"By . Peter Lewis . What is it about diamonds? They may be a girl’s best friend, but the bigger and more famous they are the more they seem to bring bad luck. This was certainly true of the Queen’s Necklace, probably the biggest diamond necklace ever made. The scandal it caused helped to bring down Marie Antoinette as Queen of France — though she never, in fact, possessed it. The extraordinary story of the necklace has been the inspiration for a novel by Alexandre Dumas, a play by Goethe and an essay by Thomas Carlyle, but historians edge round it nervously because the truth is so hard to establish. Contemporary accounts are unreliable and full of lies. Downfall: Soon after the Diamond Necklace trial Marie Antoinette was executed . Jonathan Beckman has tunnelled into the warren of misinformation like a badger digger and has come out with what must be as near the truth as we’ll get. At the beginning of the book he lists the characters most involved. Let us concentrate on four. First, the necklace itself: 647 stones weighing 2,800 carats. This monstrous lump of vulgarity was designed by Louis XV’s court jeweller for the king’s mistress, Madame du Barry. Unfortunately, the old monarch died before it was finished and the jeweller was confronted  with the new young queen Marie  Antoinette, who told him decisively that she didn’t want it. Marie Antoinette’s character has been dissected endlessly and usually to her shame. She was accused of every kind of sexual misdemeanour. It’s hard to reconcile the rumours of orgies at Versailles with her actual habit of dressing up as a milkmaid on her miniature farm in the grounds. People believed the worst of her, partly because her husband, Louis XVI, was known to be completely sexually incapable until, after seven years, doctors cured him. Even then he showed little enthusiasm for his marital duties: he entered, stayed for two minutes, then withdrew, without leaving a calling card. For all its absurd formality Versailles was a hot-bed of sexual liaison — marooned in empty country like a forerunner of Las Vegas, it was a combination of gambling den and knocking shop. Its main occupation was gossip and, of course, much of that was about the supposed adventures of the Queen. The Hope Diamond was supposedly cursed after being stolen form a statue in India. The first vicitm was diamond dealer Jean Baptiste Tavernier, who was apparently torn to pieces by wild dogs . The Koh-i-Nor Diamond is said to bring bad luck only to its male owners, but good luck to women . One of the gossipers was Cardinal Louis Rohan. He was popular, pleasant and witty and had success with women — but not with Marie Antoinette, who hated him partly because she learned he had spread a rumour that she was having an affair with her brother-in-law. To Rohan’s dismay, she either ignored or avoided him. He believed that her opposition was preventing the king from offering him a senior government post. Enter a female firebrand, who set this situation alight: Jeanne de la Motte-Valois. With her complacent husband, she had clawed a place on the fringe of the court. They could barely afford their lodging at Versailles, but she was determined to insinuate her way into the inner circle. Though she was not a beauty, Jeanne had immediate appeal to men. She was quick-witted, amoral, unscrupulous and very determined. To attract the Queen’s attention she staged a fainting fit in a corridor when Marie Antoinette was approaching. She soon persuaded people the Queen had later sent for her and she had become a royal confidante (they were the same age — 29). Dark history: A replica of the Queen's Necklace . And there were letters signed by the Queen to prove it. Jeanne had secured the services of a forger. Her next conquest was of Cardinal Rohan, who took pity on her poverty. He took her interests to heart and possibly to bed as well. She promised to speak to the Queen on his behalf and ask forgiveness for him. But he wanted more, a meeting. So Jeanne obliged. She recruited a young Versailles prostitute who resembled the Queen in face and figure. The heavily veiled girl was given a rose to hand to Rohan and rehearsed a speech, which he believed conveyed that his future would soon be assured. Rohan was then told that the Queen was short of funds and would be grateful if he could oversee the purchase of the Queen’s Necklace from the court jeweller. Between them the sale was agreed. Price: 1.6 million francs (worth £30 million today). First instalment to be paid six months later. Rohan gave the necklace to a man he believed was a servant of the Queen. He was, in fact, an accomplice of Jeanne. She swiftly had the necklace broken up and the stones were sent to London to be sold. She and her husband were in funds and lived very well. But it couldn’t last. When no instalments were paid, a desperate court jeweller sought an interview with the Queen.  She was furious to hear Rohan had pretended he was acting on her behalf. Marie Antoinette insisted that she wanted a public trial. She was to regret that later. Months of evidence — lying, contradictory, unbelievable — came tumbling out, transfixing the citizens of France and all Europe. The wold's largest diamond - the Cullinan I - weighed 530.2 carats . Though she played no part in the actual story, many believed she did behind the scenes. It all blackened her reputation further. Rohan was acquitted by a majority verdict. Jeanne was sentenced to be flogged and branded on both shoulders. Marie Antoinette was executed by guillotine soon after. Napoleon said: ‘The Queen’s death must  be dated from the Diamond Necklace trial.’","The Queen's Necklace is the biggest diamond necklace ever made .

"By . Pa Reporter . Oriol Riera's first goal in English football gave Wigan Athletic their first Sky Bet Championship victory of the season, beating rock-bottom Blackpool 1-0 at the DW Stadium. The scoreline was hugely flattering to the Seasiders, who were on the back foot for virtually the whole game and offered very little going forward. But Wigan could not take advantage of a number of carefully-crafted chances - and another inspired display from Callum McManaman - and were rather hanging on at the death. Match-winner: Oriol Riera's first goal for Wigan was enough to give them all three points against Blackpool . The winning goal was a worthy one, Riera taking his time before finding the bottom corner with his left foot. Wigan: Carson, Taylor, Ramis, Riera (Fortune 71) Huws (Tavernier 78), McManaman (Waghorn 70), McArthur, Boyce, Cowie, Perch, Kiernan. Subs Not Used: Caldwell,Espinoza,Barnett,Al Habsi. Booked: McArthur,Huws. Blackpool: Lewis, McMahon, Clarke, Rentmeister (Miller 45), Daniels, J Oriol, Perkins, Lundstram, Zenjov (Ranger 66), Zoko (Cywka), Delfouneso. Subs Not Used: Oriol,MacKenzie,Dielna,Parish. Booked: Perkins,Clarke,Zenjov. Goals: Riera 35 . Referee: Carl Boyeson . Att: 12,113 . But Wigan were nearly punished for their profligacy in the second half when Blackpool substitute Nile Ranger fluffed his lines with the goal gaping. Blackpool were nearly ahead inside two minutes, when a dangerous free-kick came in from the right and Donervon Daniels headed wide from close range. Wigan were quickly into their stride, though, and feeding McManaman as much as possible down the right. David Perkins picked up an early yellow card for hauling down the young forward, and Wigan nearly took the lead moments later. James Perch's cross from the right found Riera, who headed over from a good position. An Emyr Huws cross then found skipper Emmerson Boyce, who volleyed over from 10 yards. The home side squandered a gilt-edged opportunity on the 20-minute mark when Riera did extremely well down the right and crossed into the corridor of uncertainty. Wigan would not have wanted the chance to fall to anyway but the in-form McManaman, but this time he sliced his effort from eight yards well wide of the mark. McManaman was lucky to escape in one piece when Peter Clarke went flying in on him on the near touchline and was perhaps fortunate to be given only a yellow card. But Wigan were not to be denied and they took the lead 11 minutes before the break. Another cross from the right caused all the damage, and Andrew Taylor teed up Riera who found the bottom corner with his left foot. Riera was almost in again moments later but, after some clever footwork, his shot was blocked. Wigan came close to doubling their advantage just before half-time, and again McManaman was heavily involved. Euphoria: Riera wheels away in delight after putting his side 1-0 up against Blackpool at the DW Stadium . Perch's cross from the right looked inch-perfect for McManaman to tap in, only for Daniels to somehow get in between his opponent and the goal to clear off the line. There was still time for McManaman to fire inches past the far post, before Wigan were given a huge warning on the stroke of half-time when John Lundstram had a shot that was deflected just past the post. The second half started in much the same vein, with McManaman causing all sorts of trouble down the right and Blackpool desperately trying to get to grips with him. He beat three men on one run before firing straight at the goalkeeper - before Blackpool almost levelled completely against the run of play. The cross from the left was inviting but substitute Ranger poked over from inside the six-yard box. After being totally dominant for the entire game, Wigan then dropped further and further back to protect what they had, which saw the visitors encouraged to think there might still be something in it for them. But Blackpool could not find the quality necessary to take advantage of Wigan nerves and remain pointless in the table.","Summer recruit Riera scored the only goal of the game at the DW Stadium .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan For The Daily Mail . Danny Lennon has thrown his hat into the ring for the Ross County job after Derek Adams became the first managerial casualty of the new season on Thursday. The former St Mirren boss was immediately installed as 3/1 favourite for the vacancy in Dingwall following the shock sacking of Adams and his father George, County’s director of football. And Lennon, who won the League Cup with the Buddies in 2013 but was replaced as manager by assistant Tommy Craig in May, expressed his interest  by describing the Victoria Park outfit as ‘a model club.’ 'Model club': Former St Mirren boss  Danny Lennon is favourite to take over at Ross County . Slump: Ross County have lost four consecutive league games this season . Former Inverness boss Terry Butcher will also be a strong tip, but Lennon said: ‘It is an attractive proposition and it certainly interests me. I spent time at Ross County towards the tail end of my (playing) career and it is a lovely place with lovely people. ‘The northerly location might put some off, others might be put off by the success Derek Adams had and think he’s taken Ross County as far as they can go. ‘Personally, I think a great foundation has been laid for someone to go and pick that up and take over. They have a great stadium, great facilities and, in many ways, they are a model club. Despite four straight defeats in the Premiership, Adams launched a spirited defence of his Ross County record after being told on Wednesday night that he was being dismissed. Chairman Roy MacGregor said terminating the Adams’ contracts was the most difficult decision he had made in football, but hinted that a breakdown in relations was a key factor. Coach Steve Ferguson and captain Richie Brittain will take charge for tomorrow’s game with Hamilton. A bitterly disappointed Adams released a statement citing his pride in taking County up through the divisions to the Premiership and to a Scottish Cup final on a budget substantially lower than top-tier rivals. Defiant: Derek Adams defended his record in a statement following his release . ‘I have always believed the test of a manager is in consistently outperforming his resources and I believe I achieved that with Ross County,’ it read. ‘I have watched with immense pride as Ross County has grown from the Scottish Second Division through two promotions to the Scottish Premiership, where we are now in our third season. ‘The fact we achieved this progress while setting an unbeaten record in Scottish league football for the modern era of 40 matches and reaching a Scottish Cup final along the way gives my coaching team and myself great satisfaction. ‘Considering that Ross County has had I believe one of the lowest, if not the lowest, wage bills in the league in the last couple of seasons, I believe this shows our David has notched victories against the Goliaths of Scottish football more often than we might have reasonably expected. ‘This is most clearly demonstrated by our victories against Celtic, especially in the Scottish Cup semi final when at that time we were a First Division side. ‘As part of the financial realities of working at Ross County, I have become accustomed to working in a challenging environment. ‘For the last few seasons while working with a low wage budget, we have had to build almost entirely new teams to start each season without ever spending a transfer fee - a massive challenge that we have been able to meet by retaining our Premiership status. Family affair: Derek Adams father George was also sacked as director of football . ‘While this has been extremely challenging, I believe it makes the journey we have taken even more remarkable and I am very proud to have been a part of it.’ Chairman MacGregor surprised journalists with an unscheduled appearance at a routine press conference due to be attended by Adams yesterday, before admitting ‘chemistry’ had been a factor in the dismissals. Declining to expand on his reasons, the club owner paid tribute to both Derek and George Adams, but admitted he is likely to scrap the director of football role. ‘We have nothing in mind,’ said the County chairman.’We have to sit down and look at it. There is no deadline. ‘Will it be a director of football and manager again? I doubt that will happen. It will be a different relationship. By and large it worked for us, but it is very unusual nowadays in Scottish football.’ It’s not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There’s £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .

As these drawing show, MIT’s arms stop short of being a full exoskeleton, which can give humans super-human strength, but could probably be used in the near future and be cheaper than full body suits . MIT's arms are different to others developed, such as the University of Pennsylvania’s Titan arm, as they can move independently of a human’s. The Titan arm could help its wearer carry an additional 40lbs (18 kg) that is around the weight of a four-year-old child and make it feel easy as lifting a cup of tea. But it cannot deviate from a human’s own arm to anticipate their actions. MIT’s arms stop short of being a full exoskeleton, which can give humans super-human strength, but they could probably be used in the nearer future and be cheaper than full body suits. So many possibilities: The MIT arms could also be used to help people climb tall structures . The systems developed at MIT and Daewoo are a cross between those used by Spider Man villain Otto Octavius, or Dr Octopus (pictured left) and Inspector Gadget (pictured right) At the moment, MIT's prototype arms could be used to open a door, leaving a human wearer's hands free to carry shopping bags, for example. But in the future they could open the door for the struggling wearer in advance (illustrated) 'The extra limbs will help them hold objects, support the human body, share a workload and streamline the execution of a task,' the MIT engineers said. 'If the movements of such supernumerary limbs are tightly coupled and coordinated with their arms, the human users may come to perceive the extra limbs as an extension of their own body. 'The overarching goal of this project is to study a new type of co-robots that is perceived to be an extension of the human body, working closely with the wearer.'","The shoulder-mounted system was created at MIT's d'Arbeloff Laboratory .
It was designed as an extension of the wearer's own limbs and can also be worn on the hips .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Robots with an ability to see through walls akin to ‘X-ray vision’ have been developed by researchers. By transmitting a Wi-Fi signal between them, two robots were able to see what was beyond walls by measuring the change in the signal’s intensity. The technique could be used to find people trapped in buildings or monitor elderly people at home. Scroll down for video . Researchers at University of California create robots with 'X-ray vision' (illustration shown). The two robots detect changes in signal strength to see through walls . The system was developed by scientists at the University of California led by Dr Yasamin Mostofi. Two robots on wheels were designed, one that emits a wireless transmission while the other that detects it. - Search and rescue, and surveillance. - Occupancy detection in a home. - Classification of what an object is made of behind a wall. - Archaeological digs without needing to dig underground. - Real world robotic networks to perform tasks such as object mapping for humans. - Detecting home intruders before they enter your house. When the robots passed around a square concrete structure, out of sight of one another, they were able to work out what was inside - and could even identify a human. This was done by measuring the drop in signal strength as the transmission passed through the walls and other objects. By measuring this drop the robots could create a visual map of what they thought they were seeing in about 100 seconds. And the researchers say the results were satisfyingly accurate, with errors of no more than two inches (5cm). One robot transmits a Wi-Fi signal and the other receives it. Doing this the robots can work out what objects are between them. Here the left figure shows the area of interest that is completely unknown, while on the right is shown the map the robots made using the technique compared to the actual map . The technique can even be used to discern different types of objects beyond walls including multiple objects (shown), or also to find people beyond walls. This could be used to find people in collapsed buildings or spot intruders before they enter your home . ‘Our approach enables seeing a completely-unknown area (with details) through thick walls by using only Wi-Fi signals,’ the team writes on their website. ‘This technology can be implemented on any Wi-Fi-enabled gadget. ‘We have furthermore shown how to use this in a robotic setting to give see-through vision to robots.’ While some modern unmanned robots use laser scanners to see what is in front of them, they are unable to see through objects or walls in the vicinity. The researchers say that their new technique could be a revolution in robotic movements and enable a host of new capabilities for unmanned robots. They envisage that the technology could have a host of uses, including search and rescue operations after an earthquake. They could also examine archaeological sites without needing to dig.","Researchers at University of California create robots with 'X-ray vision'

But Google may be trying to establish itself even further in the market, and steal an edge on its rival, following the purchase of Emu. Emu is similar to Google Now because it predicts what users want to do next, and offers relevant help - but it goes one step further. The firm claims the Emu app uses artificial intelligence to learn behaviours and fine tune suggestions in real time. Scroll down for video . Emu (pictured) is similar to Google Now because it predicts what users want to do next, and offers relevant help, but it goes one step further. The firm claims the Emu app uses artificial intelligence to learn behaviours and fine tune suggestions in real time, using contextual information. For example, Google Now alerts people to an upcoming flight, and informs them of traffic or public transport conditions before they leave. It can also remind people to take an umbrella, if it looks like it’s going to rain. The software in prediction apps is based on an algorithm that combines various snippets of information to form a prediction. In the case of personal-assistant apps, the software scans calendar entries to work out . where a user is, or should be. It combines this with location data, . taken from the device's GPS unit, as well as posts on social . networks, email information and more. It will then present the user with the help it thinks they need. For example, if a calendar on an Android phone contains a diary invite, Google Now will create a reminder. It will then check to see whether the . user is en route to the meeting and add directions to this reminder, or . work out how long it will take them to get there based on current . traffic. Emu is slightly more advanced because it additionally scans and monitors conversations, in real time, to offer these suggestions automatically, and with context. If a friend asks a user where they are, Emu can send the location on a map, or if a friend asks to meet up on a particular day, Emu will check the user’s calendar to see if they’re free automatically. Location details can even be updated, live, for 30 minutes. Emu additionally scans and monitors conversations, in real time, to offer these suggestions automatically, and with context.

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Brendan Rodgers insists it is a formality that Steven Gerrard will get a new Liverpool contract as he looks to play into his late thirties. Gerrard brought an end to his 114-cap England career on Monday, saying the time was right for him to step aside in order to maximise his chances of being a dominant influence in Liverpool’s midfield for the next ‘three or four’ years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard playing baseball in New York . Commitment: Brendan Rodgers believes Steven Gerrard can play 'well into his thirties' for Liverpool . He last renewed terms with his only professional club last July, before Liverpool embarked on their tour of South East Asia and Australia. That contract now has 11 months to run, but the club have been working on a deal through the summer. Rodgers was a key figure in discussions with Gerrard when he was deciding what to do about England and Liverpool’s manager is looking forward to the opportunity of  continuing working with a player who he has regularly said has ‘given him everything and more’ since he’s been at Anfield. ‘A lot has gone on over the summer,’ said Rodgers. ‘I am very happy that Steven is now going to commit  to Liverpool and I am sure that (his contract) is something we will look at. I know he can continue to play beyond this season. Focus: Gerrard's decision to step down from England can help prolong his Liverpool career . VIDEO Liverpool everything to Gerrard - Rodgers . ‘I have always said that. Now he doesn’t have international football, he will have that freshness. Listen, for his own mind, I’m sure he will want it sorted out, absolutely. You never want to leave players with not too long to go on their contract. It is something I am sure will get sorted.’ Though Gerrard turned 34 in May, his importance to Liverpool cannot be understated and last season he recorded the most assists in the Barclays Premier League (14) and scored 13 goals of his own. If the World Cup did not go according to plan for him, there is no sign that it has left his mark and Gerrard has looked sharp as Rodgers has put Liverpool’s squad through their paces on the training fields at  Harvard University this week. The intention is to give Gerrard his first action of pre-season on Sunday in Chicago, where Liverpool face Olympiacos, and Rodgers is expecting his players to take another step forward after they lost 1-0 to Roma at Fenway Park in the early hours of  morning. Target: Gerrard could make his first action of pre-season against Olympiacos on Sunday . ‘There was lots of encouragement from the game,’ said Rodgers. ‘We are going to be in the Champions League, which is why we have taken games like Roma and Borussia  Dortmund (in August).’ One issue arising from the match with Roma was the shoulder injury to Fabio Borini. The striker, who could make a £14million move to Sunderland, will miss the rest of the tour but it is not thought the injury would prevent the transfer going ahead. Aside from launching Gerrard back into action, Rodgers will also use the workout in Chicago to give Lazar Markovic — a £20m signing from Benfica — his first appearance. Rui Costa, the legendary Portugal midfielder who is now Benfica’s sporting director, told Sportsmail: ‘Markovic is a huge talent and has the speed and skills can make a difference in the Premier League. He’s not a physical player, but he has the ability and the flexibility to escape defenders easily. Challenge: Brendan Rodgers hopes Lazar Markovic can fill the void left by £75m sale of Luis Suarez . ‘Apart from that, he’s a really focused player. He loves football and enjoys playing and watching the game. ‘Markovic is also very cold blooded when he’s in a one-to-one (situation) and he’s not afraid on facing the opponents. He’s always eager to learning, so I think he will adapt himself very quickly.’ Markovic is one of a number of players who have been signed to help Liverpool progress and show there can be life after Luis Suarez. Liverpool handled his £75million departure to Barcelona, quickly, quietly and efficiently and the club’s principal owner John W Henry felt the moment was right to sell him. ‘It was time for Luis — and time for the club — to make a break,’ said Henry, who along with chairman Tom Werner has sanctioned Liverpool’s heavy summer spending. ‘He brought so much to the club but we brought a lot to Luis.’ And as a message to any fans who might be fearful, Henry promised: ‘I think (next season) you will see a very explosive Liverpool offense.’","Liverpool midfielder can be a dominant force for next '3 or 4 years'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Scientists were baffled by the mysterious craters that appeared in northern Russia earlier this month. Researchers now believe these craters may have been created by a build-up of methane over centuries that then erupting out of the thawing ground. But strange, unexplained holes are just the beginning of what could be a series of mysterious happenings on the planet – all caused by melting Arctic ice, scientists believe. Scroll down for video . Pictured are 'drunken forests' in Fairbanks, Alaska. This phenomenon is caused by the permafrost melting beneath the trees causing solid soil to turn to mud; the result is that they lean to one side . Permafrost is leading to ‘drunken . trees’ as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants . that grow in them to lean to one side. Some trees survive their soil eroding and continue to grow. Others collapse or drown as the subterranean ice melts. As they are staggered across the landscape, people often refer to them as 'drunken trees.' According to a report by David Biello in Scientific American, temperatures across the Arctic are warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the globe. ‘At some point, we might get into a state of permafrost that is not comparable to what we know for 100 years or so, some new processes that never happened before,’ geologist Guido Grosse of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research told Mr Biello. A similar process is taking place in the melting regions of the Arctic where lakes, known as thermokarsts, which are lakes that break down plant material into methane. This methane can then escape out of the lake or the ground, and once lit, could set ice on fire. Permafrost is also leading to ‘drunken trees’ as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants that grow in them to lean to one side. An ecologist ignites a large methane bubble that was trapped by the autumn freeze. One of the largest concerns about thawing permafrost is the sudden release of methane from the Arctic . Scientists were baffled by the mysterious craters that appeared in northern Russia earlier this month. Researchers now believe they were created by a build-up of methane over centuries . Some trees survive their soil eroding and continue to grow. Others collapse or drown as the subterranean ice melts. Nasa claims that arctic permafrost soils have accumulated vast stores of organic carbon - an estimated 1,400 to 1,850 billion tonnes of it. That's about half of all the estimated organic carbon stored in Earth's soils. In comparison, about 350 billion tonnes of carbon have been emitted from all fossil-fuel combustion and human activities. Most of the Arctic’s sequestered carbon is located in thaw-vulnerable topsoils within 3 meters of the surface. 'Permafrost soils are warming even faster than Arctic air temperatures - as much as 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius in just the past 30 years,' said Nasa's Charles Miller. 'As heat from Earth's surface penetrates into permafrost, it threatens to mobilise these organic carbon reservoirs and release them into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and methane, upsetting the Arctic's carbon balance and greatly exacerbating global warming.' But separate research earlier this week suggested that some Arctic lakes store more greenhouse gases than they emit into the atmosphere. This counters a widely-held scientific view that thawing permafrost accelerates atmospheric warming. The study shows that permafrost rich in organic material will see the growth of mosses and other plants flourish, leading to greater amounts of carbon absorption. Supported by the National Science Foundation, the study was published this week in the journal Nature and focused on thermokarst lakes. A study says ice-rich lakes in Alaska and Siberia are cooling the atmosphere. The research challenges the widely-held view that thawing lakes cause warming. Found in the Arctic and cold mountain regions, thermokarst lakes (shown) occur when permafrost thaws and creates surface depressions that fill with water .","Temperatures in the Arctic are warming twice as fast as rest of the globe .

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association Sport . Hatem Ben Arfa is ready to dig in his heels and reject any move away from Newcastle in the current transfer window. Press Association Sport understands the France playmaker, forced to train with Newcastle's reserves by manager Alan Pardew, is determined to fight for his St James' Park future. Newcastle bosses claimed Ben Arfa returned for the start of pre-season overweight, but the French midfielder looked sharp as he scored in a 5-2 reserve-team victory over Reading on Monday. Skillful: Hatem Ben Arfa is one of the most gifted players in the Premier League . Staying put: Despite a lot of uncertainty about his future Ben Arfa looks set to remain at Newcastle for now . Ben Arfa's contract expires next summer and Newcastle are keen to offload the 27-year-old, with Pardew deeming him surplus to requirements. The 13-cap France star is understood to favour battling to win back his first-team spot at Newcastle over any transfer. Ben Arfa has previously been a target for Newcastle's Premier League rivals Tottenham and Liverpool, but interest has waned in this transfer window. Lyon are thought to have expressed their interest to Newcastle, but Ben Arfa is not keen on leaving the Premier League or returning to his first senior club. Ben Arfa joined Newcastle in 2010 and established himself as one of the most creative forces at St James' Park, but his relationship with current boss Pardew remains strained at best. Ben Arfa has been frustrated with Newcastle's intimations he has been unfit and overweight, confident he proved his fitness against Reading on Monday. Newcastle laboured to a 1-0 victory over Sky Bet League One side Gillingham in the Capital One Cup second round on Tuesday night. The Magpies claimed their first goal of the new season, but even that was an own goal from Gillingham's John Egan. The former Sunderland defender put through his own net to hand Pardew's men their first win of the new campaign, but still none of Newcastle's players are off the mark. Newcastle lost 2-0 at home to champions Manchester City on the season's opening day before grinding out a 0-0 stalemate at Aston Villa last weekend. New strike duo Siem de Jong and Emmanuel Riviere failed to click at Gillingham, while Yoann Gouffran could not find the net at Villa Park. The Magpies craved the kind of defence-unlocking creativity that is Ben Arfa's speciality in Kent and have lacked spark so far this term. Celebrations: Ben Arfa runs away in delight after scoring for Newcastle against Aston Villa . Reach the top: Ben Arfa is capable of mixing it with the very best in the world if he puts his mind to it . Boss Pardew admitted his side must find their attacking feet and fast to jump-start their league campaign, but it looks as though that will still unfold without Ben Arfa's assistance. Pardew revealed he could turn to teenager Rolando Aarons for Saturday's home clash with Crystal Palace after the 18-year-old impressed at Gillingham. 'He typifies what Newcastle crowd want to see, taking people on and making things happen,' said Pardew of the Jamaica-born wing. 'There's a good chance he could play on Saturday the way he played.' Newcastle signed Aarons from Bristol City in 2012, with Pardew revealing the flighty winger has edged ahead of home-grown youngster Adam Armstrong during the summer. 'He came into our academy quite late and he started showing a few signs at the back-end of last year,' said Pardew on Aarons. 'Probably he was behind Armstrong at that stage, though he's just edged above him this pre-season. 'We've got two offensive players coming through the academy and if they can crack it in the first team that would be very lucky for us. 'Because it's very difficult to get offensive players through your academy.'","The Newcastle midfielder is now set to stay put at St James Park .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . David Cameron faced a barrage of criticism last week after going ahead with a surfing holiday as Iraq descended into turmoil. But it seems the Islamic State's murderous rampage across the Middle East is still not enough to tempt him back to Number 10. For just four days later, he's back on the board despite MPs' calls for an emergency recall as the news is dominated by fears of radicalised Britons. Scroll down for video . Riding out the crisis? David Cameron was seen on the beach again as the Islamic State continues its rampage . It comes as task forces across the world race to track down the brutal murderers that assassinated US photojournalist James Foley and posted footage of the killing online. United Nations human rights chief Navi Pillay today called on the international community to treat as a priority the 'appalling, widespread' crimes being committed by Islamic State forces in Iraq, including killings, slavery, sexual crimes and targeting people on ethnic or religious grounds. However, the Prime Minister was seen enjoying the Bank Holiday Monday alongside hundreds of other surfers in Cornwall. Polls last week revealed more than 80 per cent of British voters do not believe that David Cameron can handle the Iraq crisis from his holiday beach. He made a flying 19-hour return visit to Downing Street following James Foley's murder  before going back to the south west. Unfazed: He has admitted there is poor phone signal at the beach but he went out surfing again anyway . Like water off a duck's back: The UN has called on the international community to act to stop the Islamic State after the murder of James Foley, but Cameron will work from the beach . Mr Cameron said: ‘Wherever I am in the world I am always within a few feet of a BlackBerry.’ But, he admitted, his phone reception in Cornwall is very poor. On Friday, an onlooker said: 'He seemed pretty relaxed and having a good time by himself. 'He didn't do any real surfing - the conditions weren't really there for it - but he had a go on the body board a couple of times. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, the former British human rights envoy to Iraq, was equally furious about Mr Cameron's decision to return to his holiday in Britain. She said: ‘I just find it extraordinary that he has gone off on holiday again after a few hours back in London – it is just not good enough.

"By . Laura Silver for MailOnline . More than 80,000 bats circled above a town in Australia, turning the sky black and frightening residents. Josh Ryder, who shot the bizarre footage, said the creatures were driving the Townsville locals batty. He said: 'They have been destroying the park and making the surrounding area hard to live in.' The bats live in the gardens but occasionally come out during daylight hours and take over the neighbourhood as they hunt for insects. Crowds gathered to watch the mammals circling overhead in search of prey. Bats usually hunt during the night so they are less vulnerable to predatory birds, but by grouping together like this, they make it harder for one of their own to be selected for dinner. Spotting bats during daylight hours is rare. They hunt in the darkness by emitting noises which echo off their surroundings so they know where they are going. These bats were lucky to be flapping around the sky at all. Around the same time this footage was taken, hundreds of thousands of Australian bats in Queensland died and fell from the sky during a heat wave that saw temperatures in the region soar as high as 50C.

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . A time-lapse video recording melting glaciers in Montana received an unexpected endorsement from one of the park's residents - when a furry marmot photobombed the camera. Greenpeace environmentalists left a GoPro camera in Glacier National Park in the US to raise awareness of global warming which is melting glaciers in the area. The video shows the curious critter scurrying towards the camera before giving it a good lick before dashing off. Grass warrior: Marmot emerges from the vegetation and scurries over to the Greenpeace camera which was set up in Glacier National Park in Montana, US, to record the effects of climate change . Activists had hoped to show how the alpine tundra - land where there is no vegetation because the ground is always frozen - is shrinking as more and more trees grow higher up the mountain. But instead, the marmot, who lives in the tundra, took actions into his own hands in a bid to protect his home. A Greenpeace spokesperson said: 'Though we didn’t capture the time-lapse video of Glacier National Park that we intended to, we captured something much cooler ... Marmot Love. 'This Marmot would like to give you a kiss for helping to save its home.' The video is part of the Greenpeace campaign 'Keep our coal in the ground' which brings attention to the fact that the agency charged to protect national parks  - the Department of the Interior - is auctioning off land for coal mining. Greenpeace has also launched a thermal airship at Glacier National Park to highlight with large banners reading 'Coal exports fuel climate change.' It flew over Decker Coal Mine in Montana where work is expanding at a rapid rate, prompting another two environmental groups to file a lawsuit in a bid to halt plans. Northern Plains Resource Council and the Western Organization of Resource Councils hope to block more mining. Greenpeace is calling on the government to consider the environment as they back the coal industry's export ambitions and stop selling off land for mining. 'Climate change is a major threat to national parks like Glacier, and more coal will only make it worse whether it is burned in Montana or Beijing,' said Greenpeace energy campaign director Kelly Mitchell. 'If interior secretary Sally Jewell is serious about protecting our national parks from the impacts of climate change, she should establish a moratorium on new coal leases and pursue comprehensive reform of the federal coal leasing program.'","Time-lapse camera had been set up to record affects of global warming .

"By . Liz Hull . First came glamping, the middle class approach to spending a night under canvas without all the wind and rain. But if that all seems a bit passé - and you’re not easily spooked – then you might want to try the next big holiday trend of church camping or ‘champing.’ Sleeping overnight inside a disused church is the latest initiative by The Churches Conservation Trust (CCT), the charity which looks after more than 300 redundant churches nationwide. Rugs are laid out on flagstones in the nave and visitors sleep on inflatable mattresses with blankets. Folding chairs, tables, a tea-making kit and portable lavatory and water basin add to the comfort . It hopes that trippers, keen for a quirky and educational holiday experience, will flock to stay in one of their historical Grade I or II listed buildings, and help generate cash for their upkeep in the process. The charity are currently trialling group camping trips at All Saints Church, in Aldwincle, Northamptonshire. Some might think that the medieval Domesday-listed church, with its Gothic windows, handsome limestone pillars and arches and creepy gargoyles, would not be conducive to a good night’s sleep. But, although some visitors have admitted to feeling anxious, most have reported a very peaceful and satisfying stay, said Laoise Bailey, a spokesman for the CCT. ‘Some people have been a bit nervous because they thought it may be a bit creepy, but afterwards they’ve said they found it very calm and relaxing,’ she said. ‘The feedback we’ve had is they’ve enjoyed getting back to nature and the peace and quiet.’ Rugs are laid out on flagstones in the nave and visitors sleep on inflatable mattresses with blankets. Folding chairs, tables, a tea-making kit and portable lavatory and water basin, installed in the vestry, add to the comfort. Guests are treated to a home-cooked meal at a local farmhouse bed and breakfast, before returning to the church where candles are lit at nightfall and a local historian arrives to regale them with magical stories about local myths and legends. Guests are treated to a home-cooked meal at a local farmhouse B&B, before returning to the church where candles are lit and a local historian regales them with magical stories about local myths and legends . Bacon and egg baps are brought in by the same B&B for breakfast. The scheme is being run in conjunction with the Wildlife Trust, who offer sessions on bat spotting in the surrounding graveyard, and Canoe2, a local adventure firm which organises self-guided paddle trips along the nearby River Nene as part of the deal. Packages start from £99 per person, including the activities. The CCT say they are already in talks to set up a similar scheme at a church in Kent, and hope to bring on board other activities, such as hiking, cycling and star gazing, as well as rolling champing out to other venues across the country. You can sleep in All Saints Parish Church, Aldwincle village, Northamptonshire . ‘It is certainly one of the more innovative things we are doing and we are looking to make a profit,’ Miss Bailey said. ‘But any money we make all goes back into conserving the churches we look after.’ Village resident Bernard Lowe, who sits on the parish council, said local people in Aldwincle had been supportive of the ‘champing’ trips. ‘There’s not been any objections,’ he added. ‘The church was decommissioned 70 years ago and has been redundant a long while. It’s been used for the odd musical event, but there’s no pews or facilities, such as electricity or drainage, so it’s a big, quite spectacular cavernous floor space inside. ‘We’re right in the middle of the Nene valley and the River is less than half a mile away, so it’s perfect for the canoeing.’","First nights will be at at All Saints' Church, in Aldwincle, Northamptonshire .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A captain lost control of a passenger plane after his artificial arm became detached as he was coming in to land, an accident report has said. The detachment, on a Flybe flight from Birmingham, came as the Dash 8 aircraft, with 47 passengers on board, was approaching Belfast City Airport in gusty conditions. Shortly before, the 46-year-old pilot had checked that his prosthetic lower left arm was securely attached to the yoke clamp which he used to fly the aircraft, with the latching device in place. Scroll down for video . File picture of a Flybe Dash 8 at Birmingham International Airport. A captain lost control of a passenger plane after his artificial arm became detached as he was coming in to land, an accident report has said . The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said the captain had disconnected the autopilot and was flying the aircraft manually. It said that as he made the flare manoeuvre - a stage of the landing shortly before touchdown - 'his prosthetic limb became detached from the yoke clamp, depriving him of control of the aircraft'. The captain considered getting the co-pilot to take control but concluded that, given the time available and the challenging conditions, his best course of action was to move his right hand from the power levers on to the yoke to regain control. The report went on: 'He did this, but with power still applied and possibly a gust affecting the aircraft, a normal touchdown was followed by a bounce, from which the aircraft landed heavily.' No-one was hurt and the plane was not damaged in the incident on the evening of February 12 this year. The AAIB reported that the captain had said that in future he would be more cautious about checking the attachment on his prosthesis as he may have dislodged the latching mechanism. Video courtesy of ITV Good Morning Britain . Inside: The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said the captain had disconnected the autopilot and was flying the aircraft manually . The incident happened as the flight was approaching Belfast City Airport in gusty conditions . Also, he said he would brief his co-pilots about the possibility of a similar event and that they should be ready to take control at any time. Captain Ian Baston, Flybe director of flight operations and safety, said the company was proud to be an equal opportunities employer. 'This, in common with most airlines, means we do employ staff with reduced physical abilities. Where appropriate, and in accordance with Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requirements, this does include pilots. 'The senior captain referred to in this report is one of Flybe's most experienced and trusted pilots. The airline confirms that at no time was the safety of its passengers or crew compromised in any way, nor was the aircraft damaged. 'Following the incident, Flybe immediately undertook a detailed internal investigation from which it determined a series of additional fail-safe safety checks. These were rigorously tested and instigated immediately to ensure that this type of incident could not happen again. 'The safety of our passengers and crew is our number one priority. This means that Flybe not only adheres to the CAA's strict requirements relating to the employment of staff with a reduced physical ability, but exceeds them to ensure that safety is never compromised. 'Flybe understands that the AAIB is to review this report to more clearly contextualise certain issues referred to in its findings.'","Flybe flight from Birmingham had 47 passengers on board .

"By . Peter Campbell . Massive rises in food prices  will hammer family budgets this year, the boss of one of Britain’s biggest supermarkets warned yesterday. Waitrose managing director Mark Price said recent increases in the price of bread and vegetables were ‘just the tip of the iceberg’, with prices set to rise across the board. ‘Everything will be hit,’ he added. Gloom: Waitrose boss Mark Price warned that food prices are likely to rise even further in the coming years . And with farmers facing poor harvests after the second wettest year on record, Britain’s impending food crisis looks set to last ‘for the foreseeable future’. Another punishing rise in the cost of the weekly shop – which is already increasing faster than wages – will hit families struggling to make ends meet. Living standards are already under their greatest squeeze in a generation, compounded before Christmas when energy providers announced inflation-busting price increases. Now food prices are likely to carry on rising after crops were hampered by appalling weather. Mr Price said: ‘We’re seeing input food inflation of around 3 to 3.5 per cent, but we expect it go up to as much as five. ‘But you can’t ever say how high these increases will end up being. The one safe thing to say is that demand will out-strip supply. It is likely that food inflation will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. In some commodities, the increases will be massive. It’s bread, vegetables, all produce. ‘The apple crop was down 20 to 30 per cent so apple prices have to go up. You have only seen the tip of the iceberg. It is impossible to say how long it will last.’ A car is towed from flood water in Milby, north Yorkshire, in December . The pain from last year’s poor crops will be felt for the next two years, he added. While crops such as apples and vegetables will be felt immediately, meat prices take longer to be affected. The rising costs of animal feed will still be felt in two years, because cows take 22 months to rear. Food inflation is currently at around 3 per cent but could rise to as high as 6 per cent . Food price inflation was 4.6 per cent in November, according to the British Retail Consortium. December’s figure, to be published next week, is expected to be the same. An increase of the level predicted by Mr Price could push this figure up to more than 6 per cent. Experts have already warned that last year’s catastrophic US drought would force punishing food price rises onto families. Over the summer more than 35 states declared disaster areas because of the extreme conditions, which left crops decimated and vast swathes of land uninhabitable. In the UK, sodden conditions and poor sunlight left farmers facing delayed harvests. Farmers have already warned that heavy rain in recent months means many have not yet planted crops for this year. Even own-label budget items in supermarkets are rising sharply, after it was revealed last month that grocers were hiking prices on their branded goods. Supermarkets slapped a mark-up of up to a fifth on more than 40 per cent of budget items, research from online comparison site Moneysupermarket showed. The move hits shoppers who try to save money by downgrading to cheaper ranges. Consumer groups last night called on supermarkets to simplify price structures to help families choose the best deal. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Household budgets are under enormous strain and our research has shown rising food prices are a top concern. ‘More people are shopping at discount supermarkets and one in four say they are planning to cut food spending in the next few months. ‘We want retailers to make food pricing much less confusing so real bargains can be spotted at a glance, and to offer responsible price promotions that give consumers the best possible value for money.’ Painful reading: This graph shows how the rate . of food inflation outstrips that of the shop price index (SPI) and . non-food items . The apple crop was down 20 to 30 per cent this year so the price is expected to go up . The latest figures show average wages are just 1.8 per cent higher than a year ago – well below inflation of 2.7 per cent. Inflation has been above the Bank of England’s 2 per cent target for three years and continues to outstrip pay rises for the majority of workers while at the same time eroding the nest-eggs of savers reeling from record low interest rates. It was hoped that 2013 would finally see pay rise faster than prices – with average earnings going up 3.1 per cent and inflation falling to 1.9 per cent. But in the autumn statement last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected inflation of 2.5 per cent this year compared with wage growth of just 2.2 per cent.","Recent increases 'just the tip of the iceberg,' managing director Mark Price .

"By . Chris Kitching . Call them the ‘adven-sioners’ – today’s retirees are making ambitious plans to go abroad and fulfil their travel dreams as they enter their golden years. Luxury getaways, classic road trips and thrilling activities in exotic locations are near the top of their itineraries, according to a survey that asked 1,000 retirees to reveal the ‘ultimate bucket list’ of locations they want to see and things they want to do. Travelling to Norway to see the Northern Lights was voted the most desired activity or destination by more than one million retirees. Here's looking at you: Retirees are taking their travel plans to new heights, survey suggests . Incredible sight: Viewing the Northern Lights in Norway is at the top of many retirees' bucket lists . A quarter of retirees say they want to reward themselves with a relaxing cruise in the sun-soaked Caribbean, while 23 per cent are keen to take a scenic train trip across Europe. Showing their adventurous side, 20 per cent say they want to view the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas strip during an exhilarating helicopter ride. Rounding out the top five is a romantic gondola ride in Venice. The survey by Fidelity Worldwide Investment suggests a new breed of adventurous pensioners – or ‘adven-sioners’ – is set to take the travel world by storm. Retirees are planning to jet to destinations around the globe and make the most of their retirement – and their savings. Indian adventure: 17% of retirees said they would like to see the Taj Mahal in India . Visiting the Pyramids in Egypt was voted number 10 on retirees' bucket lists . Two in five retirees admit they have drawn up a ‘bucket list’ of things they would like to achieve. Three quarters of those who have written up a list want to fulfil their travel dreams and capitalise on the things they didn’t do when they were raising children and moving up the ladder at work. Despite having ambitious and costly plans, most retirees are taking a realistic approach to their travel dreams. Just one in five think they will be able to tick everything off their must-do list. Wild time: 17% of retirees named an African safari among the top 10 things they want to do . Of those who think they will be able to accomplish everything, almost a quarter fear poor health could bring a halt to their plans, while almost half worry their nest egg will be too small. Maike Currie, associate investment director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: ‘People no longer see hitting age 65, traditionally the so-called ""retirement age"", in the same light as they did in the past.' He added: ‘Many people over 65 are healthy, active and independent. As the survey’s findings show, rather than slowing down and taking it easy, today’s retirees plan to live life to the full. ‘They are keen to travel the world and make the most of their golden years. In many ways ""65 is the new 50"". American adventure: A road trip along Route 66 was voted number seven on the bucket list . Research suggests the early years of retirement may be the best time to complete a bucket list because health reasons and spending are less likely to get in the way. According to the study, monthly spending is highest in the latter stages of retirement (ages 70 to 74), with a total average of £936 to £1,005 per month. In the earlier stages of retirement (ages 60 to 64), spending averages £874 a month. More than half of retirees believe their regular monthly outgoings will rise over the next five years with most putting this down to rising living costs, the study found.","Trip to see the Northern Lights in Norway tops survey of 1,000 .

"By . Beci Wood . Police in New York have been handing out fliers to tourists advising them that tipping the costumed characters who pose for photographs is entirely optional - and to call the 911 emergency number if they have any problems. City officials say they had to take action after physical attacks on some visitors, including children. The unruliness peaked last month when a Spider-Man was accused of punching a police officer for telling a woman the character could not force her to pay up. The new crackdown is in response to tourists often feel pressured to tip anything from $5 to $20 (£3 to £12) after getting a photograph. Advice: These fliers have been circulated around Times Square by the police . Bright red police leaflets in five languages are being handed out by police warning Times Square tourists that photos with costumed characters are free, and tipping is optional. Characters including Elmo from Sesame Street, Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob and the Statue of Liberty are among the workers who offer to have their photos taken with tourists in Times Square. Hours after the fliers started circulating Saturday, four fake superheroes were arrested for blocking pedestrians and grabbing one for a picture. Some of the mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants who wear the giant costumes say they have been left with far less to feed their families. 'Photos with costumed characters are free. Tipping is optional,' read the warnings in English, Spanish, Chinese, German and French. Visitors are told to find police or call the emergency dispatcher if they're being pressured for cash. Tourist trap: Characters hang around Time Square each day offering to pose for photos . Batman returns: Man poses as Caped Crusader in popular tourist spot Times Square . Standing 7ft tall and swathed in light green robes with an American flag pouring down her right arm, Lady Liberty - as played by Hugo Gomez, a 34-year-old Dominican immigrant with three children - has a prime spot in the middle of Times Square. He told a reporter that before the police-enforced measure, he drew about $150 (£90) in tips each day. In recent days, he made about $40 (£24). Gomez said he never begs. People still come to him, but the cash has shrunk. And standing on prosthetic devices for five-hour stretches is taking a toll, he said - without much payoff. Elmo: People dressed in costumes like these are regularly seen roaming the streets . 'My skin swells every day,' he said. One Elmo who's losing money is angry at police. 'All they say is, ""Go, go, go away, move, move, move!""' says Alberto Ramirez, a Peruvian native from New Jersey standing by the TKTS theater discount booth, where people in line behind barricades are an easy target. He says he pulled in $20 (£12) for eight hours, half of the $40 (£24) he made before, with five kids to feed. City officials say the warnings were needed to curtail any abuse. 'They're doing it for people's safety,' says Barati Narasim, a New York mother and software expert who offered a few dollars to a Spider-Man posing with her son and his friend. The City Council is working on a bill to require licensing, something Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, says would help legitimate operators by putting ""bad players"" out of business.

Even Gomez, aka Lady Liberty, favours licensing. 'We all know legalising our work with a license, he said, 'would make things normal, smoother.' Last month a man dressed as Spider-Man was charged with punching a police officer who intervened in a tipping dispute with a tourist. Three more men dressed as Spider-Man, Iron Man and Elmo were arrested at the weekend and charged with disorderly conduct for obstructing pedestrian traffic. The man dressed as Spider-Man faces an additional charge of aggressive solicitation while another man dressed as Iron Man was also given a court summons.","NYPD have been handing out fliers in five different languages .

If you thought it was a waste of precious time, you’re not alone. In an age where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to unplug, a third of Brits say they regret spending too much time on their mobile device while they’re on holiday, a global survey reveals. Time to unplug: 36 per cent of Brits admit they are reluctant to go on holiday without their mobile devices . Half of all Brits polled admit to checking work e-mails while away and four in 10 say having access to social media is 'very important' to them when they’re abroad. For some travellers it’s becoming even tougher to leave the smartphone at home. According to a poll conducted by Hotels.com, 36 per cent of Brits admit they are reluctant to travel without their mobile, placing the UK in a tie for 15th (with Germany) in a ranking of 28 countries. But when it comes to must-have travel items, a smartphone ranks behind a passport, sunscreen, travel insurance and sunglasses, the study found. Having the time of our lives: Just under a third of Brits admit to fibbing about their adventures while on holiday . The study analysed the digital holiday habits of almost 2,500 people from 28 countries. Of those polled in Britain, 83 per cent admit that they try to use their holiday to forget about work. The survey offers a glimpse into which nations are finding a healthy work/life balance. It turns out holidaymakers from Thailand are the last prepared to give up their mobile devices with 85 per cent of them saying they can’t travel without one. South Korea came in second place at 78 per cent, followed by Japan in third at 69 per cent. The study also looked at which countries are most likely to exaggerate their holiday experiences, with China finishing at the top of the list. Sixty-seven per cent of Chinese travellers are likely to lie to friends and family when returning home, the poll suggests. Germany finished second in that category at 64 per cent. The UK came in 13th place with just under a third of Brits (31 per cent) admitting to fibbing about their adventures, the survey found. Alison Couper, of Hotels.com, said: ‘Going away on holiday should be a time to take stock and unwind, whether you're lying on a beach in the Seychelles or snowboarding down a mountain in Canada. ‘While smartphones have their plus points while on leave from work, using them to check the weather or view maps, it seems travellers would benefit from switching off their e-mails to disconnect, restoring a little more of the all-important work/life balance.’","Half of all Brits polled admit to checking work e-mails while on holiday .

"By . Beci Wood . Large cruise ships  will finally be barred from Venice's historic centre, the Italian government has confirmed. The huge liners dubbed the 'skyscrapers of the sea' can currently can pass within 1,000ft of the iconic St. Mark's Square, granting a stunning view to those aboard but dwarfing Venice's Byzantine architecture. Now Italian ministers have reached the unanimous decision to stop liners of over 96,000 tonnes  from sailing in Saint Mark's basin and the Giudecca Canal (the waterway which separates the main core of Venice from the separate island of Giudecca, immediately to the south). Scroll down for video . No more: Large cruise ships will longer be able to sail in Saint Mark's basin and the Giudecca Canal . The decision comes after Michael Douglas and Cate Blanchett added their signatures to a petition calling for an end to the sight of liners dwarfing buildings such as St Mark’s Basilica. Other big-screen figures also on the list of endorsees included Rob Lowe, Diane Lane, Sir Michael Caine, Edward Norton, Susan Sarandon and Isabella Rossellini. Julie Christie, whose most iconic film – the 1973 supernatural thriller Don’t Look Now – was set in Venice, also signed the petition. Transport minister Maurizio Lupi announced the decision, saying: 'It seems to me to be a balanced solution which takes account of our duty to remove the skyscrapers of the sea from the canals of Venice, while safeguarding a world heritage city that is the envy of the world and protecting the city’s economy which is so linked to cruise tourism.' The news will be music to the ears of Venetians, environmentalists and the celebrities who voiced concern about tourist vessels sailing close to the fragile city. Plea: Hollywood stars Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Cate Blanchett signed a petition in June . Decision: Liners of over 96,000 tonnes will be banned from entering the waters near Venice's historic centre . The open letter, penned by the celebrities, read: 'Dear Prime Minister, dear Minister, . 'Having prevailed against flood, pestilence, and war for more than thirteen centuries, Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, and unparalleled UNESCO Word Heritage site, now, in a moment of relative tranquility, finds herself mortally threatened by the daily transit of gargantuan ocean liners, indifferent to the probable risk of catastrophe. 'Since the flood of 1966, Italy and countless Italian and international supporters have contributed to the defense of the world's most fragile city, eternally subject to destruction. 'The absolute lack of respect presented by the outlandish spectacle of the ongoing obstruction and potentially destruction, of one of humanity’s pre-eminent monuments is not only dumbfounding but both morally and culturally unacceptable. 'We urgently request an immediate and irrevocable halt to the traffic of the Big Ships in front of San Marco and along the Giudecca Canal putting an end to this senseless devastation.' No big ships: Demonstrators have been increasingly vocal about the presence of cruise ships in Venice . Making a splash: Opponents of cruise ships in Venice protested in the Giudecca Canal last year . Stunning views: There has been a long-standing concern the ships might cause damage and omit smog . Mr Lupi said Italy was agreeing the changes with cruise ship operators, and did not want to discourage those companies from doing business in Italy as they are an 'important resource'. He has now commissioned an environmental analysis of the nearby Contorta-Sant'Angelo canal, which has been chosen as a possible alternative route for larger vessels to reach Venice's maritime station. Venice started to restrict the movements of cruise ships in its waters earlier this year. January brought a reduction of 20 per cent on the number of ships weighing more than 40,000 tonnes authorised to enter the Giudecca Canal. The sinking of the 114,500-tonne Costa Concordia liner off the Tuscan coast in 2012, which killed 32 people, has heightened concerns about enormous cruise ships in Italy's waters.","Huge vessels dubbed the 'skyscrapers of the sea' will be barred .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A family who were holidaying on an island off the Scottish coast used their luggage straps to save 19 stranded dolphins. Finlay Meakin, 13, spotted the pod of dolphins swimming unusually close the shore at the seculded resort of Lochbuie on the Isle of Mull. He called for help when it became clear the animals had become stuck in shallow water after chasing a school of mackerel toward the beach. Scroll down for video . Rescue: Simon Lane, 59, is pictured rescuing a pod of dolphins after it became stranded off the Scottish coast . Family: Finlay Meakin, 13, spotted the pod of dolphins swimming unusually close the shore at the resort of Lochbuie on the Isle of Mull on July 24. Above, Finlay (centre), his mother Madge Meakin (left) and Mr Lane . His uncle Simon Lane, 59, and mother Madge Meakin, 48, ran down to the shore, before immediately wading into the sea in a bid to help the 'mass stranding'. The family then spent two hours slowly moving the dolphins, weighing between 35lbs and 200lbs each, back into deeper water. Incredibly, they even used their suitcase luggage straps to help lift the heavier animals and push them to safety. Video footage taken by Finley shows Mr Lane, from Hickling, Nottinghamshire, wading into the shallow water, before helping the stressed dolphins. 'Mass stranding': Finlay called for help when it became clear the animals had become stuck in the shallow waters after following a school of mackerel toward the beach. Above, Mr Lane attempts to move the dolphins . Time-consuming: The family spent two hours moving the dolphins, weighing up to 200lbs, into deeper water . Location: The beaching happened at the seculded resort of Lochbuie (pictured) on the Isle of Mull . Due to the family's brave rescue efforts, the dolphins were able to swim to deeper water unharmed. The beaching on July 24 was the worst case seen in the UK since 2008, when 26 dolphins died after becoming stranded in Cornwall, according to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust. Yesterday, Mr Lane said he was forced to carry the dolphins out to water that was up to his neck so they could swim to safety. 'On the day, we were in the house which overlooks the bay and we saw them chasing mackerel, but to our astonishment they were all beached,' said the grandfather of one. Saving lives: Incredibly, the family even used their suitcase luggage straps to help lift the heavier animals and push them to safety. Above, Mr Lane is pictured donning gloves, black swimming shorts and long socks . Getting stuck in: A video taken by Finley shows Mr Lane with the dolphins while Ms Meakin stands feet away . 'It was only about 100 yards away, I had never seen anything like it before. We ran down to see what we could do and they were beached about 20 yards from the sands and seemed very distressed. 'I went in and tried to get them out but they kept coming back in. With some of the bigger ones we had to get a strap and put it under them and lift them. 'We had to move them into the deeper water and hold them under using this strap so they could get their sat-nav sorted. At its eepest, the water was up to my shoulders and neck.' Ms Meakin, 48, added: 'Simon was definitely the hero. We just couldn’t believe what had happened.' Saved: Due to the family's brave rescue efforts, the dolphins were able to swim to deeper waters unharmed . Mr Lane was on a two-week holiday in Scotland with his partner Sue Meakin, 60, her sister Madge and her husband Jim, 58, and their son Finley when they spotted the stranded dolphins. He said the family have rented the house on the Isle of Mull for ten years but have never had to act as heroes before. 'We go up there regularly, and rent the house that overlooks the bay. It is very remote, there isn’t much out there,' he said. 'It will probably never happen again. I do a lot of snorkelling and have swam with seals before but I have never had any dealings with dolphins. 'Hero': Mr Lane said he was forced to carry the dolphins out to water that was up to his neck so that they could swim to safety . 'I wasn’t sure what they would be like, they were obviously stressed and you could hear them squeaking very loudly. 'They must have been talking to each other but they seemed to know what we were doing and that we wanted to help them. 'It was pretty exhausting but we were all so relieved to know the dolphins were safe.' The Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, which is based an hour-and-half’s drive from the loch, today  praised the family’s rescue efforts. Sighting and strandings officer Conor Ryan, 28, said: 'It was a really unusual event and the family did everything right. 'It was in a very isolated place, so it was very lucky that the family spotted them.' Mr Ryan also described the 'mass stranding' at Lochbuie as unusual, saying: 'Common dolphins normally live in deeper waters, so they don’t tend to get beached. 'Between 100 and 150 dolphins had been going through the waters nearby at that time. The dolphins that became beached were part of a splinter group. 'It’s that time of year when they move a bit closer to the shore, possibly for fish, and the mackerel come right in close to the beach.' He added: 'A ""mass stranding"" means that more than two individuals have been affected. The last one of this scale was in Cornwall in June 2008 when 26 dolphins became beached.' During the 2008 incident, the entire pod of dolphins died after becoming stranded near St Mawes in Cornwall. Veterinary wildlife pathologist Vic Simpson, who examined the . bodies, said the animals had died after they inhaled debris and mud that . clogged their insides. He added that the scenes in the River Percuil looked like 'some sort of mass suicide'.","Finlay Meakin, 13, spotted 19 dolphins stuck in shallow water in Lochbuie .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Photographer Punam Dave had all the ingredients for a perfect landscape shot - the glorious blue sea, lush green trees and moss covered rock - until a rather surly looking baboon suddenly popped into her picture. The surprise photobomber was one of a number of playful primates cavorting around at Cape Point, the southern tip of Cape Peninsula in South Africa, and putting on a show for tourists. Ms Dave, a counsellor from Limpopo Province in northern South Africa, ignored the attention-hungry animals and began to set up a beautiful shot of the sparkling ocean - when a poker-faced baboon jumped into the frame. Poser: The poker-faced baboon paused and apparently waited for photographer Punam Dave to take her shot of the famous Cape Point vista . With its arms outstretched and a surly look worthy of a catwalk model, the chacma baboon held the pose while waiting for the picture to be taken. Punam, 24, said: 'I was actually busy setting up my camera to take a shot of Dias beach which you can see in the background when all of a sudden this baboon came and sat right in the middle of my view. 'I was actually quite surprised because these baboons are known to be quite aggressive and steal people's food. 'Instead it just sat there, posing for me, calm as ever.' No animal interference: Cape Point is a spectacular lookout, with vies out to sea and of surrounding beaches . Say cheese! A llama poses for the camera in Peru, making the G Adventures' top five animal selfies list . Hilarious gag! This seal seems to be laughing at the penguins in the background in South Georgia . She added: 'It was literally for a few seconds and then it scampered away. 'There were lots of tourists standing next to me and we were having a good laugh about it - it was very unexpected.'

"By . Katie Amey for MailOnline . Clive and Jane Green have just arrived home after a long summer holiday. So long, in fact, it began back in July 1998. What started as a brief sailing trip to Ireland and Spain, turned into a 16-year round-the-world adventure. The retired couple had planned a short voyage to try out their 35ft sailing boat the Jane Green before venturing any further. Scroll down for video . Ahoy! Married couple Clive and Jane Green took off for a week-long sailing trip and just returned 16 years later . The trip began because the married couple wanted to see if they could live together in a cramped 35ft boat . But after arriving in Spain, they decided to keep going, stopping in 51 countries along the way. They have finally returned to the marina in Pembrokeshire, West Wales, from where they set sail in 1998. From Spain, the couple sailed to the Cape Verde islands and across the Atlantic to Barbados before island-hopping through the Caribbean. They then sailed up the eastern coast of the US, calling into New York. Video courtesy of Howcast . So far, so good! Following a successful first week journey to Spain, Jane (60) and Clive (62) opted to continue . Wedded bliss: In over 16 years of circumnavigating the globe, Clive insists the pair never fought once . After heading north to Canada they journeyed back down to the Panama Canal, crossed the Pacific to Australasia, sailed up through South-East Asia, over to India and through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean where they have been sailing for the last two years. They lived on around £130 a week, bartering belongings for supplies. Their best swap was one of Mrs Green’s M&S bras for a sack full of fresh fruit and vegetables on a small island off Fiji. The adventurous couple posed on the Fox Glacier in New Zealand, after leaving West Wales years earlier . From Pembrokeshire to Malaysia:  The pair took photos every step of the way on their adventure of a lifetime . Never ones to shy away from adventure, Jane and Clive spent 18 months exploring New Zealand . She recalled: ‘The tribe didn’t speak any English so it was difficult to find out what we could trade. 'But one of the women suddenly lifted up her jumper to expose her breasts and I realised she needed a bra. 'I gave her a spare and we left with enough fruit and veg for a month.’ Simply breathtaking: The pair spent time in Fatu Hiva, French Polynesia during their 16-year voyage . Cheers! To survive at sea, Clive chose to stock the small boat fridge with just one item: his favourite beer . The couple say they didn’t have a single argument on board their £16,500 vessel. Mr Green, 62, explained: ‘We made a rule that if ever we fell out one of us had to leave the cabin and sit on the deck next to the mast. But in 16 years it didn’t happen once.’ They had encounters with turtles and sting rays, saw orang-utans in Borneo, Komodo Dragon lizards in Indonesia and swam with seals. In Egypt, Jane (pictured) and Clive took a break from the boat to ride camels . During a stopover on the Galapagos Islands, Clive got up close and personal with a Komodo dragon . The pair count watching volcano sparks shooting into the night sky in Fiji among their top travel moments . Mrs Green, 60, said after they arrived back in Wales last week: ‘We have been very lucky to see our planet in such an amazing way. 'We didn’t ever plan to sail around the world. 'We would sail to a place and then, through word-of-mouth from other sailors hear about somewhere else to go on to. That has been our life for the last 16 years.’ 1998-1999: After leaving Wales on July 11, they took in Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Madeira, Canaries, Cape Verde and Barbados . 2000: St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Trinadad and Tobago, Venezuela, Martinique, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Antigua and Barbuda . 2001: St Kitts and Nevis, St Maarten, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, American Virgin Islands, Bermuda, USA, Canada . 2002-2003: Bahamas, Panama, Galapagos, Marquesas, Tuamotu, Society Islands, Northern Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga . 2003 - 2005: New Zealand, Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia . 2005 - 2007: Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand . 2009-2011: India, Oman, Yemen, Eritrea, Sudan, Egypt, Cyprus, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania . 2012- 2014: Greece, Malta, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Azores, Ireland, wales (August 8) Jane and Clive took early retirement to live their dream.  Here, they hold a coconut crab in the Cook Islands . The Greens, who don’t have children, took early retirement to live their dream – he worked as a utility company engineer and she was a hospital microbiology technician – and rented their home out in Abergavenny, South Wales. Apart from Mr Green having a tooth abscess and slicing off the tip of his finger on the galley table, they survived without a scrape. Their biggest scare was being followed by a boat in waters inhabited by Somali pirates. 'Jane is as capable as me,' Clive says of his wife's sailing abilities. 'There's nothing on the boat she can't do' G'day mate: Jane and Clive visited over 50 countries, but opted to spend two years in Australia . But it turned out to be an Eritrean fishing boat with a crewman who had a severe gash to his leg which Mrs Green was able to dress. The Greens arrived back in Neyland Marina, near Milford Haven,16 years, one month and two days after they left. Mr Green said: ‘It is good to see all our family and friends and we have promised ourselves to spend a few months getting to know them all again.’ The pair are also planning their next trip – boating the canals of Europe. In order to fully experience New Zealand, the couple purchased a van for £180 and toured the entire island . Clive especially liked exploring the coastal villages, often playing football with the local children . While not bothered by rough water, the couple admits that their most frightening moment occurred when they believed they were being followed in water inhabited by Somali pirates .

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Afp . The Food and Drug Administration's OK is all that stands between drug companies and patients who need healing medications, but a new study reveals the agency's approval process doesn't scrutinize some drugs nearly as closely as others. The Yale School of Medicine analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday found that how the FDA deems drugs 'safe and effective' varies widely drug to drug and suggests patients who think their doctors are doling out only safe and effective therapies should think again. 'Not all FDA approvals are created equally,' said Nicholas Downing, author of the study that bills itself as the first systematic look at the agency's standards for approval. Was yours scrutinized? A study out of Yale reveals the widely varied standards the FDA uses to approve different new drugs . A startling number of some 188 therapies approved by the FDA between 2005 and 2012 were given the OK without having to cite long-term evidence of their effectiveness or safety. Only 34% of the new drug approvals were backed by a study that lasted more than six months, according to the analysis of publicly available data. And even if a drug company's successful study does last longer, it still doesn't mean the therapy is any more effective. Some 37 percent were allowed on the market based on the results of a single trial that was never replicated or confirmed. What's more, most of the drugs were never compared to existing treatments to see if they are better or worse, said the study. Fewer than half were compared to treatments already on the market. 'Many . other trials were small, short, and focused on lab values, or some . other surrogate metric of effect, rather than clinical endpoints like . death,' said Downing. Although . patients may think that doctors only dole out safe and effective . medicines, a closer look at the FDA process raised doubts. OK'd but is it okay? The FDA has a blemished safety record that includes drugs with major fatality rates. In 1996, 18million prescriptions were written for fenfluramine (left) as part of the weight-loss regimen phen-fen before it was revealed to have caused major heart-valve damage to a third of users. Vioxx (right) was wildly popular in the early 2000s until revelations of its deadly side effects on the heart became clear in the wake of the deaths of tens of thousands of American users . Cause for caution: Belviq (pictured) has become one of only two long term weight-loss drugs approved in the years since the phen-fen disaster . 'Based on our study of the data, we can't be certain that this expectation is necessarily justified, given the quantity and quality of the variability we saw in the drug approval process,' Downing said. These eyebrow-raising findings are nothing to ignore, but its authors admit there is merit to the FDA's reasons behind the varying levels of scrutiny. 'The agency applies the same statutory approval standards of safety and efficacy to all drugs, but uses regulatory flexibility in applying those standards,' spokeswoman Stephanie Yao said in a statement to the Washington Post. In some cases, the FDA's 'regulatory . flexibility' can pave the way for faster approval of 'potentially . effective therapies for life-threatening diseases, such as certain . cancers, or those diseases for which there is no existing effective . treatment,' said the study. To insist that all drugs meet the same standard could result in higher costs and longer wait times. Still, . researchers said the public and the regulatory community should be . aware of the vastly differing standards for market approval. 'Based . on our analysis, some drugs are approved on the basis of large, . high-quality clinical trials, while others are approved based on results . of smaller trials,' said senior author Joseph Ross, assistant professor . of internal medicine at Yale School of Medicine. 'There was a lack of uniformity in the level of evidence the FDA used.' The FDA does not require data on comparative effectiveness as part of its approval process, the JAMA study noted. Ross . said only 40 percent of drug approvals involved a clinical trial that . compared one new drug to another, which he described as 'an important . step for determining whether the new drug is a better option than . existing, older drugs.'","The Yale analysis found the FDA allowed 37 percent of drugs onto the market after a single trial that was never replicated or confirmed .
Just 34 percent of new drug approvals were backed by a study that lasted more than six months .

The 150-year-old sea defence, known as the Grain Tower Battery, is based on a spit of land 1km off the Isle of Gran, Kent, where the Thames and the Medway meet . Although the property boasts unrivalled sea views and there are no . immediate neighbours, the property can only be accessed either at low . tide or via helicopter or boat during high tide . The huge bomb-proof building, which is set over 2,3000swm of space, was built in 1855 and originally owned by The Crown before being sold to its current owner in 2005 . Anyone wanting to live in this dilapidated fort will also need to pay out for an estimated £1million's worth of renovation to make it into a home. Although the Martello-style property was modified during World War II, it has barely been touched since. The huge bomb-proof building, which is set over 2,300sqm of space, was built in the 1855 and bought from The Crown by builder Simon . Cooper. Despite wanting to turn it into his dream home, Mr Cooper has not managed to develop the property. The former fort is marooned off the coast of the mainland, with nothing surrounding it apart from water . The house is being billed as the ideal potential home for a city boys, who wants to commute to work by speedboat . The fort's original purpose was to serve as a key military installation, protecting Chatham and Sheerness dockyards, as well as The Thames . The fort boats stunning sea views back onto the mainland, uninterrupted by any other homes or boats, as shown above . Although its day as an estuary gun emplacement are long gone - and . despite being in a dilapidated state - the imposing fort is still thought to be bomb . proof . But he has drawn up plans to show how the former fort - which has 15ft-thick walls - could look when renovated. While the estate agents are billing it as the perfect home for a city boy who wants to commute by speedboat, Mr Cooper's dream is to . see a house boat marina and a water and outdoor sports centre. The plans also show the potential to turn the fort into a mid-river nightclub or restaurant. Nigel Day, director of Riverhomes, said: 'We sell lots of very nice properties but we’ve never sold a fort. This is a first. But despite having an enviable position on The Thames, a lot of work needs to be done to turn the 19th Century property into a liveable home . The current owner, builder Simon Cooper, bought the home ten years ago but did not manage to spend the time renovating the property . Estate agent Nigel Day, director of Riverhomes, said that an estimated £1million needs to be spent on the property for it to be turned into a dream home . Mr Day said . it is 'an amazing building' and that he is 'in awe' of its potential. He said it could be turned into something 'really special' The property originally had an enormous gun on the roof. In 1912, two Quick Firing guns were moved to the tower. During the Second World War, it had a pair of six pounder QF guns installed . 'I . am in awe of what an amazing building it is and its potential, which . would be subject to planning permission and negotiations with English . heritage. 'It could be transformed into something really special - a . stunning home, a hotel, a sanctuary or something to do with outdoor . pursuits. There are so many possibilities. 'The seller has owned it for around ten years and he doesn’t have the time to do anything with it. I think you would probably look at spending a minimum of £1 million turning it into a home.' The fort's original purpose was to serve as a . key military installation, protecting Chatham and Sheerness dockyards as . well as The Thames. This map shows the remote location of Number One, The Thames - just off the Isle of Grain, where the two rivers meet . Current owner Simon Cooper, who bought the fort ten years ago, has commissioned a set of plans to show what the fort could look like. The estate agent said it could be turned into a private residence, an off-shore hotel, a houseboat community, a film location, a nightclub or a casino . This architect's image shows the revamped fort being used as a hotel or club, with a permanent walkway attached . This internal image of the proposed renovations, produced by WT Architecture, shows the building being used as a club or bar, something which the estate agent said is very plausible . Pictured are plans which show the outside and inside of the fort if it were to be converted into a bar. Mr Day said: 'It could be transformed into something really special - there are so many possibilities' The property - 4.6miles from its nearest train station, Swale - originally had an enormous gun on . the roof. In 1912 two 4.7 Quick Firing guns were moved to the . tower. During the . Second World War, it had a pair of six pounder QF guns installed and a . two-storey red brick barracks was built on stilts, to house 60 . soldiers. Although its days as an estuary gun emplacement are long gone - and despite being . in a dilapidated state - it is still thought to be bomb proof. With a guide price of £500,000, the fort is around three times the average price of a home sold in England and Wales last month. But it is also the same price that a developer paid for three garages in Wandsworth last month.","The bomb-proof 150-year-old sea defence is sat 1km off the Isle of Grain, Kent, where the Medway and Thames meet .

"By . Martin Keown . Follow @@martinkeown5 . Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos is in line to sign for Manchester United for £20million this summer. The Germany midfielder will be United's 'go-to' player and for that sort of money they will expect big things. Here, Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown gives the lowdown on the 24-year-old... Done deal: Manchester United have agreed a deal to sign Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos for £20m . The Transfer . Toni Kroos is a good bit of business for Manchester United, but he is only the first piece of the jigsaw. They still need to bring in reinforcements across the squad if they want to get back to where they were. However, a signing like this does show the power United still have. People questioned whether being out of the Champions League next season would affect their ability to buy top names. Well, here’s your answer. It’s good to get any transfers done before a World Cup so that the player’s mind is clear, and it’s particularly helpful if that player goes on to play a starring role in the tournament. But it is interesting that a club like Bayern was happy to let him go – you would have thought it would be any young German player’s dream to want to stay and win trophies at the best club in the country. Plenty of European clubs will have been interested in him but he is the marquee signing that could start the ball rolling for United. Green light: The deal to bring Kroos to Old Trafford, which was agreed when David Moyes was still in charge, has been given the go ahead by new boss Louis van Gaal . The Player . There . is no doubting Kroos’ ability. He is a quality passer of the ball, he . can defend and he has excellent vision. United want to play quick, . incisive football and Kroos is a good place to start. He keeps things . simple, always has time in possession and with his range of passing, . United will hope he could fill a Paul Scholes-shaped hole in their . midfield. Talent: Kroos is a quality passer of the ball, can defend and has excellent vision and should fit in at United . Fill the gap: United will be hoping Kroos is capable of filling the hole in midfield left by Paul Scholes . His . performance against Arsenal in the Champions League made people sit up . and take notice – he completed 147 passes, only 11 less than the entire Gunners team put together – but it’s important to remember he was . playing against 10 men for a large part of that game. He also only . scored four goals in 51 appearances this season, so he is not exactly . prolific. Sometimes . he floats in and out of matches and with Philipp Lahm often playing . deep in that Bayern midfield, Kroos was not their go-to player. He will . need to fulfil that role at United. If he plays in a midfield two, and . at the minute he would likely partner Michael Carrick, he would need to . work on his mobility. Yaya Toure and Fernandinho have set the benchmark . for all-action midfield pairings and United have to find their own . combination. Kroos can be part of that but he will need an energetic . partner. Caught the eye: Kroos' performance against Arsenal in the Champions League made people take notice . Back of the net! Kroos shoots and scores during Bayern's last 16 victory over the Gunners in February . Running the show: Kroos' heat map from February's Emirates encounter showed his dominance in midfield . The Manager . Pep . Guardiola was obviously in no rush to keep Kroos, and the German is not . your typical Guardiola midfielder. He does not have as low a centre of . gravity as the likes of Xavi or Andres Iniesta and plays in a slightly . more upright style. But Kroos does have the advantage of having worked . under Louis van Gaal before. It . was the Dutchman who gave Kroos his breakthrough at Bayern in 2010-11, . and he will know about Kroos’ pedigree. The midfielder, too, will know . all about Van Gaal’s attacking philosophy and also his colourful . dressing room manner, which can only help him adapt to life in England. It is a decent signing for United and the fans will be pleased to see . that even though there is a lot of work to be done defensively with the . squad, Van Gaal’s first instinct is still to focus on attacking . football.

"By . John Stevens for the Daily Mail . and Daniel Martin for the Daily Mail . David Cameron could be forced to resign as Prime Minister if Scotland votes to leave the UK, a senior Conservative MP has warned. Former Tory leadership contender David Davis said a Yes vote in next month’s referendum would be such a ‘humiliation’, he would have to consider stepping down. Mr Cameron has insisted he has no intention of quitting, even if he presides over the end of the 300-year-old union. Tension: David Cameron could be forced to resign as Prime Minister if Scotland votes to leave the UK, a senior Tory MP has warned. Mr Cameron is pictured (left) with Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond (right) But asked if the Prime Minister would have to go, Mr Davis told the BBC: ‘That’s his call. It will be particularly humiliating for him. ‘It would be a humiliating point for any prime minister to have lost a part of the United Kingdom, no doubt about that.’ John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, added: ‘A Yes vote would destroy Cameron’s place in the history books. ‘He would become known as the prime minister who gambled on keeping Scotland in the union and lost his gamble. ‘[It would be] very difficult in those circumstances to see how he could continue for any very great length of time.’ Mr Davis, who stood against Mr Cameron for the party leadership in 2005, said if Scotland votes to remain in the UK and gets more devolved powers there would be a knock-on effect for England. Important vote: Former Tory leadership contender David Davis said a Yes in the referendum would be such a 'humiliation', Mr Cameron would have to consider stepping down. They are pictured together in 2005 . He said there would have to be a ‘more federal answer for the United Kingdom’ and this would mean ‘at the absolute minimum, English votes for English measures’. Mr Cameron has denied his position would be untenable if Scotland voted to leave the UK in the vote on September 18. 'That’s his call. It will be particularly humiliating for him. It would be a humiliating point for any prime minister to have lost a part of the United Kingdom, no doubt about that' David Davis, former Tory leadership contender . Earlier this year when asked if he would resign in the event of a Yes vote, Mr Cameron said: ‘No and I think it is very important people understand that because it is not my name or anyone else’s name on the ballot paper.’ Earlier this year when asked if he would resign in the event of a Yes vote, Mr Cameron said: ‘No and I think it is very important people understand that because it is not my name or anyone else’s name on the ballot paper. ‘Of course, I want to see Scotland stay in the United Kingdom but I faced a choice in 2011 when the Scottish nationalists were elected to run the Scottish government. ‘Do you have a referendum or do you have some massive fight with them saying “no, no you can’t possibly have this choice”? Hot topic: Pro-independence supporters wave the Saltire as they gather in Edinburgh last year for a march . ‘I thought the right thing to do, and this was backed by the other parties at the time, and I remain of the view it was the right thing to do, was to give the Scottish people a fair, legal and decisive referendum. That’s what will happen. ‘It was absolutely the right decision. You have to decide the prior question as it were - does Scotland  want . to stay in the United Kingdom or separate itself from the United . Kingdom? 'A Yes vote would destroy Cameron’s place in the history books. He would become known as the prime minister who gambled on keeping Scotland in the union and lost his gamble' John Curtice, Strathclyde University . ‘Once you have settled that question, then you can properly engage with future acts of devolution - on which again I have a pretty good track record.’ The BBC last night claimed that four financial institutions in Scotland have privately raised fears of ‘deposit flight’ if Scotland becomes independent. But Mr Salmond told the broadcaster the Westminster government is behaving ‘irresponsibly’. He said: ‘The fear of deposit of flight is caused by a denomination risk - that is to say you would use a currency other than sterling. What we’ve been saying is exactly to prevent the fear of deposit flight. ‘The Westminster parties cannot stop Scotland using the pound.’","PM says he won't quit even if he presides over end of 300-year-old union .

Potential buyers have been granted their first look at the new 53-apartment development on Foveaux Street, with the stylish complex having its first open over the weekend . The building will be constructed from off-form concrete in a mottled grey colour . The former Legion Cabs depot made headlines last year when fashion boss Danny Avidan splashed $18 million on the site in Sydney's inner-city Surry Hills . CBRE Residential director Caroline Fagerlund said the development had attracted a lot of interest. 'We had our first open and it was very good, we had over 200 groups through on the weekend,' Ms Fagerlund told Daily Mail Australia. Kris Smith and Maddy King are among the prospective buyers . Among prospective buyers is TV host and model Kris Smith and his girlfriend Maddy King, The Daily Telegraph reported. 'We need a new place to live. They look beautiful, I'm excited to see them for real,' Smith told the Telegraph. 'It's a great spot.' The development will include one, two and three-bedroom apartments that will sell at starting prices of $780,000, $995,000 and $1.75 million respectively. Ms Fagerlund described the design as modern but natural. 'The exterior of the building is material like timber and concrete with some planter boxes,' she said. 'Inside, it's timber floors throughout, they don't have any carpet not even in the bedrooms.' Architect Adam Haddow said he tried to design a building that would age gracefully. 'It's not a polished, glitzy building you might get on the Harbour,' Mr Haddow told Daily Mail Australia. 'But I suppose the industrial chic thing would have been a bit too easy in a way. 'It's quite comfortable, and there's a texture and a rawness to the material.' The building will be constructed from off-form concrete in a mottled grey colour. 'It's accented through crisp white boxes and some timber cheeks which add warmth to the building,' Mr Haddow said. Mr Haddow added that the rooftop garden was designed to give residents space, mentally and physically. 'It's divided into a number of different zones around the rooftop so you can always go up there and find a space for yourself,' he said.

"By . Gerri Peev . Figures show that where nearly 8 per cent of households in Salford (pictured) who are meant to pay, wriggle out of it . Council tax bills could be cut by an average £100 per household if authorities chased up debts properly. Slack enforcement of council tax debts is costing households and local authorities, creating large disparities between areas with similar family incomes. Some £604 million of council tax, or 2.6 per cent, went uncollected in England last year. If councils were to recover the £604 million, it would be enough to meet all the staffing costs of public libraries, cover the cost of Sure Start childcare for nearly half a million children and pay for two-thirds of the government's free school meals for infants. Councils have complained that cuts in funding from central government will force them to either raise council tax bills or slash services. But the varying disparity in collection rates will raise questions over the validity of their complaints. The worst collection rate in the country is in Salford, where nearly 8 per cent of households who are meant to pay, wriggle out of it. Its enforcement rate of 92.1 per cent lags behind the City of London's 99.5 per cent. The average for English councils is 97.4 per cent. If Salford were to reach this national average, the bill for a house in Band F of council tax (valued at £120,000 to £160,00) could come down by nearly £123. Analysis by the Civil Enforcement Association (CIVEA) compared council tax enforcement for areas with similar profiles in 2012/13. Manchester City only managed to collect 92.9 per cent of the council tax owed, while Newcastle City achieved 97.1 per cent. Experts said if Manchester achieved a similar rate as Newcastle, council tax could be slashed by 4.2 per cent and still yield the same total for the local authority. This would reduce the bill for a band F property by £86.36. Nottingham City also collected just 93.5 per cent, compared to Dudley Borough's more impressive 98 per cent. If Nottingham could achieve the same collection rate, council tax could be slashed by 4.5 per cent and still rake in the same for the town hall. This would reduce the bill for a band e property by £94.05. Analysis by the Civil Enforcement Association (CIVEA) compared council tax enforcement for areas with similar profiles in 2012/13 . Steve Everson, director general of CIVEA said: 'These figures show that those local authorities that take a more proactive approach to the enforcement of council tax are helping to ease the financial burden on taxpayers and protecting revenue for vital public services on which vulnerable people depend.' He added: 'In an economic climate where Council Tax bills are set to rise by 0.6 per cent on average across local authorities in England, and by 4.6 per cent in Wales, this proportion of uncollected tax, upwards of £600m, represents a missed opportunity.' Bailiffs have also said the reasons that debtors are giving for not paying their council tax are getting increasingly absurd. One debtor told a bailiff that they could not make their monthly instalment as they had to pay for a funeral of a cat. Another said his fish tank broke, flooding his living room so he had to replace the tank and fish. Bailiffs heard that one man tried to avoid paying council tax as he had to put the money towards a stag party instead. Another enforcement officer greeted a supposedly broke debtor who had returned from her three week holiday in Florida. She complained he had ruined her holiday by turning up. Mr Everson said: 'These excuses can be quite astonishing but they mask a real problem in that those who avoid their council tax when they can afford to pay it are increasing the costs for everyone else.'","£600million of council tax was not collected last year, figures show .

"By . Associated Press . Capping a daylong search, a suspect in a series of shootings that killed three people and injured four others within the span of an hour in the Los Angeles area has been taken into custody. The man, whose name has not been released, was detained by SWAT officers Sunday night after holing up inside a house in Sylmar for about an hour, Capt. William Hayes said. 'You have three egregious incidents ... horrendous incidents where family members were killed and seriously injured so we wanted to resolve this as quickly as possible,' Hayes said. Serial: A suspect has been arrested in connection to a shooting spree that left three killed and four injured in the San Fernando area of California on Sunday. Above, the site of the first shooting which resulted in the year of a woman in her 20s . Above,  a map that shows the locations of the three shootings that happened Sunday morning between 5:50am and 6:45am . Witnesses had reported seeing two men in a tan- or gold-colored SUV at two of the three shooting scenes in the San Fernando Valley area. However, Hayes declined to say whether a second suspect remained at large or what led investigators to the house. Sgt Frank Preciado, a police spokesman, said a car at the house matches witnesses' description of the suspect vehicle.  He said detectives will search the house for additional evidence. Police said the victims appeared to be randomly targeted by the same gunmen because the same type of weapon was used in the morning attacks and the suspect fired from inside a car. In the first attack, a family of five was struck by gunfire at 5:50am in San Fernando as they drove to church. The family had pulled over after noticing the suspect driving erratically when they were shot, Preciado said. A woman in her 20s was killed, her mother and father were critically wounded and two children sustained minor injuries from either bullet fragments or broken glass, Preciado said. About 40 minutes later, a man was fatally shot at a Sylmar park. Arrested: Above, the scene outside the house where the suspect was taken into custody Sunday night after a stand-off with police . Then 15 minutes later and less than 5 miles away, a woman in her late 50s was shot in the head as she sat in a parked car by a church. Preciado said she may have been waiting for someone, but he didn't have more details. The shootings triggered an intense investigation and prompted the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to step up patrols on the street. 'It's a major threat,' Preciado said. He urged people to be vigilant until the suspects are apprehended. 'If you see someone that matches that description or their vehicle matches that description, then go off to an adjacent street,' he said. 'Get away.' Investigators were looking into whether Sunday's attacks were related to at least two shootings earlier in the week, Preciado said.","Police have not yet identified the suspect they took into custody Sunday .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Jailed: Convicted fraudster Robert Mitchell was moved to the accounts department of the CQC . The government's care regulator hired a twice-jailed fraudster to work in its accounts department - just months before he was jailed for a third time. Robert Leslie Mitchell, 61, was allowed to join the Care Quality Commission in 2011 despite openly telling bosses that he had been jailed for huge swindles in 1990 and 1994. At first he did not deal with money. But in January this year, the CQC's customer services centre in Newcastle moved him to the accounts department - and failed to reconsider his criminal record. Just four months later he pleaded guilty to conning his own brother-in-law, a geneticist, out of £9,000 by convincing him to invest in a courier business he had already sold. The CQC suspended him the day after his guilty plea appeared in the regional Chronicle newspaper, and he was later sacked for gross misconduct. Mitchell has since been jailed for 19 months over the con, but questions have been raised as to how he managed to work with huge sums of cash for a government organisation. A CQC spokesman said the fraudster was hired as a permanent member of staff in September 2011, where he began as a £21,000-a-year administrator in the Newcastle customer service headquarters. He was later promoted and held the roles of team leader and officer in the same centre. In January this year Mitchell was seconded to the accounts team as an accounts liaison administrator, and his record was not re-examined. He had already declared his convictions from 1990 and 1994 when he joined the regulator, the spokesman added. Those convictions were a 21-month jail term in 1990 and another three-and-a-half year term in 1994, the second of which was upheld by the Court of Appeal. For the first crime in 1990, he admitted 21 offences of obtaining £140,000 from customers over a two-year period while he was managing his own financial firm. His victims included widow Margaret Speight, who handed over a £30,000 death grant given to her when her husband died in 1988. Then, in 1994, the businessman was jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for taking an elderly couple's life savings after advertising for investors for his catering company 'The Big Bite'. He appealed his three-and-a-half-year term, but Court of Appeal judge Mr Justice Morland upheld his sentence and described him as 'a menace to gullible and unsophisticated investors'. High-profile: Mitchell was moved in January this year to work at the CQC's customer services headquarters in Newcastle (pictured). Just four months later he pleaded guilty to fraud in court and was later dismissed . In the latest case, North Tyneside Magistrates' Court heard Mitchell had committed two frauds against his brother-in-law Dr David Manning, 54. He convinced Dr Manning to invest £9,000 in a courier business after telling him it had been his sister Yvonne's dying wish, and a 'golden opportunity' to make some money. Yvonne had been married to Mitchell for a year when she died from cancer, aged 50, in 2005. In the years after her death, the brothers-in-law stayed in touch and Mitchell suggested the investment when they went on holiday together. In 2008, Dr Manning handed over £4,000 to help Mitchell expand his delivery business Fastway Couriers, and the following year he gave him a further £5,000, the court heard. Court case: Mitchell, 61, outside a previous hearing earlier this year at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court . Yet despite Mitchell claiming the company was doing well, he had sold it just days after the first investment. Mitchell was transferred for sentencing last month at Newcastle Crown Court, where a judge handed him 19 months' jail for the two frauds in 2008 and 2009. A CQC spokesman said: 'Robert Leslie Mitchell was suspended from CQC with immediate effect on May 7, 2014 and was subject to internal disciplinary procedures for gross misconduct. He was subsequently dismissed from his position. 'Mr Mitchell declared his convictions when he first applied to CQC and these were considered and he was cleared for appointment. 'The position was not reconsidered when he applied for a temporary role in the Finance Team two years later.'","Robert Mitchell joined Care Quality Commission's Newcastle HQ in 2011 .

Suarez and his Liverpool team-mates wore t-shirts of support (right) after he was banned for eight games for abusing Evra. While at Inter, Balotelli angered his own fans after wearing rivals AC Milan’s kit and he celebrated scoring in the Manchester derby with his ‘Why Always Me?’ t-shirt. Sending a message: Balotelli with his famous 'Why Always Me?' T-shirt at Old Trafford in 2011 . FIREWORKS DISPLAY . Normally a metaphor, Balotelli provided literal fireworks at City when he nearly set his house on fire after letting some off in his bathroom. He later became an ambassador for firework safety. Though not quite as explosive, Suarez’s behaviour has prompted some fiery reactions. His dive against Everton in 2011 led to Jack Rodwell being sent off and a year later he celebrated a goal against the same team by diving in front of the Everton dugout. Expect fireworks: Balotelli fronting a Bonfire Night safety campaign just after the infamous incident . P.S. Liverpool was never a happy hunting ground for Balotelli. In four matches against them for City he never won a game, let alone scored a goal. He also managed to get sent off in November 2011, lasting just 18 minutes as a sub before picking up two bookings. Discipline: Balotelli was sent off four times during his times at Manchester City, often at important times . CAR CRASH (August 2010) Just days after signing for City, Balotelli hits the headlines after crashing his Audi R8 en route to the club's training ground. Balotelli was found carrying £5,000 in cash at the time of the accident and when police asked why, he reportedly replied: 'Because I am rich.' FIRST RED CARD (November 2010) Balotelli scored his first Premier League goals in a 2-0 win at West Brom but the achievement was marred when he was sent off following a clash with Youssouf Mulumbu. WILSHERE SNUB (December 2010) City boss Roberto Mancini said Balotelli must change his attitude following his claims he had never heard of Jack Wilshere after beating the Arsenal midfielder to FIFA's Young Player of the Year award. DART-THROWING INCIDENT (March 2011) Balotelli again hit trouble after it emerged he threw a dart at a City youth team player. No one was hurt in the incident and he escaped punishment. SECOND RED CARD (March 2011) Balotelli apologised to his team-mates after being sent off during a Europa League tie with Dynamo Kiev for a reckless challenge on Goran Popov. BACK-HEEL BLUNDER (July 2011) Balotelli was immediately substituted by an enraged Mancini after performing a pirouette and back-heeling wide when clean through on goal in a pre-season friendly against LA Galaxy. FIREWORK INCIDENT (October 2011) The Italian had another run-in with the emergency services after a firework was set off in the bathroom of his home, triggering a fire. The next day, he scored in the Manchester derby and celebrated by revealing a T-shirt which read 'Why always me?' THIRD RED CARD (November 2011) The third red card of Balotelli's City career arrived in a league match against Liverpool, the 21-year-old dismissed for two yellow cards. BREAKING CURFEW (December 2011) Balotelli broke a club 48-hour curfew by visiting a curry house ahead of a match against Chelsea. RICHARDS CLASH (December 2011) Just days after Balotelli's curfew lapse, he again attracted negative headlines after pictures emerged of a training-ground bust-up with team-mate Micah Richards. PARKER CLASH (January 2012) Balotelli was charged with violent conduct by the Football Association, and subsequently handed a four-match ban, after appearing to stamp on the head of Tottenham's Scott Parker during a Premier League match. INTER PRESS CONFERENCE (March 2012) Balotelli gatecrashed the press conference to announce the appointment of Andrea Stramaccioni as Inter Milan's new coach. FOURTH RED CARD (April 2012) Balotelli was sent off for two bookable challenges on Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. He was also guilty of a shocking knee-high challenge on Gunners midfielder Alex Song. CLASH WITH MANCINI (January 2013) Balotelli clashed with Mancini during training with the pair pulled apart by coaches.

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Criminally boastful: Wellington 'Jamal' Brown, 25, shared images of $100 bill stacks and designer goods on his Instagram account before he was arrested on sex trafficking charges . Judging by accused sex trafficker Wellington Brown’s Instagram account, it is not that hard out there for a pimp after all. Mr Brown, 25, from Hartford, Connecticut, was indicted last week by a federal grand jury on sex trafficking charges involving five underage girls. Brown, a Jamaican citizen, and his suspected accomplice, 21-year-old Sheena Dume, were arrested by FBI in Maryland last month. The male suspect, known to his friends as 'Jamal,' arguably has made the job easier for federal investigators thanks to his Instagram account documenting his high-flying lifestyle, complete with thick stacks of $100 bills, bottles of Dom Perignon and designer accessories, as The Smoking Gun first reported. The shady entrepreneur spared no detail in his frequent online postings, splashing photos of Fendi and Louis Vuitton bags, rings and watches encrusted with diamonds, sumptuous surf and turf lunches and over-the-op lobster dinners. Many of Brown’s Instagram photos were accompanied by captions bragging about his charmed life. 'I'm way too young to be living like this but I love it,' he gushed in a post uploaded two months ago along with a snapshot of five Dom Perignon bottles resting in an ice bucket. 'I f****** love it!' About a week before his arrest, Brown shared a photo of a money fan with the description: 'that money triple up when u get it out of state.' Brown also may have been using his social media account as a kind of recruitment tool. Spreading the wealth: Brown and his female accomplice are accused of pimping out five girls between the ages of 15 to 17, one of whom told the FBI that the sex traffickers kept all the money but gave them presents . Making it too easy: Brown did nothing to hide his allegedly misbegotten wealth . In one shot, he photographed two women is skimpy outfits touting oversize Louis Vuitton shopping bags. The telling caption read: 'Show me loyalty and I treat u like royalty.' On a similar note, the 25-year-old suspected pimp put up on his social media account a receipt from Louis Vuitton for more than $6,000 in purchases, writing next to it: 'Once you get the privilege to meet me your life will never be the same babygirl.' Mr Brown's account has been dormant since his arrest July 30 in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The FBI sting also netted his alleged business partner, Ms Dume. The two have been charged with conspiring to recruit, entice, harbor and transport the victims for sex acts from June 2013 to last February. Lap of luxury: Judging by his social media postings, Mr Brown 25, has been a loyal customer of Louis Vuitton . Sumptuous feast: Like most Instagram accounts, Brown's features many shots of over-the-top meals . Humble brag: The 25-year-old Jamaican citizen gushed how he was too young to lead this Dom Perignon-drenched lifestyle . According to an arrest affidavit, the pair prostituted girls between the ages of 15 and 17, who were given monikers like Chocolate, China, Delicious and Desire . One of the victims told FBI agents that she was recruited by Brown straight out of high school. The teenager said Brown and Dume would routinely take the girls' personal property when they would go to meet johns to make sure they will return with the money. The teenage prostitute also revealed that the 25-year-old never paid her or the other young women money, but instead bought them presents and took them to beauty salons. The charges against Brown and Dume carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and up to life in prison.","Wellington 'Jamal' Brown, 25, charged with sex trafficking for allegedly pimping out five girls between ages 15 and 17 .

The usually elusive marine predator, estimated at 15 feet in length, was sighted off the coast of Chatham yesterday afternoon. Experts believe the shark was hunting seals in the channel and was caught at low tide. Scroll down for video . Close encounter: The Shakin family were boating off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Thursday when they ran into this Great White shark in the water . Predator: The male shark was estimated to be about 15 feet in length . On the hunt: Researchers say the massive fish was likely out chasing seals when it got caught in low tide . Thrilled: Catherine Shakin's sister, Kelsey, was able to capture a video showing the shark approach her family's boat . A video recorded by 17-year-old Kelsey Shakin, who was out on a boat with her family Thursday, captured the moment the shark swam up to their vessel. 'My God, Shark'! the boaters could be heard screaming and gasping in shock as the fish approached the Shakins' vessel. 'I was like, ""Oh, my God, there's a shark.” And it was really, really big,' Kelsey's 13-year-old sister, Catherine Shakin, later recalled to WCVB. Jess Metzler, who also had a run-in with the sea monster, said the Great White came so close to her boat that she could reach out and touch it. Scientist John Chisholm recorded the same shark with his GoPro camera . Thriving species: The population of Great Whites has been on the rise due to successful conservancy efforts . The sightings prompted officials in Chatham to issue warnings to swimmers, but the local beaches remained open Friday. The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, a Cape Cod-based non-profit group committed to raising public awareness of sharks, shared another video on its Facebook page Thursday showing the male sea creature swimming off Chatham. The GoPro footage depicting the predator silently traversing the turquoise waters was captured by John Chisholm, a researcher with the Massachusetts Shark Research program who is currently working on a shark population study. On Wednesday, the Cape Cod conservancy group shared on Facebook a stunning still image captured a week earlier showing a male shark, possibly the same one that was sighted Thursday, swimming in the same area. Experts say Great Whites are fairly common around Cape Cod; there have been more than a dozen sightings so far this year. Cue 'Jaws' music: the Great White's impressive dorsal fin is seen slicing the waves Thursday . Earlier sighting: The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy shared this incredible still of a Great White spotted in the area of Cape Cod last week . A study by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists, published in June in the journal PLOS ONE, said shark population has climbed since about 2000 in the western North Atlantic. The scientists behind the study attributed the resurgence to conservation efforts, such as a federal 1997 act that prevented hunting of great whites, and greater availability of prey, esecpailly seals. The species is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The research added recent unpublished data to previously published records to establish 649 confirmed white shark sightings from 1800 to 2010. The data showed that a period of decline in white shark abundance during the 1970s and 1980s has reversed, the authors said.","The 15-foot-long male shark was spotted off Chatham, Massachusetts, Thursday .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Police are hunting a group of exhibitionists who had an orgy on a beach in front of shocked onlookers. Up to five men and women performed sex acts in broad daylight on Jersey’s Le Saie beach, a popular beauty spot, over the course of five and a half hours. Officers have questioned four people and are yet to make any arrests, but believe there are more witnesses who have not come forward. Orgy: Up to five men and women performed sex acts on each other in public at a beauty spot on the Channel Island of Jersey near Rozel Bay, pictured. Police want to have the participants prosecuted for 'gross indecency' Officers said the incident happened 'between noon and 5.30pm' on Tuesday, August 5, on a secluded stretch of beach near Le Mont De Rozel on Jersey’s north east coast. The beauty spot in Saie Harbour is described by World Guides as one of the best in the Channel Islands, known for its 'tranquil' and 'untouched' beauty. The four or five participants were seen engaging in various 'acts of gross indecency' which sparked complaints. Officers particularly want to hear from anyone who was on the beach when the incident began. A spokesman for Jersey Police said: 'Police are currently investigating an incident that occurred during the afternoon of Tuesday 5th August 2014 on Le Saie Beach, Le Mont De Rozel. 'The incident involved four or five adults engaging in acts of a sexual nature on the beach.' Beauty spot: The beach is near Rozel Bay (pictured) on Jersey's north east coast, described as one of the best places to visit in the Channel Islands. Police believe there may be more witnesses yet to come forward . It is not known whether the participants were locals or holidaymakers. Police have also declined to say what type of sexual activity is believed to have taken place, or how many witnesses there were. However, the incident comes in a summer which has seen Britons hit the headlines for public sexual activity at European holiday resorts. Earlier this week a young man and woman were filmed apparently having sex in the sea, in full view of families in the Spanish resort of Magaluf. While some onlookers were shocked, others cheered and applauded the two lovers. A British girl was filmed in the same resort last month performing a sex act on 24 men in a bar in just two minutes as part of a bar crawl. In events which prompted outrage at the bar crawl's organisers, the 18-year-old was allegedly told she would win a 'holiday' which turned out to be a £4 cocktail of the same name. Jersey's legal system defines 'gross indecency' as any deliberate act which 'right-thinking members of the public would regard as grossly indecent'. One Jersey resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'You hear about this sort of thing happening in boozy Spanish holiday resorts but not on Jersey. 'You expect a better class of people here, but then nothing seems to shock you these days. 'It’s a secluded spot and quite a hike to get up there - that’s possibly why they chose the area.'","Up to five men and women performed sex acts on Jersey's Le Saie beach .

"By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . A white supremacist prison gang member has been arrested over a suspected bank robbery after a brief stint as Utah's 'Public Enemy Number One'. Charley Louis Sanford, 28, recently broke out of a halfway house where he was on supervised release after being sentenced in 2013 to 21 months for bank fraud. His photo was released on Thursday by the Salt Lake Metro Gang Unit. Ten hours later, he was arrested following numerous public tips and back behind bars at the Weber County Jail. Charley Louis Sanford, 28,  (right in his latest mugshot) spent a brief time as Utah's 'public enemy number one' on Thursday but he is now back behind bars. His criminal career started early after he was arrested, aged 19 (left), for armed bank robbery in the state . Sanford pictured with his girlfriend Cait Fox. The 28-year-old is back behind bars on suspicion of an armed bank robbery on Tuesday . He was arrested on Thursday without incident and was found to be in possession of a gun. The 28-year-old is suspected of robbing the Key Bank on Tuesday. He was charged with aggravated robbery and carrying a concealed weapon, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Sanford's criminal history is long and varied. At 19, he was charged with an armed bank robbery in Olympus Grove and jailed in 2006. His mugshot from the time showed that he already had several tattoos on his neck and chest. In 2010, he escaped from a halfway house but was recaptured and sentenced again. In October 2013, he was in court for illegal possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia. He was given a suspended year-long jail sentence and 18 months on probation. He pleaded guilty in 2012 to drug possession and giving false information in a case. Sanford, 28, had numerous tattoos including swastikas, lightning bolts on his cheeks and two horns on his forehead . After his recent release from prison for bank fraud, he was ordered to be placed on supervised release, banned from drugs and alcohol and ordered to under mental health treatment. A description of Sanford was released by authorities telling the public to be on the lookout for a 6ft white male, weighing 185 lbs with brown eyes and brown hair. His numerous tattoos were noted including several on his neck,  a swastika on his right cheek and  horns on the forehead. Police noted lightning bolts on his left cheek which also appeared to be SS, signifying Hitler's terrifying paramilitary unit under the Nazi regime. The 28-year-old also has the word 'pride' tattooed over his right eyebrow and a UFC (perhaps to stand for Ultimate Fighting Championship) on his hand. Sanford's Facebook page lists his profession as a tattoo artist and that he is married to Cait Fox, who reportedly works at MAC Cosmetics.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . An elderly female pastor suffered a heart attack after police in riot gear stormed her home in a 'botched' early-morning drug raid. Relatives of Hyacinth Brown, 79, have complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission saying the operation was a blunder by Scotland Yard who left empty-handed. They are furious that Mrs Brown has not yet received an apology after her house in Hackney, North East London, was turned 'upside-down'. Hyacinth Brown, 79, suffered a heart attack after a 'botched' raid on her home in Hackney, London . Met Police executed a warrant and forced their way into her home in Hackney, east London at 8am last Friday. Ms Brown, who leads a congregation, immediately began feeling unwell and paramedics were called. She was rushed to hospital and treated for a minor heart attack and stroke. Family say officers also handcuffed Mrs Brown's daughter, Jacqueline, a minister for a congregation in Kensington, who was staying overnight to keep her mother company. She said her mother was 'terrified' and added: 'The police said surveillance once saw the house selling drugs but they had got the wrong house.' Police in full riot gear had a search warrant and said they were acting on 'intelligence' of drug activity. But whether or not it was the right address is now the subject of an investigation. Her daughter Jacqueline said: 'I came running down the stairs as I thought someone was breaking in. The pastor's family has lodged an official complaint to the Met Police. The force said it could not comment while the complaint was under investigation . 'My mother was terrified. They said surveillance once saw the house selling drugs but they had got the wrong house.' Another of Mrs Brown's daughters, Sandra, 40, claims one officer stormed into her mother's bedroom in the house and police continued kicking down doors despite their protests that they had the wrong property. She said: 'It was very upsetting. What is even more disgusting is police have not apologised or had any contact with us. 'It wasn't handled with any diligence. They burst into her bedroom and down the flights of stairs. They turned the house upside down, all the doors were taken or kicked off without any second thought. She was overcome with worry. 'After they realised she was an elderly woman they still continued with their raid. It was like something out of a movie. The whole thing was disgusting. 'We think she must have started to have the heart attack when they burst into her room, as she couldn't speak at first. 'My mum was telling them it wasn't the right house and they still carried on busting through doors and turning things inside out. She's really unhappy about the whole situation, really tearful and emotional. She doesn't deserve what happened to her.' Neighbour Roy Smith described Hyacinth as being a 'pillar of the local community.' He said: 'She's a church lady, the family are not involved in anything like that.' Police confirmed officers had obtained a warrant for the raid, but admitted no drugs were found or arrests made. A spokesman for Met Police said: 'We are aware an official complaint is being lodged. Under these circumstances it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.'","Pastor Hyacinth Brown, 79, suffered a heart attack and was taken to hospital .

"By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . McDonald's has added mozzarella sticks to its menu - with the obligatory 'McMarinara' sauce on the side. The fast-food chain is test-running the snack in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut with three pieces being sold for a dollar. The menu item is not entirely new - the cheesy item was previously available in the UK and called Mozzarella Dippers. The fast-food chain is test-running the cheesy snack with Italian tomato sauce at one New Jersey location . In fact, the item was so popular among British fast-food eaters that a petition was set up on Facebook entitled 'Keep Mozzarella Sticks in McDonalds UK all year round'. The new fast-food option was spotted by Grubgrade in northern New Jersey. McDonald's told MailOnline today: 'It’s premature to speculate on the decisions we may make after the test, but we’re excited to share this menu item with our customers in this test market.' They have 260kcal per serving of the sticks with an additional 50kcal for the Italian tomato dip. The reaction to the limited roll-out has been varied. On Twitter, one user @austintobler3 enthusiastically tweeted: 'Mcdonalds having mozzarella sticks is the greatest thing of all time.' Another positive endorsement came from @lesenez who tweeted: 'Mozzarella sticks are back at McDonald's all my prayers have been answered.' Twitter user @melarenass seemed more dubious, writing: 'Dad came home with mozzarella sticks from mcdonalds what...' McMozzarella sticks are yet another way that McDonald's are shaking up their menu to try to attract new customers. In the past 18 months, the chain has introduced the option to substitute egg whites in breakfast sandwiches and rolled out chicken wraps as its first menu item with cucumbers. Last fall, it announced plans to give people the choice of a salad instead of fries in combo meals. And in coming months, mandarins will be offered in Happy Meals, with other fruits being explored as well. The company faces an uphill battle, especially if the past is any indication. The salads it introduced more than a decade ago account for just two to three per cent of sales. And the chain last year discontinued its Fruit & Walnut salad and premium Angus burgers, which analysts said were priced too high for McDonald's customers at around $5. McDonald's is not the first to capitalize on America's love of the cheesy fingers - fast-food joints and chains Sonic, Applebee's, The Cheesecake Factory, Chilis, Red Lobster, Wendy's, Arby's and TGI Fridays all have mozzarella sticks on the menu. The three McMozzarella sticks are available for a dollar. No word yet on whether McDonald's plans to take the new item countrywide .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . A retired paramedic has won a seven-year battle with British Gas after he was hassled for £1,100 in unpaid bills - despite never using gas in his home. Cyril Richardson, 78, was threatened with legal action and a warrant to enter his Shropshire home by solicitors representing the energy giant. British Gas claimed the retired paramedic owed them £1,100 in gas bills even though the meter reading at his Shrewsbury house had not changed since the day he moved in, back in 2007. Retired paramedic Cyril Richardson, 78, was hassled by British Gas for seven years over £1,100 in unpaid bills - despite never using gas in his home . Even with photographic evidence to prove this, the 78-year-old endured letters threatening him with disconnection and forced entry to his flat at the hands of debt collectors. Mr Richardson did use British Gas for his electricity supply, but he never needed to use gas in his home as all his appliances are electric. The seven-year nightmare was finally resolved after he was forced hire a solicitor to fight back against the claims. But when he asked for compensation, British Gas offered just £50 as a 'goodwill gesture', which he has declined. 'It has been a terrible time for the past seven years,' said Mr Richardson. 'They just didn't want to listen. They were adamant that I owed them money, even when I could prove I didn't. British Gas claimed the retired paramedic owed them £1,100 even though the meter reading at his property had not changed since the day he moved in . Mr Richardson doesn't use gas in his home as all his appliances are powered by electricity . 'From the very start I told them that although I used electric, I didn't use gas. 'But they carried on regardless sending me letters threatening legal action, that they were going to get a warrant to enter my property and that they would disconnect my supply. 'And the bill kept getting bigger and bigger. I pay for everything by cash, I have no debts and this was very worrying for me.' Mr Richardson was first billed £179.15 just months after he moved in to the flat in Shrewsbury. In November 2007 he tried to move electricity supplier to either npower or Southern Electric but British Gas objected to the move due to the 'unpaid' gas bills. By May 2008 the bill had reached £447.54 and by July 2009 had risen to £687.94. It had then gone to £859.82 in March 2010. Over the next few years the bill grew and grew until last month it had reached £1,100.28. He added: 'I just didn't know what to do. 'They said the debt had been passed to a collections agency. 'Citizens Advice spoke to British Gas as far back as 2007 and we were told then to 'forget all about it' by their adviser. 'But in 2008 they were still sending me bills and we were telling them that I wasn't using any gas. 'They finally removed the meter and the matter is closed.' Mr Richardson has asked British Gas for compensation for the letters, phone calls and heartache they caused, but has not even received an apology. A spokeswoman for British Gas said: 'I am very sorry for the distress caused by the errors with Mr Richardson's gas account. 'We did not act as quickly as we should have to correct the account details. 'We have apologised for this and for the incorrect final bill that we sent. 'We will be contacting Mr Richardson again to explain how this happened and to resolve the issue.'","Cyril Richardson, 78, was hounded by British Gas for seven years .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . If you enjoy scaling mountains, scuba diving or splashing around in water parks, this expansive swimming pool shows you can do it all from the comfort of your own home - as long as you have an extra $2 million floating around. The luxurious, 140ft-long pool in Springville, Utah features a towering man-made mountain, five waterfalls, a lazy river and is deep enough for its owners to practice their scuba diving. The feat of creative and engineering genius featured on Animal Planet's 'The Pool Master'. Scroll down for video . Making a splash: A massive man-made mountain stands in the middle of a family's swimming pool in Utah . Secrets: It features a 60ft water slide that goes through the mountain and into the pool below . Stunning: From the top, there are stunning views of the landscape, as well as the expansive swimming pool . The mountain is crafted from reed bar, metal beams and 350 yards of concrete painted to look like the real thing, and inside there's a 60ft waterslide that spits swimmers out into the pool below. The man-made mountain 'emulates the natural surroundings perfectly', Anthony Archer-Wills, the host of The Pool Master, says on the episode. The tallest of the five waterfalls stretches to 20ft and forces more than 3,000 gallons of water per minute over the edge. The falls can also be reached from nooks inside the mountain. Atop the massive boulder are bridges, pathways and steps that lead to the waterslide and give views over the 140ft by 60ft pool - which holds 360,000 gallons of water in total - in all its glory. Luxury: Swimmers that are scuba dive certified can also descend to 26ft through an entrance inside . Exploring: The underwater route then brings the swimmer back out to the main swimming pool . Hidden away: Inside the mountain, there is also a kitchen with a grill and granite topped surfaces . Lair: There is also a whole changing room with showers, lockers and a bathroom for freshening up . But the mountain has more inside than cement and the occasional secret passageway - it also houses a kitchen with granite counter tops, an eight burner grill and a refrigerator. A separate room holds changing rooms, lockers and a shower. Encircling the entire pool is a 300ft lazy river, which is propelled by jets. Or if you fancy being a little more active, you can don a wet suit and descend to as deep as 26 feet to check out the bottom of the pool. If you take this route, you enter from an excluded entry point inside the mountain then take a 54ft long and 5ft wide tunnel into the pool. Not bad for a home nearly 1,000 miles from the ocean. The show did not name the family lucky enough to own the pool. The Pool Master launches in the UK in October on Animal Planet .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A former middle school teacher has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the hit-and-run death of a six-year-old boy who was killed as he went to get candy for being good. Tammy Lowe, a former Grand Prairie, Texas schoolteacher, was sentenced on Friday to eight years in prison for manslaughter and 10 years for failure to stop and render aid to John Raidy in 2013. She will serve the sentences concurrently and is eligible for parole in four years. She faced as many as 20 years behind bars after being found guilty of manslaughter in Dallas County, Texas Thursday. On January 24, 2013, she ran a red light in Carrier Parkway, plowing down John Raidy as he crossed the street to get treats with his mother Lauren and little sister, who was in a stroller. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Tammy Lowe, a former teacher, cries as she takes the stand in her manslaughter case this week. She was found guilty of manslaughter in the hit-and-run death of a six-year-old boy last year . Lauren Raidy watched in horror as the driver continued, carrying her son on the hood for about 300 feet, before stopping briefly and then speeding off. The deadly incident was captured on surveillance cameras outside nearby businesses. When Lowe got home, she told her husband that the damage to her car had been caused by kids at school. But five days later, after quitting her teaching job, she turned herself in to police. Raidy's mother, Lauren Raidy-Brooks, testified about the heartbreaking incident on Tuesday and later sobbed during the closing arguments, Fox8 reported. 'I have this pain and there's a hole that won't go away,' the devastated mother said through tears. 'Nothing is going to bring my John back. But she did what she did and she needs to pay for it.' Victim: John Raidy, pictured, had been walking across the crosswalk with his mother Lauren, right, and baby sister to get candy when they were plowed down by Lowe, who had failed to stop at a red light . In court, Lowe explained that she had always loved children. She had served on the Sunshine Committee at Adams Middle School, where she worked for almost 20 years, WFAA reported. 'I loved kids and they were drawn to me,' she told jurors. Arrested: Lowe, 54, quit her job and turned herself into police five days after the deadly accident . But in the incident in January of last year, she saw the small figure roll onto her hood and she had a panic attack. 'My hands were shaking and sweating so bad,' she said. 'I had no rational thought of what to do, except that if I didn't flee I was going to die.' She said she eventually knew she had to turn herself in, so she told her husband and they sat down with their children and told them what had happened. She then went to her school and quit, before heading to speak to police. 'I would trade places in a second if I could,' she said of the little boy, WFAA reported. 'I have wanted to trade places and him be okay.' Before the jury announced its verdict on Thursday, she had already pleaded guilty to one felony, Failure to Stop and Render Aid. The defense had argued that the prosecution failed to prove that Lowe had 'conscious intent' to run the light, and argued she be found guilty of the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide, which is punishable by up to 180 days in state jail. 'Did she panic? Did she freak out? Was she scared?' defense attorney Lee Bright asked jurors. 'I'd bet all of the above, and she made a horrible choice' - but added she was not guilty of manslaughter. Evidence: Lowe returned home and told her husband that the damage to her car was caused by kids at the school where she taught. He fixed the damage and she eventually admitted the truth days later . But prosecutors said she had not been paying attention as she drove and then did not stop, adding: 'That's her conscious intent.' 'A good person would have stopped,' prosecutor Danielle Uher told the court. 'A good person, had they panicked, would have gone back.' The jury is scheduled to deliberate her punishment on Friday.

"By . Josh Gardner for MailOnline . Platinum-selling rapper Young Jeezy has been arrested on suspicion of possessing illegal firearms--specifically an assault rifle--during an investigation into a fatal shooting at the concert in Silicon Valley . The Atlanta-based rapper, whose real name is Jay Wayne Jenkins, was taken into custody Sunday by detectives along with five other people while executing a search warrant at the Verizon Amphitheater in Irvine, Mountain View police spokesman Sgt. Saul Jaeger said Monday. They were taken to the Orange County jail, where Jenkins was being held on $1 million bail. Arrested: Grammy nominee Young Jeezy was arrested Sunday (mugshot at right) as police investigated the shooting that occurred Saturday at a concert (Jeezy is pictured at left performing) co-headlined with Wiz Khalifa . The arrests come after Eric Johnson of Orinda was shot and killed while backstage at the Under the Influence of Music concert Jeezy co-headlined with fellow rapper Wiz Khalifa at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View on Friday. The 38-year-old husband and father worked as a concert promoter for Bay Area musicians, but was not connected to the concert tour where he lost his life. The five other people arrested were Alexa Beason, 52; William Paul Gilmore, 48; David Kuniansky-Altman, 31; Kena Jermaine Marshall, 39; and Peter Arthur Maynard, 38 according to the Mercury News. All five were somehow employed on the tour. None of the arrested has been identified as suspects in the fatal shooting, Jaeger said. 'We haven't made any arrests for the homicide. These arrests were made during the execution of the warrant,' Jaeger said. Police, however, say they are still in search of a suspect described as between 5-foot-6 and 5-foot-8. Victim: 38-year-old husband and father Eric Johnson was shot and killed at the Wiz Khalifa/Young Jeezy concert on Saturday in Mountain View, California . Not implicated: Wiz Khalifa has in no way been implicated in the crime that took place backstage at his concert Saturday . Police believe the African American man in his 20s used a black pistol with a large magazine. A source told TMZ that the victim was shot backstage and was hit at least five times. Wiz, real name Cameron Jibril Thomaz, posted two tweets on Saturday afternoon, calling the killing a 'senseless tragedy' and added: 'Violence is never the answer. My prayers go out to the victim’s family. Police are asking anyone with information, video or photos about the shooting to call 650-903-6395 or email police@mountainview.gov.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . A ‘lenient’ nine-year jail term handed to a mechanic who beat his lover's newborn baby to death will be reviewed by the Court of Appeal amid complaints it was not long enough. Michael John Pearce, 33, was convicted of the manslaughter of his former girlfriend’s six-week-old son Alfie Sullock after hitting him with a shoe and a plastic bottle. But the motorcycle mechanic from Caerphilly, Wales, was cleared of murder - an offence which carries a mandatory life sentence – at Newport Crown Court last month. Michael John Pearce, 33, (left) was given a nine-year jail term for killing his girlfriend’s six-week-old son Alfie Sullock (right). The sentence is to be reviewed by the Court of Appeal following 10 complaints . He had offered to look after the newborn so his 29-year-old girlfriend, Donna Sullock, could have her first night out after giving birth on August 16 last night. But in a 'momentary loss of control' he lashed out at the child, who died four days later suffering from bleeding on the brain. It emerged that Pearce’s outburst came just hours after his girlfriend told him she would not have a baby with him. Solicitor General, Robert Buckland, yesterday referred the sentence handed down to Pearce to the Court of Appeal as potentially unduly lenient. Former holiday rep Donna Sullock, from Cardiff, met Pearce while six months pregnant and started to spend most weekends at his house. She was on her first night out since giving birth when Alfie was killed . Pearce’s outburst came just hours after his girlfriend told him she would not have a baby with him . The move means that three appeal court judges will now consider whether the sentence is too short, and his jail term could be increased. Pearce was told by a judge that he could expect to serve half a custodial term in prison with the remainder on licence. This means he could released from prison by early 2018 as he spent about a year on remand while awaiting trial. The case is expected to be heard at London’s Court of Appeal within six weeks. The attorney general’s office confirmed earlier this month that it had received about 10 complaints about the sentence. Mr Justice Baker asked whether jealousy had played a part in the killing during the trial last month. He told Pearce: 'Alfie died as a result of you having inflicted upon him multiple blunt force injuries. 'It may well be that, due to your denials... whether you were motivated by jealousy as a result of Donna’s refusal to have your child earlier that evening.' While babysitting Alfie in August last year, Pearce sent Ms Sullock a text saying: 'You can trust me you know' Donna Sullock (orange top) with her family and friends after the trial at Newport Crown Court . And disputing Pearce’s mitigation, the judge added: 'This was not a momentary loss of control by a sleep-deprived parent. Alfie was only in your care for a short time.' Former holiday rep Ms Sullock, who lived in Cardiff, had met Pearce while six months pregnant and had started to spend most weekends at her boyfriend’s house. Prior to her girls’ night out, she went to a local pub with Pearce - where he drank four pints of beer within an hour. Pearce asked Ms Sullock to have a child with him - but she said no. During the course of Pearce’s trial, the Crown said the defendant showed 'obsessive' behaviour towards Ms Sullock - and had showered her with gifts just a few weeks into their relationship. Ms Sullock said that, when she left the house for her night out, Alfie was 'happy and healthy' and did not have as much as scratch on him. While babysitting Alfie, Pearce sent Ms Sullock a text saying: 'You can trust me you know'. But at 9.11pm he dialled 999, after claiming he had gone to the toilet and returned to see Alfie had stopped breathing. When paramedics arrived moments later, they found the baby lifeless and blue. Pearce was home alone babysitting Alfie last year when paramedics were called to his address in Nelson, Caerphilly, south Wales. A trial at Newport Crown Court heard it was the first time divorcee Pearce had been left alone with the baby. Alfie died after suffering head and abdominal injuries.","Michael Pearce, from Caerphilly, bludgeoned Alfie Rhys Sullock to death .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . We're often told that a positive attitude is key to getting ahead at work. But it turns out people with an upbeat manner can actually be bad for business. For a study has found that if staff are too chirpy it can lead to complacency and superficiality – rather than improved productivity and wellbeing. Conversely, negative emotions can benefit a workplace if they are expressed constructively and in the right context. Scroll down for video . Negative emotions in a workplace can be beneficial if expressed constructively and in the right context . For example, the researchers found that anger can lead to positive outcomes if it is motivated by perceived violations of moral standards. In this case it can prevent or stop injustices against a colleague, or it can make fellow workers avoid repeating mistakes. And having a grumpy, dissenting voice in team situations can stir up greater discussion by preventing the group reaching a consensus too quickly. The University of Liverpool research – published in the journal Human Relations – concluded that commonly held assumptions about attitudes at work should therefore be questioned. Dr Dirk Lindebaum, from the university’s school of management, said: ‘The findings challenge the widely held assumption that in the workplace positive emotions generate or engender a positive outcome, and vice versa. ‘They add to our knowledge and understanding of how the positive and negative dynamics affect the working environment and has practical application and relevance in the workplace.’ If staff are too chirpy at work it can lead to complacency and superficial outcomes according to research .","People with an upbeat manner can actually be bad for business .

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is re-examing evidence on the benefits of alteplase after experts said previous assessments may have been flawed. Patients are given the drug to disperse clots in a treatment known as thrombolysis. It leads to an increased risk of bleeding in the brain, but evidence suggested the danger was outweighed by the benefits of an improved recovery. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has been asked to have another look at the drug after claims previous assessments on the clot-busting drug may be flawed, picture posed by models . However, Dr Roger Shinton, a stroke specialist, raised concerns in a letter published in The Lancet. He told the BBC: ‘My concerns using alteplase for stroke have always been that the risks of this drug are quite considerable, particularly with bleeding into the brain. The question is, do the benefits justify that risk? And I am not myself convinced that they do.’ The MHRA recently reaffirmed that the benefits outweighed the risk but also said it was setting up an expert working group ‘to ensure all relevant sources of evidence have been taken into consideration’. It is expected to report back next year. German manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim said it stood by the safety of alteplase.

"By . Caroline Graham for The Mail on Sunday . Actor Rob Schneider tweeted that one of the side effects of Robin William's medication is suicide . A close friend of Robin Williams has blamed the drugs the comedian was taking to combat Parkinson’s disease for his suicide. Actor Rob Schneider tweeted: ‘Now that we can talk about it #Robin Williams was on a drug treating the symptoms of Parkinson’s. One of the side effects is suicide.’ Schneider, 50, met Williams more than two decades ago when they appeared on the US TV show, Saturday Night Live. They remained close friends and often performed together in stand-up comedy clubs. Williams’s spokeswoman declined to comment when asked by The Mail on Sunday about rumours that the tragic comic’s family blames the medication he was on for ‘pushing him over the edge’. A source said: ‘Robin had recently left rehab. He was on medication for anxiety and depression and had also started taking drugs to combat the early onset of Parkinson’s. ‘Many of these drugs list suicidal thoughts as a possible side effect. A lot of Robin’s friends are convinced that the cocktail of prescription pills he was on somehow contributed to his mental state deteriorating as quickly as it did. ‘Robin had always suffered from depression and addiction but the diagnosis and treatment of his Parkinson’s was new, as was the combination of drugs he was on.’ Williams, 63, was last photographed at an art show near his home in Tiburon, northern California, last Saturday night. He appeared frail and thin. He took his life last Sunday as his third wife Susan Schneider (who is not related to Rob Schneider) slept in the next room. The pair are thought to have been sleeping in separate rooms because Williams was suffering from insomnia brought on by the drugs he was taking. Williams’s body was found on Monday morning by his personal assistant. Results of toxicology tests are expected to take six weeks. Experts say Parkinson’s disease can make symptoms of depression worse. America’s National Institute of Mental Health says on its website that people struggling with depression and Parkinson’s ‘suffer higher levels of anxiety and more problems with concentration’ than those suffering from only one of the ailments. Dr Jeff Bronstein, neurologist specialising in Parkinson’s, said: ‘Obviously getting the diagnosis can make people depressed but we also know there is a much higher incidence of depression even before the disease is recognised. We think it’s one of the early symptoms.’ Comedian Robin Williams with his daughter Zelda in 2009 before he tragically took his life last Sunday .

"By . Jenny Johnston for MailOnline . 'Brilliant, beautiful' Freddy McConnel died of a Heroin overdose in 2011, aged 18. He is pictured here at 15 . Are addicts born that way? The nature vs nurture question is one that's preoccupied composer James McConnel for longer than he can recall. He beat his own demons – drink was his – by the time he was 30, but when his children came along, the questions ('for which I still do not have answers') became more pertinent. He veers towards the idea there's an addictive 'gene', something we're either born with or not, something that may kill us or not. 'My daughter Daisy doesn't have it,' he explains, talking of his youngest, who is about to go to university. 'She doesn't have that obsessive, compulsive thing.' His son Freddy, though – 'brilliant, beautiful Fred' – did have it. He saw it in him almost before the little boy could walk. 'He had to throw himself into everything 100 per cent. He didn't just drink his orange squash, he'd guzzle it. Freddy never approached things, he attacked them. He took up ping-pong, and ended up representing his country. He went on Junior Mastermind. 'By the time he was 18 he'd decided he was going to be a songwriter. Being Freddy, he was going to be the best songwriter in the world.' When Freddy got involved in drugs he threw himself 100 per cent into that too, dying from a heroin overdose in 2011 at just 18. His death made headlines because of his connections. His mother was the celebrated cartoonist Annie Tempest; musician Pete Doherty was a good friend. What only emerged later was that he'd been a friend of Peaches Geldof too, and it's probable they did drugs together. In a diary entry a few weeks before his death he wrote that Peaches was going to visit him later and he was going to 'inject for the first time'. After Freddy, pictured left, died, his father . James McConel said Peaches, pictured right, a friend of Freddy's, phoned . to beg him not to reveal her drug addiction to her father Bob Geldof . Freddy, pictured here the year he died, wrote in a diary entry weeks before his death that Peaches was coming to visit and he would 'inject for the first time' Inevitably the conversation with James turns to Peaches, and her death in April this year, with its striking echoes of his son's. Mr McConnel said of Peaches' death: 'It never really surprises me any more when I hear about youngsters dying of heroin overdoses' 'Was I surprised? Not desperately,' he says, 'I wasn't expecting her to die, but I knew she knew Freddy well. I knew she'd been having a rough time. It never really surprises me any more when I hear about youngsters dying of heroin overdoses, because it happens so much.' Peaches called James the day after his son died, but he was furious that she was preoccupied with ensuring her name wasn't linked with his. 'She was far more concerned about getting into trouble if her father ever found out. At the time I thought she was being a spoilt little brat, but now I realise the poor girl was going through hell and couldn't help herself. Now I just feel desperately sorry for her family.' With . hindsight one wonders what would have happened if James had lifted the . phone and called Bob Geldof himself. He says that never occurred to him. 'At that time I wasn't sure she was using. I knew that towards the . very, very end she paid Freddy to go and buy drugs and he visited her in . Kent, but to be honest, by the time Freddy died the last thing I was . thinking about was anybody but him.' He . bears no rancour. 'I don't know if she taught him to inject. 'It looks . that way, but it doesn't really matter. If it hadn't been her, it would . have been someone else. Now I just think it's so bloody sad.' His interest in the subject of addiction . led to his involvement in a Channel 4 project called Addicts' Symphony, . for which he worked for several months with drug and alcohol addicts who . used to be musicians. James, pictured with his wife Annie and daughter Daisy at their home in Norfolk in 2011, works with addicts who were formerly musicians . It's a harrowing programme, with some of the most talented souls possible opening up about how they lost almost everything to addiction. James acts partly as musical director, partly as counsellor as, assisted by members of the London Symphony Orchestra, they're tasked with working together to write and perform their own composition. It's challenging, emotional and stressful – and not all of them see the project through to the end. James says Freddy was the inspiration for the programme. 'He was curious about the idea of music as an addiction therapy. I remember him saying once, ""I wonder if music could be a way to recovery.""' James picked the world of classical music partly because he wanted to show that 'addiction isn't confined to rock bands and film stars. Ordinary middle-class people have it as well.' Peaches was found dead in April this year at her home in Wrotham, Kent. She had 3mg per litre of diamorphine, the chemical name for heroin, in her blood . Mr McConnel said he was initially annoyed that Peaches, pictured left with her husband Thomas Cohen, and right, had tried to cover her own back so soon after Freddy's death - but he now realises she was 'going through hell' It seems Freddy was riddled with insecurity from an early age, even though he was a high-achiever. 'Freddy was beyond bright – he was brilliant. But he never liked himself. I remember he didn't like looking in the mirror when he was two, which was so strange. As he got older he had very little self-esteem. He never thought he was loved, even though he was adored – it's extraordinary how many people came to his funeral.' Freddy had his first cigarette at nine, on holiday in France when he sneaked off with a friend; his first drink, a Bacardi Breezer, stolen from his au pair's fridge, not long after. By the time he was 14 he was experimenting with LSD and the stimulant drug mephedrone. Heroin followed. James says he and his ex-wife Annie (they split up in 2006, just as Freddy was slipping into torment) 'tried everything' to help. In 2008 they sent him to a 'tough love' rehab camp in America. Later, they watched helpless as he was sectioned and admitted to the Priory hospital in London. Did James blame himself for what happened? 'Non-stop. I can't tell you how many times I've beaten myself up for all the things I could have done better, or differently.' To hurl himself into a project that stirred up all the old emotions must have been hard. 'Yes, but it's better to confront them than bury them.' He says seeing the participants make music together at the end of a painful process was 'the most uplifting thing imaginable. These were people getting their lives back, and proving it's possible to do so.' Only for some, sadly. Addicts' Symphony will be shown on Thursday 28 August at 11pm on Channel 4.","James lost his 'brilliant, beautiful' son Freddy to the drug overdose in 2011 .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . For party-going Prince Harry, his 30th birthday party was always going to be a night to remember. And the Duchess of Cambridge is planning an event he will likely never forget by turning one room of Kensington Palace into a nightclub with the help of Guy Pelly - the owner of London hotspot Tonteria. However the guest list may raise a few eyebrows, as Kate is believed to have invited two of Harry's ex-girlfriends, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy, to the celebration on September 15. And once there they may well bump into  Camilla Thurlow, who the Prince was spotted kissing last month, as she is also thought to have been invited. Prince Harry is said to be relaxed about the thought of two of his ex-girlfriends being invited to his 30th birthday party on September 15 which is being organised by the Duchess of Cambridge and old friend Guy Pelly . Cressida Bonas, 25, who split from Prince Harry in April this year, and Chelsy Davy, 28, who dated the prince on-and-off between 2004 and 2010, are both said to be invited to his 30th birthday . According to the Daily Mirror, Prince Harry has no problem with seeing Cressida, 25, or Chelsy, 28, at his birthday bash as he has remained firm friends with both. Harry split from Cressida in April this year shortly after attending his first official engagement with her. At the time a friend said that the split was 'amicable' and that they would be keeping in touch. Chelsy, a Zimbabwean landowner's daughter, and Harry dated on-off for six years between 2004 and 2010 before she decided a Royal life was 'not for me', and the two parted ways. Also believed to be on the guest list is Camilla Thurlow, 25, a former Miss Edinburgh who Harry was spotted 'in a clinch' with last month . Kate and Mr Pelly, 32, are said to be inviting a cocktail mixologist and sexy dancers along to the palace to complete their nightclub theme. Mr Pelly has plenty of experince organising high-end parties. His current nightclub in Sloane Square features latex-clad dancers, £28,000 bottles of champagne, and a toy train suspended from the ceiling which delivers tequila shots to tables. Prince Harry is said to be a regular visitor, getting in through a secret entrance from Sloane Square Hotel to void the press, and was once spotted at the club on three occasions in one week. In fact it was at Tonteria, in July this year, that Harry was spotted 'in a clinch' with Miss Thurlow, 25, a former Miss Edinburgh who is also thought to be invited to his birthday party. The pair apparently had 'a few drinks' and kissed in front of friends at the Mexican bar, though friends played down the relationship, saying it was just a case of two young people having fun. The pair met through the Halo Trust, where Miss Thurlow works as a project officer in Siem Reap, Cambodia. The Trust is a mine clearance charity with which Diana, Princess of Wales, was heavily involved. The charity, which conducts humanitarian landmine clearance and ordnance disposal operations, was made famous by Diana in 1997 when she visited a minefield in Angola. The prince himself later become a patron of the charity, but left in March this year. Mr Pelly's other clubs also include Mahiki, another favourite of both Prince Harry and Prince William, Whisky Mist and the controversial Public. Guy was originally William’s friend as they are the same age and met in 2001 when both were junior members of the Beaufort Hunt. William and Kate will host Harry's 30th birthday at Kensington Palace (pictured) on September 15 . Guy Pelly, 32, who owns Sloane Square club Tonteria (pictured), is helping Kate to organise the 'nightclub' theme and is thought to be bringing sexy dancers and a cocktail mixologist to the palace . However Stowe-educated Pelly, whose sculptor mother Vanda is a member of the Tate & Lyle sugar dynasty, soon became close to Harry. While he was known for a time as a trouble-maker among the Royal household, he is now thought of as a third brother. While the party he is organising for Harry was initially supposed to be a secret, it is thought Harry is now aware of the plans and very happy with who will be attending. While the party will likely be lavish, Harry himself has said he does not want birthday gifts and has instead asked for donations to his Walking With The Wounded charity.","Prince Harry said to be relaxed about two  ex-girlfriends attending birthday .

"By . Associated Press . and Ashley Collman for MailOnline . The parents of a murdered New Hampshire teen confronted her killer in court on Thursday, holding up a picture of their dead daughter as they stared down the murderer who was sentenced to life in prison. Seth Mazzaglia, 31, received the maximum sentence for the killing of 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott, of Westborough, Massachusetts. He looked emotionless as a slew of Lizzi's family members spoke. Mazzaglia previously tried to get out of appearing at Thursday's hearing, telling parents over the phone that he didn't want to have to listen to her family 'b**** and moan about what a monster I am'. In June, Mazzaglia was convicted of first-degree murder and other charges. The key witness was Mazzaglia's ex-girlfriend, Kathryn McDonough, who testified that she lured Marriott to their apartment as a sexual offering for her domineering boyfriend. No forgiveness: The mother of murdered 19-year-old Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott, Melissa Marriott (left), confronted her daughter's killer Seth Mazzaglia (right) in court today as he was sentenced to life in prison . Too young: Lizzi was just 19 years old in October 2012 when she was murdered by Mazzaglia for refusing his sexual advances. Pictured above flanked by her parents . Confrontation: Bob Marriott holds a large photo of his daughter of his daughter and lookst at Seth Mazzaglia during sentencing on Thursday . McDonough testified that she lured Marriott over to the apartment she shared with Mazzaglia as an offering to her S&M-loving boyfriend.  But when Marriott declined the invitation of rough sex with Mazzaglia, he strangled her from behind with a rope and then raped her lifeless body. The pair then threw Marriott's body in a river. It's never been found. McDonough is serving 1 1/2 to 3 years in prison for hindering prosecution. Marriot's mother, Melissa Marriott, told Mazzaglia before the sentence was announced, 'I want you to know that I unequivocally hate you.' She continued in a firm voice: 'You are a cowardly, despicable person. You stole our smart, vivacious, beautiful daughter from us. You murdered Lizzi, raped her lifeless body and then threw her away because Lizzi had the self-confidence and the self-esteem to say no to you.' Mazzaglia spoke briefly, saying he didn't kill Marriott but he was sorry for the family's loss. 'I did not rape and murder Elizabeth Marriott,' he said. 'However, I do understand the Marriott family's pain and I did play a part in covering up her death, a mistake I tried to correct when investigators came to me and I showed them exactly where I left Lizzi's body. 'Unfortunately, they were unable to recover her and for that I am truly sorry. My heart goes out to the Marriot family and I am very sorry for their loss.' Wasn't me: In his statement in court on Thursday, Mazzaglia maintained that he was innocent and did not kill Lizzi Marriott . Just before he was sentenced, Mazzaglia's mother, Heather Mazzaglia, asked if she could speak with the Marriotts. She went into the conference room used by prosecutors and gave Bob Marriott an extended hug while sobbing. She gave him a folded note and told an Associated Press reporter upon exiting that she told him 'only that I'm sorry.' She also hugged Elizabeth's brother, Robert Marriott Jr., who went with his father into the room. She also asked to speak with Melissa Marriott but Bob Marriott shook his head. Mazzaglia's ex-girlfriend Kathryn McDonough (left) was the star witness of the case, testifying that she lured her friend Lizzi (right) to the apartment for a threesome that took a violent turn when her boyfriend murdered her . Also addressing Mazzaglia were Marriott's grandparents, father, girlfriend and other relatives and friends. At least eight of the jurors who convicted Mazzaglia also were in attendance. On an easel, a large portrait of a beaming Elizabeth Marriott holding out a frog in the palm of her hands was tilted toward Mazzaglia. His parents were also in court, separated from Marriott's relatives and friends by a table where a court security officer sat. McDonough initially told investigators that Marriott died while the two women were engaged in consensual rough sex. Granted immunity from prosecution, she later said Mazzaglia strangled Marriott after she twice rebuffed him.

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . and Associated Press . A pay-it-forward chain at a Florida Starbucks ended when a man opted not to buy the coffee of the person behind him in the drive-through line. Peter Schorsch, customer number 458, ordered two Venti Mocha Frappuccinos and was told that one of his drinks had been paid for by the previous customer and asked if he'd like to do the same for the next customer. Schorsch declined, saying he felt the phenomenon was a marketing ploy for the company and no longer a spontaneous act of kindness when the barista asks the customer to pay it forward. Break in the chain: Peter Schorsch didn't 'pay it forward' because he didn't want to be part of what he felt was a marketing ploy by Starbucks . 'I just don’t want to be forced into doing something,” Schorsch told ABC News. 'This is turning into a social phenomenon and I had to put an end to it.' He had heard about a 'pay it forward' streak at the same Starbucks the previous day that ended on customer 359. Schorsch didn't end the chain to be stingy, he said, adding that he tipped the barista $100. 'This is turning into something ridiculous and cheesy,' Schorsch told ABC. 'It just seems like a ""first World"" problem to me. Middle-class people sitting in their cars at a drive-thru, sipping a $5 drink and worrying about someone breaking the ranks.' A woman started the act of kindness chain that lasted for hours at the Starbucks drive-thru on Thursday. She ordered an iced coffee around 7 a.m. Thursday in St. Petersburg and asked to pay for the caramel macchiato for the stranger in the car behind her. 'First world problems': Schorsch thinks that if people really want to be charitable, helping the homeless would be more useful than paying for people's coffee in a drive-through queue . He returned the favor. The chain kept going as employees began keeping count. The chain finally ended around 6 p.m. when customer number 379 pulled up and ordered a regular coffee. Barista Vu Nguyen leaned out the window and explained the chain that started earlier in the day, asking if she'd like to participate. She declined, saying she only wanted to pay for her coffee. Nguyen says he doesn't believe she understood the concept of paying it forward. But Schorsch certainly did.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Punk rocker Henry Rollins has slammed Robin Williams for killing himself - and revealed he has 'a little bit of disdain' for everyone who has taken their own life. In a scathing column for LA Weekly that has sparked backlash online, the former Black Flag singer said he didn't understand why the comic would want to traumatize his three adult children. 'How in the hell could you possibly do that to your children?' he wrote. 'I don't care how well adjusted your kid might be - choosing to kill yourself, rather than to be there for that child, is every shade of awful, traumatic and confusing.' He added: 'I think as soon as you have children, you waive your right to take your own life.' Scroll down for video . No sympathy: In an opinion piece, punk rocker Henry Rollins, left, called Robin Williams selfish for killing himself and leaving his three children behind. The opinion has been slammed by fans on social media . In the piece, which also praises Williams for his acting skills and his work with the troops, Rollins said that he lost respect for people - either friends or well-known faces - after they killed themselves. 'I have many records, books and films featuring people who have taken their own lives, and I regard them all with a bit of disdain,' he wrote. 'They have nullified their existence because they willfully removed themselves from life.' He added: 'Almost 40,000 people a year kill themselves in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In my opinion, that is 40,000 people who blew it.' Williams, 63, had suffered from depression and addiction years before taking his life on August 11. Before his death, he had also been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Following the suicide, fans around the world mourned the loss of the comedy great, who won an Academy Award for his role in Good Will Hunting. Unsurprisingly, some of the fans had words for Rollins after his article appeared online. 'Whatever the opposite of a ""think piece"" is, Henry Rollins just wrote it,' comedian Josh Weinstein wrote on Twitter. Left behind: Williams poses with sons Cody and Zack, then-wife Marsha and daughter Zelda at a screening in 2004. In his piece, Rollins said having children meant Williams had 'waived his right to take his own life' Attack: People took to social media to lambast the article for being judgmental and unsympathetic . Writer Patrick Verel added: 'Still kind of stunned at the lack of empathy from @henryrollins whose opinions I’ve always held in high regard.' Rollins' opinion piece follows anger at Kiss bassist Gene Simmons for his similar lack of sympathy. 'Drug addicts and alcoholics are always, ""the world is a harsh place"".

Gong Tseng, 30, had been holding his cousin Cui Meng, 29, hostage at knifepoint after a family dispute broke out in the city Chongqing, in southern China. Police managed to persuade Tseng to release Meng after a two-hour standoff, but when he turned the knives on himself the crowd lost patience. Scroll down for video . Gong Tseng, 30, got into a two-hour standoff with police while holding a knife to his cousin Cui Meng's throat . According to police the pair got into a family dispute before Tseng pulled a knife and took his cousin hostage . One spectator shouted: 'Come on, we're fed up with waiting,' while another added: 'Get on with it, we don't have all day.' Tseng eventually dropped the knife and was arrested for taking a hostage and causing GBH. Earlier Meng, who was dressed in white, could be seen making a frantic call from his mobile phone while he was being held. 'The man who seized me is my cousin and I was calling our grandfather to make him let me go,' he explained later. Police manged to persuade Tsen to let his cousin go, but he then held the knives up to his own throat . As officers convinced Tseng to give up the crowd began shouting 'get on with it' and 'we haven't got all day' Suicide attempts in large Chinese cities are often seen as a nuisance because they are viewed as a display rather than a genuine attempt . Suicide rates in China were once among the highest in the world, but have been falling in recent years as wealth and access to education have increased. However suicides in heavily populated urban areas are becoming increasingly common and are viewed as a frustration by many as they often lead to busy transport networks being closed. The fact that many of are performed publicly and in dramatic fashion has also lead people to believe that many of them are stunts, rather than genuine attempts. Officers eventually persuaded Tseng to give up and he was arrested for taking a hostage and GBH .","Gong Tseng, 30, took cousin Cui Meng, 29, hostage during a family dispute .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Germany is suing one of Switzerland's largest banks for millions of Euros that went missing during the reunification of East and West Germany. Bank Julius Bar has confirmed it is being sued for 91million Euros (£65million) by Berlin over claims a lender it took over allowed money to be withdrawn illegally. Germany claims that Rudolfine Steindling, who was the head of East German trading company Novum from 1973, stashed charges levied against West German firms in Swiss bank accounts. Julius Bar, one of Switzerland's largest banks, is being sued by Germany for 91million Euros it claims were illegally withdrawn as the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 . After the Berlin wall fell in 1989, Germany claims Steindling withdrew cash she had no right to, and says the Swiss banks did nothing to stop her. The German lawsuit claims that Cantrade, a bank bought by Julius Bar in 2005, was one of the banks invloved, according toThe Local. Spokesman Jan Vonder Mühll said shareholders had been told of the lawsuit in its last earnings report, adding: 'The bank denies the claim and has taken measures to protect its interests.' Vonder Muhll insisted that Switzerland's largest bank UBS, which sold Cantrade to Julius Bar, is responsible for answering the lawsuit. Rudolfine Steindling, a communist in charge of an East German trading company, stashed charges levied against West German firms in Swiss banks, then withdrew the cash as the Berlin Wall fell (pictured) Since East and West Germany were reunified in 1990, the country has launched dozens of lawsuits in various jurisdictions to try to recover money stashed by the former regime. German lawyers have already successfully sued another Swiss bank, a branch of Bank Austria which is now part of Italy's UniCredit, for 254million Euros ($337million). Steindling, who died in Israel in 2012, never revealed what she had done with the money.","Germany suing Swiss bank over money that went missing as Berlin Wall fell .

"By . Amanda Williams for MailOnline . Russia's answer to high-end supermarket Waitrose has been hit by food sanctions imposed by the Kremlin, banning imports of foreign produce. Affluent shoppers looking to buy Mediterranean tomatoes, Spanish peaches, or Italian fennel at the Azbuka Vkusa chain have been instead met with their home grown - and inferior - counterparts. Earlier this month Russia banned all meat, fish, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports from the United States, the European Union, Norway, Canada, and Australia for one year in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by these countries over Ukraine. Affluent shoppers looking to buy Mediterranean tomatoes, Spanish peaches, or Italian fennel at the Azbuka Vkusa chain have been instead met with their home grown - and inferior - counterparts . The Sunday Times reports that tomatoes from southern Russia are being stocked instead of those usually imported from the Mediterranean, Norwegian salmon has been replaced by Russian smoked trout, and parma ham has also been banned in favour of a Russian meat called tagansky. It was recently reported that the Kremlin has been urging people to eat Siberian reindeer as beef from the West disappears from Russian supermarkets. Schools and hospitals in Chukota - a far-flung region close to Alaska where football tycoon Roman Abramovich was once governor - are to be supplied from local herds to replace American imports. It comes as a McDonald's outlet in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, and a Burger King in Krasnoyarsk, are the latest to be targeted by the Russian authorities in what is seen as punishment for Western sanctions. Tomatoes from southern Russia are being stocked instead of those usually imported from the Mediterranean, Norwegian salmon has been replaced by Russian smoked trout, and parma ham has also been banned in favour of a Russian meat called tagansky . The chains are being hid by inspections over alleged administrative or sanitary abuses, a move widely seen as having political connotations. The Russian government has targeted Western food imports in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions imposed over the Ukraine crisis. This has led to an embargo on meat from the US and EU. As Scottish and American beef vanish from the shelves, TV news reports in Russia are instead strongly promoting the delights of reindeer delicacies from producers across Siberia. 'Reindeer meat is ecologically clean, and that is why neither French foie gras, nor Spanish jambon not any other foreign delicacies can compare with it,' said a Russian TV report trumpeting the benefits of home-grown produce. In the Yamal region of northern Russia, some 70,000 reindeer will be slaughtered this year for venison, reported The Siberian Times .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . It might be barking mad, but a Turkish company has come up with an ingenious way of getting people to recycle AND feed stray animals at the same time. Meet Pugedon - the vending machine where you put the drinks bottles in, and out comes a portion of food for Istanbul's stray dogs and cats to gobble up. The profit made from the recycled bottles covers the cost of the pet food, so the machine works economically, while it is also super eco-friendly, as it runs off solar power. Scroll down for video . Doggie dinner: This Turkish vending machine both encourages recycling and helps feed hungry stray animals . Ameowzing: A stray cat gratefully tucks into the food dispensed at the bottom on the machine . Istanbul has a high number of stray cats and dogs, many of which can go for days without food. It is estimated that there are around 150,000 dogs alone without owners in the city. The station has two insertion holes, one for plastic bottles, metal soda cans and carton containers and one for the water which the plastic bottles may contain. When a plastic bottle or can is dropped into the hole the unit releases some food to the feeding container below, while the water that is poured down the separate hole goes directly to a container below for the animals to drink. Good deeds: Inventor Engin Girgin says the machine kills two bird with one stone, and is economically viable . Engin Girgin, inventor of the machine, told Der Spiegel: 'My primary goal was to make people see that they don't have to spend any money to help stray dogs. And I also wanted to show that people can do good deeds with things they would normally throw away. 'At the same time, of course, I know that we don't give much priority to recycling here in Turkey. In my opinion, this has to change. So I basically killed two birds with one stone.' It is manufactured by industrial company YCN Yucesan group, who usually make steam boilers, but they were keen to buy into Mr Girgin's innovative project. There were fears among residents that these food boxes may lead to parts of the city being flocked with packs of hungry dogs, but that has not been the case, as all dogs have their own territory, which they do not leave for any long time, even for food. The project's success has been noted all round the world. Mr Girgin says that 61 countries have expressed interest in having vending machines of their own, and they are being shipped out to 20 cities outside of Turkey in the near future.","Feral-friendly invention has been introduced in Istanbul city centre .

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . A video showing a pilot's eye view of death defying aeroplane stunts has emerged from the Cameron air show in Missouri, US this year. In the clip we see the pilot performing white knuckle moves as he nosedives back to earth at speed and even flies through flames. Loop-the-loops and spiralling back down to ground level were just two of the stomach-churning tricks the pilots pulled at the event. And the action culminated in a plane flying so low that a motorcyclist could grab a wing to propel him along a runway at breakneck speed. Kyle Franklin, a pilot who performed at the show this month, knows better than anyone that the stunts can be life or death after losing his wife, father and father-in-law on the airfield. He told freejohnnydare.com: 'It's rough. We've paid a high price to stay in this business. But I love to fly and one thing I love more than anything is entertaining. 'The reason we keep doing this is mainly for all of the spectators who come out and see us. I get letters from people telling me I inspired them how to fly - that's the main reason I stay in the air show business. ' Pilot's eye view: Footage from the 2014 Cameron air show reveals the view from the cockpit . Give me a hand: A motorcyclist at the Cameron stunt show grabs on to the wing of an aeroplane . His wife Amanda Franklin, 25, was killed at an air show in 2011 after wing-walking on the plane which was being flown by her husband. When the aircraft's engine stuttered and caught fire during the stunt in Brownsville, Texas, Kyle tried to save his wife who released her safety harness on the wing and got back inside the plane, but she suffered 70 per cent burns when it crash-landed. She spent the next two months fighting for life but later died of her injuries. They pair had been dating since May 2004 after meeting an an air show. They married in 2005, three months after their fathers died in a similarly horrific crash. Bobby Younkin and Jimmy Franklin were good friends and had flown together on numerous occasions. Pilot Kyle Franklin lost his wife Amanda, 25, after a plane crash at an air show in Texas . Before the fateful flight, Amanda said: 'If you live your life in fear that something could go wrong, you're not living your life'. Kyle continues to fly three years after the loss of his wife, father and father-in-law . But on July 10, 2005 at an air show in Canada, the pair – who were flying separate planes – collided with each other and were both killed. Kyle and Amanda’s website explains: ‘Their love rose from the ashes of the plane wreckage and their abilities as an air show act are a testament to the ongoing legacy of a family fated to continue dancing on the wings of airplanes.’","Footage shows white knuckle stunts at Cameron air show in Missouri, US .

"By . Press Association . and Damien Gayle for MailOnline . Give your children their dinner on smaller plates to stop them from getting too fat, a top public official has said. Duncan Selbie, head of Public Health England, warned that unless young people ate less and exercised more millions would suffer from poor health adults. More than a third of schoolchildren in year six now rank as overweight, according to official statistics, and the number of people with diabetes in Britain could treble in the next 20 years, warned Mr Selbie. Scale-busting: A health chief says giving children smaller plates at mealtimes would help to tackle obesity . He told the Daily Telegraph he learned a simple example of how to stop children getting fat from a Manchester mother who had been raised on the idea that one should always clear one's plate. 'The child (her son) was overweight at school, and it was a definite problem,' he said. 'The prescription was that they brought them smaller plates. The child was back on track: he went on to be ahead of the class.' Just last month official figures showed nearly one in 10 four to five-year-olds starting school in England were obese, rising to almost one in five among youngsters getting ready to start secondary. The growing obesity crisis among the nation's children has led to school uniform suppliers stocking XXXXXXXXL trousers with 50 inch waistlines to meet demand. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said this week that their research shows that in the next 15-20 years 50 per cent of the entire UK population will be overweight. He said: 'It really is an an appalling situation we find ourselves in and very disturbing that we are seeing school uniforms going up to waist sizes of 50 inches. 'Unfortunately, a significant amount of adults do not eat properly and this is passed down to their children. 'Something drastic needs to be done to combat this.' 'Adults don't eat properly and pass this on to their children': Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said this week that research shows that in the next 15-20 years 50 per cent of the UK population will be overweight . The Health and Social Care Information Centre said 45.1million prescription items - including insulin, anti-diabetic drugs and monitoring devices for the condition - were handed out to patients in England last year. That is a more than 50 per cent rise on the number prescribed in 2005/6. In a wide-ranging interview Mr Selbie also told the Telegraph minimum pricing for alcohol should be introduced and more fizzy drinks should be made sugar-free. He praised the bans introduced on smoking in public places and in cars with children on board, but added that it is likely smoking in the home in front of children will be looked at next. Referring to the rise in cases of tuberculosis, Mr Selbie said it was because the UK is such an 'open nation'.","Public Health England chief Duncan Selbie gives stark warning to parents .

He studied martial arts to fend off bullies at school and despite developing an enviable physique in later years, he was known as a weedy teenager, cementing himself as an idol for the weak and defenceless everywhere.

The ruthless All Blacks showed exactly why they are the best team in world rugby, by far, hammering Australia 51-20 in a record-breaking rout that delivered a sobering dose of reality to Ewen McKenzie's team. New Zealand, stinging from last week's 12-12 draw in Sydney, dominated every facet of the game to continue an amazing 33-match winning streak against allcomers at their spiritual home. The Wallabies never looked like ending their own 28-year Bledisloe drought in Auckland once the hosts skipped ahead with back-to-back tries on the 30-minute mark for a 21-6 lead.

Lapping up perfect conditions on a fast Eden Park surface, the All Blacks played their energetic, high-tempo game to near perfection for a six-try thumping. For the bulk of the night, the Wallabies' performance was in stark contrast as they struggled to cope with the heat from the world champions. Even two late tries to Israel Folau and Michael Hooper, again Australia's best, couldn't bring a hint of respectability to the scoreline. It was the All Black players under most pressure from last week's draw - their tight-five and playmaker Aaron Cruden - who did the damage. Cruden was at his scheming best, in partnership with dangerous halfback Aaron Smith, and befuddled Australian defenders time and time again.

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . and Reuters . and Associated Press . A hairdresser from South London has become the first Briton known to have travelled to Iraq to fight alongside Kurdish forces against the Islamic State. Mama Kurda of Croydon, South London, runs a hair salon in Clapham. But the 26-year-old is now fighting with the Kurds against the militant group whose savagery has shocked the world. And although he's proud to be British, he says he's ready to kill any of the estimated 500 Britons who have travelled to the region to join the Islamic State insurgency. Scroll down for video . Perfect hair, of course: Mama Kurda has left his job as a hairdresser in Clapham, south west London, to travel to Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region and fight alongside the Peshmerga against the Islamic State insurgency . The UK has been shamed by the recent video circulated by Islamic State that all but shows a militant with a London accent beheading captive American photojournalist James Foley. 'I have to show the world there is a British citizen fighting against them,' Mr Kurda told the Daily Mirror. Mr Kurda was born in the Kurdish region, which extends from Turkey, through Syria and Iraq, and into Iran, but moved to Britain at the age of 15. Since returning to the region three weeks ago to fight alongside the Peshmerga - the self-defence force of Iraq's Kurds - he has taken part in fierce firefights and was among the units that retook the vital Mosul Dam. He told the Mirror's Martin Bagot he believes Islamic State's militants are mostly young, easily brainwashed and go into battle high on drugs. At work at the salon: Mr Kurda was born in the Kurdish region, which extends from Turkey to Iran, but moved to Britain at the age of 15 . 'What I saw from their eyes is they come to be killed 200 per cent because they are brainwashed they will go straight to heaven,' said Mr Kurda. Today Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Iraqi government forces were attempting to recapture two towns in northern Iraq seized by Islamic State in a lighting advance over the past month. The Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. airpower, took one district near the eastern entrance to Jalawla, 70 miles northeast on Baghdad, the site of weeks of clashes, the sources said. Iraqi troops supported by Iraqi fighter planes were advancing towards the nearby town of Saadiya, the security sources said. Both towns are near the Iranian border and the semi-autonomous Kurdish region. It is not known if Mr Kurda was among the units involved in the fighting. But his comments, published today, suggest he would jump at the chance and that he's in for the long haul. 'When I saw my Kurdish brothers and sisters being killed by these terrorists I was angry in my heart. I couldn't stop myself and stay home,' he said. 'People say, 'If you have a British passport why are you doing this? You could get out.' But I am fighting to save people's lives.' The actions of the Peshmerga forces have created a quandary for the West. In Turkey, the Kurdistan People's Party (PKK) fought a 20-year insurgency that saw them labelled a terror group by the international community. Now those same fighters are also crossing the borders into Iraq and Syria where they are now fighting on the same side as the U.S. and its allies, including Turkey. The PKK says it played a decisive role in blunting the militants' sweep through Iraq, which triggered U.S. air strikes to halt their advance, and is now lobbying for an end to its terrorist label. 'This war will continue until we finish off the Islamic State,' said Rojhat, a PKK fighter speaking from a hospital bed in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region in Iraq. Rojhat, 33, was wounded for a third time in the battle to retake the northern Iraqi town of Makhmur from the Islamic State after the militants initially routed the Kurdish autonomous region's Peshmerga. The first two times he was fighting Turkish forces, part of a conflict which killed 40,000 people between its beginnings in 1984 with demands for Kurdish independence from Turkey and a ceasefire in March 2013. His role highlights the challenge the PKK represents for Ankara, which still views it as terrorist but feels seriously threatened by the Islamic State, which has seized dozens of its citizens. Victory: Peshmerga fighters walk across Mosul Dam in northern Iraq yesterday after they managed to retake the strategically important position from Islamic State militants with the help of the U.S. Air Force . Thanks to Rojhat and his comrades-in-arms, residents of Makhmur who fled in terror at an onslaught that threatened Erbil, 40 miles away, are now returning to assess the damage. They have already sprayed over graffiti that reads: 'the Islamic State is here to stay'. 'This is not just about Makhmur: this is about Kurdistan,' said PKK commander Sadiq Goyi, seated beneath a banner of the group's jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan, referring to Kurdish-inhabited land in Syria and Iran as well as Turkey and Iraq. 'Islamic State is a danger to everyone, so we must fight them everywhere'. Enemy's enemy: A Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) fighter in Makhmour, recently retaken from Islamic State . An armed sister group of the PKK - People's Defense Units (YPG) - has carved out an autonomous zone in Syria's northeast, successfully fending off attacks by IS militants who have proclaimed a caliphate straddling the frontier with Iraq. When the militants overran peshmerga positions in northwestern Iraq, YPG fighters crossed over from Syria and evacuated thousands of minority Yazidis left stranded on a mountain with scant food and water. 'The PKK is our hero,' said 26-year-old Hussein, one of hundreds of Yazidis being trained by YPG fighters at several camps inside Syria to fight the Islamic State. PKK commanders say guerrillas have been dispatched to the front line in the cities of Kirkuk and Jalawla as well. They declined to give numbers and fierce fighting makes their statements hard to verify. The wounded guerrilla Rojhat said the PKK was more organised and disciplined than the Peshmerga, and its tactics better suited to fighting Islamic State, even without the kind of military hardware Iraqi Kurds are seeking. 'This is how we fought the Turkish army for years,' Rojhat said. 'War is an act of faith'.","Kurdish-born Mama Kurda runs a hair salon in Clapham, south west London .

In an excerpt from a book about one of the game's most controversial figures, published in The Daily Telegraph, Tandy made allegations about the process of in-house testing. Before his sudden death in April this year, the former NRL player told of the culture of drug taking in the game and the relaxed way drug tests were undertaken before their overhaul this year. Late NRL player Ryan Tandy made explosive claims about drug testing in the game shortly before his death . 'For in-house tests, we were just given the cup at the start of training and expected to hand it back at the end of the day,' Tandy said. This meant anyone could provide the sample. In the book the details of his personal struggle with drug use but also the notorious match-fixing scandal he was involved in will be revealed . He said asking a fellow player to takes the test on your behalf was a common occurrence within the teams and he admitted to getting mates to do it for him many times. The former player also revealed that at one club the players stole testing kits to check if there was anything in their systems before they were asked to take a test by the club. Tandy was a self-confessed drug user, and spoke about his recreational substance use, but the book  - The Penalty - will also tell of the infamous match-fixing of the Bulldogs-Cowboys game back in 2010 which led to him being banned for life from the NRL. Following the 32-year-old's death from a suspected prescription drug overdose there was uncertainty over whether the book would go ahead, and in what is believed to be the late player's last interview he reflected on how the book affected him emotionally. In the epilogue Tandy revealed he was appalled when the tell-all was finished and he looked back at all the things he had done wrong in his life. 'I barely left the house for a week after I finished it the first time. I experienced so many emotions. There was shame. There was sadness. There was humiliation. I wondered what my family and friends would think,' the introduction reads, according to the Daily Telegraph. The 32-year-old died in April of this year in his parents house from a suspected drug overdose . The disgraced player spent time at many different NRL clubs including North Sydney, St George Illawarra, Melbourne Storm, South Sydney Rabbitohs and Wests Tigers before he was sacked from the Bulldogs in 2011. Tandy was found dead at his parents' house in Saratoga, New South Wales in April of a suspected drug overdose. The former journeyman front-rower had been living at his parents' apartment as part of his bail conditions after he was charged with allegedly kidnapping a man on January 16.","Ryan Tandy claimed drug testing in the NRL was not policed .

"By . Erin Clements for MailOnline . One woman has claimed that the military cut her family's pay after her husband cheated on her. Sara Rutledge (a pseudonym) tells HuffPost Live that she discovered just one day after her wedding that her husband was sleeping with the wife of his 'battle buddy.' But the risk of losing the financial benefits offered to military families - such as health insurance, housing allowances and tax breaks - left her ambivalent about whether to tell anyone. Sara Rutledge, a former military wife, says her family's pay was cut after her husband cheated on her . 'When I found out, I had this moral conundrum of: Should I even tell the husband?' she said. 'These are soldiers who have been deployed together multiple times. ... So not only am I risking messing up the . dynamics of this unit that needs to function as one, like an army of one . when they're deployed and working together, but I'm also risking the . financial security of my house because our paycheck was significantly . cut,' Ms Rutledge added, noting that fraternizing with other men's wives . is a punishable offense. Ms Rutledge - who has since divorced - informed her husband's colleague of the infidelity via the internet while on her honeymoon, and he subsequently told their superior officers. When her husband returned from the trip, he admitted to the affair. 'When he did find out, when I did tell everyone, we did lose a significant part of our paycheck,' she said. 'When he did find out, when I did tell everyone, we did lose a significant part of our paycheck' But she says she couldn't keep the infidelity a secret from the man whose wife her husband cheated with. 'I felt like this man who had served our country has a right to know what his wife was doing with the person he considered a close friend,' she said. Ms Rutledge, who was a week shy of her 22nd birthday when she tied the knot, also said that many people in the military get married because of the financial benefits offered. 'It just makes sense. If they were thinking of getting married, they're just like, ""Why don't we go ahead and do it?"" because you can almost double your paycheck. ... So if you're gonna make more and you're already kind of in love, why not get married? I know it sounds terrible, but it's true.' As for the other couple, 'This man and his wife did not receive any punishment,' Ms Rutledge said. 'They are still married, actually.'","Sara Rutledge discovered her husband was sleeping with the wife of his 'battle buddy' 24 hours after she married him .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . and David Kent . An association for football managers has apologised after it appeared to dismiss racist, sexist and homophobic text messages allegedly sent by former Cardiff City coach Malky Mackay as 'friendly banter'. Mackay has been accused of exchanging a series of offensive text messages with his former colleague Iain Moody while they worked at Cardiff City football club and today the identity of a woman agent 'victim' was revealed. After the allegations were revealed by the Daily Mail, the League Managers Association (LMA) - which calls itself the 'voice of football management' - released a statement appearing to play down the scandal. Scroll down for video . Former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay (right) and Iain Moody (left) are accused of sharing racist, sexist and homophobic text messages . Victim: Agent Carly Barnes was discussed in offensive text messages allegedly sent on Iain Moody's phone . The association claimed Mackay 'was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter'. The LMA rowed back on the statement today, apologising for the 'inappropriate' comments, which it admitted have 'been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature'. Mackay and Moody are under investigation over text messages which called South Korean players 'Fkn chinkys', referred to one agent as a 'gay snake' and referred to another female agent's 'falsies'. Today that agent was revealed to be Carly Barnes, an agent and lawyer. She was unavailable for comment. The text exchanges date back to when Mackay and Moody worked as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff City, before both were sacked by club owner Vincent Tan amid claims of over-spending in the transfer market. As the world of football expressed shock at the claims yesterday, the LMA put out a statement appearing to play down the seriousness of the allegations. It said: 'Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. 'These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.' The bizarrely worded statement caused outrage in the world of football, with  the organisation branded 'bumbling dinosaurs'. The FA is investigating Mackay's messages as part of a dossier submitted by Cardiff alleging misconduct . Moody resigned from his latest role as sporting director of Crystal Palace after the allegations became public . Former-England striker Stan Collymore wrote on Twitter: 'Disgraceful. Institutional acceptance of the ""banter"" of casual racism.' Ex-Blackburn striker Jason Roberts tweeted: 'LMA actually wrote this. They are actually being serious! Somebody drafted that... WOW!' Cardiff City FC called for the resignation of LMA chief executive Richard Bevan over the incident. The club stated: 'We find it entirely reprehensible that the LMA should put out a statement which seeks to dismiss deeply offensive racist comments as 'friendly banter'. 'If that is the view held by the LMA, as appears from its statement, we consider that Richard Bevan's position is untenable and we call for his resignation.' After widespread anger at the response, the organisation hastily apologised today, insisting it is completely against discrimination. They stated today: 'The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention.' But for some in the game, the apology came too late. Troy Townsend, the education and development manager for Kick It Out, said: 'I wish this was the statement they (the LMA) had prepared yesterday. 'Does today undo the damage from yesterday? I don't think it does. It is welcome but yesterday will stick in people's minds. I wish (the LMA) had taken a step back and said ""this would have been more appropriate in the first place"".' The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC. In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete. The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise. Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC. Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter. Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others. Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter. The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention. It is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory, even used in private, are totally unacceptable. The LMA remains absolutely aware of our responsibility to the game and to promote and uphold the highest standards of behaviour. The LMA will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to Malky Mackay whilst The FA conducts its investigation, other than to repeat that both the LMA and Malky will be cooperating fully. We will continue to work with all of the game's stakeholders to address the important issues of respect and discriminatory behaviour in all its forms.","Former Cardiff manager mired in scandal over offensive text messages .

"By . Associated Press . and Damien Gayle for MailOnline . A 24-year-old Japanese businessman is under investigation after he fathered at least 16 babies with surrogate mothers in Thailand. Mitsutoki Shigeta is at the heart of a multinational probe by Interpol after nine of this children were discovered in a 'baby factory' in an upmarket district of Bangkok. Police raiding the flat found the nine babies living with nine paid nannies in a few rooms furnished only with bouncy chairs and play pens, and packed with baby bottles and nappies. They have since identified Mr Shigeta as the father of seven other babies. Scroll down for video . Baby father: Thai police display pictures of surrogate babies born to a Japanese man who is at the centre of a surrogacy scandal during a press conference at the police headquarters in Chonburi, Thailand . 'What I can tell you so far is that I've never seen a case like this,' said police Major General Apichart Suribunya, director of Interpol in Thailand. 'We are trying to understand what kind of person makes this many babies.' Maj Gen Apichart said Interpol offices in Japan, Cambodia, Hong Kong and India have been asked to probe Mr Shigeta's background. Police say he appears to have registered businesses or apartments in those countries and has frequently travelled there. No charges have been brought against him. Police Lieutenant General Kokiat Wongvorachart, Thailand's lead investigator in the case, said he and his colleagues were looking into two motives: 'One is human trafficking and the other is exploitation of children.' 'I've never seen a case like this': Maj. Gen. Apichart Suribunya, head of Interpol in Thailand, said they were trying to understand Mitsutoki Shigeta's motive . He said Mr Shigeta made 41 trips to Thailand since 2010. On many occasions he travelled to nearby Cambodia, where he took four of his babies. In the meantime, Mr Shigeta is trying to get his children back. The 12 in Thailand are being cared for by social services - and he has proven through DNA samples sent from Japan that he is their biological father. He quickly left Thailand after the August 5 raid on the flat and has said through a lawyer that he simply wanted a large family and has the means to support it. Mr Kokiat said Mr Shigeta hired 11 Thai surrogate mothers to carry his children, including four sets of twins. Police have not determined the biological mothers. 'As soon as they got pregnant, he requested more,' said Mariam Kukunashvili of the New Life clinic, which operates in Thailand and six other countries. 'He said he wanted 10 to 15 babies a year, and that he wanted to continue the baby-making process until he's dead,' she said, adding that he had also inquired about equipment to freeze his sperm. As for Mr Shigeta's motives, she said he told the clinic's manager that 'he wanted to win elections and could use his big family for voting,' and that 'the best thing I can do for the world is to leave many children'. The father of 16 surrogate babies discovered by police in Thailand invested money in a mobile app to monitor the movements of your children. Mitsutoki Shigeta is understood to have a 4 per cent stake in Hamburg-based Familonet, whose technology automatically alerts parents about the movements of their children. The South China Morning Post reported that Familonet has since taken down photos of Mr Shigeta from its Facebook page and said it had 'initiated precautionary actions to suspend him as an investor.' Ms Kukunashvili is based at her company's headquarters in Georgia, and said she never met Mr Shigeta but received reports from her Thai staff. She said she sent faxes in English and French in April last year to Interpol's head office in Lyon, France, and an email through the agency's website, but they went unanswered. Maj Gen Apichart said his office in Thailand never saw the warnings. She also sent Mr Shigeta an email to express suspicion, and lawyer Ratpratan Tulatorn responded on his behalf in an August 31 2013 email. The lawyer said Mr Shigeta was involved in 'no dishonesty, no illegal activities'. He said his client hoped to keep using New Life, but the company then stopped working with him. Mr Shigeta's activities remained discreet until early this month, when an Australian couple was accused of abandoning a baby with his Thai surrogate mother - but taking his twin sister - after learning the boy had Down's Syndrome. Though the couple disputes the allegation, the case prompted a crackdown by Thai authorities on what had been a largely unregulated industry. Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua poses with baby Gammy at the Samitivej Hospital in Bangkok: David and Wendy Farnell have made international headlines for abandoning the disabled infant . After the Australian case emerged, police received a tip that prompted the raid on Mr Shigeta's Bangkok flat. Mr Ratpratan appeared during the raid to insist that Mr Shigeta had done nothing wrong. 'These are legal babies, they all have birth certificates,' he told Thailand's Channel 3 television station. 'There are assets purchased under these babies' names. There are savings accounts for these babies, and investments. If he were to sell these babies, why would he give them these benefits?' He is no longer Mr Shigeta's lawyer, and his replacement has not responded to requests for comment. Mr Shigeta's current whereabouts are unknown.","Mitsuoki Shigeta has confirmed paternity of 12 babies in Thailand .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Despite rising skin cancer rates, the number of American teens using sunscreen has dropped by almost 12per cent - from 67per cent to 56per cent - in the space of a decade, according to a new report. In addition, the number of teens - predominantly white females - using indoor tanning beds only fell slightly (eight per cent) in that time-frame; suggesting that awareness campaigns which warn of the links between cancer and UV exposure are falling on deaf ears. The report, conducted by the William Paterson University in Wayne, New Jersey, looked at data between 2001 and 2011, and was published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New report: The number of American teens using sunscreen dropped by almost 12per cent between 2001 and 2011, and nearly 30per cent of teens admit they use tanning beds, most of them white females . The study's lead author, professor Corey Basch told CBS: 'Since UV exposure is such a major component in causing skin cancer, using sun protective behaviors like applying sunblock and avoiding intentional exposure to tanning devices will be key. 'Future prevention efforts definitely need to be focused at young people.' Skin cancer is America's most common type of cancer. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, five million people are treated for it each year, with cases of melanomas - the deadliest form - increasing by 1.6per cent in men and 1.4per cent in women between 2001 and 2010. Crunching the numbers: This graph shows the prevalence (per cent) of sunscreen use among a nationally representative sample of high school students, 2001 - 2011 . Tanning beds in particular have been linked to higher incidences of melanomas, and despite ever-increasing warnings and regulations, 29.3per cent of U.S. teens admitted to using them in 2011; only a slight improvement on the 37.4per cent who did so in 2009. 'It's still in vogue to have that suntanned color,' said dermatologist Dr Jeanine Daly of the North Shore-LIJ Health System in Manhasset, New York. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, and the leading cause of death from skin disease.The exact cause isn't clear, but exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning beds increases your risk of developing melanoma.It may begin in a mole (skin melanoma), but can also begin in other pigmented tissues, such as in the eye or in the intestines. 'No matter how hard we've been trying to get that message out, we need to keep at it and work harder.' Ms Daly advises teens - and adults alike - to use zinc-containing sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays; both of which are known to cause cancer. She added: 'The most important thing to remember about sunscreen is that it doesn't last very long. Sunscreen needs to be applied every two hours.' This report follows hot on the heels of another, publicized by the U.S. surgeon general, Rear Adm. Boris Lushniak last month. He cited an alarming 200per cent jump in deadly melanoma cases since 1973, and said state and local officials need to do more to help people cover up. Schools, he suggested, should encourage kids and teens to wear hats and sunscreen, and schedule outdoor activities when the sun is low in the sky. Additionally, rules surrounding tanning beds should be tightened. 'We need more states and institutions on board with these policies that discourage or restrict indoor tanning by our youth,' Mr Lushniak said. 'Tanned skin is damaged skin.'","The number of American teens using sunscreen dropped by 12per cent between 2001 and 2011 .

A police spokesman said Friday that the Oregon State medical examiner's office has determined that 43-year-old Derek Rieth died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The death has been ruled a suicide. Officers found Rieth's body Wednesday night when they conducted a welfare check on behalf of someone who was concerned after not hearing from him for several hours. Found dead: Derek Rieth, a longtime member of jazz outfit Pink Martini, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his home in Portland, police said Friday .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In September 2013 Nasa announced they were pretty sure that Voyager 1, the most distant man-made spacecraft from Earth, had passed into interstellar space. And now that finding has been confirmed, thanks to a ‘tsunami wave’ of radiation from the sun. The wave vibrated particles in the spacecraft’s vicinity and allowed scientists to calculate that the probe was in a different region of the universe to our own solar system. Nasa has confirmed that Voyager 1, illustrated here, has successfully entered interstellar space. Data from the spacecraft in September 2013 suggested that it had done so almost a year earlier in August 2012 but the finding has only just been confirmed thanks to an ejection from the sun . Voyager 1 launched in 1977 and has been making its way out of the solar system ever since. Along the way it made numerous discoveries and observations at various locations including Jupiter and Saturn. It is 37 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from Earth has flown before. Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings -- the mission was extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. Having passed the outermost planets it is now the furthest man-made object from Earth and continues to send back data as it becomes the first spacecraft ever to enter interstellar space. The recent confirmation that it was in interstellar space was made by observing the effects ‘bubbles’ from the sun had on Voyager 1’s surroundings. The bubbles originate as waves known as coronal mass ejections from the sun, huge outpourings of energy that often accompany a solar flare. These waves are what led scientists to the conclusion, in the fall of 2013, that Voyager 1 had indeed left our sun's bubble, entering a new frontier. As they move out from the sun they create the bubbles of radiation and since 2012 three of these bubbles had been observed, but this latest one confirms the earlier findings. ‘Normally, interstellar space is like a quiet lake,’ said Ed Stone of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, the mission's project scientist since 1972. ‘But when our sun has a burst, it sends a shock wave outward that reaches Voyager about a year later. ‘The wave causes the plasma surrounding the spacecraft to sing.’ One cause of contention from Voyager 1 is that there have been repeated announcements that it has 'entered interstellar space', with several false alarms, which has become somewhat of a running joke among astronomers. However, Professor Martin Barstow, President of the Royal Astronomical Society and Professor of Astrophysics and Space Science at the University of Leicester, explains to MailOnline why this is so. 'I worked on Voyager 1's cruise science in the 1980s and 90s and I think it is a remarkable mission, still going almost 40 years after its launch in 1977,' he says. 'It is interesting that Nasa keeps renouncing [it has entered interstellar space], but that is because it’s really hard to be sure. 'The boundary between the solar system and interstellar space is not very sharp, or obvious, but is complicated. It also moves as solar activity varies. 'It’s quite likely that the boundary has moved backwards and forwards past the spacecraft over the last few years as we have gone from solar minimum to solar maximum, where we are now.' Voyager 1 became the furthest man-made object from Earth in the 1990s when it overtook the slower deep-space probes Pioneer 10 and 11 that had been launched previously. It will remain operational until about 2025, at which point it will be adrift in space. It will take 17,500 years for Voyager 1 to travel one light year . Data from this newest tsunami wave generated by the sun confirms that Voyager is in a region between the stars filled with a thin soup of charged particles, also known as plasma. The mission has not left the solar system, though, as it has yet to reach a final halo of comets surrounding our sun known as the Oort Cloud. Announcements of Voyager 1 entering interstellar space are a running joke for astronomers (shown), as there have been many 'false alarms' before - but this seems to be the real deal . But it has broken through a wind-blown magnetic bubble, or heliosphere, that encases the solar system. 'All is not quiet around Voyager,' said Don Gurnett of the University of Iowa, Iowa City, the principal investigator of the plasma wave instrument on Voyager, which collected the definitive evidence that Voyager 1 had left the sun's heliosphere. 'We're excited to analyze these new data. So far, we can say that it confirms we are in interstellar space.' So, how do scientists know that Voyager 1 is now in interstellar space? It's due to our sun going through periods of increased activity, where it explosively ejects material from its surface, flinging it outward. These events, called coronal mass ejections, generate shock, or pressure, waves. Three such waves have reached Voyager 1 since it entered interstellar space in August 2012. The first was too small to be noticed when it occurred and was only discovered later, but the second was clearly registered by the spacecraft's cosmic ray instrument in March of 2013. Cosmic rays are energetic charged particles that come from nearby stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The sun's shock waves push these particles around like buoys in a tsunami. Data from the cosmic ray instrument tell researchers that a shock wave from the sun has hit. Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched 16 days apart in 1977. Both spacecraft flew by Jupiter and Saturn (illustrated here). Voyager 2 also flew by Uranus and Neptune. Voyager 2, launched before Voyager 1 but on a slower trajectory, will also enter interstellar space in a few years . Meanwhile, another instrument on Voyager registers the shock waves, too. The plasma wave instrument can detect oscillations of the plasma electrons. 'We live in a dynamic solar system, with the atmosphere of our Sun interacting with the planets and galactic cosmic winds,' Kelvin Long, Executive Director of the Initiative for Interstellar Studies, tells MailOnline. 'The definition of the solar system boundary is not yet well characterised, and this is mainly due to the very low level of space probe reconnaissance we have done of the outer solar system; namely the Voyagers and Pioneers. 'To better characterise the extent of our solar system it is clear therefore that we need more reconnaissance and exploration and also to obtain better measurements of the interstellar medium. 'These are clear science goals for future missions.' 'The tsunami wave rings the plasma like a bell,' said Stone. 'While the plasma wave instrument lets us measure the frequency of this ringing, the cosmic ray instrument reveals what struck the bell - the shock wave from the sun.' This ringing of the plasma bell is what led to the key evidence showing Voyager had entered interstellar space. Because denser plasma oscillates faster, the team was able to figure out the density of the plasma. In 2013, thanks to the second tsunami wave, the team acquired evidence that Voyager had been flying for more than a year through plasma that was 40 times denser than measured before - a telltale indicator of interstellar space. Why is it denser out there? The sun's winds blow a bubble around it, pushing out against denser matter from other stars. Now, the team has new readings from a third wave from the sun, first registered in March of this year. These data show that the density of the plasma is similar to what was measured previously, confirming the spacecraft is in interstellar space. And thanks to the sun's rumblings, Voyager has the opportunity to listen to the singing of interstellar space - an otherwise silent place.","Nasa researchers in California say Voyager 1 is in interstellar space .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . An audio recording has emerged of the moment the driver of the derailed train which caused the Lac-Megantic train disaster was told it was his vehicle at fault. The recorded phone conversations between train driver Tom Harding and a dispatcher referred to only as RJ show how the driver had no idea it was his train which has rolled off the tracks and exploded in the Quebec town. When the news is broken to him you can hear Harding shout: 'She was f***ing secure. F***!' before adding: 'Oh, Jesus Christ….How in the f*** did that thing f***ing roll down, RJ?' Scroll down for audio . Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude oil after derailing in downtown Lac-Megantic, Quebec . The train, which was carrying 72 carloads of volatile oil from North Dakota, had been parked on a railway line for the night when it derailed, hurtled down an incline and slammed into downtown Lac-Megantic on July 6 last year. Several train cars exploded and 40 buildings were levelled. Parts of the town were evacuated in the early hours of the morning as fireballs shot high into the sky, flames spread to nearby homes and thick acrid smoke filled the air. The audio recording, obtained by CBC Radio-Canada, also shows how it was Harding who initially alerted railway company Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railways to the disaster, before he realised his involvement. He told the dispatcher: 'Everything is on fire - from the church all the way down to the Metro, from the river all the way to the railway tracks. From what I can see, RJ, the box cars have all burnt in the yard - the ties, everything. Whatever is in the yard, rolling stock, is now gone - completely.' Searchers dig through the rubble for victims of the inferno in the explosions, which killed 47 people last July . The accident resulted in 47 of the town's residents being burnt to death, and lawsuits have been brought against the now bankrupt company. The weak safety culture at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railways and poor government oversight were among the many factors that led to the oil train explosion, Canada's Transportation Safety Board said in a new report released on Tuesday. TSB chair Wendy Tadros said 18 factors played a role, including a rail company that cut corners and a Canadian regulator that didn't do proper safety audits. 'We now know why the situation developed over time,' Tadros told a news conference in Lac-Megantic. 'A weak safety culture at MMA, poor training of employees, tank cars that didn't offer enough protection.' A worker walks near the railway track on the site of the train wreck on July 16 last year . Driver Tom Harding had no idea it was his train which had derailed when he called the dispatcher that night . The TSB, which is responsible for investigating rail, air and marine accidents, blamed another government agency, Transport Canada, for failing in its oversight duties. 'And then Transport Canada didn't audit railways often enough and thoroughly enough to know how those companies were really managing, or not managing, risk,' Tadros said. TSB chief operating officer Jean Laporte called Montreal, Maine & Atlantic's operations 'dubious' and said the railway chose to limit the speed on certain routes instead of improving its equipment. 'People only did the bare minimum to get the job done rather than always following the rules,' Laporte said. In May, the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Canada Co. and three of its employees, including Harding, were charged by Quebec prosecutors with 47 counts of criminal negligence causing death. Class-action lawsuits are pending. The crash, the worst railway accident in Canada in nearly 150 years, prompted intense public pressure to make oil trains safer. Canada's transport minister said in April that the type of tankers involved in the disaster must be retired or retrofitted within three years because they are prone to rupturing. *1.47am: Tom Harding (TH) calls RJ* .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . Keegan Eggenton, 19, went into cardiac arrest after he chocked on a biscuit at his home in Essex . A mother kept her son alive for twelve minutes using chest compressions after his heart stopped when he choked on a biscuit. Debbie Eggenton thought 19-year-old Keegan was dying when he went into cardiac arrest at their home in Westcliff, Essex. She jumped out of bed and began pumping on his chest until paramedics arrived and used a defibrillator to restart his heart. Mrs Eggenton said: ‘The first thing I knew, Keegan’s girlfriend came in and said she had tried to wake him up and couldn’t get a response. ‘I jumped out of bed and ran into his room and started screaming. ‘His girlfriend called the ambulance service, who said put him on the floor and start CPR. ‘I’d never done it before so I copied what I had seen on TV. ‘I was shouting “1, 2, 3, 4,” as I pushed on his chest while my husband talked in his ear. ‘All of a sudden the police arrived and I heard a voice in my ear: “Would you like me to take over.” ‘I was thinking he was dead and I collapsed on the floor, then I went to the kitchen and threw up in the sink.’ Paramedics and a doctor arrived quickly and praised the teenager’s parents. Aaron Hughes, one of the paramedics who was reunited with Mr Eggenton as he thanked the team for bringing him back to life, said: ‘It was a really scary situation for the family and they managed admirably. ‘It shows the importance of knowing CPR and just pushing hard and fast on the chest is the most effective thing you can do as it keeps the heart pumping. ‘He was out for more than 10 minutes, he’s had an amazing recovery and it’s great to see him fit and well.’ Mr Eggenton, who works with his father Jim, 48, at Open Wood Face Facades, in Wickford, Essex, woke up a day and a half later in Southend Hospital and remembers nothing of the incident. He said: ‘My parents’ actions were superb. They both said they hadn’t been through an ordeal like that before. ‘They did what they did so quickly and so professionally in a situation where the adrenaline takes control - it’s out of this world. ‘There are no words to describe what they did.’ During his three-week stay in hospital, doctors discovered one half of his heart is bigger than the other and a blood vessel is in the wrong position. Mr Eggenton has since made a full recovery. Ex-footballer and Hollywood star Vinnie Jones starred in a famous NHS advert urging people to use ‘hands-only’ CPR two years ago. The team that saved his life: (From left to right) Mother Debbie Eggenton, brother Ryan, paramedic Mark Rowley, Keegan (centre), paramedics Aaron Hughes and Georgia Statham, his other brother Shane and father Jim .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A United Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing after two passengers fought over a device that stopped a seat reclining. One woman passenger on the flight threw water at a man seated behind her who used the $21.95 Knee Defender device to stop her reclining her seat on the four-hour flight from Newark to Denver. The pilot made an emergency landing in Chicago on Sunday where the two passengers, both 48, were arrested. The Federal Aviation Administration leaves it up to individual airlines to set rules about the controversial devices. Controversial: The Knee Defender consists of two plastic locks that are clipped onto the arms of a tray table (pictured) that prevents the person in front from reclining. The gadget caused a flight on a United Airlines flight this week . Locked and loaded: Most airlines prohibit the use the of the Knee Defender, the male passenger allegedly used one so he could continue working on his laptop . Tiny: The Knee Defender, which is about the size of a house key, retails for about $19.95, but is banned by all major American airlines . United Airlines said it prohibits use of the device, like all major U.S. airlines. Spirit Airlines and . Allegiant Air take the reclining mechanisms out of their seats, leaving them permanently upright. The dispute on United Flight 1462 from Newark, New Jersey to Denver escalated to the point where the airline decided to divert to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, according to Transportation Security Administration spokesman Ross Feinstein. Chicago Police and TSA officers met the flight, spoke to the passengers and 'deemed it a customer service issue', Feinstein said. The TSA would not name the passengers. The plane then continued to Denver without them, arriving 1 hour and 38 minutes late, according to the airline's website. The Federal Aviation Administration can impose a civil fine of up to $25,000 for passengers who are unruly. In this case, no arrest was made, according to airport spokesman Gregg Cunningham. The fight started when the male passenger, seated in a middle seat of row 12, used the Knee Defender to stop the woman in front of him from reclining while he was on his laptop, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak. Emergency landing: United Flight 1462 from Newark, New Jersey to Denver had to make an emergency landing in Chicago, causing the flight to be one hour and 38 minutes late to its final destination . A flight attendant asked him to remove the device and he refused. The woman then stood up, turned around and threw a cup of water at him, the official says. That's when United decided to land in Chicago. The two passengers were not allowed to continue to Denver. Both passengers were sitting in United's Economy Plus section, the part of the plane that has four more inches of legroom than the rest of coach.","Incident occurred Sunday in United Airlines Flight 1462 from Newark to Denver .

"By . John Hall for MailOnline . Libya has revealed it needs urgent foreign help defeat Islamists in the country, as U.S. officials admitted they were 'caught off guard' by airstrikes carried out by the UAE. Using bases in Egypt, Emirati warplanes secretly bombed targets in the Libyan capital Tripoli after the country's Islamist dominated General National Congress named a rival premier early last week. A senior U.S. official was quoted as saying the America had not known anything about the airstrikes, in what appears to be a dramatic escalation in direct action by regional Arab states that have previously fought proxy wars in Libya. Attack: Emirati warplanes (pictured) secretly bombed targets in the Libyan capital Tripoli after the country's Islamist dominated General National Congress named a rival premier early last week . Rebel: An Islamist fighter from the Fajr Libya (Libyan Dawn) coalition flashes the V sign for victory at the entrance of Tripoli international airport on Sunday . As turmoil in Libya appeared to deepen, U.S. officials said jets from the United Arab Emirates' had launched two attacks in seven days on Islamists in Tripoli. An Emirati official refused to comment on the allegations, saying only that his country had 'no reaction' to the report. The air strikes signal a step towards direct action by regional Arab states that previously have fought proxy wars in Libya, Syria and Iraq in a struggle for power and influence. The bombing raids were first reported by The New York Times, and Islamist forces in Libya had also alleged the strikes had taken place. 'The UAE carried out those strikes,' one American official said on condition of anonymity. When asked about the New York Times' account, another official added 'the report is accurate'. Both officials admitted that the U.S. did not play any part in the airstrikes, but refused to say whether Washington had been deliberately left in the dark about Egypt and the UAE's involvement. However, speaking to the BBC another senior official reportedly said America was caught 'off-guard' by the strikes, because it had not been consulted in any way about the possibility of military action. Defending the territory: Libya Dawn militants sit in a truck mounted with anti-aircraft guns at the gate of Tripoli International Airport . Divide: Libya's General National FCongress - officially replaced earlier this month by a freshly elected parliament - selected pro-Islamist Omar al-Hassi (picturted) to form a 'salvation government' The first strikes, on Monday last week, . focused on militia targets in Tripoli - including a small weapons depot, . according to the New York Times. A second round south of the city early Saturday targeted rocket launchers, military vehicles and a warehouse. Those strikes may have been a bid to . prevent the capture of the airport, but the Islamist militia forces . eventually prevailed anyway. The UAE - which has spent billions . on U.S.-made warplanes and advanced weaponry - provided the military . aircraft, aerial refuelling planes and crews to bomb Libya, while Cairo . offered access to its air bases, it was reported. Egypt has not publicly . acknowledged any role in the air strikes. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates view Islamist militants as a serious threat to the region and have cooperated against what they see as a common danger. News of the raids came after Libya's Islamist-dominated General National Congress threw down the gauntlet to the interim government by naming a premier-designate to form a rival administration. Destruction: The Emirati airstrikes may have been a bid to prevent the capture of Tripoli airport, but the Islamist militia forces eventually prevailed anyway . The GNC, officially replaced earlier this month by a freshly elected parliament, selected pro-Islamist Omar al-Hassi to form a 'salvation government', a spokesman said. 'The GNC dismissed [interim premier] Abdullah al-Thani as head of government and gave Omar al-Hassi a week to form a salvation government,' Omar Ahmidan told journalists in Tripoli. At the same time, Libya's new army chief Abdel Razzak Nadhuri declared 'war on terrorists' after parliament -  holed up 1,000 miles east of Tripoli in Tobruk - nominated him to tackle the unrest. The GNC meeting, for its part, gave its backing to 'legitimate moves aimed at liberating the country,' Ahmidan said of the weekend capture of Tripoli airport by the Islamist coalition. The airport seizure came after weeks of fighting between Islamists and the nationalist militia of Zintan in the west, which had controlled it since the overthrow in 2011 of long-time dictator Colonel Gaddafi. The GNC - whose re-emergence plunges . Libya's rocky political transition into fresh crisis - met following a . request from the Islamists, who accused parliament of complicity in last . week's air raids. Thani has subsequenty rejected the GNC's decisions, branding the meeting 'illegal' and saying 'the only legislative body is parliament' during a televised news conference in Tobruk. He also said Islamist militants had ransacked and torched his house in Tripoli last week. Conflict zone: A damaged aircraft is pictured after shelling at Tripoli International Airport  over the weekend . Telling of 'threats, thefts and looting' in the capital, Thani said 'no public service can operate in these conditions.' Parliament, elected in June, and Thani's government decamped to Tobruk after the army proved unable to restore law and order to Tripoli and Benghazi - Libya's two largest cities. Fajr Libya, which translates as Libyan Dawn is a coalition of Islamist militias, mainly from Misrata, east of Tripoli. The Ansar al-Sharia militant group, meanwhile, controls around 80 per cent of the city of Benghazi. This morning Fajr Libya dismissed a call from Ansar al-Sharia for the two groups to unite under one banner, saying it rejects 'terrorism and extremism'. But in a statement published by LANA news agency, it also accused parliament of violating constitutional legitimacy by calling for foreign intervention to solve the chaos gripping Libya. The United States and its European allies yesterday strongly condemned the 'escalation of fighting and violence' in Libya, calling for a democratic transition.","Emirati warplanes secretly bombed Islamist targets in Libya's capital Tripoli .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . and Associated Press . Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell has moved out of his home and is living with a priest at a rectory instead, he has revealed during his corruption trial. McDonnell left the home he shared with his wife of 38 years, Maureen, the week before their trial began, he revealed as he testified extensively about their troubled relationship on Thursday. He said that although he only recently left the home, he concluded that his marriage was over in September 2011 after he became angry and exhausted at the relationship. The couple both stand accused of accepting more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his company's dietary supplements. Family troubles: Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell  arrives at court with his daughter Cailin Young on Thursday, when he detailed the extent of his marital woes with wife Maureen during their corruption trial . But the McDonnells say their marriage was broken and that they were barely speaking, let alone engaged in a criminal conspiracy. On Thursday, the former governor testified that he had written a long email to his wife three years ago trying to save his marriage, calling her his 'soulmate' - yet he also said he grew so weary of her yelling that he began taking refuge in his office late at night rather than go home. McDonnell choked up at various times and became particularly emotional as he described writing to his wife on Labor Day 2011, after she had rejected his efforts to spend the weekend together. 'I was heartbroken,' he said, and worried 'that this was maybe the end of my marriage'. He began the email 'I love you' but said the weekend 'was one of the lowest points of my life'. 'You tell me all the time how bad your life has been with me,' he wrote. In the spotlight: Former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell arrives at court with her attorney William Burck in Richmond, Virginia on Thursday as her - now estranged - husband took the stand in his defense . He apologized for being absent, but said, 'I am completely at a loss at the anger and... that has become more frequent and... exhausted,' he wrote. Maureen McDonnell never responded, he testified. He explained that he later moved into the rectory because he couldn't face going back to his wife every day after the trial. Meanwhile, he said he learned while preparing for the trial that she had been in contact with Williams four different times that day. At first, he thought they shared a natural bond over dietary supplements - Maureen McDonnell had sold nutritional supplement for decades as a part-time business. She was crushed when he told her it would be inappropriate to continue selling vitamins as first lady, he said. McDonnell testified that he doesn't believe his wife had an affair with Williams, but that they had developed an intense, emotional connection to which he had been oblivious. At the center: They are accused of accepting more than $165,000 from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams, pictured earlier this month, in exchange for promoting his company's dietary supplements . Close: McDonnell said he did not believe his wife Maureen had an affair with Williams, both pictured, but that he had realized her connection with the businessman had been much deeper than he thought . The former governor's lawyers have argued McDonnell did nothing more for Williams than he would for any other Virginia businessman. McDonnell said in April 2011, he told his wife they should start entertaining one or two couples at a time for dinner for the sake of 'some sense of normalcy'. Maureen suggested inviting Williams and his wife, Celeste. 'We were friendly,' he said. 'I wouldn't say at that point we were yet friends.' He said his daughter Cailin dropped by, and the topic of her upcoming wedding came up. A couple of weeks later, McDonnell said he learned Williams wanted to give Cailin a wedding gift — $15,000 to cover catering costs. 'I had to think about it,' McDonnell said. Ultimately, he concluded that it was a gift to his daughter, so it was OK. The check is one of the gifts prosecutors said the McDonnells received and failed to disclose. According to previous testimony and evidence, Bob McDonnell had signed the catering contract and made two payments, and a refund check from the catering company was made out to Maureen McDonnell. High life: Images show the gifts they allegedly enjoyed from Williams, including borrowing his Ferrari. The businessman claimed Maureen had asked him if they could use it as they stayed at his summer house . McDonnell also testified that he often heard Maureen McDonnell yelling at her assistants, usually over little things. He told her she shouldn't treat governor's mansion employees so badly. 'She would yell at me, say I was taking the staff's side and I didn't know what was going on over there,' McDonnell said. The tension at the governor's mansion and his futile attempts to smooth it over hurt his marriage, which was already strained by his frequent absences and his wife's struggle with her public role as first lady, McDonnell said. McDonnell said that early in his career, he devoted time to being a state legislator, Army Reservist and lawyer in private practice.He said his wife resented his long stretches away from the family and the tension escalated as his political career took off. Things got worse when the family moved from their longtime Virginia Beach home to Richmond after he became attorney general in 2006.","McDonnell testified about his troubled marriage to wife Maureen at length during their public corruption trial on Thursday .

The Department of Public Safety said in a news release that Lance Cpl. R.S.

Montgomery said he was returning home to Greenwood when pulled over for exceeding the speed limit . Montgomery was arrested and spent a . night in jail after Salter clocked him going 89 mph in a 55 mph zone. But the trooper's dashboard camera obtained soon after by The Associated . Press also captured the officer threatening to use a Taser because the . 6-foot-3, 262-pound lineman was struggling to understand his commands. 'The next thing you're going to get is the Taser,' Salter was heard to say on the tape. 'Whoa,' Montgomery responded, 'I'm not trying to cause problems.' Montgomery . said he was returning home to Greenwood when pulled over. He played . football for Greenwood High, then spent three seasons at LSU where he . had 19 career sacks and helped the Tigers to the 2011 national . championship game won by Alabama. Montgomery . was selected by Houston in the third round of the 2013 draft. However, . he was inactive for the Texans' first seven games and waived by the club . last October. Oakland signed him to the practice squad in December. Montgomery signed with Cincinnati as a free agent in April. At . the time of the incident, agency spokeswoman Sherri Iacobelli said in a . statement the department expects troopers treat the public with . courtesy and respect. When . Montgomery's arrest was brought to the agency's attention, 'we began a . review of the traffic stop and self-initiated an internal . investigation,' Iacobelli says. Salter . was suspended soon after the stop while the agency investigated. The . department's Office of Professional Responsibility found Salter's . behavior was unprofessional and comments to Montgomery during the arrest . were inappropriate, according to a release sent by agency . communications director Sherri Iacobelli. Montgomery's ticket was dismissed by a judge in July when Salter did not show up for traffic court in Laurens. The . agency said Salter's interactions with Montgomery were 'inconsistent . with how he was trained to conduct a traffic stop.' Its release said . Salter's command, 'NFL, you are under arrest,' to Montgomery could be . seen as suggesting that he was being arrested because of his status as a . pro football player. Salter also deviated . from protocol when he immediately arrested Montgomery without telling . him why he was stopped, the agency said. The agency said Salter's interactions with Montgomery were 'inconsistent with how he was trained to conduct a traffic stop' The . department's statement said Salter's comments to Montgomery on the ride . to the detention center were inappropriate at times, including when he . said, 'we can pull that (seat belt) across you tight and lock it, and we . make it a very uncomfortable ride to jail.' The . department said that Salter's assertion to Montgomery that at 25 mph . over the speed limit, 'you get arrested,' was a misrepresentation of . facts because its investigation showed Salter arrested some violators . and not others in similar circumstances. The agency said Salter was disciplined previously for unprofessional conduct and making inappropriate comments. 'These violations demonstrate behavior that is inconsistent' with agency standards, the department said. The Associated Press attempted to reach Salter for comment. Two phone numbers listed for him have been disconnected.

"By . Francesca Chambers . Congress' do-nothing strategy has become a source of 'great frustration' for many Americans, Former White House Senior Adviser David Plouffe said today, arguing that too often Washington puts off solving the nation's problems because the solutions are politically unpopular. 'You're not sent here to occupy the darn office,' he declared. Honing in on Tea Party Republicans, Plouffe criticized conservatives for bragging about their status as Washington outsiders. '""Oh I'm [on] the outside. I'm sleeping on my couch,""' he said, imitating them. 'The thing they fear more than anything else is going home.' Great Frustration: David Plouffe, former White House Senior Adviser, said today that Americans are tired of Congress 'kicking cans down the field' instead of providing long-term solutions to the nation's problems. Plouffe is pictured here during an appearance on Meet the Press in 2012 . 'And you gotta have people who are here to say, ""Nope. For the time I'm here, whether it's bad politics, good politics, you know, I'm gonna try to get some things moving on the Hill."" ' Plouffe said the 2010 healthcare reform legislation was an example of Democrats putting their political futures on the line to solve an important problem. 'Whether it be a family, a business, a church, a school, you can't just kick problems down the field. You gotta deal with them,' Plouffe said. The Democratic operative criticized House Republicans for the way they 'just go out of town' without coming up with a 'real solution' to problems like they did last week with immigration. 'There's great frustration that the things that are broadly supported by the American people, that would help the economy, we just kick the can down the field.' Congress is currently in recess, and lawmakers are not scheduled to return to work until September. Both the House and the Senate left town without agreeing to legislation to provide emergency funding to the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies for illegal immigration efforts. White House backed legislation died in the Senate on Thursday night and the House did not pass a bill until Friday night after Senators had already returned home. The GOP-led House's bill would only have kept the agencies funded for the next several months. As a result, President Barack Obama said he would veto the legislation even if the Senate did pass it, killing all chances of the bill becoming law, regardless of whether the upper chamber had stuck around until the House was finished voting. Congress currently has an average approval rating of 12.3 percent, according to polling website Real Clear Politics. Christie Comeback: Plouffe named New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as one of the GOP's most viable 2016 presidential candidates. Christie, who chairs the Republican Governor's Association, spent the latter part of last week in First in the Nation presidential voting state New Hampshire. He was there campaigning for the state's Republican candidate for Governor . Plouffe made his remarks disparaging Congress at a luncheon in Washington, D.C. this afternoon hosted by Politico. Asked about what it would mean for President Obama if Republicans win a majority of seats in the U.S. Senate in November - as they're increasingly predicted to do - Plouffe said it would depend on how the GOP decides to govern. 'If they take control of the Senate and all they want to do is investigate and go off on these witch hunts like Benghazi, it's bad for the Republican Party and the country,' he said. Speaking about Republicans' odds at retaking the White House in 2016, the 2008 Obama campaign manager said New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush are among the most viable general election candidates, though he doesn't thank any 2016 hopefuls on the right have what he thinks it takes to win.

A 23-year-old woman working as an intern at the Museum of Modern Art has been declared brain dead after falling from a Manhattan rooftop during a going-away party. Cindy Yeh was attending a party at a friend's apartment on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village when she danced too close to the edge of the roof and fell off early Sunday morning. Yeh was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where she was tragically declared brain dead. Seriously injured: Cindy Yeh, 23, was pronounced brain dead Sunday after taking a fall from a Manhattan rooftop in the middle of a going-away party . According to the New York Post, Yeh was attending a party on the roof for three roommates who were moving out of the building. This apartment on Sullivan Street (above) in Manhattan's Greenwich Village was the site of a rooftop party early Sunday morning . It was around 1:10am when she was dancing close to the edge of the roof, lost her footing, and fell four stories down. A resident was out for a walk with his wife when he saw the accident unfurl. 'It was like she tumbled down and smashed down in front of the building,' the 25-year-old resident told the Post. 'Her friends ran out of the door screaming. A guy held her and yelled out ""She's still breathing"" 'Another guy was crying and punching a car, and then we saw two girls crying while calling 911,' he said.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . Doctors working in emergency rooms across the U.S. are being warned to watch for overdoses tied to a new drug that can be up to 15 times more potent - acetyl fentanyl . Doctors working in emergency rooms across the U.S. are being warned to watch for overdoses tied to a new drug that can be up to 15 times more potent - acetyl fentanyl. Scientists have said medics can expect 'an upswing in what on the surface appear to be heroin overdoses', but that are actually caused by the new opitate. The drug - a relative of the powerful prescription painkiller, fentanyl - is being mixed into street drugs marketed as heroin. Scientist John Stogner, from the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of North Carolina, said: 'What's frightening about this emerging street drug is that users themselves may not be aware that they are ingesting it. 'A patient may report heroin use and have symptoms consistent with heroin overdose, but an emergency physician may find that the standard dose of antidote - naloxone - doesn't work. 'Larger or additional doses are necessary when acetyl fentanyl is responsible. 'It's never good to lose time between overdose and treatment.' Acetyl fentanyl is an opiate analgesic, with no recognised medical use. It is five to 15 times stronger than heroin and users typically use it intravenously as a direct substitute for heroin or pharmaceutical-grade opiods, though many are unaware that what they are consuming is not plain heroin. A user who injects pure acetyl fentanyl may suffer severe consquences because of its extraordinary potency, experts warn. Acetyl fentanyl is not specifically regulated in the U.S., existing in a legal grey area. It is classified as illicit for human consumption but if a package is labeled 'not for human consumption', the product is technically legal. 'Clever and well-informed drug distribution networks will likely take advantage of the legal loophole and profit by replacing or cutting a highly-regulated drug with this less regulated one,' said Dr. Stogner. 'One of the many downsides of illegal drugs is you just can't trust your drug dealer. 'The trend of adulterants being worked into street drugs to make them more potent is dangerous. 'The significant potential for overdose of acetyl fentanyl necessitates more medical research and policy reform.' Scientist John Stogner, from the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology at the University of North Carolina, said: 'What's frightening about this emerging street drug is that users themselves may not be aware that they are ingesting it.' The drug is commonly mixed with heroin and marketed as the better-known drug .","New drug is acetyl fentanyl is being mixed with heroin and sold on the streets in the U.S.

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . A mother tricked her local community and even her husband into believing her 5-year-old daughter was dying of terminal cancer and raised over $1,000 in the process. Leatha Kaye Slauson of Atlantic, Iowa was arrested this week after local authorities discovered her 5-year-old daughter Riley wasn't actually dying of colorectal cancer. The 30-year-old mother-of-five started spreading the lie back in September 2013, shaving little Riley's head and even medicating her with unnecessary cannabis oil. Con: Leatha Kaye Slauson (left) convinced her family and local community that her 5-year-old daughter Riley (right) was dying of cancer. Local authorities discovered this week that little Riley was not suffering from any terminal illness . The local community rallied around the Riley, raising money and even paying for the family's trip to Walt Disney World. The ruse was brought to light last week when administrators at Riley's school started looking into what special care she might need and realized inconsistencies with the mother's story. Slauson first started the story last fall, and even went on television in the spring to talk about her daughter's so-called bucket list. Plenty of time: In April, local firefighters invited Riley to tour their station and take a ride in the truck as part of her 'bucket list' Firefighter-obsessed Riley was brought into the local station to ride around in a fire truck for a day, and her mother talked to local reporters about her daughter's 'illness'. '(The cancer) is just spreading too fast,' Slauson told KETV back in April. 'It spread to her liver and the last MRI (showed) it spread to her lymph nodes and they stopped chemotherapy.' It also appears Slauson medicated Riley with unnecessary cannabis oil, and even posted a picture of the girl on her Facebook, sucking at an oral syringe commonly used to dispense the drug. The little girl subsequently tested positive for THC. Drugs: Slauson has also been charged for medicating Riley with unnecessary cannabis oil. She posted this picture of the little girl sucking on an oral syringe to Facebook. Oral syringes are commonly used to dispense cannabis oil . Local authorities held a press conference On Friday after Slauson's arrest and said it appears she was the only person involved in the crime, saying her husband and four other children were convinced of the ruse as well. They wouldn't say the total funds Slauson conned from the community, but it's thought to be over $1,000. Those funds have since been frozen, but a GoFundMe page still exists online for donations as of Saturday. Authorities are now asking community members to stop sending money to the fake charity. 'I don't think the hearts of this community will he hardened by this,' local Police Chief Steve Green said. Following Slauson's arrest, Riley and her four other children are being cared for by their father. Cass County Attorney Dan Gesitner says the father is 'struggling with how to proceed in his life'. Slauson faces charges of child endangerment and distribution of drugs to a child under 18. The Atlantic Police Department, Cass County Sheriff's Office, Cass County Attorney and Iowa Department of Human Services are investigating. Paid for: Authorities haven't released a full total of the funds Slauson solicited under the guise of charity.

Scroll down for video . Appeal: In a campaign video released today, Mrs Obama warns the upcoming mid-terms will be even tougher than her husband's two presidential wins . She says: 'When it comes to the midterm elections this November, we need you to be as passionate and as hungry as you were in 2008 and 2012. 'In fact, you need to be even more passionate and more hungry to get Democrats elected to Congress because these elections will be even hard and even closer than those presidential elections. 'we're talking about races that are won and lost by just a few thousand votes or even a few hundred votes.' Concerns: The First Lady insists her husband has been working 'so hard' on issues such as equal pay for women, immigration reform and raising the minimum wage .

Mrs Obama raises several key issues . including equal pay for women, immigration reform, raising the minimum . wage and 'ensuring that women can make their own decisions about their . bodies and their health care'. President Obama is said to have played 81 rounds of golf since the 2012 election . She adds: 'My husband is working so hard on all these issues but he needs leaders in Congress who will work with him, leaders who care about what's going on in your lives and who will fight for you every single day.' Barack Obama, has faced widespread criticism in the press after it was alleged that he has played 81 rounds of golf since re-election – as many as he played in his entire first term. He is said to have holed himself up in Washington where he attends fundraisers and dinners with celebrities rather than tackling the day-to-day business of congressional politics. It has also been reported he has been spending a significant amount of time house hunting and has looked at buying a luxury £2.5 million mansion in a California compound dubbed the ‘Playground of the Presidents’. The President is already seen as a lame duck due to the current deadlock on Capitol Hill and he could lose power entirely if the Republicans take control of the Senate as is widely expected. He has long faced criticism that he has not dirtied his hands with the day-to-day business of Congressional politics and that this has contributed to the rancour which nearly brought about a government shutdown last year. If the Republicans did take the Senate they would redouble their attempts to repeal his health care reform, the President’s signature piece of domestic legislation.","Footage recorded to launch the Democratic Congressional Campaign .

An eleven-year-old boy who died when he fell from a newly-installed zipwire at a children's adventure attraction had not been secured into his safety harness properly, an inquest heard yesterday. Bailey Sumner, of Blackpool, died when he plunged from the 475ft-long Swampflyer ride at the award-winning GreenWood Forest Park near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, in April 2011. An inquest jury at Dolgellau heard a carabiner clip, normally used by climbers, was connected to a 'false loop' in the safety attachment. Giving evidence, Stephen Bristow, managing director of the site, said it should have been spotted by staff during the pre-launch checks. 'The training required them to be absolutely rigorous about what they were doing,' he said. Bailey died at Gwynedd Hospital, Bangor. 'What we want to know is how he came to die,' coroner Nicola Jones told the eight jurors. 'This isn't a court that deals with any issues of blame. Nobody is on trial here.' The inquest is due to last three days. Pathologist Dr Anthony Caslin said Bailey died after suffering a brain injury due to a fractured skull following a fall from a height. Mr Bristow said it had been decided to install a zipwire in November 2010. He did some research and sought advice about the type of safety harness to provide. The SwampFlyer ride had been open just a week before the fatal accident . Bailey died from head injuries after he fell at the GreenWood Forest Park near Caernarfon, Gwynedd . The Swampflyer opened on April 17, 2011, a week before the accident. It was taken down immediately afterwards. 'I didn't want it to remain there,' he said.'It was a symbol of tragedy.' He said he didn't foresee, nor had he been warned, about the risk of a false loop. He had taken professional guidance before opening the ride. Mr Bristow said the park used a voluntary Heath and Safety Executive-approved scheme of safety inspections. An expert passed the zipwire to open.

Mr Bristow said it wasn't a legal requirement to have an inspection. 'We get the best advice we can find,' he said. He said there was 'top-quality equipment' and staff were trained to check it. The coroner said the delay in holding an inquest was because of the investigation by the police and Crown Prosecution Service.

"By . Liz  Hull . A coroner has called for permanent zip-wires to be regulated after Bailey Sumner (above), 11, died in a fall from one at a children's adventure park . A coroner yesterday called for tighter regulation of leisure zip-wires after a boy of 11 fell to his death from one at a children’s adventure park. Bailey Sumner plunged 30ft from a 500ft-long ride because he had been wrongly attached to his harness by a poorly-trained member of staff, an inquest heard. The Swampflyer at GreenWood Forest Park, near Caernarvon, north Wales, had been open just a week when the accident happened on Easter Sunday two years ago. Bailey, who had been visiting the park with his parents and sister Jessica, suffered a fractured skull and died in hospital from his injuries. Police investigated but prosecutors decided to take no further action against the park. However, officials from Gwynedd council last night confirmed its inquiry into ‘possible regulatory breaches’ was continuing. The ride has been dismantled. Yesterday North Wales coroner Nicola Jones, sitting at Dolgellau magistrates court, expressed concern that anyone could set up a zip-wire without licence or regulation. ‘There’s no statutory or other regulation of permanent zipwires,’ Mrs Jones said. ‘They are something of a boom industry, they seem to be cropping up everywhere. Anyone of us could set up our own permanent zipwire without a licence and the safety being checked. The lack of guidance (from the authorities) played a significant part in how Bailey has come to die.’ She said she would be writing to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and other agencies demanding action be taken to prevent a similar tragedy. The jury was read a statement from park ‘ranger’ Sion Hughes, 23, who clipped Bailey on to the thrill-seeking ride. Mr Hughes, who had been employed for just a few days, said he felt staff had been ‘inadequately’ trained and that he had too much responsibility. ‘My heart stopped whenever someone stepped off (the platform), it was nerve wracking,’ he said. But he failed to raise his concerns with his boss or the park owner. Bailey, of Blackpool, plunged from the new 475ft-long Swampflyer ride at the award-winning GreenWood Forest Park near Caernarvon, Gwynedd, in north-west Wales during Easter in April 2011 (file picture) The court was told that Mr Hughes watched Bailey on the wire for a short distance before turning round to assist the next rider. He then heard a ‘loud thump’. Mr Hughes suggested Bailey, from Blackpool, might have tampered with his harness, causing him to fall. But HSE inspector Louise Robinson said that was ‘highly unlikely’. Colleague Dave Riley said human error was the most likely explanation. The mistake – which occurred because the youngster was wrongly attached to a ‘false loop’ in a rope lanyard dangling from the cable – should have been spotted during the pre-launch checks, Stephen Bristow, managing director of the park, said. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The Swampflyer opened on April 17, 2011, a week before the tragedy. Following the incident, it was dismantled .","Bailey Sumner plunged from Swampflyer ride at GreenWood Forest Park near Caernarvon, north Wales, in 2011 .

"By . Tania Steere . It is considerably more expensive than your average 99 ice cream … but it could leave you fizzing with delight. The world’s first champagne ice lolly has gone on sale in Britain. Priced at a not-so-cool £5 each, the push-up lolly, called Pops Classic, contains 37 per cent champagne and has only 100 calories. Scroll down for video . Bubble up: The world's first Champagne ice lollies, which have gone on sale at £5 a pop... The luxurious treat is said to already be a hit with celebrities such as Kate Moss and Miley Cyrus and is being sold at events and festivals around the UK. The lolly’s makers will also deliver boxes of 24 – yours for a mere £100 – and they are in talks with Selfridges to stock it in department stores. Each lolly contains approximately half a unit of alcohol – the equivalent to around half a glass of champagne. Old school friends James Rae and Harry Clarke created Pops after coming up with the idea on holiday last summer. Mr Clarke said: ‘We were in Majorca and we were attending a lot of the day parties. We spotted a gap in the market for an alcoholic product that was more refreshing than a drink and could keep you cool.’ The luxurious treat, on sale at festivals around the UK, is said to already be a hit with celebrities such as Kate Moss and Miley Cyrus, and they can be bought in bulk for the bargain price of £100 for 24, right . And you may need something to help you beat the heat this week as parts of the South-East are forecast to be as warm as the South of France. London is expected to hit 27C (81F), while in other areas of the South and in the Midlands the mercury is set to peak in the mid-20s. For today, though, an umbrella may be more useful than an ice lolly as heavy rain is forecast. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for the South-East, which is predicted to experience heavy downpours today. This rain front should disperse by this evening.

But when one group of unruly fugitives were tracked down, the arresting officer found himself helpless against their charms. PC Mark Wallace was driving home when he stumbled upon a litter of nine runaway puppies in the village of Seend in Wiltshire. Scroll down for video . The puppies were running amok on the side of the road before PC Wallace bundled them into his car . With no owner in sight, the 45-year-old decided to round the animals up and take them to safety. But his plans were soon thrown out, as for every dog that he could get in the car, another one jumped from the vehicle. Eventually, PC Wallace resorted to depositing the puppies through the car's windows to keep them all rounded up. His trouble didn't end there however, with the animals clambering across the dashboard and licking his ear as he drove them to a nearby police station. 'It was the best day I've ever had in my 24-year career,' said Mr Wallace. 'In this day in age there is a lot of hard work in policing, but this day, well, I was laughing my head off. 'It was absolute chaos. It was so funny.' PC Wallace said it was the best day in his 24-year career as a policeman . Mr Wallace, who has a Jack Russel, was passing through the village after finishing a job in Worton when he saw the dogs running amok on the side of the road. The puppies, a variety of Australian Sheepdogs and Weirmaraners from two different litters, were being chased by another motorist who had stopped to try and catch them. 'It was quite a fast country road and I came round the bend on to the straight and I saw the car - then the puppies - and thought ""what the hell is that?"" 'There was a mass of puppies and this poor woman who had spotted them first, trying to herd them. 'They were wandering all over the road.' After bundling the dogs' mother, an Australian Sheepdog, into the woman's car, PC Wallace tried to get the others into his vehicle. 'The puppies were a bit more difficult to round up. 'As soon as I opened the door to put one in another came out. 'I was having to wind down the window and pop them in one at a time. 'Next thing I knew all the puppies were everywhere - they were on the dash board, on the back window, everywhere. 'I was laughing my head off. They were stepping on the camera buttons and light buttons. It was absolute chaos, but it was so fun. 'I rounded the ones that weren’t sleeping to the back seat and used my letter briefcase to wedge between the seats so that couldn’t come forward. 'But driving back I’ve got one licking my ear, and one trying to climb out of the window.' The puppies were taken to Towbridge Police Station where their panicked owner collected them 20 minutes later. They had escaped through an open door at the house. 'They were so cute. If I’d had room at home, I’d have taken them myself,' added Mr Wallace.","PC Mark Wallace was driving home when he noticed puppies on side of road .

The Hollywood legend wore the red saloon gown when she performed a song as bar singer Kay Weston in the 1954 film River of No Return. She sang One Silver Dollar to drinkers in the bar in one of the opening scenes of the film, set in the Gold Rush era. The dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in this movie poster for River Of No Return is now up for sale at auction . American actress Debbie Reynolds, 82, a contemporary of Marilyn's, bought the dress at a sell-off of costumes by film studio 20th Century Fox in 1971. She sold it in 2000 to a private collector and it has been in their hands ever since. Experts have tipped it to fetch $600,000 - around £360,000 - when it goes under the hammer at Bonhams auction. In contrast, figures released last week showed that in June, the average UK home was worth £265,000. This red dress was made famous by Marilyn when she wore it during the 1954 film The River Of No Return . This isn't the first dress of Marilyn's owned by Debbie to be given such a large price tag - other iconic outfits sold  for even more. In 2011, the white dress that she wore in the 1955 film The Seven Year Itch sold for £2.8m, while a red sequinned dress and headdress that she wore in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes changed hands at the same auction for £900,000. A green velour dress also worn by Marilyn in The River Of No Return, which she wore to sing 'I'm Gonna File My Claim,' sold for £304,000. Actress Debbie Reynolds (pictured) was a prolific collector of Hollywood costumes, but has been forced to sell most of the items recently . Debbie said at the time of the 2011 auction: 'I'm heartbroken. I don't want to see the collection broken up - it should stay intact. 'It's a real shame but that's the way it's going to be.' She was reported to be seen sobbing as she watched the lots go up for sale.","Dress made famous in 1954 when Marilyn wore it to sing One Silver Dollar .

And the nutritionist who sparked Millie's interest in all things green and clean says you too can emulate Millie's lifestyle in a few easy steps. Madeleine Shaw, Millie's best friend and go-to health guru, shared her healthy living tips with FEMAIL and believes that the first port of call is introducing a daily green juice into your diet. Scroll down for video . Health guru: Madeleine Shaw is the nutritionist best friend of Millie Mackintosh and believes that by adding one juice into your daily diet, your body will benefit hugely . While many glossy A-listers embark on gruelling three-day juice cleanses, Madeleine, who was one of Millie and Professor Green's bridesmaids, says that having a juice a day alongside your regular diet can have lots of health benefits. 'Juicing for me is a way of life. It's amazing how all of the goodness contained within a freshly made juice can fuel a workout, beat that afternoon slump or to help you sleep,' she said. 'Freshly made fruit and vegetable juice is packed with nutrients, making it a simple step towards getting your five-a-day.' She does, however, warn that shop bought juices aren't as beneficial. 'If you are always on the go then it may seem like an easy option to grab a bottled juice. However, shop bought juices actually lose many of their nutrients over the course of their long shelf life due to the pasteurisation process. Plus they tend to be fruit-based making their sugar content higher,' she said. Health pals: Millie and Madeleine have been friends for years and it was Madeleine who introduced the former Made In Chelsea star to her healthy way of life . Clean living: Madeleine says it's amazing how all of the goodness contained within a freshly made juice can fuel a workout, beat that afternoon slump or to help you sleep and she's shared seven recipes for achieving optimum health . Madeleine, who is working with Philips on its campaign for real juice, starts the week by bagging up all of the ingredients for each juice she plans to make that week in a zip-lock bag with a label on it. 'When I come to juice I grab the right bag and just put everything through the juicer. I love to have a juice containing beetroot with leaves to cleanse the system before the start of busy week. This has been used for decades to cleanse and support the liver, she said. Her 'classic cleanse' juice is packed with carrots, a beetroot, an apple and two stalks of celery. 'Monday morning means it's a fresh new start. I like to sip on a glowing greens juice for breakfast. This is loaded with silica from the cucumber, which helps the elasticity of the skin. It helps you glow even brighter thanks to the vitamin C in the pear, which fights free radicals to help keep your skin fresh all week long.' Juice is served! Madeleine has teamed up with Philips and launched a campaign for real juice because, she says, shop bought juices actually lose many of their nutrients over the course of their long shelf life due to the pasteurisation process . Before hitting the gym, Madeleine recommends sipping on a carrot juice with beetroot, parsley and ginger. 'It is a great source of beta-carotene, the famous antioxidant that protects against the damaging effects of stress and increases oxygen in the blood, tissues and brain. 'This juice is the perfect pre workout fuel; I find drinking it so beneficial to my workout, it makes me work harder. Having a big meal can make you feel heavy so something lighter works perfectly, try this recipe before starting some exercise,' she said. When the clock hits 4pm, we can often get that mid-afternoon crash and crave sugar but instead of reaching for the biscuit tin, Madeleine recommends whizzing up a juice filled with a handful of spinach, romaine lettuce leaves, cucumber, celery, lemon, apple, ginger and ground cinnamon. 'I always make my 4pm pick-me-up juice and soon feel back to normal without having to reach for an unhealthy snack,' she said. 'This juice has a little dusting of cinnamon which is great for regulating the blood sugar levels reducing that mid-afternoon slump.' Healthy lifestyle: Madeleine, who follows a clean diet, says that Sunday is her prep day when she gets all of her shopping done at the local farmers market . Having trouble sleeping? Avoid the Night Nurse and make yourself a bedtime juice filled with green apple, strawberries, cherries and a cucumber, says Madeleine. 'This juice contains cherries, which contain melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep cycle. I drink it an hour before bed then curl up with a book before I hit the hay,' she said. She continues: 'Approaching the end of the week I often feel like something a little less green, fruitier and with a kick. So, I grab a quarter of a watermelon and make my watermelon juice. This is a total fat buster. The citrulline in watermelon has been shown to reduce the accumulation of fat in our fat cells. Amazing for getting ready for the weekend ahead!

'It is loaded with tomatoes, which contain inflammation fighting lycopene and are seriously hydrating for the body if you've had a heavy Friday night!'

But the beauty pageant, which attracts entrants from as far flung as Dubai and Australia has also long been considered 'twee' and outdated by its critics over on the Emerald Isle. So the news this weekend that the event's latest winner, Boston-born Maria Walsh, 27, is gay has caused shock waves across Ireland. Maria Walsh, 27, was crowned Rose Of Tralee at the competition in County Kerry last Tuesday . Maria, who was raised in County Mayo for 20 years, made the revelation in the Irish Sun On Sunday yesterday and the resulting outpouring of affection from thousands of well-wishers has been enormous. Many are even predicting the announcement will give the Rose Of Tralee pageant a much-needed push into the 21st century. The studio manager, who has already flown back to her current home in Philadelphia took the courageous decision to make her sexuality public in order to help other people in the same situation. She told the newspaper: 'My family and friends have been extremely supportive, my parents were very much about ensuring that their children are healthy and happy. Maria Walsh, 27, newly-crowned Rose of Tralee announced that she is a lesbian at the weekend . 'I'm not ashamed of my sexuality by any means. 'The Rose of Tralee is about celebrating women's intelligence, careers, their volunteer work, the question of sexuality just never came up. 'To me, being gay is normal; it's natural.' The reception to Maria's interview was overwhelmingly positive, with Twitter lighting up with remarks about her inspirational decision. Maria's decision to speak out about her sexuality caused a barrage of positive comments on social networking sites like Twitter . After the announcement yesterday morning, Maria donned a green jersey and headed down to cheer on her Mayo football team at the KerryMayo All Ireland football semi- final in Croke Park, where she was given a hero's welcome. The host of the Rose of Tralee, DÁithÍ Ó Sé has also now spoken out in support of Maria's announcement.

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . Julie Burchill has a knack for raising eyebrows. Despite years of outspoken columns in national newspapers, the writer still now never fails to drop a new tit-bit of information that leaves jaws hanging open - most recently the fact that she was into bondage as a teen. She has admitted this today in her latest job role as an Agony Aunt for the revamped Loaded magazine, after receiving a letter from a man whose wife - hot under the collar from the new Fifty Shades Of Grey film trailer - is demanding they get kinky in the bedroom. Scroll down for video . Julie Burchill (pictured) admits she was into S&M in her late teens . During her reply, Julie, 55, reveals that at just 17 years old, the same time that she started working as a reporter for NME magazine, she also started a relationship with a man who indulged in regular S&M. She said: 'To be perfectly frank, I was into this sort of palaver in a BIG way when I was a girl. 'I was just 17 when I knocked on the door of one of London’s most notorious sadists and suggested that he show me what it was all about. 'My interest in being thrashed lasted into my 30s, whereupon I developed a sense of humour and suddenly couldn’t so much as look at a pair of nipple clamps without howling with laughter.' She continues: 'S&M, like love-bites and Maoism, can look lovely on the young and pretty. But there’s few things funnier than a fat middle- aged fetishist.' Julie then goes on to advise her new pen pal, who is extremely reluctant to get involved in extreme bedrooms antics, to play his wife at her own game by wholeheartedly taking to bondage in one session in an attempt to put her off for life. She said: 'There’s a theory that the reason women are throwing their collective undercrackers at Christian Grey is because, in an age of perceived male non-commitment, he is obsessed with Anastasia. 'Women are big on being seen as ‘special’ and ‘unique’ and all that crap, so it’s not hard to imagine that this is the real appeal – not the fluffy handcuffs and silky bonds. E L James pictured with her novel Fifty Shades Of Grey, which has now been made into a Hollywood movie . 'Your best bet is to go the whole hog with the aim of putting her off completely. 'Chuck out the silk and fluff and bring in the hardware - stick a ball-gag in her mouth, chain her to a chair and beat her intensely for a full five minutes. The September issue of Loaded is out now . 'Then release her and ask innocently, 'Was I doing it hard enough?” 'Chances are, if she’s just a masochist manque, she’ll be desperate to return to vanilla sex with maybe just a tiny bit of swearing on the side.' Deputy Editor of Loaded magazine, Lia Nicholls said of their decision to hire Julie as an agony aunt: 'There aren't many brave enough to admit they were thrashed about during bondage sessions well into their 30s. 'That's one of the many reasons why Julie Burchill is so brilliant. 'When Loaded first started, Barbara Ellen was the mag's opinionated feminist . 'Now, for the relaunch of Loaded, we've appointed Julie as our resident agony aunt, a huge coup. 'In the mag's current issue, as well as bondage, Julie also gives her opinion on infidelity, prostitution and global warming.'

"By . Michael Seamark . Andy Coulson and five others are facing prison for their roles in what prosecutors called a ‘pervasive’ culture of phone hacking at the News of the World. Under Mr Coulson’s editorship, the phone messages of actors, celebrities, and politicians were intercepted on ‘an industrial scale’. Police identified 4,000 possible victims. The hacking scandal began to unravel in 2007, when royal reporter Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were jailed for intercepting the voicemails of members of the Royal Household. Scroll down for video . Facing jail: Former News of the World editor and No.10 spin doctor Andy Coulson may face jail along with five others, after he was found guilty of phone hacking . Initially News International insisted the practice was limited to one ‘rogue reporter’. But that defence crumbled after emails disclosed in a series of civil actions for damages exposed a wider conspiracy. By last October – at the start of this trial – the scale of the hacking plot became clear when the Old Bailey was told that three former news editors at the newspaper were among five men who pleaded guilty to their part in the hacking plot. Senior executives Greg Miskiw, 64, James Weatherup, 58, and Neville Thurlbeck, 52, all admitted playing a part in a six-year campaign of phone hacking which targeted politicians, pop stars and members of the Royal Family. Mulcaire, 43, who was paid £100,000 a year by the paper to arrange the hacking, admitted intercepting the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, among a host of other victims. Close friends: Event: Rebekah Brooks, Charlie Brooks, with Andy Coulson and his wife Eloise in 2009. The court heard how Brooks and Coulson had a series of affairs . At an earlier hearing, he also . admitted three counts of conspiracy to commit phone hacking after police . found ‘thousands and thousands of pages’ of notes relating to his . victims. And reporter Dan . Evans, who appeared as a witness for the prosecution in the hacking . trial, confessed to hacking Sienna Miller’s messages on actor Daniel . Craig’s phone. He has admitted conspiracy to hack phones at the Sunday Mirror between February 2003 and January 2005, and the same offence at the News of the World between April 2004 and June 2010. He also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice. They will be sentenced alongside Coulson after he was found  guilty yesterday of conspiring to hack phones. Targets: Actors Jude Law and Sienna Miller's phones were hacked (pictured in 2004) They each face a maximum sentence of two years for the phone hacking. The former News of the World Editor, whose affair with Mrs Brooks was sensationally revealed during the trial when excerpts from a deeply personal letter from his co-defendant were read to the jury, will face sentencing shortly after the trial finally ends. At that point, it is likely that Miskiw, Weatherup, Thurlbeck and Mulcaire will be brought back to court to be told their fate. The jury heard that phone hacking was so widespread at the News of the World that senior journalists even used a special hotline for ‘do-it-yourself hacking’ and targeted rival journalists. Celebrities who were hacked include Sir Paul McCartney and his then wife Heather Mills, as well as Jude Law and Miller, his girlfriend at the time. Kate Moss, Will Young and Joanna Lumley were targeted too. Mulcaire admitted recording voicemail messages belonging to former Home Secretary David Blunkett and British nanny Louise Woodward, who was convicted of killing a child in the US in the 1990s. News UK – the British newspaper publishing arm of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire – said it had put in place measures to ensure that the wrongdoing at the News of the World could not happen again. ‘We said long ago, and repeat today, that wrongdoing occurred, and we apologised for it. ‘We have been paying compensation to those affected and have co-operated with investigations,’ the company said. ‘We made changes in the way we do business to help ensure wrongdoing like this does not occur again.’ Brian Cathcart from lobby group Hacked Off, which campaigns for state-imposed regulation of the Press, said: ‘For years the Murdoch press clung to the story that one rogue reporter was responsible for phone hacking. We now know this was a lie. ‘Far from being an isolated incident involving a few “bad apples”, the trial has shown that the entire orchard was rotten.’ By James Chapman . Guilty verdict: Andy Coulson at the Old Bailey on Tuesday . David Cameron endured . searching new questions  yesterday over the failure of officials to vet . disgraced spin doctor Andy Coulson to the highest level. Coulson . – who became Downing Street’s chief spin doctor in 2010 – was not . security-vetted to the same level as his predecessors and successors. Instead, . the former tabloid editor was vetted to ‘security check’ level, which . allows only supervised access to the most secret government documents. He resigned before a stricter ‘developed vetting (DV)’ clearance process . had been completed. Of the . Downing Street communications directors before Coulson, three were . already vetted to the DV level, two others were granted the status three . months after starting the job and another after seven months. Mr . Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne hired Coulson as the . Conservatives’ director of communications only weeks after he quit the . News of the World in 2007, saying he took ‘ultimate responsibility’ when . royal editor Clive Goodman pleaded guilty to phone hacking. Labour . leader Ed Miliband revelled in Coulson’s downfall yesterday and asked . why he had not gone through the full vetting process earlier. Mr . Miliband said: ‘I think David Cameron must do much more than an . apology. He owes the country an explanation for why he did not act on . these allegations against Andy Coulson, why – as the evidence piled up – . he didn’t do anything about. ‘He . doesn’t seem to have received the most comprehensive security vetting . and clearance. We need to know why that didn’t happen.’ Mr . Coulson’s background had been probed by a private company contracted by . the Conservative Party when he began work as its head of communications . in 2007. But it was decided to commence ‘developed vetting’ of Mr . Coulson only after he had to brief the media on a terror alert at the . East Midlands airport in October 2010. This had not been completed when . Coulson resigned in January 2011. Under . Mr Cameron’s premiership, current director of communications Craig . Oliver has been develop vetted, as has Gabby Bertin – Coulson’s deputy. No . 10 pointed out that Lord Justice Leveson concluded in his inquiry . report that the Civil Service decides what levels of security clearance . staff require. Last night . Gordon Brown’s spin doctor Damian McBride, who resigned over a smear . campaign against opponents, attacked the Tories for ’equating my . behaviour – however reprehensible – with the criminal activities for . which Andy Coulson has just been convicted’. He added: ‘I had to undergo . the developed vetting process, and have my finances, love life and past . activities thoroughly looked through by the security services. I was . not allowed to start doing the job properly until I’d received my DV . status. ‘Why was Coulson not put through developed vetting for the director of communications job in No 10?’ But . Whitehall sources said it was unlikely a ‘developed vetting’ process . would have uncovered any fresh evidence about Coulson and phone hacking. The . Tory leadership had been dreading the conclusion of the Coulson trial . for months, since Mr Cameron had vowed to make a full public apology if . he was convicted. Mr Cameron admitted at the Leveson Inquiry that his . decision to hire Coulson had ‘haunted’ them both. Coulson, . however, insisted the question of voicemail interception was raised . only once by Mr Cameron during his recruitment – in a phone call while . he was on holiday in Cornwall. Downing . Street said Coulson had given assurances to the police, Press . Complaints Commission and a Commons select committee that he knew . nothing of hacking. Mr . Osborne said: ‘I too am very sorry for the decision we made to employ . Andy Coulson. He gave us assurances that turned out not to be the case. We gave him a second chance but, knowing what we now know, it’s clear . that we made the wrong decision.’ Mr . Clegg said he warned Mr Cameron about the hiring of Coulson. He said he . took the PM to one side when the Coalition was formed in 2010 and . questioned why Coulson was a Downing Street communications director.","Ex-spin doctor Andy Coulson found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski for Daily Mail Australia . A hardline Sydney Islamic preacher has launched an inflammatory Facebook tirade, saying Muslims who preach acceptance 'will never be Australian enough' for 'bigots'. In a post to supporters Sheikh Abu Adnan, from Sydney's western suburbs, wrote: 'This is an advice to those Muslims who are trying very hard to send out the message of acceptance. '""I am an Australian too!"" is what they a screaming out in their responses to many Facebook articles,' he goes on in the rant. 'Realise that these comments will go unnoticed because to the bigoted Australian, you are not white, not blue eyed and don't carry a white name like John.' Scroll down to read the Facebook post in full. Scroll down for video . Sheik Abu Adnan is considered to be a prominent lecturer in the Islamic community in Sydney. Sheikh Abu Adnan,pictured delivering a lecture at the Global Islamic Youth Centre in Sydney's south-western suburbs. The Sheikh continued: 'Don't forget, and if you weren't born yet, ask your migrant parents, that these are the same people who hated their Asian neighbours because they have different eyes and read top-down. 'Their fathers had issues with Greeks and Italians when they immigrated into Australia and invented the derogatory term WOGs for them.' 'Their grandfathers had problems with the Irish-Catholics and their great-grandfathers believed that black people are under-developed sub-humans, who deserved to be killed and their land raped from them.' 'You will never be Australian enough to them.' 'To this bigot, your wife who wears the hjiab is oppressed'. The Sheikh did not respond to a Daily Mail Australia query about these remarks, but in Facebook comments which followed he said they were not aimed at all Australians, just bigoted community members. 'Obviously there are many who are good, the post aiming on bigots who don't get it,' he wrote. 'I know many Aussies who are not racist'. But leading Muslim activist Dr Jamal Rifi blasted the post and said it sent the wrong message. '(Australian Muslims) have the right to feel the right to feel as Australian as anyone else.' he said. 'They shouldn’t feel anything less, regardless of where they are born, regardless of their faith regardless of how funny their name sounds.' In the post, Sheikh Adnan also labelled unnamed Muslim activists who criticised their own community to win white votes 'house Negros'. The Sheikh told Daily Mail Australia those comments were not about anyone in particular. He emailed: 'The comments are general advise, NOT made to this incident in particular or any event in particular nor about any individual in the community.' Dr Rifi fired back, saying that the real people who are demonising the Islamic community are the likes of Australian militants Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar, who are fighting in the MIddle East. 'I reckon the one who is demonising our community is the Australians fighting overseas and parading severed heads on Facebook. These are the culprit. 'And... everyone else should point the finger at these people overseas who are demonising not just our community, their own family, and their own religion. And that’s why (the Sheikh) is wrong.' Pictured: Australian jihadist Khaled Sharrouf. Australian militant Khaled Sharrouf, pictured in earlier times with Mike Tyson. A Twitter account purporting to belong to Khaled Sharrouf posted this horrific image of his son wielding the head of a dead fighter. Dr Rifi said the Sheikh should take a stand to enlighten and inform his supporters. 'The way we should lead is not to follow the masses but taking a stand that enlightens and informs the masses,' he said. Last week Sheikh Abu Adnan was one of more than 60 Islamic community members and groups who signed a letter opposing Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s proposed counter-terrorism laws. The legislation has divided the local Islamic community with some members refusing to meet with the Mr Abbott over the laws. ‘These laws clearly target Muslims and they do so unjustly,’ the petition said. ‘While the language of the law is neutral, it is no secret that in practice these laws specifically target Muslims’. The debate over the proposed laws continues. 'This is an advice to those Muslims who are trying very hard to send out the message of acceptance. ""I am an Australian too!"" is what they a screaming out in their responses to many Facebook articles. Realise that these comments will go unnoticed because to the bigoted Australian, you are not white, not blue eyed and don't carry a white name like ""John"". To this bigot, your wife who wears the hijab is oppressed, You are brown and follow a religion that originated from the far away deserts of the Middle East.''Don't forget, and if you weren't born yet, ask your migrant parents, that these are the same people who hated their Asian neighbours because they have different eyes and read top-down.

Their grandfathers had problems with the Irish-Catholics and their great-grandfathers believed that black people are under-developed sub-humans, who deserved to be killed and their land raped from them. You will never be Australian enough to them.''This is a sincere reminder to some of the Muslim politicians who like to continually demonise their own community thinking that they will win the hearts and minds of these white voters.

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Historian Monika Siedentopf believes that Nazi spy chief Herbert Wichmann, pictured, wanted the German invasion to fail . Germany sent 12 Nazi spies to Britain in September 1940 to gather information ahead of Hitler's planned invasion. But most of the agents who arrived as part of Operation Lena were arrested without having come close to completing their mission 'because of their own stupidity', according to official records. One was arrested when he tried to order cider at 10am - not knowing that he could not be served before lunchtime during the war - while another two were spotted cycling on the wrong side of the road. Their cover was blown when police officers discovered Nivea hand cream and German sausages in their bags. The reason why Germany, known for meticulously-prepared spies, sent such incompetent agents on one of the most important missions of the second world war has remained a mystery. Now historian Monika Siedentopf suggests that the botched mission, part of Operation Sealion - the code name given to Germany's plan to invade - was not a sign of German ineptness but an act of sabotage by anti-Hitler officials. In her book Operation Sealion: Resistance inside the Secret Service, published this summer, Siedentopf traces the mission to a circle of people around Herbert Wichmann, the officer in charge of the Hamburg intelligence unit - one of Nazi Germany's top secret service posts. Wichmann had close ties to spy chief Wilhelm Canaris and to the Stauffenberg group which planned to assassinate Hitler in July 1944. MI5 described Wichmann and his group as 'good Germans, but bad Nazis'. Siedentopf told the Guardian that she believes the spy chief had . deliberately sent the agents - many of whom were not fluent in English - . because he feared that Operation Sealion was badly planned and that it . could cost German lives and resources. German amphibious tanks are prepared for Operation Sealion, the 1940 plan to invade Britain that Siedentopf believes was deliberately sabotaged . Amphibious tanks are prepared for Operation Sealion. Historian Monika Siedentopf argues that Herbert Wichmann thought that the mission was badly planned .

He also feared that an attack on England would lead to a full world war. To avoid the devastation Wichmann sent citizens with low levels of intelligence and a resounding enthusiasm for National Socialism. Many of them were petty criminals and members of far-right organisations in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.","Germany sent 12 Nazi spies to Britain as part of Operation Lena in 1940 .

"By . Candace Sutton for Daily Mail Australia . A court has heard that Roger Rogerson, pictured, went to the storage unit where student Jamie Gao was allegedly murdered to see why he and Glen McNamara had been in there so long . Former detectives Roger Rogerson and Glenn McNamara can be seen dragging the dead body of Jamie Gao on his back to a car minutes after they murdered him, CCTV footage shown by Crown Prosecutor Christopher Maxwell QC in Central Local Court contends. In the footage, Rogerson and McNamara can be seen taking what appears to be a heavy object wrapped in a bag from the Rent-a-Space storage unit in the south-western Sydney suburb of Padstow at around 2pm on May 20 this year. 'The body's dragged on its back,' Mr Maxwell said, describing the footage as it was played to the court. 'Both appear to take part in the lifting of the body.' Mr Maxwell showed dramatic scenes captured on security footage in what he says was an organised plan from the start to murder 20-year-old Mr Gao in the storage unit. He played the footage in pleading the Crown case to oppose a bail application by Mr Rogerson before Magistrate Les Mabbutt. Rogerson's lawyer, George Thomas, offered the 'matrimonial home' and a holiday house owned by the former detective and his wife, Anne Melocco, who was in court on Monday as surety for bail, which was formally refused by Mr Mabbutt. Mr Maxwell said Rogerson, who appeared in the court via audio visual link from Silverwater remand prison in western Sydney, 'had control and access to the scene of the killing'. Mr Maxwell said a prison phone call between Rogerson and his wife, Anne Melocco, since his arrest suggested Rogerson would be arguing that he had only intervened in whatever had happened between Jamie Gao and McNamara in the storage unit after the shooting to give some 'grandfatherly advice' He said Rogerson told Ms Melocco 'well they'd been there a fair while Anne. I thought I'd go over there and see what's happening. 'I thought i might be able to give a bit of a hand, a bit of old grandfatherly advice.' Rogerson, dressed in prison greens, sat shuffling papers and reading notes in the prison during the hearing today. In part of the footage - which shows McNamara and Gao enter together through the door of one of a row of cream coloured storage units, later followed by Rogerson - the three men are inside the unit for nine minutes. Scroll down for video . No bail: Anne Melocco, the wife of former detective Roger Rogerson, who is accused of murdering student Jamie Gao during a $3 methylamphetamine drug deal, leaves Central Local Court on Monday following her husband's failed application for bail. Rogerson's lawyer offered up Ms Melocco and Rogerson's marital home and a holiday house as $1.5m surety . Serious charges: In refusing Roger Rogerson bail in Central Local Court on Monday, magistrate Les Mabbutt said Rogerson was facing serious charges of being involved in commercial drug supply of 2.8kg of 'ice' and of murdering Sydney student Jamie Gao (Pictured), whose body was found floating in the ocean a week after he was suspected of being involved in the suspected botched drug deal . Following this, McNamara can be seen taking a surfboard bag into the unit. Rogerson - who appears to hobble or limp each time he moves on foot - emerges to move his vehicle. 'Mr Rogerson ... brings his car over to shield them bringing the dead body out,' Mr Maxwell said, showing footage of Rogerson parking his car behind Mc Namara's outside the unit. Rogerson, 73,  and Glenn McNamara, 55, are charged with murdering of university student Mr Gao, whose body was found wrapped in a tarpaulin floating in the sea of Cronulla in southern Sydney on May 26, a week after he was reported missing. Police allege the University of Technology Sydney student was shot in a storage facility by McNamara and Rogerson during a botched drug deal involving 3kg of methylamphetamine on May 20. The application was before Magistrate Les Mabbutt. Barrister George Thomas, for Rogerson,  suggested a struggle between McNamara and Mr Gao might have ensued before Rogerson entered the storage facility. He said there was between three and four minutes that the two were in there, 'enough time for a killing to take place'. On August 8, Magistrate Mabbutt refused a bail application by McNamara, who offered $580,000 in a surety to be effectively 'under house arrest'. Jamie Gao was already dead and on the floor following a struggle with a firearm by the time Roger Rogerson entered a storage unit on May 20, Rogerson's barrister told Central Local Court. He didn't know: Roger Rogerson's wife, Anne Melocco (pictured, above left) leaves court along with his barrister, George Thomas (pictured above, right, after unsuccessfully applying for his client's bail) who argued Rogerson was only brought into co-accused Glenn McNamara's 2.8kg 'ice' deal to sort out Triad associates of Jamie Gao and that when he entered the storage unit where Gao was shot, the 20-year-old was already dead . Mr Maxwell said a prison phone call between Rogerson and his wife, Anne Melocco, since his arrest suggested Rogerson would be arguing that he had only intervened in whatever had happened between Jamie Gao and McNamara in the storage unit after the shooting to give some 'old grandfatherly advice' George Thomas said Rogerson had been called to the scene of a proposed 'ice' drug deal between Mr Gao and former detective Glenn Mc Namara to deal with alleged triad associates. CCTV footage shows Mr Gao arriving at the Padstow storage unit with two young Asian men.In submissions to the court distancing Rogerson from both the drug deal and what he described as the 'unintended' killing 'in self defence' of Mr Gao by McNamara, Mr Thomas said Rogerson had made no attempt to conceal his activities on the day. He said Rogerson's presence at the scene 'related to McNamara's concerns Jamie Gao had associations with people said to be triad related. McNamara wanted to be sure he wasn't being followed'. He said in the three to four minutes McNamara was with Mr Gao inside the storage unit - which was dark and had no light - there was a struggle involving a pistol which may have been carried by Mr Gao. Jamie Gao's body was found wrapped in a tarpaulin floating in the sea off a beach in Cronulla, southern Sydney, on May 26 . He said on entering the storage unit, 'a man was already on the ground, deceased' and McNamara told Rogerson there had been a struggle. Mr Thomas said Mr Gao's two bullet wounds - one of which was '150mm down from the nipple' and both of which showed had been made in a ' downward trajectory' - could not have been made by Rogerson who was shorter than Mr Gao. He said Rogerson had helped to remove Mr Gao's body from the unit, but had not been involved in the dumping at sea by Mc Namara. Last month the case was facing some delays as fingerprints, DNA evidence and CCTV footage were still being compiled in the murder case against former NSW detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara, a court heard. They have also been accused of commercial drug supply. Police allege the University of Technology Sydney student (pictured left, and right with his girlfriend) was shot in a storage facility by McNamara and Rogerson . Lawyer Paul Kenny, for Rogerson, 73, did not require him to be videoed in from Silverwater Correctional Centre in July, while McNamara, 55, is in Goulburn prison. Police prosecutors told the court more time was needed to assemble some of the scientific evidence in the case, and there were significant delays in autopsy reports on the victim. Central Local Court heard that up to five weeks was needed to assemble fingerprint evidence from the crime scene and DNA testing of clothing. Evidence to be presented in the case included analysis of methylamphetamines allegedly found in McNamara's car. However, although a postmortem had been completed on Mr Gao, there was a six-to-nine-month delay at the Sydney morgue on the autopsy report. Police allege the University of Technology Sydney student was shot in a storage facility by McNamara and Rogerson during a botched drug deal on May 20. McNamara was charged and faced Kogarah Local Court on May 26. Rogerson was arrested amid a media frenzy outside his home in the western Sydney suburb of Padstow the following day.

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . and Candace Sutton for Daily Mail Australia . Bradley Morcombe has vowed to keep his murdered twin brother close to his heart on his wedding day. So much so, he and older brother Dean - who will be the best man - will pin a photo of Daniel and a red rose to their jackets during the ceremony. The 24-year-old will walk down the aisle on Saturday to wed his schoolgirl sweetheart Anna Martin in what will be a big family celebration. Scroll down for video . Daniel's twin, Bradley Morcombe, 24, and schoolgirl sweetheart Anna Martin (pictured) will walk down the aisle with in what will be a big family celebration . He will be there forever: Bradley Morcombe (pictured, left, with his twin brother Daniel) has said that although Daniel is gone, he is with him and his family every day . 'Daniel will be watching from heaven, watching over the day, that’s for sure,' Bradley told the Courier Mail. 'Dean and I will be wearing a photo of him.' Bradley first met Anna, now 25, whilst they both attended Siena Catholic College - where Daniel also studied. The invitation-only ceremony will be held on the Sunshine Coast, south-east Queensland. Family first: Denise and Bruce Morcombe said they were determined not to let the tragedy tear the family apart . The abduction of Daniel Morcombe (pictured, left) in December 2003 could have torn his family apart, but Bruce and Denise Morcombe were determined to keep their clan together, as they have detailed in their new book 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' (pictured, right, with a framed photo of Daniel) The day will be a testament to the positive thinking of the Morcombe family who refused to be torn apart by the tragedy of 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe's abduction and murder on December 7, 2003. 'The wedding we hope will be a very positive and happy family event,' Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia on August 2 - the same day he and wife, Denise, launched their book, 'Where is Daniel? The Family's story', published by Pan MacMillan. 'In the back of everyone's minds, there is where is Daniel, where is the twin? But it is Brad and Anna's day. 'There will be thoughts about Daniel. [You would have] expected him to be best man. 'But Dean [Bradley's older brother] will be the best man.' While Bruce Morcombe said the ceremony will reflect the wider 'family' the Morcombes have acquired since Daniel went missing, through their long campaign to find him and the trial and conviction of murderer Brett Peter Cowan earlier this year. Family first: Bradley Morcombe, 24, (pictured, left) will marry his fiancee Anna Martin with his brother Dean (above, right) as best man . Twins: When Bradley Morcombe (left), his father Bruce Morcombe says it will be natural for some people to think 'where is Daniel (pictured, right), where is the twin' but that the days will belong to the couple Bradley and his bride, Anna Martin . Bruce and Denise Morcombe's book 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' is intended to help other families under stress or who have lost loved ones to hold together and not crumble in the face of adversity . Julie Elliott, a former police senior sergeant stationed at Caboolture, 40km north of Brisbane, was appointed as a special police media liaison officer exclusively to the Morcombe case; she retired from the police force to become a civil celebrant and will marry Bradley Morcombe and Ms Martin. Kay McGrath, a Channel 7 Queensland journalist and presenter who covered the Daniel Morcombe case, will act as the wedding's MC. Bradley Morcombe, who works as a fencing contractor, has previously told Australian Women's Weekly how he might have accompanied his twin brother on the Christmas shopping expedition that ended in Daniel's disappearance and murder by Cowan, which left the family in limbo as Denise and Bruce pursued answers as to what had happened to their son. Priorities: Bruce and Denise Morcombe said finding their son Daniel, who was abducted and murdered by Brett Peter Cowan (pictured) in December 2003 was of huge importance - but so was keeping their family together, which they write about in their new book . Bradley told the Weekly there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of his brother. 'He is with us all the time, every single day,' Bradley said. 'He's still part of the family. He'll always be my brother and I'll always miss him, no matter what happens in the future.' Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia keeping their family together under such strains and pressures was one of his and Denise's great achievements, which he hoped to impart to other families suffering tragedy and loss. 'If the Morcombes can stay together, well so can others,' he said. 'The book ... is very much a survival of the Morcombe family, so that out experience will benefit other families. 'It was very much a concerted decision [for us] to be strong. You are very much aware through media reports how a significant life event almost always results in the family exploding. 'Because of crises [families] have disintegrated. People become depressed and some don't manage all that well.' Mr Morcombe as much as he and Denise had been determined to find their son, in the early stages hoping to find him safe, and then to bring home his remains and the killer Cowan to justice, 'Where is Daniel - The Family's story' was about their other driving force. 'We made that very much known within the inner family ... that this will not tear us apart,' he said. Mr Morcombe said he has watched on proudly as older son Dean and Daniel's twin, Bradley, have pass their life miletsones. 'They both have good jobs, a steady girlfriend and they've purchased houses.' 'I think holding the family together has been one of the highest priorities and of course finding Daniel. 'It wasn't easy. How do you put ona 21st party for Bradley and everyone thinks we should have two cakes, but you have to be realistic and celebrate the positive aspect. 'And we have all stuck together.' Bradley Morcombe and Anna Martin both attended Siena Catholic College at Sippy Downs on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and live locally at Buderim. 'Where is Daniel?

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron once spoke out against the dangers of using Twitter - declaring 'too many twits might make a tw**'. But it seems Members of Parliament have ignored the Prime Minister's advice - with soaring numbers signing up to the popular website according to a new study. Over the past 12 months MPs wasted almost 60 hours a week sending messages on Twitter, it has been revealed. Respect MP George Galloway sent the most tweets of any MP over the past year, ahead of the Lib Dem MPs Tim Farron and Julian Huppert . There are more Tory MPs than any other party using Twitter - but also the highest proportion who have not yet signed up. Overall,  71 per cent of MPs are now on Twitter . The number of MPs using Twitter soared following the 2011 decision to allow smart phones and iPads to be used in the chamber to send messages. Over the past 12 months MPs sent a total of 718,431 Tweets – which works out at more than 1,500 messages for each of the 461 MPs on Twitter. In total, MPs spent a combined total of over 115 days - or more than 2,774 hours – sending messages to their followers between July 29 last year and July 28 last month. The extent of Parliament’s addiction to Twitter is detailed in a study compiled by the political lobbying firm Westminster Public Affairs. Overall, 71 per cent of MPs are now on Twitter – an increase since January 2010 of 350 MPs using Twitter. There are also 118 peers - 15 per cent of the House of Lords - who use the site. Out of the main three political parties, 82 per cent of Lib Dems are on Twitter – 46 MPs - 75 per cent of Labour MPs - 193 – and 67 per cent of Tories, or some 203 MPs. Olly Kendall, the managing director of Westminster Public Affairs, said: ‘MPs are sending tweets in a far greater volume than ever before. In 2011 we calculated that MPs spend a total of 1,000 hours on Twitter. That number has significantly increased. ‘The relaxation of the Commons Twitter ban, overturned at the start of 2011, which until then outlawed Tweeting in the Chamber has certainly helped to increase the volume of tweets sent.’ In 2011 11 MPs signed an amendment which would have effectively banned the use of Twitter and other micro-blogging in the Commons . George Galloway (right) and the Lib Dem President Tim Farron (left) were the most prolific Twitter users last year. David Cameron once warned that 'too many tweets might make a tw**' The ammedment would have limited MPs to only 'receive and send urgent messages' while in the Commons, but was defeated by 206 to 63. Until 2011 there had been an informal arrangement allowing MPs to use handheld devices such as BlackBerrys, iPhones and iPads but not laptops in the Commons so they can keep up with their day-to-day business. But amid a surge in popularity among MPs for using Twitter, a Commons committee attempted to update the rules. Labour MP Luciana Berger said moves to limit the use of mobile phones so only 'urgent messages' could be exchanged - effectively banning the use of Twitter - were 'anti-democratic, regressive and bemusing to the public'. She added: 'It's a very useful way to connect with communities we were elected to serve. We are all adults and we are all mindful of how we are viewed in the eyes of the public and the importance of being respectful to each other.' She was supported by Tory Clare Perry, who said tweeting helped MPs to 'stay informed, in touch and accountable to their constituents'. Any ban would be 'an inexplicable step back in time'. David Cameron was widely mocked over this Tweet of himself pictured speaking to Barack Obama. The PM once warned about the dangers of using Twitter . Patrick Stewart was one of a host of celebrities mocking David Cameron's serious phone face selfie on Twitter . But Roger Gale said the use of Twitter would mean MPs could be prompted to ask certain questions. He said MPs were already reading 'vast tracts' of briefs prepared by lobbyists, while 'genuine debate'' had often been stifled by MPs turning to speeches prepared for them by other people. Mr Gale continued: 'If we are now to suggest that Members are going to be allowed to Twitter and receive comment in the course of these debates then it is absolutely inevitable that you will have people sitting in the public gallery sending messages saying 'ask him this, tell her that, read this'. That is not what this place is about.' His Conservative colleague James Gray, who signed the amendment, said one ''very senior'' MP told him the Commons should observe the same rules as the opera and ban mobile devices completely. He warned the Procedure Committee's report would mean ''we end up with a room full of MPs staring at devices - as I can see three or four doing as I look round the chamber at the moment''. Mr Gray added: 'I think it brings the whole nature of debate in this place into some disrepute. I would like to see the standard of debate here maintained. We are the Mother of Parliaments, let us engage in detailed and logical debate and let us not spend an excessive amount of time on our electronic devices.'","Soaring number of MPs using Twitter after Commons ban was lifted in 2011 .

British Airways and Iberia have become the latest airlines to offer a small holding fee that caters to travellers who need more time to decide before booking a trip. With a deposit of up to £10, customers can lock their flights and the price for up to 72 hours before booking. The deposit for short-haul flights is £5 per person, while the fee for long-haul flights is £10 per person. Hold on: British Airways has introduced a small fee that allows customers to put a hold on certain flights . The fee is refunded once the seats are paid for, but customers will lose their deposits if trips are not booked within three days. The price will not go up while the flights are held, British Airways said. If the price jumps while the booking is on hold, British Airways will cover the difference. If the taxes, fees and charges drop, the customer will pay the lower price. Some planning is required because the holding fee is not available for flights departing within 21 days. It does not apply to bookings including infants. The holding fee is not available for all flights offered by British Airways and Iberia, however. Family getaway: The holding fee could mean cheaper getaways . Twenty British Airways destinations are currently excluded, including Argentina, Barbados, Egypt, India, Israel, Mexico, Syria and Pakistan. Colombia, Costa Rica, Vietnam and Haiti are among the 16 Iberia destinations that are ineligible. Drew Crawley, British Airways’ chief commercial officer, said: ‘There’s nothing more frustrating than seeing a great flight price but not being able to book it straight away, either because you may need to get the time off work or check it’s ok with family or friends – then coming back and finding there are no seats left or the price has changed. ‘Now customers can see the price, hold their seats and be sure that’s all they’ll pay, up to three days later.'","Holding fees are £5 for short-haul flights and £10 for long-haul flights .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Michelle Mone, pictured outside Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court earlier this year, was today banned from driving for six months . Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has been banned from the road for six months after admitting to speeding. The 42-year-old was caught driving at 70 mph in a 50mph zone on the M77, near Glasgow, in March last year. She was spotted by officers as she sped past the junction at Dumbreck Road in her Range Rover. Mone, from Glasgow, was not present when the case called today at Glasgow’s Justice of the Peace Court. Defence lawyer Graham Walker, who represented Mone at the hearing, said there was an 'agreement' with the Crown that the case could call in her absence. JP George Fullerton handed Mone - who already had nine points on her licence - four more points, automatically banning the mother-of-two from the road for six months. She was also given a £225 fine, to be paid in 28 days. Procurator fiscal depute Scott Dignon told the court Mone was caught by police driving her Land Rover around 70 miles per hour. He said she was cautioned and charged by police and made no reply. Mr Walker told the court that looking at her licence there was a 'pattern of offending' that relates to using a mobile phone while driving. He added: 'She’s a high profile businesswoman who works internationally, her business has global responsibilities but as part of that she regularly drives throughout the UK.' The lawyer said she spends a 'great deal of time on her phone' and that 'her vehicle is an extension of her office'. He also described the speeding offence as 'flying in the face of previous offending' and invited the court to keep the current points on her licence and impose a short-term ban. However, Mone was banned because her points exceeded the maximum of 12 meaning she was given the mandatory six month ban. Mr Walker entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Mone for a charge of allegedly using her mobile phone on August 12, last year on the M8, which was accepted by the Crown. On August 21, it appeared she was jetting off when she posted on her Twitter page: 'Taking my wee Mum out for her birthday Then home to pack. Off to #StTropez party weekend with the girls.'

"By . Sarah Dean for Daily Mail Australia . and Frank Coletta . Former footy star Senator Glenn Lazarus has claimed politics is 'tougher' than anything he faced on the field. The rugby league great and one of the Palmer United Party's star recruits has revealed he is feeling the pressure after being elected to the Senate in the 2013 federal election. The 48-year-old told Fairfax Radio 4BC Mornings: 'I am very confident in my ability as a footballer, so I would have to say playing State of Origin and playing rugby league certainly came a lot easier to me pressure wise, I think politics would take that hands down.' Responding to the recent criticism he faced after it was revealed he had ripped off information from Wikipedia to inform followers about his state of Queensland, he said: 'If that is a real crime, then I am guilty.' Scroll down for video . Senator Glenn Lazarus, the footballer they called 'the brick with eyes' is now in the eye of a political storm amid allegations he has plagiarised Wikipedia's Queensland website . The accusations of plagiarism stemmed from his personal website senatorlazarus.com, where details about the state's primary industries appear to have been simply cut and pasted onto his page. 'I've had some pretty violent and a huge footballers try to rip my head off and I think I am big enough and ugly enough to handle the criticism, but that sort of doesn't sit well with me when my mother rings, or mother-in-law rings or someone like that to see how I am because of some very negative press,' he told the radio show. Local media reports suggests the new senator has been sidestepping questions about his party leader's controversial comments about China. The Courier Mail in Queensland reports that Senator Lazarus has refused to respond to questions about Australia’s economic future, what his plans for the state were and the comments made by party leader Clive Palmer and fellow Senator Jacqui Lambie. As a Senator, Glenn Lazarus, enjoys a base salary of more than $195,000 plus a raft of entitlements including travel. It's been a tough initiation for one-time football great, heckled during his maiden speech, accused of going to ground by sections of the media and now this. Also on Senator Lazarus's website, the words used to describe the role of the Senate and a member's role in it strike a remarkably close resemblance to the details provided on the site of South Australia's Independent Senator, Nick Xenophon. Clive Palmer (right) and Senator Jacqui Lambie have recently been embroiled in the war of words of Australia's relationship with China and now PUP Senate leader Glenn Lazarus is in hot water . The following are the second and third paragraphs on Senator Lazarus' website: . 'Queensland is the largest state and the third most populated with a population of some 4,560,059 people. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia’s third largest city. Referred to as the ‘Sunshine State’, Queensland is home to 10 of Australia’s 30 largest cities and is the nation’s third largest economy. The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain’s longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over Cooksland, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.' Palmer United Party senators Jacqui Lambie (left) and Glenn Lazarus are making headlines for the wrong reasons . Before entering politics in 2013 with the Palmer United Party, Glenn Lazarus (pictured playing for NSW against Queensland) enjoyed a stellar rugby league career, considered one of the code's greatest players . And the following are excerpts from Queensland - Wikipedia: . 'Queensland (abbreviated as Qld) is the second-largest and third-most populous state in Australia. 'Queensland has a population of 4,560,059, concentrated along the coast and particularly in the state's South East. 'The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia's third largest city. 'Referred to as the 'Sunshine State', Queensland is home to 10 of Australia's 30 largest cities and is the nation's third largest economy. 'The state was named in honour of Queen Victoria, who on 6 June 1859 signed Letters Patent separating the colony from New South Wales. The date 6 June is now celebrated state-wide as Queensland Day. Queen Victoria, who went on to become Britain's longest reigning monarch, chose an eponymous name for the colony over Cooksland, which had been suggested by the influential local Presbyterian minister John Dunmore Lang in honour of navigator James Cook. Queensland achieved statehood with the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901.' Apart from some re-ordering of sentences, there appears to be very little differentiation between the two pages. Reading further, there are arguably too many similarities to be a coincidence. As the Queensland Wikipedia site appears today . The words on the Queensland page of the Glenn Lazarus site senatorlazarus.com strikes a remarkable resemblance to those on Wikipedia (top) Senator Lazarus seems to be not backing down after the first real test of his political career, unlike his former football team-mate Mal Meninga. Meninga, another rugby league great who starred for the Canberra side, is remembered for perhaps the country's most short-lived of political careers. In September 2001, just a few days after deciding he would run as an Independent in the ACT elections, he pulled out of the race while in his first political interview, saying quite simply: 'I'm buggered, I'm sorry. I have to resign'.","Glenn Lazarus has spoken out about the pressure he faces as a politician .

You've got to have somebody a little bit more cool, and he's not like that, Jason. 'He can whack a 35-yard free-kick in here and there but a penalty, with all the pressure on him at a place like White Hart Lane - not in a million years for me.' Warnock responded to Puncheon's comments with a statement saying he had done 'nothing untoward' and was addressing the matter directly with the player. 'Good luck to Crystal Palace.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . Commons Speaker John Bercow is under mounting pressure to delay the appointment of a controversial Australian as Parliament’s most senior official, amid a growing outcry from MPs. Former foreign secretaries Jack Straw and Margaret Beckett have added their voices to a cross-party campaign to let MPs grill Mr Bercow’s top choice to become the next House of Commons clerk. It came after Carol Mills finally broke her silence over the controversy surrounding her proposed appointment. Scroll down for video . Commons Speaker John Bercow is under pressure to let MPs grill the Australian Parliamentary aide Carol Mills, who is the front runner to become the new House of Commons clerk . Ms Mills, a senior aide in the Australian Parliament in Canberra, said she was ‘disappointed’ that colleagues in Australia had declared that she had ‘no parliamentary knowledge or experience’. It came after an email was leaked from the Australian clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing, to the Commons authorities which warned against her appointment. Responding to the memo Ms Mills said: ‘It would not be appropriate for me to comment further in a personal capacity at this time,’ she said. ‘As a senior parliamentary officer, I take seriously my responsibilities to promote and uphold the values and code of conduct articulated in the Commonwealth of Australia Parliamentary Service Act 1999.’ Ms Laing apparently cited an incident in which CCTV cameras were used in the Australian Parliament to track someone pushing an envelope under the door of a senator's office late at night. The episode is being investigated, as cameras are supposed to be used only for security and to prosecute illegal activity. But Ms Mills said her Department of Parliamentary Services ‘looks forward to the opportunity to explain to the committee the basis of its view that use of the CCTV footage was in fact authorised, and wholly consistent with parliamentary privilege’. Former Commons Speaker Baroness Boothroyd has slammed the proposed appointment of Ms Mills . Baroness Boothroyd, a former House of Commons speaker, said Ms Mills' statement ‘underlines the urgent need for the Prime Minister to reconsider her proposed appointment as clerk of the House of Commons’. She added: ‘Mr Cameron should postpone a decision until widespread concerns about her suitability to fill an important constitutional position at Westminster are properly addressed.’ A growing number of MPs have called for Ms Mills to face a confirmation hearing in front of MPs before she can take up the role. Ms Mills is believed to have been recommended for the prestigious role following a recruitment process with a selection panel led by Mr Bercow. But concerns have been raised about her ability to fulfil the crucial role in which she will advise the Speaker and Prime Minster over constitutional matters. Baroness Boothroyd has claimed she would be ‘totally out of her depth’ in the role. Public Administration Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin has written to David Cameron asking him to publicly back letting MPs scrutinise Ms Mills. Former Commons leader and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw backed the move. He told The Guardian: ‘Given the controversy, and without making any observations about the relative merits of the candidate, I think that such pre-appointment scrutiny would be a good way of resolving this.’ Mrs Beckett, who also served as leader of the Commons, told the newspaper: ‘These days you cannot make an appointment like this without select committee scrutiny.’ The £200,000-a-year position combines the role of clerk of the House of Commons and chief executive responsible for running the building and managing almost 2,000 staff. Critics have said that while Ms Mills' may be a suitable candidate for the chief executive element of the job, they are concerned about her ability to advise MPs, the Speaker and Prime Minister on constitutional matters. Mr Bercow - who has attempted to drive a significant modernisation of the Commons - has come under fire for overlooking the respected deputy clerk David Natzler. But his allies have defended the way it was handled, with an open recruitment process and lengthy interviews for the shortlisted candidates. Mr Bercow chaired the appointment panel which also included Andrew Lansley - who subsequently lost his job as Commons leader in the reshuffle - shadow leader Angela Eagle, Labour chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge and Liberal Democrat John Thurso. Mr Bercow's spokeswoman said: ‘This is the first time ever there has been an open and fair recruitment process for the clerk of the House of Commons.’ Former Foreign Secretaries Margaret Beckett and Jack Straw have called for Ms Mills to appear in front of a Parliamentary committee to scrutinise her appointment . Eight candidates were interviewed, with a shortlist of three called back for a second round of grilling by the panel. The successful candidate's name is understood to have been put forward to Downing Street to subsequently recommend to the Queen. The vacancy has arisen because of the retirement of Commons veteran Sir Robert Rogers amid claims he has clashed with the Speaker. Tory MP Michael Fabricant, who claimed in the Commons last month that Mr Bercow had once told Sir Robert to ‘f*** off’ in front of witnesses - an allegation immediately denied by Mr Bercow - said the Speaker should consider resigning. On Twitter he said: ‘If I were Bercow, I'd be thinking about my own position, let alone considering what to do about the rigged appointment of the new Clerk.’ Sir Robert has put in place a plan for when he retires at the end of the month, with Mr Natzler acting up as clerk until the new appointment is in place. He said the plans ‘are resilient’ and that ‘we could go to the election without a problem. I'm quite sure we would be fine’.","Carol Mills, a top aide in Australian Parliament, set to be next Commons clerk .

"By . Chris Paine . and Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . and Marielle Simon For Daily Mail Australia . Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has addressed his controversial comments towards 'Chinese mongrels' and 'Chinese b***ards' by insisting 'they were not directed at the Chinese community or the Chinese government'. After receiving backlash for his bizarre rant on ABC's Q&A program on Monday night, Mr Palmer today issued a statement saying he has 'been an admirer of China and its people for many years', going on to mention the Party's first mainland born Chinese Senator Dio Wang. The Palmer United Party leader reiterated his support for China, but made clear his comments were directed against Citic Pacific, with whom he's locked in a series of legal disputes. Mr Palmer maintained his stance against Citic, who he has accused of abusing and undermining Australia's legal system for 'commercial gain'. Scroll down for video . Australia's Palmer United Party leader was on the panel of ABC television programme Q&A on Monday night when he hit out with the racist comments . 'We cannot encourage foreign labour within Australian jurisdiction to be paid lesser amounts than what is lawful in this country,' he said. 'No amount of money, no amount of lobbying should blind us from the duty to protect.' Despite vowing his support for China, Mr Palmer earlier said it would be a while before he visited the country, quipping: 'If I went they'd shoot me'. A social media storm forced Mr Palmer yesterday to publicly clarify his comments, while his eccentric colleague senator Jacqui Lambie weighed in with a bizarre written statement warning of a 'Chinese communist invasion'. She also went on radio repeating calls for Australia to double its investment in military and missile defence system, or else risk 'letting our grandchildren become slaves'. Mr Palmer has again tried to clarify his position, telling the Australian Financial Review that while he wasn't talking about the Chinese people, from his point of view there is 'no distinction' between Citic and the government. Citic has accused Mr Palmer of using $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013. Mr Palmer's comments may have sparked diplomatic tension between Australia and China, who described his tirade as 'absurd and irresponsible', the AFR reports. And in an attempt to smooth things over, foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Chinese embassy that 'these were the comments of one Member of Parliament and not representative'. Clive Palmer (right) on the panel with opposition leader in the senate Penny Wong (middle) and talk show host Tony Jones (left) Clive Palmer's comments come as he is locked in a legal battle with Chinese-owned Citic Pacific over a series of disputes. The first concerns a bank account operated by Mr Palmer's company Mineralogy, for which Mr Palmer was the only signatory of the account at the time of the incident. Citic claims that the account was only to be used for covering the operational costs of Port Preston, an iron ore port in Western Australia. Two cheques were spent from this account in 2013, one for $10 million that went to Mr Palmer's Cosmo Development and a $2.17 million check that went to the PR firm Media Circus. Citic has accused Mr Palmer of using the $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013. On Monday's episode of Q&A Tony Jones tried to get Mr Palmer to admit whether or not he had spent any money from the Mineralogy-operated account on his election campaign. One of Mr Palmer's companies, Queensland Nickel, put $12.7 million back into the account after media accounts of the incident first emerged. There is an ongoing dispute between Palmer's Mineralogy and Citic about the Sino Iron Project. The dispute concerns royalties for the project, with Mr Palmer claiming he is owed $500 million. Mr Palmer was on the panel of the ABC's flagship programme when he launched into a tirade about Chinese business interests in Australia, accusing Chinese people of trying to take over Australia . 'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said. The controversial MP made the comments when he was being questioned by host Tony Jones about allegations he used money from one of his business accounts to fund his election campaign. Mr Palmer repeatedly refused to answer Mr Jones's questions, saying he would be answering them in court this week and would not be subjected to a 'trial by media'. He then claimed he was owed 'about $500 million by the Communist Chinese government.' 'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We've had... an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels - I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said. Outraged Q&A viewers took to social media and expressed their disgusts over the mining billionaire's derogatory views. Activist group GetUp! tweeted: 'Hey, that was pretty racist @CliveFPalmer, and that's not okay'. 'To say what Clive Palmer just said on #qanda. I'm surprised if that's legal. Or free speech absolute in Oz?' Peter Johansson tweeted. 'I love how @clivefpalmer is celebrating Australia's cultural diversity in an anger racist Palmer kind of way,' Raphael tweeted. Silas Palmer wrote: 'Was that [the snarling, racist and ruthless] the Real Clive Palmer'. 'Dear @JulieBishopMP , If you need help with your portfolio perhaps @CliveFPalmer may help with a diplomatic mission to China,' tweeted Viscount Mike OBE. Some expressed support for Mr Palmer, with Raiderette tweeting: 'Good on ya Clive keep speaking freely!' and Michael Brown writing: 'Fair enough Clive.' The 56-year-old was on the panel for the weekly Australian talk show hosted by Tony Jones. The 56-year-old is a mining billionaire and established the Palmer United Party last year . Other panellists were deputy prime minister Warren Truss, opposition leader in the senate Penny Wong, businesswoman and RBA board member Heather Ridout, national CEO of St Vincent de Paul Society John Falzon. In 2009, Clive Palmer criticised the Labor government's trade policies, which made trade more difficult for Chinese investors than U.S. investors. In an address to the Queensland Media Club he called the current policies 'racist' and said there was 'a great cry in Australia about Reds under the bed'. But Mr Palmer argued that 'capital is now in China, it's not in the US' and that Australia had a terrific opportunity to become a strong trade partner with China 'if our politicians could only be fair and treat the Chinese people and Chinese government with the dignity they deserve.'","Clive Palmer says his comments on Q&A were not directed towards the Chinese people .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . A former county cricket chairman has described the combined county debt, which has approached £200million by his reckoning, as a ‘national disaster for the game’. Neil Davidson, who owns The Cricketer magazine and used to run Leicestershire, has researched the vast monies owed for a financial state-of-the-game report for his magazine. He discovered that the sums owed by the 18 counties had risen from £100m in 2008 to £191m four years later. Davidson believes that building or refurbishing grounds to gain or keep international matches is responsible for the deficit. Grounds for complaint: The cost of refurbishing grounds has left county cricket around £150m in debt . In the Red: County cricket's debt is still less than the cost of a new stand at Anfield . However ECB chief operating officer Gordon Hollins dismisses Davidson ‘as not really understanding’ the strategy, insisting new facilities will greatly improve counties earning power.

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . Yet another World Cup comes and goes but still Bobby Moore remains the only England captain whose hands have reached out to grasp football’s Holy Grail and raise it aloft.’ Thus begins the updated and significantly expanded publication of my biographical labour of love about the most iconic figure of all in the rich anthology of English football. What more fitting way to celebrate the 50th anniversary, in 2016, of England’s only World Cup glory than to rectify the shameful failure to elevate the winning captain to football’s company of knights? Defining moment: England captain Bobby Moore plants a kiss on the World Cup trophy in 1966 . Long time: It is almost 50 years since England won the World Cup and the Three Lions failed again this summer . This is the question, still vexed all these 21 years after Moore’s premature death, which is put, with considerable vehemence, at the end of the book. There can be any number of justifications for rushing into print and the two identified above are prominent in the reasoning for this revised work.One begets the other. The descent into mediocrity of the nation which gave birth to the greatest game steepened at Brazil 2014, from which a craven England were eliminated in record time: Two games and out. That stirred the memory of how it all began to go wrong after that dizzying afternoon at the old Wembley in the summer of ’66 when Moore wiped his muddied palms on the velvet-covered rail of the Royal Box before receiving the Jules Rimet Trophy from the white-gloved hands of the Queen. It also provoked the thought that this worsening humiliation might have been averted had the Football Association, instead of freezing Moore out, employed the wisdom and experience of their most inspirational captain... the way Germany did with his great friend, exact contemporary and similar personality Franz Beckenbauer to such unprecedented success. Over here, in this bastion of Middle English values, decency and common sense, we do not only print the Mail. We get mail. Yesteryear’s grand old-fashioned flood of readers’ letters, many so beautifully crafted, has subsided before the advance of communications technology. But that tradition is exceeded now by the millions of emails, texts, tweets and comments posted at our website. Legends: Moore stands alongside his great friend Franz Beckenbauer at the 1972 European Championship . Of course it can be a mixed bag and a few of my respondents are prone to asking: ‘Can you ever go a week without mentioning your mate Bobby Moore?’ A majority, however, share an understanding as to why it is his larger-than-life-size statue which stands guard at the approach to the new Wembley Stadium, not unlike Horatio at the bridge. Some are old enough to relive through Bobby’s printed reminiscence the thrill of that solitary World Cup triumph: ‘Bursting inside and trembling. Elated but trying not to get carried away. Typically English. Don’t show too much. But even seeing the film years later still gives me the shivers. It is the be-all and end-all of football.’ Those words came echoing down the years to swirl around the multi-coloured promenades of Rio de Janeiro this summer. This World Cup was the be-all for Germany’s Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Muller and Joachim Low. It was the end-all for Lionel Messi, David Luiz, Robin van Persie and Big Phil Scolari. And it was another death, this one not so small, for the English game. That is the relevance of Bobby Moore today. Learned professors warn us that we forget our history at our peril. Our most cherished game has paid the price for ignoring a national hero until he died. Another rummage through the notes and recordings of our conversations down the years unearthed this prophecy of sporting catastrophe, uttered before Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello came, failed, took the money and ran: ‘The England job is for an Englishman, not someone from abroad. Every country has its football culture and it takes one of our own to understand how the English player works. Early exit: England were knocked out of this summer's World Cup after the group stage in Brazil . Foresight: Moore said, long before foreigners Sven Goran Eriksson (left) and Fabio Capello (right) took charge, that the job of England manager is one for an Englishman . ‘Anyway, a national team should be all about people from that country — from the manager through the players, all the way down to the tea lady. ‘And by the way, no country has ever won the World Cup with a foreign manager.’ And that is still true today. Moore passed away before Terry Venables was appointed England head coach in 1994. What he said comes as a rebuke from beyond the grave for the FA’s failure to secure Venables for the 1998 World Cup following his thrilling run to the semi-final of Euro ’96: ‘Terry is one of the most intelligent coaches and inspiring man-managers I have ever known or worked with.’ It would be hard for the blazered FA to deny having turned up their pompous noses at the Cockney footballer, even more than they did at other great men who they tended to look down upon as muddied oafs. So I am certain Bobby would have shared my gratification at including in his biography, now, the public apology from a more recent FA chairman, David Bernstein, for that organisation’s neglect of its World Cup-winning captain. There was a belief that higher honours had been denied Moore because of the accusation levelled against him of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery shop in Bogota en route to the 1970 World Cup finals in Mexico. False: Moore (second right) was wrongly accused of stealing a bracelet from a jewellery shop in 1970 . Those charges were false and withdrawn but they famously consigned him to house arrest, delaying his arrival in Mexico, and he sensed the stigma had stuck in some quarters. So I am obliged to reaffirm him telling me that ‘one of the younger lads in the squad did something foolish, a prank with unfortunate consequences.’ Whodunnit? Years later, at the mellow end of one of our very long evenings, Bobby entrusted me with the name of the suspect on the sworn pledge never to reveal it, at least not before both he and the culprit died. That, I will continue to honour for so long as I live. Moore lives on. In that imposing statue at Wembley, for which I had the privilege of writing the inscription. In the annals of his countless commanding performances. Through the sadness which engulfed his first wife Tina, daughter Roberta and his grandchildren at the tragic and premature loss of the only other male member of the family, his son Dean. His legacy includes the fund for fighting the bowel cancer which killed him, for which the devoted efforts of his widow Stephanie have raised more than £20million, thus far. Legacy: The Bobby Moore Fund has raised more than £20million to tackle bowel cancer . Living on: Stephanie, wife of Bobby, opened the first Bobby Moore Fund Laboratory for Bowel Cancer Research . Since his death 21 years ago the accolades have kept coming: Elected to FIFA’s All-Time World Cup XI, voted into the World Team of the Century, inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, named as England’s Golden Player in UEFA’s list of the 50 greatest European footballers. But still no knighthood. Still no place in the pantheon of Sir Walter Winterbottom, Sir Stanley Matthews, Sir Tom Finney, Sir Alf Ramsey, Sir Matt Busby, Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir Geoff Hurst, Sir Bobby Robson, Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Trevor Brooking. The honours committee reacted too slowly after Moore’s illness became public, and now hide behind the rules prohibiting knighthoods after death — despite including the nation’s law-makers in their group. One segment of the biography contains these sentiments: In all honesty, in all decency, in all sanity an exception should be made to the protocol which refuses posthumous knighthoods. This is a national hero. It cannot be beyond Parliament’s resources to enact a specific statute of exemption. In the shocked aftermath of Bobby Moore’s death, thousands upon thousands added their signatures to the petitions for him to be knighted.

Everton have suffered a major blow ahead of the start of the new season after Ross Barkley was ruled out for between six to eight weeks. The England international, who recently committed his future to his boyhood club by signing a new four-year deal, has suffered a knee ligament injury in training and his absence will cause a major headache for manager Roberto Martinez. Barkley was hurt during training at the club's Finch Farm headquarters on Friday and was seen leaving with his leg in a supportive brace. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ross Barkley smash one in during England training . Setback: Everton's Ross Barkley (right) is set to miss the opening six weeks of the season with a knee injury . Blow: The England international was hurt during a session at the club's Finch Farm training ground on Friday . The midfielder must now undergo scans to determine how long he will be on the sidelines. The best case scenario is that he will be able to return within six weeks but, even still, he will be a big miss for Everton, who have a demanding opening to the campaign that includes assignments against Chelsea and Arsenal before the end of the month. If Barkley is out for eight weeks, however, he will miss Everton's return to Europe on September 18, as well as the first Merseyside derby at Anfield on September 27. Not only that, he will be ruled out of England's forthcoming friendly against Norway at Wembley and the opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland. There is no indication yet whether Barkley requires surgery to correct the damage, which was suffered in an accidental collision. That, however, will be no solace to Martinez, who has frequently championed Barkley's ability and made the 20-year-old one of the key figures in his starting line-up.

And the scope of the inquiry, revealed in a letter sent by chairman Greg Dyke to all councillors and staff members following the last FA board meeting, suggests the world’s most famous club knockout tournament will have a radical makeover. Dyke writes: ‘The review will consider the Cup’s audience, attendances, format, place in the fixture calendar, prize and rewards and brand and rights. They will report to the board before the end of the season and recommendations will form part of the new plan.’ Cup of joy: Arsenal ended their trophy drought with a Wembley win in May, but the competition faces an overhaul . The FA know they must do something about their historic competition, which still has no sponsor for next season and has prize-money for the winner less than the fee Premier League clubs receive for a single live match. An FA spokesman said: ‘The review is all about the FA Cup remaining relevant to a young audience.’ The Ageas Bowl proved a difficult venue for the third Test, with poor crowds, unsatisfactory transport arrangements — the park-and-ride system was cancelled on Thursday — and a ground that resembled a building site in places. Yet Ian Botham and Shane Warne, who just happened to have been house guests of Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove during the Test, were conspicuous for the way they sang their praises of the ground while commentating for Sky.

The £20million summer signing from Southampton was considered one of the best centre backs in the Premier League last season before he picked up an ankle injury.

'I think if Lovren establishes himself in the team became a top player by showing the same form he has at Southampton for Liverpool, then in the next few years when Stevie does decide to call it day he will be in contention. 'You look at him and he has the potential to make a big powerful impact at the back and that’s what Liverpool need.’ Strong at the back: Lovren had a good season for Southampton before picking up an injury . 'Jordan Henderson is another who could possibly be in contention and there will be more who arrive in that time that could be up for it as well.

"By . Mark Bryans, Press Association . Harry Redknapp saw his QPR side roundly beaten on his return to Tottenham but insists he will stick with his new formation. The 67-year-old was at White Hart Lane for the first time since being sacked in 2012 but his Rangers team were outclassed as Tottenham cantered to a 4-0 victory. Nacer Chadli scored twice, with Eric Dier scoring his second goal in as many weeks and Emmanuel Adebayor adding a fourth after the break. Leading the way: Harry Redknappy refuses to ditch Queens Park Rangers' 3-5-2 system . Mauricio Pochettino saw his attacking players shine, especially in the first half up against the back three on which Redknapp has pinned his survival hopes. Rio Ferdinand, Steven Caulker and Richard Dunne were given the runaround before Redknapp reacted by changing to a back four for the second half. Despite an improved performance, with only one goal shipped, Redknapp is not ready to give up on his 3-5-2 formations. 'I don't know if that (the system) is a problem,' he said. 'We played okay last week playing that well, it is about energy really. We were slower on the ball and were off the pace a bit - in certain areas we weren't sharp enough. We have to work harder both with and without the ball. 'I don't think it is systems. That system allows me to get two strikers into the team which I was trying to do. '(Loic) Remy doesn't play up on his own, it is difficult. Charlie Austin doesn't play up on his own. You look to play 4-4-2 and you get slaughtered in midfield, it is not easy.' Dejected: Joey Barton and Rio Ferdinand gaze into the distance as they were roundly beaten at Tottenham . Easy pickings: Emmanuel Adebayor slid home Tottenham's fourth goal at White Hart Lane on Sunday . The size of the victory saw Pochettino's side move to the top of the Barclays Premier League table, but the former Southampton boss was quick to dispel any early season talk of a title tilt. 'It is nothing,' he replied when asked about Tottenham sitting top of the table. 'It is two games. The most important thing is to try and develop our style and philosophy, (against QPR) we showed our basis. 'For me, it is important that the team show they are a team. We played like a team all together and we can achieve something. 'It is important to keep the reality and stay calm. If you lose two games you are in danger but we need to keep calm, it is only the beginning of the season.' Pochettino remains more interested on getting his style in place rather than worrying about where Spurs sit in the standings. 'I'm in charge for my first season at Tottenham and at the moment we want to put in place our philosophy and play in the way that Tottenham have played in their history,' he added. 'We are very pleased. In front of our supporters and our first game of the season here it was a good game for us. I think we played well. We have players that can play in this way and we have belief.'","Premier League new boys were beaten 4-0 at White Hart Lane .

"By . Craig Hope for the Daily Mail . Louis van Gaal failed to get his first win as Manchester United manager after being held to a 1-1 draw with Sunderland. United's Spanish playmaker Juan Mata opened the scoring before the Black Cats' £10 million summer signing Jack Rodwell equalised in the second-half. Sportsmail reporter Craig Hope was at the Stadium of Light to give his views... Scroll down for video . Crock star: Jack Rodwell almost hurt himself while celebrating his equaliser against Manchester United . Rodwell has had his fitness problems in recent years and he very nearly had another celebrating his equaliser against Van Gaal’s team. The midfielder, who joined Sunderland from champions Manchester City over the summer, slipped before crashing down on his backside in front of the ecstatic home fans. His joyous team-mates quickly hauled him back to his feet and, thankfully, Rodwell was OK. Here's one I made earlier: Referee Martin Atkinson (R) was able to recycle his vanishing spray . We had our first instance of vanishing spray being recycled. United had only just defended a free-kick from the right channel when Santiago Vergini seized upon the clearance only to be chopped down again by Ashley Young in exactly the same spot. Referee Martin Atkinson  merely had to ‘touch up’ his earlier effort. We've heard of the Black Cats, but what about the white dogs? A pair of huskies — complete with Sunderland shirts and red and white ribbons — were spotted outside the ground before the game. It’s just a shame Sunderland lacked the attacking bite to see off United, whose forward line was similarly toothless. United had 10 shots on goal, but could not add to Juan Mata’s 17th-minute opener. In-house publications are often criticised for their blinkered view of proceedings. However you cannot level that accusation at Manchester United’s official Twitter feed. Losing his bottle: Juan Mata kicks out in frustration after United fail to take a late opportunity . Honesty is the best policy? Manchester United's Twitter feed gave a frank assessment of the game . For with 85 minutes on the clock they posted: ‘Time is running out at the Stadium of Light and, in truth, Sunderland look the more likely winners at the moment’. A stern-faced Van Gaal, watching from the dugout, would likely have shared that assessment. Sunderland may have edged the contest but their wait for a win over United at the Stadium of Light in the Premier League will enter its 19th year next season. For while they broke an Old Trafford duck dating back to 1968 last season, they’re yet to beat United at home in the post-Roker Park era. Home disadvantage? Sunderland have not beaten United at the Stadium of Light in 19 years . The hosts had 11 shots on United’s goal and earned a glut of free-kicks in attacking areas but couldn’t find the goal to give them their first home league win over United since March 1997.

"By . Craig Hope for the Daily Mail . Jack Rodwell looks like a footballer, he talks like a footballer — albeit an erudite and engaging one — and his CV would suggest he is a very good footballer. He is 23 years old, has been capped by England at every level, has a Premier League winners medal and a total of £22million invested in him by Manchester City and then, earlier this month, Sunderland. But for more than two years — since swapping Everton for the Etihad —Rodwell was not a footballer, and upon reintroduction to his profession at West Brom it showed. Off the pace: Jack Rodwell struggled on his Sunderland debut in the 2-2 draw at West Brom last weekend, but his manager Gus Poyet has backed him to rediscover his best form following his move from Manchester City . Ready for action: Rodwell will likely line up for Sunderland against Manchester United on Sunday . No Premier League debutant scored a lower Sportsmail merit mark than Rodwell’s ‘5’ in the 2-2 draw. This, of course, comes with an almighty caveat, for Rodwell had not started a league game for 11 months. It should sound as a cautionary tale for youngsters lured to the likes of City, for no matter his talk of ‘learning curves’ and ‘no regrets’, here is a player who has stood still in the stands. At The Hawthorns a week ago he looked lost, as if he had forgotten how to perform on such a stage, unable to showcase his ability. The accelerated evolution of the Premier League, of course, means players are quicker, stronger and fitter than even two years ago — Rodwell has some catching-up to do. Forgotten man: Rodwell was starved of game time during his two seasons at Manchester City . Faith: Sunderland manager Gus Poyet believes Rodwell will come good with more time on the pitch . International return? Rodwell is targeting more appearances for England . In the days before the game he had sat with journalists and confidently held court, bullishly declaring he was good enough to play for England in central midfield or defence. His subsequent effort on the field, however, made his words seem premature. For now, Gus Poyet is protecting the £10m man. ‘This week he has been much better (in training),’ said the Uruguayan, who subbed Rodwell in the second half. ‘In the first half, we didn’t help him. He couldn’t get into the game. I took him off when he was starting to influence the game, you can blame me.’ Gary Bennett — the former Sunderland captain who came through the ranks at Manchester City — agrees. Towering: Rodwell beats Craig Gardner in the air during last weekend's match at The Hawthorns . ‘Jack will only get better,’ he said. ‘He will come good. He has not played for a long time and it will take a little while for his timing and fitness to improve. ‘But he is young. I know people say he has wasted two years, but he would have learnt a lot at City and he comes here hungry. We just have to be patient.’ This is the year Rodwell must start playing like the footballer we all hoped he would become.","Rodwell looked off the pace on his Sunderland debut at West Brom .

"By . Mark Duell . Toddler: Sophia Parslow died in Gloucestershire after becoming entangled in a window blind cord . A toddler tragically died after becoming entangled in a window blind cord, an inquest heard today. Sophia Parslow's mother had only left her in the lounge watching her favourite TV show for a few minutes when she popped upstairs. In those few moments the 17-month-old - described as a ‘happy, typically inquisitive toddler’ - had climbed onto a chair to either look out of the window or to try to reach a photograph hidden behind the curtain when she became caught in the nylon blind cord on the morning of June 27 this year. Her mother, Amanda O'Halloran, came back downstairs and discovered Sophia behind the curtain hanging from the cord in the lounge of their home in Tirley, near Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire. Miss O'Halloran called 999 and desperately tried to revive her daughter using the first aid training she had learned a few weeks earlier. Sophia was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors spent more than an hour attempting to revive the toddler but they were unable to save her. Miss O'Halloran, 22, and her partner Chris Parslow were too upset to attend today's hearing at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court. In a statement read to the hearing, Miss O'Halloran said she had left Sophia watching Peppa Pig while she went upstairs to get some of her daughter's clothing because Mr Parslow's mother Karen was arriving to collect her granddaughter for the day. ‘I would say it was between 10.45am and 10.50am by now. I used the toilet quickly, selected some clothes for Sophia to wear. I was no more than four minutes,’ Miss O'Halloran said. Memories: Sophia with her parents Amanda O'Halloran and Chris Parslow  at her christening in Cheltenham in September 2012 . ‘I came back down and panicked. I could not hear or see Sophia anywhere and I couldn't work it out because the lounge is only a small area. ‘She could not have gone into the kitchen because the door was shut. I stood behind the closed stair gate and I could still not see her. Trauma: Mr Parslow and Miss O'Halloran hold a photograph of their daughter Sophia Parslow . ‘I then saw that she was behind the right hand curtain by the window. I rushed over to her and saw that she was suspended by her neck from the chain of the window blind to the right hand side of the window behind the curtain. ‘I picked her up and saw that she was unconscious. I gave her a shake to try and wake her up but she did not respond and I could see that she had vomited. ‘I picked up the phone and called 999 and put her on the floor of the lounge and gave her CPR for about 10 minutes over the phone. ‘However, I already knew what I had to do as I had been on a child first aid course a few weeks before. I kept repeating the 30 compressions to two breaths of air as I was told.’ Miss O'Halloran, a hotel receptionist, said the paramedics arrived and continued with the attempts to resuscitate her daughter. Sophia was taken by ambulance to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors battled for over an hour to save her life. A post mortem examination found her injuries to be consistent with being suspended by a blind cord and gave the cause of death as ‘suspension by ligature’. ‘Since this has happened myself and Chris have had a chance to look and see what might have happened to Sophia,’ Miss O'Halloran said. ‘It is clear that the ornaments on the window sill had been knocked over. I did not knock these over lifting Sophia up and the paramedics had no cause to go near the window since I had placed her on the floor. Treatment: Sophia was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where doctors spent more than an hour attempting to revive the toddler but they were unable to save her . ‘I realised afterwards that the . picture of Sophia which had been lost from the frame was behind the . curtain on the right hand side of the window sill and as such Sophia . must have tried to get the picture knocking over the ornaments on the . window sill as she did so.’ 'To these . parents it was an almost unimaginable sequence of events - a tragic . accident with consequences every parent fears - it is their absolute . nightmare' Katy Skerrett, assistant coroner for Gloucestershire . She . added that Mr Parslow had removed the standard roller blind from the . window, which had been there before they moved into the cottage, and it . had been given to the police. Detectives who investigated Sophia's death regarded it as a tragic accident with no suspicious circumstances. Katy Skerrett, assistant coroner for Gloucestershire, recorded a conclusion of accidental death. ‘In my judgment it is very clear Sophia was left alone for a matter of minutes by her mother in the lounge,’ she said. Looking out: Following Sophia's death, her parents launched a campaign, called Sophie's Cause, to ban looped blind cords from people's homes . According to health and safety campaigners The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, at least 27 people have died after becoming entangled in blind cords since 1999. RoSPA is supporting The Make It Safe campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the potential dangers of looped cords among families with small children. The group cites research saying most accidental deaths involving blind cords happen in the bedroom and occur in children between 16 months and 36 months old. Sophie (above) died aged 17 months. More than half happen at around 23 months. These toddlers are mobile, but their heads still weigh proportionately more than their bodies compared to adults. In addition, RoSPA says that their muscular control is not yet fully developed, which makes them more prone to being unable to free themselves if they become entangled. And toddlers' windpipes have not yet fully developed, which means that they suffocate far more quickly if their necks are constricted. Similarly to drowning, toddlers can be strangled quickly and quietly by looped cords with carers nearby, potentially unaware of what is happening. To reduce the risk posed by looped cords, including blind cords, the RoSPA advises that cords are kept out of the reach of children. ‘Her mother had gone upstairs to obtain Sophia's clothing leaving Sophia in the lounge watching her favourite programme. ‘In . those few minutes Sophia, a happy, typically inquisitive toddler, . climbed onto the chair and I find it more probable than not that Sophia . was perhaps trying to look out of the window or trying to reach the . photo of herself hidden behind the curtain. ‘In so doing she managed to become entangled in the blind cord and suspended from it. ‘It . is a situation that whilst blinds are a known safety hazard to small . children and some of the modern blinds often carry a warning, no parent . thinks it will ever happen to them. ‘To . these parents it was an almost unimaginable sequence of events - a . tragic accident with consequences every parent fears - it is their . absolute nightmare. ‘The appropriate conclusion in this case is therefore accidental death.’ Following Sophia's death, her parents launched a campaign, called Sophie's Cause, to ban looped blind cords from people's homes. Their campaign, which includes an online petition signed by nearly 4,000 people and a Facebook page, has won widespread support. Earlier today Miss O'Halloran posted a message on the 'Ban Looped Blind Cords in the UK - Sophia's Cause' Facebook group, which said: ‘Sophia's inquest is today. I hate how it has been dragged out but it's just one of those formalities. ‘Christopher and I have decided we are not going to attend the inquest, we are not required to go anyway, it was a hard decision but one I think is for the best. ‘We know everything that is going to be said, I am an emotional wreck right now and don't think I'd be able to hold myself together. ‘Mummy and Daddy love you so much princess, sending you big kisses now xxxxxx’","Sophia Parslow's mother left her in lounge watching TV for a few minutes .

But Ince Jnr decided against following in his father’s stud marks and instead joined up with one of his old man’s former Manchester United team-mates, Steve Bruce, in a decidedly less romantic location – Hull. Nevermind that: Tom Ince insists he is 'over the moon' at Hull despite the earlier interest from Inter Milan . Earlier days: Ince played for Blackpool, before joining Crystal Palace on loan, and is now with Hull City . It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football... There's £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest-scoring manager! The 22-year-old, however, is thrilled with his new surrounds, rejecting the Italian giants to swap the west coast of Blackpool for the east of Humberside. ‘I am over the moon,’ said Ince, who signed a two-year deal at the KC Stadium in July. ‘I have found my home. With the manager, when someone helps you out like that, not only on the pitch but off the pitch, you are happy. ‘When you are happy off the pitch the performances come on it. I know what I want to do, I’ve got ambitions in myself. But first of all it is to try and do well for Hull City.’ And what of turning down the offer from Inter? ‘I’ve said to many people, it’s easy to just reach for the stars and go for the top and think “Yeah, I’m doing this, I’m doing that”. But you have to think football,’ said the England Under-21 forward. ‘There are not many 20, 21, 22-year-olds that are playing week in, week out in the Premier League now. ‘I am with a great bunch of lads and there are a lot of games coming up, hopefully in the Europa League and in the cup runs as well, there is plenty of football to be played.’ Hull will have to overcome a 1-0 deficit to Sporting Lokeren this week if they are to extend their stay in the Europa League. Ince was a second-half substitute on Thursday as the Belgians nicked victory following a gift from goalkeeper Allan McGregor. And he reflected: ‘It’s a learning curve. This is our first ever time in this tournament. These European teams, you have to learn, you have to adjust to it. ‘Throughout the game we looked the better side, we kept the ball. We had a 10-minute spell where we were a little bit shaky but we soon got back under control and started creating chances. There are lots of positives to take into next week and we will be ready to take them on at the KC.’ Inter Milan are one possible opponent should Hull progress to the group stage. The San Siro, then, could yet await Ince this season.

"By . David Charlesworth, Press Association . Hull boss Steve Bruce has said a potential deal to sign Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes is 'dead and buried'. The former Sunderland manager was keen on bringing the prolific Championship striker to the KC Stadium following the departure of Shane Long to Southampton for £12million earlier this month. Bruce reported Blackburn were open to selling their star asset, but that they had changed their minds, with the former Wigan and Sunderland boss now conceding defeat in his pursuit of the Scotland international. Staying put: Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes will not be joining Hull City this summer . Disappointed: Steve Bruce now has under a week to sign a replacement for former striker Shane Long . 'It's dead and buried,' Bruce said. 'We got an indication from Blackburn that they were willing to do a deal and that obviously changed in 24 hours. That's their prerogative. 'If they'd have said that to start with - that he wasn't for sale no matter what we wanted to do - then fine, we'll walk away. 'But unfortunately it gets a bit protracted and last weekend we thought it was close and then all of a sudden he's not for sale, so we'll move on to the next one.' Bruce admitted his frustration at coming so close to landing the 24-year-old, who has scored 53 goals in 93 Championship appearances since joining Rovers two years ago, and blamed the constant scrutiny being placed on the deal. 'It gets into the public domain and all of a sudden it's not going to happen,' Bruce added. 'It's disappointing for everybody concerned, but more disappointing, I would presume, for somebody like Jordan.' Replacement needed: Long decided to leave Hull City to join Southampton earlier this month . Perhaps understandably, Bruce was a little more reticent about naming his other targets, but did reveal the club were nearing a deal to boost their forward line. 'We're close to one or two things, very close on one in particular, which will be a fantastic addition if we pull it off, but until it's really, really rubber stamped then I'm not going to say much,' he said. 'I really don't want to comment after last week's debacle on Jordan Rhodes. It would be wise of me to say nothing.' One person who has already completed his move to east Yorkshire this week is defender Michael Dawson, who signed a three-year deal from Tottenham for an undisclosed fee on Tuesday. Bruce is thrilled with his latest acquisition, believing Dawson's maturity at the back will be vital as Hull battle on domestic and European fronts this season. 'We're delighted to get someone of his experience and his ability,' Bruce said. 'I've always thought that especially in the centre of defence, a little bit of experience does everybody the world of good. 'It's been a long drawn out process but we eventually got him which I'm delighted about.' Done deal: Former Tottenham defender Michael Dawson became Hull City's sixth summer signing .

"By . Simeon Gholam for MailOnline . Follow @@SimGholam . Nottingham Forest thrashed Reading 4-0 at the City Ground to return to the top of the Championship table on Saturday. Norwich City's 1-0 win at Ipswich earlier in the day had put the Canaries first for a couple of hours, but Michail Antonio, returning to haunt his former club, scored twice before Matty Fryatt and Britt Assombalonga rounded off the scoring to restore Stuart Pearce side's position at the summit. Elsewhere, Jordan Rhodes, Grant Hanley and Rudy Gestede all netted for Blackburn as they raced into a 3-0 half time lead at home against Bournemouth. The Cherries seemed down and out before a Brett Pitman penalty and Steve Cook pulled them to within touching distance of a draw, but it wasn't quite enough as Gary Bowyer's side just held on for a 3-2 victory. Brace: Mikhail Antonio scored twice as Nottingham Forest ran out 4-0 winners against Reading . Celebration: Jordan Rhodes (left) opened the scoring for Blackburn in their 3-2 win over Bournemouth . Bolton's poor start to the season continued as they went down to 2-1 at Brighton. Matt Mills put Dougie Freedman's side in front after 25 minutes, but Craig Mackail-Smith scored his first league goal since New Year's Day 2013 to level the scores before Joao Teixeira scored the winner in the second half. Despite going down to ten men after Tony Craig felled Birmingham's Clayton Donaldson in the area after just 15 minutes, from which Paul Caddis scored the resulting penalty, Brentford fought their way back into the game to clinch a 1-1 draw through Moses Odubajo's late equaliser. Igor Vetokele scored a late equaliser for Charlton to  cancel out Nakhi Wells earlier effort for ten-man Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium, whilst Ben Pringle popped in the winner for Rotherham early on in the second half to hand Millwall their first defeat of the season. Equaliser: Craig Mackail-Smith nearly falls into the net scoring the leveller for Brighton against Bolton . Off the mark: Atdhe Nuhiu's brace for Sheffield Wednesday were his first Championship goals . Sheffield Wednesday secured an impressive win over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium, with an Atdhe Nuhiu brace sandwiching a Stevie May finish to give them a 3-2 win, with Grant Leadbitter scoring twice from the spot for the home side in the closing stages, whilst a last-minute Mark Hudson own goal gave Wolves a dramatic 1-0 win at home to Cardiff. And finally, Fulham fell to their fourth defeat in as many games this season after being thrashed 5-1 by Derby, Leeds had two men sent off in a humbling 4-1 defeat away at Watford, and Wigan beat struggling Blackpool 1-0 to leave them second bottom of the table.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is in no doubt that their Barclays Premier League clash with Manchester City would be a great one to win. However Rodgers has also emphasised it should not necessarily be seen as an indicator of how the clubs' title bids might pan out. The contest at the Etihad Stadium pits the champions - in City - and runners-up from last term against each other. Realistic target: Brendan Rodgers believes his side can get something out of Monday night's game at City . Celebration: Liverpool managed to beat Premier League rivals Manchester City 3-2 at Anfield last season . For each team it is only their second Premier League fixture of the 2014/15 campaign, and Rodgers feels the fact it comes so early makes it particularly significant in terms of needing to make a mark. At the same time, though, he is not going to be reading too deeply into the outcome. 'Whatever time this game comes, it's always very important - and for us, so early on, it's even more significant,' Rodgers said. 'But I don't think it will define everything. It's over the course of the 38 games. 'We did reasonably well in the big games last season, but it's over the course of the 38, and that's something I'll always look at. 'It's early in the season and we started with a great win, and now to go and perform and hopefully get the result is what the aim will be.' Both Liverpool and Manchester City began their Premier League campaigns with victories, triumphing 2-1 against Southampton and 2-0 at Newcastle respectively. Victory: Liverpool claimed a 2-1 win against Southampton on the opening weekend of the Premier League . Certainly neither found their best form as they each picked up the three points, and City boss Manuel Pellegrini said: 'We played very well in the first 35, 45 minutes in all senses. 'Technically and physically we didn't have any problems. We defended very well. 'But maybe in the second half we could not continue with the same pace.' Pellegrini also closely monitored Liverpool's performance against Southampton from the opening weekend. He said: 'I watched that game and we played them also in the United States (this summer in a pre-season friendly), so we know what they are doing.' New City signing Eliaquim Mangala remains unlikely to make his debut as he is still short of match fitness, but fellow defender Pablo Zabaleta could be back in line to start and loan midfielder Frank Lampard is available. City debut: Frank Lampard could make his first appearance for the club since joining the club on loan . Striker Sergio Aguero, who came off the bench to score at Newcastle last week, may not be ready to play 90 minutes. Former City striker Mario Balotelli will not be able to feature even if his proposed transfer to Liverpool from AC Milan goes through before the match, as it needed to have been completed by midday on Friday for the Italian to be eligible. Balotelli's proposed switch to the Merseyside outfit appears to be imminent, with a £16million fee reportedly agreed and the Italy international having visited the club's Melwood training ground on Friday. There could be debuts for Reds summer signings Lazar Markovic and Alberto Moreno, but the wait for England midfielder Adam Lallana (knee) to make his bow will go on.","Brendan Rodgers hopes his side can build on their win against Southampton .

"The San Francisco 49ers officially opened the $1.2billion Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara with a ribbon-cutting ceremony complete with all the opulence of their new home. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh, linebacker Patrick Willis and left tackle Joe Staley joined CEO Jed York and others on stage to cut the ribbons. They used oversized red scissors with gold-colored blades in keeping with team colors. Hard-hat wearing construction workers lined the steps in fluorescent yellow jackets as team employees cheered and a fog horn blared. 'This is a long time in the making,' York said. Spectacular: Levi's Stadium opened to wild applause from 49ers fans as the franchise aims for another Super Bowl run . The stadium's opening put one of the NFL's flagship franchises on firm footing and planted the country's most popular sports league in technology-rich Silicon Valley for the first time. Goodell called it a milestone for the league. He also added a twist to the ceremony by addressing the looming stadium issue just up the road in Oakland, where the Raiders have long been searching for a replacement to the outdated Coliseum. Goodell said it's up to the Raiders to decide whether they want to try to build a stadium in Oakland or share the facility at Levi's Stadium with the 49ers - an idea York has never dismissed. Raiders owner Mark Davis has said he doesn't want to be a renter in the 49ers' facility, which is now fitted with red seats and posters of past and present San Francisco greats. The 49ers' new home will hold about 68,500 fans and has the ability to expand to 75,000 for Super Bowl 50 in February 2016. The facility features 165 luxury suites, 9,000 club seats and even a green roof-top deck that includes solar panels and harvested herbs for on-site food preparation. Free Wi-Fi will be available at the stadium, and a smartphone application will allow fans to have food delivered to any seat and check waiting lines at concession stands and bathrooms. 'The stadium reflects the greatness of the region, the technology and the innovation,' Goodell said. Party time: Confetti rains down in Santa Clara as the 49ers' new home was declared open . The seats in the lower bowl will hold some 45,000, or two-thirds of stadium capacity, and will be the largest first level in the NFL. All club levels look out to the field in one direction and the surrounding valley and mountains in another. It's 35 rows up to the first club seating area, while Row 1 of the stadium is about 10 feet off the field. The only lingering stadium concerns from most 49ers fans involve the traffic in an already congested area and rising ticket prices. And, of course, some are still bitter about the team leaving San Francisco, where the team tried and failed for decades to get a new stadium. Levi's Stadium, steps away from 49ers' practice facility, is about 45 miles south of downtown San Francisco - the longest distance any team in the league has to the city that bears its name. The 49ers had played in San Francisco since their establishment in 1946, including the last 43 years at Candlestick Park, where the team won all five of its Super Bowl titles. The whipping wind and cold air from the city's famous fog made conditions constantly change at Candlestick, which is set to be demolished. That's far from the near year-round sunshine - and temperatures that can be 20-25 degrees warmer - in Santa Clara, where most players and coaches already live. Talking a good game: CEO Jed York speaks as the 49ers look forward to another tough season in the NFC West . The 49ers will host Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos in the first preseason game at Levi's Stadium on August 17. The first regular-season game will be against Chicago on September 14, a Sunday night. York said the only promise he has not delivered on with the stadium is a Super Bowl title, and he joked with players and coaches in attendance that there's 'no pressure, guys'. He also said the 49ers will hold a parade on Market Street in San Francisco when - not if - they win another Super Bowl title. 'Now,' he said, 'it's time to make some new memories in our new home.'","The 49ers move to Santa Clara after 43 years at Candlestick Park .

"By . Nick Pisa . Mafia hitmen have shot dead a convicted mobster, his girlfriend and her two-year-old son after forcing them off the road in high speed chase. Target Cosimo Orlando, 43, with travelling in a car with his new partner Carla Maria Fornari, 30 and her son Domenico. The trio were killed instantly after hitmen forced their car off the road and then opened fire with machine guns riddling it with bullets - amazingly two other children inside survived. The child, named as Domenico, was travelling in a car with his mother Carla Maria Fornari, 30 and her new partner and target Cosimo Orlando, 43 . The hit happened at Palagiano, near Taranto, in the southern Italian region of Puglia - popular with British holidaymakers - and in the heartland of the local mafia known as the Sacra Corona Unita. Pictures from the scene showed the red Daewoo Matiz in which the family were travelling pushed up against a barrier, while a silver funeral hearse was parked nearby and police examined the road. Police said that Orlando had been released on parole after being convicted of a double murder in 1998 which was linked to rivalry over lucrative drugs markets. While Fornari's first husband and father of the three children, Domenico Petruzzelli, himself a known mobster was murdered three years ago. Mafia hitmen have shot dead a convicted mobster, his girlfriend and her two-year-old son after forcing them off the road in high speed chase . She was driving the car, while Orlando was sat in the front seat with her three year old son on his lap, in the back their were her other two children aged six and seven years old who were unhurt. All three were killed instantly in the hit which happened late on Monday night and apart from the two children - who are now in police protection - there were no witnesses. A police spokesman said: 'This was a massacre, simple as that. The child stood no chance and was killed instantly along with his mother and Orlando. The hit happened at Palagiano, near Taranto, in the southern Italian region of Puglia - popular with British holidaymakers - and in the heartland of the local mafia known as the Sacra Corona Unita . Mafia hitmen have shot dead a convicted mobster, his girlfriend and her two-year-old son after forcing them off the road in high speed chase . 'We are investigating all possibilities - although we believe that Orlando was probably the intended target we have to remember that his partner was also married to a murdered criminal. 'There could be several motives revenge or drugs both Orlando and Petruzzelli had connections to drugs trafficking and they were both involved with organised crime. 'The only witnesses are the two children who are in a secret location with police and hopefully they will be able to give us some clues.' It is not the first time that children have been innocent victims as a result of mob hits - earlier this year another three year old boy was murdered after gunmen targeted a car he was travelling in killing two men as well. Police revealed Domenico, was named after his father who was shot dead three months before he was born. They said he was two and a half adding that he would have turned three in August. The other two children were named as Mauro, seven and Davide, six. Laura Gioia, the headteacher of the primary school they attended, said:'We must now think of them, all our thoughts are with Mauro and Davide. They are two lovely boys and so was little Domenico. 'The whole family has been marred by tragedy, first the father, now the mother and her youngest child. We must protect them from the terrible memories that they will have and that will probably never leave them.' Today even the Italian PM Matteo Renzi expressed his shock at the killings saying:'This is a painful atrocity and I feel it first as a father and then as premier,' adding that he had been in touch with Taranto's police chief for a full briefing on the shootings. Rosy Bindi, president of the Italian parliament anti mafia commission, said:'This slaughter at Taranto with the murder of a child, shows even if it were still necessary the brutality of mafia violence, they know no morals. 'This is confirmation that there is no mafia code and it has never existed. They have always killed, even women and children. I hope that those responsible are caught quickly as well as those that ordered this slaughter. This murders must be stopped and punished quickly. 'My thought go also to the two children who escaped this slaughter. Now they must have the support of the institutional authorities to rebuild their lives as quickly as possible to guarantee them some sort of future and normal life, avoiding that they are conditioned by crime.' The interior minister Angelinio Alfano deployed 60 extra officers to the area to help in the hunt for the killers and ensure law and order was maintained. Local priest father Francesco Zito, of Pagliano, who knew the victims said: 'There are no words to describe this. I am not going to get involved in the background of their private lives - an adult can make a mistake and answer to his conscience but a two and a half year old child ? There is no need to comment further.' Mayor Gaetano Tarasco said:'I think Carla was killed because she was going out with Orlando. She was killed because of who she knew and who she was seeing. 'There was nothing about her linked to organised crime - her children were her life. This is a painful act, ferocious act which has claimed innocent victims and leaves the town a little worried. Drugs are an increasing problem here and in the surrounding area and we need more police.' Locals in the town also said that Carla had testified against the two men who had killed her husband and who had been jailed for life prompting speculation that may also have been a motive.","The target of the hit was  Cosimo Orlando, 43, who was a convicted criminal .

"By . Anna Edwards . A company is selling t-shirts with the slogan 'Keep Calm And Rape Them' emblazoned across the chest on Amazon. The online clothing store, Solid Gold Bomb, sells the short-sleeved t-shirts for between £15 and £17 on the warehouse website.

They posted a variety of responses to Facebook users, saying they had deleted the product and saying that the message had been generated from the dictionary. Andrew Banks wrote: 'I'm disgusted by this product, and can think of no good reason for such a slogan. That someone thought it was a good idea disturbs me somewhat.' Devin wrote: 'You guys are kidding with this shirt's slogan, right? In what universe is that shirt remotely acceptable in civilized society? Gross.' The Solid Gold Bomb Facebook page claimed a computer programme had generated the offensive slogan . The website said they were deleting the tshirts and said they appreciated everyone's 'understanding' of the mistake . Anonymoosh demanded answers from both the creators and Amazon: 'In what society is this even acceptable? and why is Amazon listing these? there is no possible justification including a misplaced sense of irony for wearing a Tshirt with this message on it.'

'I appreciate everyone's comments but please, accept this as a mistake as we certainly do not condone ""rape""...' Twitter users vented their fury that the t-shirts 'promote rape' and also poke fun at the serious sexual assault. Angry users urged others to email the clothes shop and Amazon to express their disgust and demands that it be removed from sale.

The pilot also made an announcement that 'there was smoke in the cockpit and the radar failed', it has been claimed. Flight UA201 - a Boeing 777 carrying 335 passengers and 12 crews from Honolulu to Guam - was forced to set down on Midway Island, a tiny 2.4-square-mile atoll in the Pacific, on Friday. A 'mechanical error' has been blamed for the diversion, which occurred about three hours into the flight, United spokeswoman Mary Clark told The MailOnline, however the aircraft was delayed on the tarmac before leaving Hawaii on Thursday, as airport maintenance crews reportedly worked to fix an undisclosed issue. Passengers were told of an unidentified odor in the cockpit before the flight and some even got off, according to at least two on board.

'The captain said there was smoke in the cockpit and the radar failed and other electronic systems were failing, so they had to land,' she told CNN. 'At one point there was one drop of about 40 feet. 'After that turbulence, it got really silent. I thought everybody was praying, and we were coming in on the wings of faith. We were all praying.' Von-Merveldt said she, like many people, were asleep when the problems started to obviously become serious, and she awoke to hear a flight attendant having a nervous conversation with another passenger. Midway Island: An old gymnasium on the atoll was opened up to house the passengers from UA201 for a few hours until a backup plane arrived to take them to Guam . Elated: Passengers pose with the pilots in the gymnasium of Midway Island after the dramatic landing . 'When more people woke up, they made an announcement,' Von-Merveldt. 'I could understand they didn't want mutiny. First we thought it was of a storm hitting Guam. 'Then the smell got worse in the cabin, and I started to gag because of the smell of chemicals. The attendants were busy. 'In between they would communicate saying they were busy in the cockpit trying to figure things out.' Von-Merveldt said she now believes the plane should never have left Honolulu, because they was clearly uncertainty. 'They told us they had a problem with a smell on the cockpit. Passenger Teresita Smith, who was also . traveling with several family members on the flight, told reporters a . burning smell filled the aircraft. The passengers were so terrified many were loudly praying. 'It . was terribly frightening.  There was no doubt, 100 per cent emotion, of . the feeling that the plane was going to go down,' she told KITV. Flight: The Boeing 777 was carrying 335 passengers and 13 crew members (file picture) Diversion: The flight was heading from Honolulu to Guam when it was diverted to the remote island of Midway . Midway Island - an atoll 1,300 miles northwest of Honolulu - was used by the Navy as a base during the Cold War but abandoned in 1996. It's now a national wildlife refuge, home to more than one million seabirds, green sea turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals. The island's residents manage the airstrip and wildlife refuge. They opened an old gymnasium for the passengers of UA201. Inside, passengers sat on folding chairs and rested on the floor. As it was the middle of the night - or early Friday morning local time - shops were opened and the passengers were given food. The barely populated island is a national wildlife refuge home to more than 1 million seabirds, green sea turtles and endangered Hawaiian monk seals . After a few hours of waiting, a new . flight, UA2105, flew the passengers to Guam, where they landed Saturday . about 6pm local time, Clark said. 'We’re . currently reviewing the mechanical issue and circumstances surrounding . the diversion of flight 201 and will not be able to provide additional . details until our review is complete,' Clark said.","Flight UA201 from Honolulu to Guam set down on remote island of Midway due to 'mechanical problem'

"By . Gerri Peev . It emerged that Lib Dems complained that Jo Swinson (pictured with Nick Clegg) became pregnant when a minister . A woman Liberal Democrat who hoped to become an MP was told by her local party not to get pregnant because the electorate did not want to see a ‘baby hanging off your t***’. The shocking remark was made by an older woman who held a senior post in the constituency association and helped with selections. Speaking privately, the former candidate said: ‘My jaw dropped when I was told, “I hope you are not planning on falling pregnant. We don’t want a baby hanging off your t*** during the campaign”.’ The revelations came as other women .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Paul Ryan hugs his wife Janna during a welcome home rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin . At age 15, Paul Ryan was already feeling isolated from his father, who had grown distant from his family and leaned heavily on whiskey. Then one morning the future congressman found his alcoholic father in bed, dead from an apparent heart attack at age 55. It's a formative story the Republicans' 2012 vice presidential nominee has not fully told publicly before now. In an interview with Associated Press, Ryan said the event shaped him as a politician and as a family man - and figures heavily into whether he will seek the presidency in 2016. 'Having not had a dad for a long time, it brings you much closer to your kids and your family,' Ryan said from New York as he begins a tour to promote his new book, 'The Way Forward: Renewing the America Idea'. As Ryan weighs up a presidential campaign, talk turns to his three children. The oldest, Liza, is about to turn 13. Ryan says he is not eager to spend even more time away from Janesville, the small Wisconsin town where he grew up and where he and his wife, Janna, have raised their own family. 'One of the reasons why I've always passed elected leadership positions up in the House - you know, speaker, leader, all the things people ask you to run for - is because it takes you away from your family even more,' Ryan said. 'I've made career decisions based upon family balance and part of that is because of my own upbringing and my own childhood.' During his turn as Mitt Romney's vice presidential nominee, Ryan often returned to Janesville on weekends. In the final weeks of the campaign, Janna and the children joined him on the plane or on bus tours that went on for hundreds of miles each day. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney shakes hands with running mate Ryan (L) during the final session of the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida in 2012 . Ryan with his wife Janna and daughter Liza and sons Charles, left, and Sam, right, during a welcome home rally . Ryan's stint as Romney's number two lasted 87 days. A two-year presidential campaign would be tougher as well as longer, keeping his family traipsing through early nominating Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. And that is before the frenetic head-to-head race against the Democratic nominee if he were to win the nomination. But in his new book, Ryan lays the policy-heavy groundwork for a presidential campaign - or perhaps an expanded role in the House. He is expected to give up the gavel of the House Budget Committee and shift to the powerful Ways and Means Committee early next year. While there is plenty of partisan criticism of President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies - he calls the Obama administration 'lawless' - the book's personal revelations are the ones that could soften his image as a hard-nosed budget negotiator. None is more personal than his father's drinking. Ryan has written a new book, titled 'The Way Forward: Renewing the America Idea', in which he opens up about finding his father dead from alcohol . Ryan describes a morning phone call from his father's assistant during the summer of 1986. The unexpected call roused the younger Ryan after a late night working at the local McDonald's. The assistant said Paul Murray Ryan, a lawyer, had clients waiting for him at the office. Ryan went looking for his father around their Janesville home and checked his parents' bedroom. 'It was obvious I wouldn't be able to save him,' he writes in the book. 'His heart had stopped and he was gone.' Years of drinking had taken their toll, Ryan said. His father had struggled with alcohol addiction and at one point checked himself into an in-patient treatment program. He stayed sober for more than 20 years, but then slipped back into a pattern of whiskeys from the time he came home until the time he went to bed. 'I've never talked about it before,' Ryan said. He said the relationship with his father had 'atrophied', especially during the two years before the heart attack. 'While he certainly tried to fight it, my dad's addiction eventually won out,' he writes. 'Over time, it made him more distant, irritable and stressed. Before I lost him to a heart attack, whiskey had washed away some of the best parts of the man I knew.' His mother was visiting Denver when her husband died. The high school sophomore started planning for funeral services before his mother returned home and learned about the death. 'I grew up real fast,' Ryan said. Why, after not discussing his father's struggles during previous campaigns, did Ryan write about it now? 'It would have been incomplete had I not discussed it,' he said in the interview. 'I thought it would have been too whitewashed had I not talked about it.'","Ryan found his father of the same name dead in bed when he was 15 .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . Supermarkets should be banned from offering cut price deals on junk food to stop poorer families getting fat, the head of the health select committee has warned. Dr Sarah Wollaston told MailOnline that too many special offers were on crisps, sweets and fizzy drinks, which encouraged cash-strapped shoppers to have a poor diet. She warned voluntary agreements with big chains had not worked and regulation was now needed to force stores to offer discounts on fruit and vegetables. Special offers on crisps, sweets and fizzy drinks should be banned to encourage poorer families to eat more healthily, Dr Sarah Wollaston said . A study in 2012 by the University of East Anglia’s Norwich Business School found that discounts and buy one, get one free deals were skewed towards unhealthy products . Research suggests there is a link between levels of income and the likelihood of obesity, particularly amongst women. Dr Wollaston, a former GP, has vowed to use her election to the health committee to challenge 'all the crap from the lobbying industry, big alcohol and junk food industry'. She said: 'The level of obesity is double in the most disadvantaged households. 'It is not just about the fact you are more likely to die earlier. You are more likely to spend more years with a disability. The cost of all of this is spiralling out of control.' The government's Responsibility Deals – encouraging firms to sign voluntary agreements to improve public health – have not worked, Dr Wollaston said. 'One of the reasons why the most disadvantaged people are running into difficulties is partly because the healthy food is more expensive. 'If you are struggling on a budget, you are much more likely to pick food on special offers. But all of the special offers tend to be on crisps, sweets and junk food. Tory MP Dr Wollaston, a former GP,  has vowed to to challenge 'all the crap from the lobbying industry, big alcohol and junk food industry' 'Just by saying to the big vested interest supermarkets, if you are going to have loss leaders, put them on foods that are healthy. 'People can buy two packs, but don't let's see any more loss leaders on unhealthy food. 'The junk food industry is not going to do this voluntarily because they worry about the other manufacturer down the road. The industry says it needs regulation.' In 2012 a study by the University of East Anglia’s Norwich Business School discounts and buy one, get one free deals were skewed towards unhealthy products. Every year obesity costs the NHS more than £5billion every year and is linked to 40,000 deaths. She argued that if someone wants to lead an unhealthy lifestyle 'of course that's entirely up to them'. But the government should intervene, with new regulations if necessary, to make it harder for people to buy junk food. She also wants an end to 'supersize' deals in fast food restaurants and cinemas, where for a few pence more people are offered bigger drinks, snacks or meals. 'While some people say it is draconian to say you cannot sell mega-bucket sized portions of sugary drinks, why is it such a trauma to say it should be a standard size? Most of us tend to take the default size. 'If you want to buy two, buy two. It is a simple way to say can you cut the calories. To some extent we have to accept that we may not change it for everyone. 'But if there are simple things which take calories out, we should just get on with it.' One in 10 children aged 2-10 is obese, rising to almost a third among the over-65s, official figures show . She also wants calories stripped out of canteens in schools and hospitals and a ban on advertising of junk food to children. Around 10 per cent of children aged 2-10 is classed as obese, rising to almost 19 per cent among 11-15-year-olds, 24 per cent of working age adults and 30 per cent of the over-65s. 'No-one should pretend there's a single thing we can do to wave a magic wand and everyone is suddenly slim and fit,' Dr Wollaston added. 'There is a huge amount of personal responsibility. But it is now so serious we need to state to step in and take some measures. 'The choice is you either do nothing and carry on saying it's all down to personal choice and you continue to pick up a huge bill through the NHS. 'We have to take out junk food calories and help to get people moving and more active.' The Department of Health insists there is 'no magic bullet to solve the problem' of obesity, and will reuiqre effortGovernment, local communities, industry and individuals. A spokesman said: 'Our primary responsibility is to help the nation to be healthier.' The department says that the Responsibility Deal is reducing calories in food and drinks 'to ensure that healthier options are available'. 'We also have a voluntary front of pack labelling scheme which will help people keep track of what they're eating and give them the information to make healthier choices,' the spokesman added.","EXCLUSIVE: Dr Sarah Wollaston warns poorer families end up buying junk .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Monaco's royal family has welcomed its newest member: a baby boy born to the daughter of Princess Caroline. The palace announced this morning that Charlotte Casiraghi, 27, gave birth yesterday at Princess Grace Hospital. She and her 42-year-old French comedy actor boyfriend of two years, Gad Elmaleh, have named the child Raphael. New parents: Monaco royal Charlotte Casiraghi, 27, and her 42-year-old French actor boyfriend, Gad Elmaleh, have welcomed their first child together, a boy named Raphael . The little boy is the second Monegasque royal to be born this year: Charlotte's brother Andrea and his wife Tatiana Santo Domingo welcomed their son Sacha in March. In the run up to the birth, Gad, who has a 12-year-old son named Noé from his relationship with actress Anne Brochet, told People magazine that his girlfriend, Charlotte, would be 'the best mother in the world,' because she is 'generous and loving'. The couple raised eyebrows when they got together in December 2011 because of their 15-year age gap. However, there is no doubt that they are a good match. Just recently, Gad spoke about what drew them together and described his partner as 'a smart and very intelligent girl who has a lot of humour' and makes him the 'happiest man.' 'You can talk about philosophy and make stupid jokes with her,' the Moroccan-born talent continued. Born a royal: Charlotte, who is not herself a princess, is the second child of Caroline (pictured left) and the late Italian businessman Stephano Casiraghi, who died in a boat race accident when she was just four-years-old . 'We go to see art or she will go crazy over a TV show and laugh out loud with me about a stupid gag.' He added: 'We have real conversations and share things. I'm the happiest man - really, I am. I am lucky to be with her.' The Monaco royals have also accepted the relationship, with the actor adding that Princess Caroline laughs at his jokes. 'We have real conversations and share things. I'm the happiest man - really, I am. I am lucky to be with her' Whether the new parents will marry . remains to be seen. This summer rumors emerged that they were engaged . after Charlotte was spotted out and about wearing a silver band on her . left ring finger. However, the couple later snuffed reports with Gad recently musing 'maybe one day'. Charlotte, who is not herself a princess, is the second child of Caroline and the late Italian businessman Stephano Casiraghi, who tragically died in a boat race accident when she was just four-years-old. Caroline is Albert's older sister, daughter of the late Prince Rainier and the late American actress Grace Kelly. Multi-talented: While she will now be focused on motherhood, Charlotte has had a varied career to date as a champion equestrian and a model for Gucci's Forever Now campaign . This makes Charlotte fifth in line to the throne. It emerged that she was pregnant in August as she sported a noticeable baby bump while holidaying in Capri with her beau. Covering her stomach with a loose-fitting dress, the royal didn't seem to be trying to keep the news under the radar as she was spotted going into a maternity shop. She met Gad, who has starred in Priceless and Midnight In Paris, in late 2011 at the party of a mutual friend. While she will now be focused on motherhood, the aristocrat has had a varied career to date, as a champion equestrian, a model for Gucci's Forever Now campaign and a journalist.","The unmarried couple, who met through mutual friends two years ago, have named their son Raphael ."
"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . A pageant mother from Florida fed her teenage daughter tapeworms to help her slim down for a competition, a nurse has revealed. Maricar Cabral-Osori told how she admitted the girl to the ER with severe stomach cramps and initially suspected she was pregnant - something an ultrasound ruled out. However, the cause of the pain became clear when the nurse later found the teenager screaming over a toilet bowl full of tapeworms, she recalled on a recent episode of Untold Stories of the ER. A Florida mother fed her daughter tapeworms so she could lose weight for a beauty pageant; pictured are contestants from Miss America Nevada . Ms Cabral-Osori said the girl's mother, 'who turned white', admitted buying tapeworm eggs in Mexico and feeding them to her daughter. The eggs hatched after the girl ingested them. She said: 'The mom was apologizing to the girl. 'She's like, ''I'm so sorry. You know, I just did it to make you a little skinnier. You needed some help before we went on to the pageant'',' Gawker reported. Ms Cabrai-Osori said the teenager had passed the tapeworms, some of which were 'very long and trying to get out of the toilet bowl'. Tapeoworms have been used for nearly 100 years to increase weight-loss, but doctors have warned the practice is extremely dangerous. Last year Dr Patricia Quinlisk, Medical Director of the Lowa Department of Health, wrote: 'Ingesting . tapeworms is extremely risky and can cause a wide range of unstable . side effects, including rare deaths.

"By . Peter Campbell for the Daily Mail . Tesco has issued a second profit warning in as many months as Aldi and Lidl eat into its sales. The chain slashed the dividend paid to shareholders by 75 per cent  – prompting its shares to hit their lowest level in 11 years. The move follows the ousting of chief executive Philip Clarke last month, with Britain’s biggest grocer haemorrhaging sales to cut-price rivals at one end of the market, and Waitrose at the other. Tesco said its half-year dividend for shareholders will be 1.16p per share - a cut of 75 per cent on last year . Now shoppers are set to profit from Tesco’s misery – with experts predicting the chain will use the money saved through lower dividends to fund steep price cuts in a bid to win back customers. Yesterday Tesco said annual profits would be £2.4billion – some £400million lower than expected – after ‘challenging trading conditions’. The announcement, which helped to wipe more than £1billion from the value of Tesco’s shares, came just days after figures showed the chain is losing both sales and market share. Its new chief executive Dave Lewis, a former Unilever executive, will start on Monday, a month earlier than planned, in a sign of the scale of Tesco’s problems. The supermarket giant has cut its forecast for 2014/15 trading profits to between £2.4 billion and £2.5 billion . The firm’s shares on the London Stock Exchange fell 7 per cent to close 16.35p lower at 229.95p yesterday, after the firm said its half-year dividend will be 1.16p a share – 75 per cent lower than last year. Around 10 per cent of its investors are small shareholders, while millions more hold Tesco shares in their pension funds. The chain will raise £1.3billion by gutting its dividend and cutting back on makeovers for its shops. This will be used to reduce prices, analysts predicted. Tesco launched its £1billion store refurbishment programme two years ago, but the initiative has failed to arrest a fall in sales amid the rise of discount chains. Big job: New boss David Lewis will start on Monday - a month earlier than planned . Tight family budgets have driven shoppers to be more bargain-savvy and Aldi and Lidl have cashed in, more than doubling their sales in five years. This week Lidl said an influx of middle-class shoppers – dubbed ‘the Lidl-classes’ – would push sales up by a fifth this year to more than £4billion. Aldi is also expected to report a leap in trading in the coming weeks. Asda, the only one of the ‘big four’ supermarkets not to lose market share over the last year, has fought back by offering a ‘price lock’ on dozens of essential items. Morrisons, the first of the major chains to suffer due to its large number of stores in the North, has already set aside £1billion to cut prices. Sainsbury’s has teamed up with Netto to open its own range of discount stores, but Tesco has yet to take major action. ‘The company has had its head in the sand,’ said one senior City source. Analyst Clive Black at the bank Shore Capital added: ‘Tesco is expected to cut prices amongst a package of initiatives to regain custom lost elsewhere.’ He said the latest stock market developments ‘raise questions in our minds about the capability of the management under Mr Clarke at this once great company’. Since the departure of Tesco’s visionary boss Sir Terry Leahy, the firm has floundered. It has consistently lost customers over the past three years, and last year reported its first fall in profits in two decades. The chain has also been forced into embarrassing exits from some of its overseas operations; pulling out of the US cost the chain more than £1billion. Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent said: ‘The actions announced today regarding capital expenditure and, in particular, dividends have not been taken lightly.’ A study for The Grocer magazine earlier this month found that Lidl was almost a third cheaper than the leading major supermarket chains, and that both it and Aldi have made dramatic gains in market share. In the 12 months to July 2014, Aldi’s market share rose 32.2 per cent, while Lidl’s grew 19.5 per cent. Retail experts said their success will intensify the competition, forcing bigger chains such as Tesco to ‘up their game’ and slash prices. The Grocer’s ‘shopping basket survey’ found Lidl charged 29.5 per cent less than Tesco for 33 popular lines, and that while a weekly shop at Tesco cost £63.73, the equivalent at Lidl was £49.23. As well as the threat of Aldi and Lidl, Tesco's overseas operation has also suffered. The company has exited both the Japanese and US markets, and in the last financial year, trading profit for its European operations fell as sales in the likes of Hungary, Poland and Turkey, all declined. A Tesco spokesman said today: 'The combination of challenging trading conditions and ongoing investment in our customer offer has continued to impact the expected financial performance of the group.'","Chief executive Dave Lewis told to start position month earlier than planned .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . The police have issued an official warning urging people to beware the dangers of having a one-night stand. The warning came after a married man was robbed of his wallet and phone after a one-night stand in a hotel room. The man, whose wife was not in town, met the stranger in a Manchester bar and invited her back to his hotel room, Greater Manchester Police said. Greater Manchester Police warned people about the dangers of a one-night stand after a man was robbed . But his secret tryst turned into theft overnight and he was left feeling rather sheepish. The man fell asleep at around 3am yesterday morning and woke at 7am to find the woman had disappeared with his wallet, mobile phone and cash from his trouser pocket. He rang Greater Manchester Police to report the theft. Officers were called to an apartment hotel in Manchester city centre at 7.23am. Following the incident, the police warned of the perils of one-night stands. In a tweet, they wrote: 'Beware the one-night stand. Call this am from married man who invited girl back to hotel 3am and woke at 7am to find wallet and phone missing.' Twitter users reacted by saying 'karma' and 'what goes around comes around'. GM Police said the man was robbed of his wallet and phone after a one-night stand in a hotel (stock picture) But others suggested he may not necessarily have been unfaithful. One user tweeted: 'He might only have played a game of Scrabble with the lady! Surely that's not being unfaithful?' But Greater Manchester Police responded by saying: 'He'd get 19 points for using the letters ""unfaithful"" and 50 extra for word over seven letters :)' They later tweeted: 'Unsurprisingly, he doesn't want a victim of crime letter going to his home undermining the web of lies he has spun with his wife.' A recent survey by the site MaritalAffair.co.uk found that Manchester was the most adulterous city in the UK, with one subscriber for every 27 people.","A married man was robbed in a Manchester hotel room .

A new study has revealed that 82 per cent of us regularly trip over our words, with women getting most tongue-tied by every day terminology. And place names can be particularly confusing, according to the study commissioned by London railway station St Pancras International, which is itself frequently mispronounced by 33 per cent of people to sound like the gland 'pancreas'. 1.

And one in six (16 per cent) speakers do not pronounce the south-east London district of 'Greenwich' correctly. The study discovered nearly half of us can't pronounce 'sherbet' (40 per cent), while 34 per cent stumble over 'et cetera'. Nearly a quarter of women (20 per cent) find common words such as 'prescription' and 'espresso' difficult to say, and 24 per cent of people get tongue-tied saying 'often'. Researchers who have compiled a list of the words we find hardest to pronounce say the Italian starter 'bruschetta' has 25 per cent of people regularly stumped. The study found a quarter of British people (23 per cent) feel so worried about getting words like these wrong they even ask someone else to say them. One in six embarrassed speakers (17 per cent) confess to stopping the conversation and apologising for getting mixed up. However, it seems men are less self-conscious, with 35 per cent of males saying they do not care if they mispronounce something.

Difficult: The Cambridgeshire city of 'Ely' is the most commonly mispronounced word, with more than half of Brits (59 per cent) getting it wrong . And 41 per cent of us admit we interupt conversation to correct someone when they say a word incorrectly. The study also highlighted regional differences, with 93 per cent of people in Northern Ireland admitting that they trip up during conversations. But those in the North West are least likely to say that they pronounce their words wrongly, with only one in ten doing so. 'We are always hearing people referring to the station as ""St Pancreas"",' said Wendy Spinks, commercial director of HS1, which owns Eurostar terminal St Pancras International. 'With the rise of social media, more and more people are mixing the two up both in speech and text. 'It is completely understandable as people are more familiar with pancreas. 'In addition, it is a much easier word to say as it has three syllables allowing the speaker to elongate their speech and giving them longer to get their mouth around it.' Tricky: Researchers who have compiled a list of the words we find hardest to pronounce say the Italian starter 'bruschetta' has 25 per cent of people regularly stumped . The study found more than half of Brits (55 per cent) actually attribute mix ups to some words being spoken differently to how they are spelt. One in five (18 per cent) think certain words are simply difficult to say, while others (6 per cent) insist confusing silent letters are to blame. One in 20 (5 per cent) instead pass the buck and suggest their errors come from repeating what someone else said. 'We often fail to engage our conscious brain when speaking aloud what we are reading,' said neuropsychologist Dr David Lewis. 'As a result we see what we expect to see rather than what is actually there. 'In the phrase 'paris in the the spring', for example, many fail to notice the second 'the'. 'It's the same with St Pancras. 'When seen for the first time the brain reads this as 'pancreas', the insulin-producing gland, and that is how it is pronounced thereafter. 'Thinking before speaking and pausing before saying can save many embarrassing errors of pronunciation.'","Place names are particularly confusing with 'Ely' often mispronounced .

"By . Kit Holden . Pep Guardiola has implemented a strict regime of discipline on his Bayern Munich players in a bid to mentally toughen them for the new season. The squad were subjected to a talk from their head coach at the beginning of the season, in which he outlined his new stick over carrot approach, and reportedly told them, 'from now on, this is all completely compulsory'. At the centre of the new idea is a rigorous system of fines for small indiscretions, which the German press have christened 'Guardiola's punishment catalogue'. Punishable indiscretions involve arriving late to team meetings, not observing dress codes, failing to put dirty clothes in laundry bins, and taking phone calls on the first floor of Bayern's training ground HQ on Sabener Strasse. Serious business: Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola is getting strict on his players this season . Physical: Guardiola puts his hands on forward Thomas Muller during an open training session . Intense: Guardiola shouts during training as he aims to get his Bayern squad back to their best . Players will receive a €250 fine for committing an offence on one occasion, with the size of the fine going up by another €250 with every repeat offence. Captain Philipp Lahm is said to be in charge of collecting the fines from offending players. Fines will also be handed out to players who are deemed to be overweight, and to those who fail to eat within an hour of the end of a training session or a match. This last point is reported to be particularly important to Guardiola. On the advice of Bayern's dietician Mona Nemmer, the players should be eating pasta dishes within an hour of finishing work, but many avoid doing so, in order to eat with their families when they return home. This has clearly begun to frustrate the Guardiola. The stricter discipline has been taken as a direct response to Bayern's Champions League collapse last season. In April, director of sport Matthias Sammer complained that the atmosphere at the club was too friendly, describing it as a 'cuddly oasis'. His worst fears were confirmed when the team slumped to a 4-0 humiliation at the hands of Real Madrid days late. Having already won the Bundesliga by March, many saw that defeat as a psychological failure. Debt collector: Captain Philipp Lahm is said to be the man in charge of taking fines from players . Pass and move: Bayern (and Arjen Robben, left) are expected to win the Bundesliga again this season . Indeed, Guardiola admitted as much himself. In a new biography dealing with his first year at Bayern, the Spaniard is quoted saying that he and his players became too emotional about the Real game, which ultimately led to their downfall. Hence the new, more ruthless approach. With a plethora of early season injuries to deal with, as well a lack of pre-season preparation for his World Cup winners, Guardiola is also keen to make sure the side is as fit as possible. Lahm explained the new regime in those terms. 'We're not used to starting the season having trained so little. After such a short holiday, it's difficult to be at 100 per cent' said the Bayern captain. Despite having won the Double in his first season in Munich, Guardiola knows that his time at Bayern will be judged primarily on the Champions League. He is desperate to avoid the same physical and psychological collapse which embarrassed his team last season. As the new season gets under way, it's out with the cuddly oasis, and in with the Bavarian bootcamp.

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Goodison Park will be packed to its old rafters on Saturday and somewhere among the throng there will be four Evertonians appreciating Steven Naismith. The Scotland international has endeared himself to the blue half of Merseyside with his honest performances combining hard work, deft skill and an ability to pop up with a goal when it matters, but the affection for Naismith runs deeper. He is not someone for whom the term ‘typical footballer’ could be used. VIDEO: Scroll down for Steven Naismith buys tickets to donate to unemployed fans . In form: Steven Naismith scored against Arsenal on Saturday and has started the season brightly . Naismith, for starters, is an ambassador for dyslexia in Scotland, launched an initiative some time ago to help the progress of injured ex-servicemen return to work, and he supports homeless centres in Glasgow and Liverpool. Spend time with Naismith, 27, and you discover he is a man with awareness and values and that explains why he became quickly attuned to the rancour surrounding the prices of tickets to watch matches in the Premier League and the frustration that come from spiraling costs. So he decided to try and make a difference. Before the beginning of this campaign, he bought four season tickets for Goodison Park with the ambition to give those down on their luck a chance to get matches they would have no hope of seeing. The tickets will be circulated around Merseyside, with four different fans being selected for each Everton home match. It is why, when Roberto Martinez’s side emerge for their crucial meeting with Chelsea, there will be one particular quartet in the crowd willing on Naismith. Charitable: Naismith bought four season tickets to allow less privileged fans to attend matches . ‘When I got to my mid-20s I started thinking of myself as a bit more of an established player in terms of knowing how the football world works, what’s expected of you,’ said Naismith. ‘On the other side, you know what comes with it, with all the attention on you. ‘Social media is a massive platform with Twitter and stuff. It’s so easy to get things out. ‘Even when that side of it was young, I would talk to mates and say you could literally write anything on there and within three or four days everyone would know about it. ‘So we got thinking of what we could do that could make a difference to various charities and it was pretty simple really. 'The price of football is getting more expensive and more and more fans, who would probably have gone for years, were struggling to go any more. That was the idea.' Deja vu: Naismith scored against Chelsea last season and will hope to do the same on Saturday . ‘But without being able to just go and pick people, and not knowing if you’d picked the right ones, we decided to speak to the job centres in the local areas — they would know who was working hard to get back into employment and maybe had a few setbacks and could do with a morale-booster. ‘It’s worked really well. We spoke to the people who went to the first game and they were delighted, they said it made a really big difference to them. It’s good to hear it. Prices can’t get out of hand because we are losing the spine of what football is all about.’ Though he initially struggled to adjust to the Premier League — he says he was ‘in awe’ of players like Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines and Steven Pienaar — Naismith has blossomed in the last 12 months and it was against Chelsea last season that his Everton career really took off. Improving: Naismith scored 10 goals for Everton last season and is already off the mark this campaign . His header secured a 1-0 victory, gave Martinez his first win and set the ball rolling for them to return to Europe. Chelsea are likely to prove a different proposition to the out-of-sorts bunch that arrived last year but they will have to contain a forward whose confidence is on the up. ‘Last year there was a lot more uncertainty about how we were going to play and shape up because the manager was new,’ says Naismith. ‘This time the start of the season has been more of a disappointment rather than not understanding the system. We’ve thrown four points away.’ Should they play as they did for 60 minutes against Arsenal last week, though, Chelsea will certainly have issues to deal with and Naismith is relishing the prospect of working in tandem with Samuel Eto’o and Romelu Lukaku. New kid in town: Naismith is relishing the chance to link up with Samuel Eto'o, who signed on Wednesday . ‘Samuel is a player with a massive pedigree,’ he says. ‘Maybe he’s getting older but he still has a wealth of knowledge that could definitely be passed on. ‘As for Rom, it will be a funny day for him. This is probably the first season he is going to get that he can show them what he is made of.’","Steven Naismith scored against Arsenal last week and is set to start on Saturday against Chelsea .

"By . Simon Jones for MailOnline . Blackburn have signed Everton defender Shane Duffy for a fee of £1.5million. The Republic of Ireland international struggled to breakthrough at Goodison Park under both Roberto Martinez and his predecessor David Moyes and has opted to drop down a division to link up with Championship Rovers. Duffy spent last season on loan at Yeovil, making 39 appearances in Somerset. He also had loan stints at Burnley and Scunthorpe after moving to Everton in 2009. On the move: Shane Duffy, playing for Everton in a pre-season friendly against Celta Vigo, has joined Blackburn . His path to the Everton first team is blocked by Phil Jagielka, Sylvain Distin, Antolin Alcarez and the emergence of John Stones. The centre-back made his senior international debut against Costa Rica in June. Duffy had been set to make his bow for the national team in 2010 but had to have life-saving surgery after suffering a freak accident in Ireland training. He suffered a lacerated liver after colliding with a team-mate and lost 3.6 litres of blood, around two-thirds of the body's supply. Duffy made 10 appearances in all competitions for the Toffees, making his bow in December 2009 in a Europa League clash with AEK Athens.","Duffy drops down a division to link up with Championship side Blackburn .

"By . Dominic King for MailOnline . The talk on Merseyside this week has been about the footballing enigma that is Mario Balotelli, but 20 years ago today the chatter centred on the emergence of a phenomenon. It was on August 28, 1994, that Robbie Fowler wrote his name in the record books with the fastest Barclays Premier League hat-trick, plundering his treble against an Arsenal defence which contained David Seaman, Tony Adams and Martin Keown in just four minutes 33 seconds. That devastating spell stamped the then 19-year-old Fowler as the most exciting young talent in the English game and ensured he was destined for a place in Anfield folklore; two decades on, it remains one of the Premier League’s most remarkable moments. VIDEO Still got it! Scroll down to watch Robbie Fowler's brilliant crossbar challenge . Hat-trick: Robbie Fowler scored three goals against Arsenal at Anfield in under five minutes . Robbie Fowler’s hat-trick against Arsenal at Anfield, August 28, 1994 . Goal 1 — 25min 58sec . Goal 2 — 28min 42sec . Goal 3 — 30min 31sec . TOTAL TIME: 4min 33sec . ‘Is it really that long?’ Fowler asks with a shake of the head, as he revisits that glorious afternoon when his professional life changed. ‘It’s probably the thing I’m known for most in the Premier League and it’s certainly the one I am most proud about. ‘I’ve moved down to sixth in the all-time scoring list and, honestly, that isn’t a problem. 'I don’t mind people taking over in terms of the goals they score, both in the Premier League and for Liverpool, but the hat-trick is the one achievement I want to stay as mine forever. It was some day.’ Liverpool had started the 1994-95 campaign with an eye-catching 6-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park but their next assignment, against George Graham’s Arsenal, was going to be the true test of their capabilities under Roy Evans. Record: Even 20 years later, Fowler's hat-trick is the fastest in Premier League history . On a glorious afternoon, both sides had started confidently in front of Sky’s cameras but midway through the first half, Fowler exploded into life, scrambling Arsenal’s senses and sparking pandemonium around Anfield, hosting its first game without the standing Kop. 26th minute: Jamie Redknapp’s right-wing cross bounces off Ian Rush and falls invitingly to Fowler. Andy Gray on Sky: ‘They got a bit of luck there, Liverpool. But when it dropped to Fowler, on that left foot, was there ever going to be any end product but the net bulging? He doesn’t miss them.’ Fowler: ‘I remember the cross came in and I found myself in space after it came off Rushie. I didn’t think about what I was going to do. I just put my head down and hit it.’ 29th minute: Liverpool turn defence into attack with Rob Jones setting Steve McManaman on a storming 60-yard run. As the winger moves forward with menace, Fowler starts to peel away. Martin Tyler on Sky: ‘McManaman… Fowler, making a yard for himself… Is it going in? It is! Two in two minutes from Robbie Fowler and they’re going crazy here at Anfield!’ Goals: Robbie Fowler is sixth in the all-time Premier League goal-scorers list . Fowler: ‘That was the best one. As Stevie Mac kept running, Arsenal’s defence kept dropping deep. Stevie and I had a great understanding and I knew if I made an angle, he would provide the pass. I managed to squeeze my shot through Lee Dixon’s legs and it left David Seaman unsighted. 31st minute: John Barnes swaps passes with Stig-Inge Bjornebye just inside Arsenal’s half and spies Fowler on the move. As Barnes delivers his lofted ball, Anfield senses history is in the making. Martin Tyler: ‘And he’s away again here! Is this going to be the hat-trick?… It is!’ Andy Gray: ‘That’s incredible! How’s that for a cool head? Unbelievable stuff from Liverpool! Unbelievable stuff from Robbie Fowler!’ Fowler: ‘What I remember most about this was the noise. The old Kop had been demolished, so all the season-ticket holders had been moved to the Anfield Road end and the noise they made was incredible. When Barnesy put the ball through to me, I heard this roar go up as I was about to shoot. Third: David Seaman and Martin Keown try desperately to prevent Fowler from scoring his sides third . ‘Martin Keown and David Seaman tried to block my first effort but I got the bounce of the ball and I managed to turn it in from a tight angle. It was an amazing moment.’ Fowler (left) ended that season being named PFA’s Young Player of the Year. He also helped Liverpool win the League Cup, having scored 31 goals in 57 matches. There were many more great days but, as he looks back on what he calls his best of all in Red, there is one slight regret. ‘The ball,’ Fowler says. ‘I’ve got it somewhere in the house but I couldn’t tell you which one it is. ‘I kept all the hat-trick balls (he scored nine, second only to Alan Shearer). If I’m honest, I regret not marking that one. I got all the lads to sign it but there was no fuss. ‘If I had given it some thought, I should have made a point of writing the game and date on it. ‘Arsenal were a lucky team for me and I had a lot of good times, including winning the FA Cup in 2001. ‘But people still talk to me about that day. It’s great it is still remembered after all these years.’","Robbie Fowler reflects on his hat-trick against Arsenal .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . To date we know of only one star in the universe that can host life: our sun. This has led astronomers to believe that stars similar to our own could host life, in addition to ones cooler than ours. But new research suggests we shouldn’t rule out hotter stars either, as they may also allow life to flourish. A new paper suggests that stars hotter than our sun might be able to host alien life. Previously it was thought that the additional ultraviolet radiation would be detrimental, such as on an exoplanet closely orbiting a star (pictured), but researchers say that is not necessarily the case . There are various different types of stars classified as, from hottest to coolest, O, B, A, F, G, K, M, of which our Sun is a G-type star and sits in the middle of the 'main sequence' on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. At the top end O and B stars are far too hot and live far too short lives of just a few million years to support the evolution and survival of life, considering life on Earth took half a billion years to establish itself. But F-type stars, while once thought to be inhospitable, could be prime candidates for habitability. F-type stars have a mass about 10 to 60 per cent more than our sun. This also gives them a surface temperature ranging from 5,800 to 6,900°C (10,500 to 12,500°F) – our Sun is just under 5,500°C (10,000°F). They are also thought to remain stable for 2 to 4 billion years, which led the researchers to estimate there would be a sufficient window of opportunity for life to get a foothold. Hotter, brighter stars (top) are thought to have larger habitable zones than our sun (middle), although exactly how habitable they are remains to be determined. Red dwarf stars (bottom), meanwhile, which are dimmer than our sun, have a smaller habitable zone . ‘It has been argued that the most likely host candidates for exobiology should be K-type or even M-type stars based on their relatively long life spans and high frequency compared to the other types of main sequence stars,’ paper co-author Manfred Cuntz, a professor of physics at the University of Texas at Arlington, and lead scientist of the project, told Astrobiology Magazine. ‘But the only case known for life to exist is the environment of our sun, identified as a relatively hot and massive G-type star. ‘Therefore, it appears to be fully appropriate to explore the possibility of exobiology for stars even hotter and more massive than the Sun.’ The researchers say that F-type stars are probably at the upper range of where life can survive. Any . hotter and the amount of ultraviolet radiation emitted destroys . molecules like DNA that are regarded as essential ingredients for life. The . study suggests beings on a planet in orbit around an F-type star would . receive up to 7.1 more radiation damage than we receive on Earth. But an atmosphere or ocean could provide sufficient protection to allow the alien life to survive. This is a scatter graph used to classify stars in the universe. It was created in 1910 by Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russel. It . shows the relationship of a star’s magnitude (how bright it appears to . us) and luminosity (how bright it actually is) to its temperature. As stars evolve they move to different points on the graph. Based on stars we have observed, the graph shows us how a star will change over time. Through the middle runs the ‘Main Sequence’ of stars, upon which most stars begin. Some will evolve into giants in the top right, while others will ultimately become white dwarfs in the bottom left. Our sun will become a red giant in about 4 billion years. Our sun is a G-type star and sits in the middle of what is known as the 'main-sequence' of stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The next 'level' up in stars is F-type, which can be up to 60 per cent more massive then the sun and emit up to 7.1 times as much radiation . In addition, increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation can provide the source of energy life needs to evolve. ‘Broadly speaking, UV should be considered both a friend and a foe to the principal possibility of life,’ Cuntz said. ‘At the present stage of Earth in regard to many of its life forms, the lack of an ozone layer would be truly harmful to most types of surface life. ‘On the other hand, in regard to life's origin and early stages of evolution, a notable UV intensity could be important for facilitating the onset of life by triggering relevant early-stage biochemical reactions.’ Another promising aspect of F-type stars is that they could have larger habitable zones, the regions around a star where liquid water can exist. This means that more planets in orbit around the stars have a chance to form water. However as F-type stars are rarer than smaller ones like our sun, their is less chance to study them in detail. Nonetheless, the researchers conclude that astronomers should not limit their hunt for habitable planets to stars like our own, and should instead also consider some of these hotter stars.","Researchers have said that stars hotter than our sun could support life .
Previously it was thought such F-type stars would be inhospitable .
This is because they emit more harmful radiation onto nearby planets .
But Manfred Cuntz and his team say the radiation could actually be helpful .
It could stimulate evolution and the stars also have a bigger habitable zone .
Therefore we should not rule out larger stars in our search for life ."
"By . Lucy Waterlow . Ordeal: Hannah was abused by a friend of the family (posed by model) A mother was shocked and horrified to discover her three-year-old daughter had been molested by a friend of the family. Now she's urging other parents to broach the subject of sexual abuse with young children to ensure they are safe and aware of what's right and wrong. Rachel was stunned when her little girl, Hannah, (names have been changed to protect their identities), casually revealed that her private parts had been touched by Ron Wood. He was a trusted friend of the family who Rachel had no reason to suspect was a child abuser. She had only raised the issue of sexual abuse with Hannah after hearing about the NSPCC's PANTS campaign - which advises parents to ensure their children know they should not be touched beneath their underwear. Rachel explains: 'I hadn't thought about talking to Hannah about abuse before as she was only three-years-old and I didn't think that it would be something that would happen to us. Not long after hearing about the NSPCC's Underwear Rule, I was putting some cream on her where her pants had rubbed and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to talk to her. 'I said: ""Where your pants cover; that area is for you. No-one else can touch this area."" I expected her to just say OK but she said ""Ron puts his fingers up there.""' Jailed: Ron Wood was found guilty of four counts of sexually abusing the girl . In disbelief, Rachel and her husband, Mark (not his real name), then asked Hannah to tell them more about what Ron had done.The couple had known Ron for ten years but had never been aware he had been alone with their daughter when he had visited their home. Rachel said: 'I felt so betrayed and I . was in a state. We didn't think something like this could ever happen . to her; we hadn't even left him completely alone with her. We saw Ron . and his wife a lot and, from what Hannah told us, he had used every . opportunity he could when he got a few minutes alone with her to abuse . her. They played hide and seek a lot and she told me that he always told . her to hide in the bedroom and he did it then. She said he did it ""lots . and lots and lots"" of times.' The . parents called the police and praised the way they gently spoke to . Hannah about what had happened to her before taking their investigation . further. Rachel recalls: . 'Everything was taken at Hannah's pace and I can't fault the police at . all for how they handled it. I agreed that Hannah could have a medical . examination and the damage was consistent to what she had told us had . happened. 'By now she knew that what had happened to her was wrong and she knew that she had to talk to the police about it so that Ron would be punished for what he did. 'She said: ""Do I have to tell them everything that he did to me so that he is told off?"" I told her that she did and I was shocked when she said he touched her elsewhere too.' She added that she was sickened to learn Ron had been telling Hannah she was his 'special little princess'. Ron, 60, of Chaddesden, Derbyshire, was arrested and charged with four counts of sexually abusing the girl. He denied he had done anything wrong so the family had to go through the ordeal of giving evidence at his trial. It's good to talk: Rachel is urging other parents to broach the underwear rule with their children (posed by models) Rachel was a witness and Hannah gave her statement via a video link. Rachel said she was proud of how bravely her little girl handled the intimidating situation. She said: 'We told Hannah that it had to go to court as she said it happened and Ron said it hadn’t and she understood that. I was initially concerned about her having to give evidence via video link but they did everything to ease my worries and to make the experience as comfortable for Hannah as possible. 'Mark and I were shown around the court first and were able to ask questions about the process. We were then able to take Hannah so that she could get used to the courthouse and could learn about what would happen. P is for...

I think they underestimated what they . would get from her but she is a very smart, switched on little girl so . she kept coming out with things. 'Even . though she was young, I knew from her personality that she was more . than able to do it. It was still horrible waiting for it to finish . though and I couldn’t see her after as I was a witness so she went and . had dinner with her dad. But Mark said she couldn’t eat anything and was . upset by the ordeal.' Ron was found guilty of all four counts of sexual abuse and jailed for eight years. Rachel said: 'We . were relieved that they came back and found him guilty the same day. He . was sentenced to eight years in prison. We told Hannah and she said ""See, I told everyone I wasn't lying.""' Rachel . said Hannah was clingy for a time after the trial and didn't like being . left alone. But as time goes on, her mother said she is regaining her . confidence. Now Rachel is urging other parents to talk to their children about the Underwear Rule, explained in our pink box out. She said: 'I know a lot of parents might be worried about having the conversation with their children but it's so important that you do. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. 'You don't think that sexual abuse will ever effect your family but it could do so you need to talk to your children about it to protect them. There are so many opportunities when you can bring it up, such as when you are washing them or dressing them. 'You don't have to make it into a big thing; you can talk to them as though it's an everyday conversation. You can just tell them that what is under their pants belongs to them and no-one else should touch it and that if anything worries them they should tell you and not keep it a secret. 'If I hadn't have heard about the Underwear Rule I don't think I would have had that conversation with Hannah and the abuse could have progressed and then things could have got a lot worse.'

"By . Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . A single mother and her two children will be turfed out on the street if they don’t pay a four year backlog of council rates in Queensland. Lorraine McElligott, who admits she has been living on’ Struggle Street’, has just 30 days to pay more than $11,000 in unpaid rates or her home will be put up for auction in November by the Sunshine Coast Council. ‘We have been living on a knife’s edge for a long time,’ an emotional Ms McElligott said as a failed business has left her broke and battling to keep food on the table to her two children. Scroll down for video . Lorraine McElligott has just 30 days to pay more than $11,000 in unpaid rates or her home will be put up for auction in November by the Sunshine Coast Council . Ms McElligott owes $9,367.00 plus $2,500 in interest on unpaid rates over the past four years . Ms McElligott says she is now able to start paying off her debts but the council has taken a stand. ‘We weren’t in a position to pay it but we are now on top of all of our other bills,’ she said. ‘I offered to pay i$177 a fortnight in three years – even offered to pay $1,000 but they wouldn’t even entertain it at all.’ Thousands of properties Australia-wide are threatened with forced options of unpaid rates each year but most escape the hammer the owners have until the auction begins to find the outstanding cash. Sunshine Coast Council sent 292 forced auction notices since June – but wouldn’t confirm how many actually go to sale. The council released a statement saying auctioning properties is last resort used only after council had used all avenues to allow property owners to pay . ‘Despite eight rate notices, eight reminder letters, numerous phone and other correspondence Ms McElligott has paid zero rates on her property for more than four years,’ it stated. Ms McElligott admits she has been living on’ Struggle Street’ but is now in a position to pay off the bills . Sunshine Coast Council stated that it was left with no choice but to send an auction notice . But Ms McElligott plans to fight back and is rallying fellow rate defaulters to unite to get council to overturn the decision to sell their homes. ‘This is our home we have to fight we have no other options,’ she said. ‘There are some people who are really doing it tough like me – there’s a few of us around and I wold like to get a group together to work with the council.’ Red Tape Busters managing director Shane Bowering said homeowners should stand up and demand that council listen to them. ‘I don’t understand why they are not working with this resident and working out a payment plan so the money can be paid back and the person gets to keep their home,’ he said. ‘They are not looking at the collateral damage that’s going to happen to this family who’s going to be out on the street,’ Mr Bowering said. ‘And who’s going to be picking up the tab for them - Department of Housing? That’s going to be a cost as well.' Ms McElligott  is rallying fellow rate defaulters to unite to get council to overturn the decision to sell their homes . Red Tape Busters managing director Shane Bowering said homeowners should stand up and demand that council listen to them . He advised home owners to take action quickly if they fell behind in their payments. Council needs to be thinking with more empathy and looking at how they can work with their ratepayers rather than turfing them out . Ms McElligott just asked for a bit of a break. ‘This sort of thing I hate to say it can happen to anybody sometimes there are times when you are down,’ she said. ‘Sometimes you just need a wee bit of help and a bit of space,’ she said. ‘We are praying for a fair go – it’s about all we’ve got left.’","Lorraine McElligott, has just 30 days to pay more than $11,000 in unpaid rates or her home will be sold in November by the Sunshine Coast Council .

"By . Laurie Kamens . In the market for a new home? A 1960's cold wold missile silo with a fully converted bunker can be all yours for just $750,000. The missile silo, located Lewis, New York, that once held an Atlas missile, but was decommissioned in 1960 and emptied of all sensitive equipment, is now being sold as a one family home. Complete with escape hatches, warning signs, rooms filled with control panels, one bedroom, and one bath, the silo sits on 8.3 acres of upstate farm land with a beautiful waterfront view on to the foot of the Adirondack mountains. The Property: Seen from an aerial view, this decommissioned Cold War missile silo in Lewis, New York is being sold as a single family for $750K. The silo lies on 8.3 acres of upstate farm land . View: The missile silo sits on 8.3 acres of land that looks out on to the Adirondack mountains. The property also has a private pond and stream running through it . Underground: The bedroom is located in the silo's underground bunker in what used to be the Launch Control Center . Realtor Brian Dominic told KGW Portland that the house is so popular, his company is charging $375 just to see it. 'We'll probably get 1,000 inquiries via emails, probably 100 phone calls and that will lead to a handful of people that will actually visit the property,' Dominic told the station. The two-story missile silo has 32,000 square feet, and is equipped with one bedroom, a utilitarian 'cook top' kitchen, and one full bath. However the perspective home is bit of a fixer-upper, as the listing notes the basement is partially unfinished. Secure: The Cold War missile bunker is fully equipped with heavy gun-metal gray blast doors that are both a good security system and can withstand nuclear fallout . Equipment: The missile silo comes fully stocked with old military equipment, that though it no longer works makes for interesting home decorations . Silo: The old missile silo that used to hold the Atlas missile now stand empty and rusted after years of disuse . Industrial: The decommissioned missile military complex looks less homey and more industrial with metal grates and steel doors throughout it . The silo-home is even located in a good school district, according to the online listing. No longer an active missile base, the silo is still full of quirky details that do have a certain Cold War charm. The rooms are filled with light up control stations, heavy metal doors, and rusted military equipment, as well as, 'ominous red lights, blast doors, and an emergency exit,' according to Realtor.com. Rooms: The missile silo comes complete with a utilitarian kitchen that's advertised as having a refrigerator and 'cook top' Living space: The living room is located in the old launch control center and furnished with authentic retro looking furniture . Command Center: Throughout the silo are pieces of old non-working military machinery, and in this room the realtors even included yellow hard hats as an authentic decorative touch . Communal: The silo's bathroom, like its other rooms, is very simple. Resembling a public school bathroom, the water closet has a multiple-person sink . The realtors have even stocked the house with yellow hard hats and army green jumpsuits for people who really want to get into the spirit of the complex. Though the missile has long since been removed from the property, the empty air shaft can function as an impromptu skylight for the open-minded homeowner. Built over 50 years ago the silo has the full amenities of modern living . including a well drilled septic system, a propane water heater, cooling system for the whole house, and satellite dishes. Military: The underground home has a wall adorned with clocks representing different time zones for the old occupants who potentially couldn't get out to see the light of day . Equipment: Though it no longer works, the missile silo is filled with old monitoring equipment that imaginative residents can play with and pretend to be living in the bunker 50 years ago . Authentic: The reality company hung olive green coveralls in the silo for those residents who want to get the full nuclear missile bunker experience . Other structures on the property include outbuilding, a storage shed, and a barn, for those who intent to farm on the property. The only caveat is that living in a bunker can feel restrictive, as the rooms are located in the formed Launch Control Center and lit with hanging overhead lights and no natural light. Tunnels: Occupants can move from room to room in the underground missile bunker by a series of lit tunnels . Space: Aside from the living areas, the rest of the 185 feet deep structure is full of numerous rooms containing old operating stations and out-of-work control panels . Outdoors: On the expansive property, that includes a paved road to the silo, there is a barn, storage shed, outbuildings, and 8.3 acres of green grass and trees . Missile: Included in the realtor's listing as a diagram of the original Atlas missile that the silo housed during the Cold War . But if occupants ever feel claustrophobic they can simply venture . outside to explore the grounds and look out on to the pond or at the foliage dotted mountains in the distance. And if there is ever a nuclear war, consider yourself prepared.","An old Cold War missile silo on 8.3 acres of land in upstate New York is being sold as a one family home for $750K .

But now a new parenting type has been identified - and experts say 'snowplough parents', who clear every obstacle from their child's path while piling on the pressure to achieve, can be every bit as damaging. According to David McCullough, a teacher for 30 years and the author of a book on the subject, aggressive parenting is producing children who are 'anxious, dependent, narcissistic and careerist'. Too much: Children whose parents pile on the pressure and insist on certain paths can be left anxious . Speaking to the Sunday Times, he also warned that children are becoming 'terrified of failure' and being turned into 'achievement machines' by their parents. 'From birth, they are strapped into the car seat and protected, driven and aimed in one direction,' he added. 'They [children] are compliant; they have given up self-determination and a willingness to explore their own interests.' And the results of competitive parenting, from failure to settle into careers to dependence and even breakdown, can be devastating. Not, says McCullough, that any of this is intended. 'If you do not get into one of the top 30 to 50 colleges, you are in for a very hard time in life - that's the thinking driving all this,' he explains. Tutors: Parents who employ tutors or even do their child's homework for them risk making them dependent . Tough love: Tiger mothers like Amy Chua run the risk of inadvertently harming their children . Snowplough parenting is becoming increasingly common in the UK as well as the US with nearly a quarter of teenagers supplied with tutors by their parents in a bid to boost their grades. After school classes, intensive music lessons and an emphasis on besting the competition in team sports are all favourites of the snowplough parent, who also, on occasion, take charge of their children's homework. As a result of increasing parental pressure, one in 10 university students suffers from mental health problems while others find themselves unable to cope without help from Mum and Dad and an army of private tutors. 'They besiege professors for extra lessons or expect a private tutor like they had when they were 17,' explains McCullough. 'In some cases, they just drop out, seeing failure as a failure of the support system around them and not as their failure.' This, he argues in his new book You Are Not Special, has arisen from the modern 'cult of exceptionalism' and which has made children afraid to be average. In it, he highlights examples of snowplough parenting, including . that of a child being sent on a 120-mile bus journey every Saturday for a . piano lesson and another who, when confronted with spelling mistakes by . his teacher, replied: 'Mum must have missed those.' Instead of succumbing to the temptation to micromanage children, McCullough says that parents should try taking a step back. 'Try as much as possible to give children free rein,' he advises. 'Let them follow their own passions and curiosities without overweening interference every step of the way. 'Sometimes our kids take paths they shouldn't, sometimes they will make mistakes. That's OK.' You Are Not Special: And Other Encouragements by David McCullough costs £11.46 and is published by Scribe .","Snowplough parents who clear all obstacles can damage children .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . Stay back because they bite! After a number of reports of seals sighting on beacheson the South-West coast of Australia, the Department of Parks and Wildlife has released a statement to remind people not to approach the large animals. Wildlife officer Cameron Craigie said it was common for species including the leopard seal,sub-Antarctic fur seal and New Zealand fur seal to come ashore during winter fronts. 'These seals haul up on beaches to rest – they are not ‘stranded’ and don’t require assistance from people,' Mr Craigie said. If you spot a seal or a sea lion sun baking on a beach do not approach it or you may be bitten . Leopard seal seen recently at Rockingham; Australian sea lion relaxing at a Perth beach . Mr Craigie said some seals seen on metropolitan beaches recently were juveniles or sub-adults with poor body condition. 'Human intervention with these animals causes a high level of stress, which may result in a further deterioration of their health and even cause death,' he said. 'In the majority of cases, the best thing for the seal is to be left undisturbed.' People may also notice seals and sea lions spinning or twisting around in the water and sticking their flippers in the air. 'This is a natural behaviour known as thermo-regulating where by the seal is controlling its body temperature by exposing different parts to the sun and sticking flippers in and out of the water,' Mr Craigie said. If people see a seal with obvious body injuries they can report it to the department’s Wildcare Helpline on 9474 9055. These cute marine creatures like people and other animals to keep their distance while they rest on the beach .","Parks and Wildlife Western Australia have issued a warning to not disturb seals or sea lions resting on Perth beaches .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Donald Trump's 'pitbull' adviser is suing a Hamptons homeowner for 'ruining his summer'. Michael D Cohen rented an $8million Sagaponack mansion from NYU Dr Ali Guy, but says the physiatrist lied to him about the home's state. When Cohen and his extended family arrived at the home on August 2, they discovered that the air conditioning wasn't working and that half of the rooms were outfitted with too-small twin beds. Cohen paid $150,000 to rent the home for a month, and is now suing Guy for double, according to a suit filed in Manhattan Superior Court. 'He ruined my summer!' Cohen said, according to the New York Post. Not fit: Donald Trump's adviser Michael Cohen (left) is suing NYU Dr Ali Guy (right) for renting him an $8million Hamptons home he says was in disrepair . Upsetting: According to the $250,000 lawsuit, the home's air-conditioning was broken and the beds in four of the eight rooms were too small for the visiting adults . Cohen, a Trump Organization Vice President and special counsel to the Donald, says the home is more than double the size of his past rentals since he wanted a large space to house his wife, their two children, his parents, his three siblings, and his siblings' children. He eventually decided on Dr Guy's eight-bedroom, 12,000-square-foot home because it had enough room 'to accommodate his entire family' and for its 'wow factor,' according to the suit. According to a real estate listing, the home on Parsonage Lane sits on 1.2 acres and comes with formal living and dining rooms, a great room, screening room, gym, spa, wine cellar, two laundry rooms, pool, three-story elevator and 11.5 bathrooms. But Cohen says that while the home is aesthetically pleasing, it is non-functional. Not happy: Cohen admits the home is aesthetically pleasing, but that the various problems have ruined his summer vacation . Small: One of the biggest issues Cohen has with the home are the too-small twin beds in half of the rooms . Stuck inside: Cohen has also had to spend hours at home, supervising maintenance workers trying to repair the air-conditioning, missing out on family time . Bad surprise: The home's sauna and security gate have also had issues that were specified when Cohen agreed to rent the home for $150,000 . The home has had multiple issues that has tainted Cohen's summer and made it nearly uninhabitable for his family, who came all the way from California and Florida for a reunion. Right-hand man: Cohen is an Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization and special adviser to the Donald . One of the biggest issues was the twin beds in four of the eight rooms - too small for his 6-foot-tall teen soon or his married sisters. He says the broker was forced to buy two big beds with mattresses, box springs and frames just to 'make things right'. Cohen also found that the sauna was broken, the security gate malfunctioned and the toilets were busted. Even worse - the air-conditioning wasn't working in two of the bedrooms. When . he confronted Guy about the air-conditioning issues in the heat of . summer, the landlord told him to open the windows at night and 'hope for . sea breeze' even though the house isn't on the beach. Contractors . were called out to the house to fix the AC, but were unsuccessful. While they worked Cohen was stuck in the house supervising, missing out . on time with his family. Dr Guy has spoken out about the suit and told the Post Cohen's complaints are 'completely unfounded'. 'He wants to sue me for $250,000 and his rent was $150,000' Dr Guy said. 'We are filing a response, and I feel I will be vindicated,' he added. Cohen has been called Trump's 'pitbull' and has been given the nicknqame 'Tom' in reference to The Godfather character.","Michael Cohen is an executive vice president of the Trump Organization and special adviser to the Donald .

"By . Kate Lyons for Daily Mail Australia . Passengers on Qantas and Virigin Australia flights will now be able to use electronic devices on flight during takeoff and landing . Passengers on Qantas and Virgin Australia aircraft will be able to use electronic devices during flights, including during take-off and landing. The new policy will allow passengers to use smart phones, tablets, and mp3 players throughout plane journeys and on the tarmac as long as they are in flight mode. Larger items such as laptops will be able to be used during flights, though will have to be stored during take-off and landing and passengers will still not be able to make calls or send text messages from the air. The new policy was approved by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority on Monday and comes into effect on Tuesday at 3pm. Qantaslink, Jetstar and Tiger Airlines currently have submissions before CASA to allow them to introduce the policy to their airlines. 'Basically we put a set of procedures in place and the airlines had to demonstrate two things. They had to demonstrate their aircrafts won’t be susceptible to electro-magnetic interference,' Peter Gibson from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority told Daily Mail Australia. 'The second thing was cabin safety. The airline had to have in place appropriate procedures, things like, big devices like laptops still have to be stowed due to risk of injury… ensuring cords don’t hinder people, common sense sort of stuff.' When asked about instructions offered to plane passengers that they must turn off their electronic devices because they might interfere with a plane’s navigational equipment, Mr Gibson said: 'Modern aircraft have been examined for this and the risk of interference is very, very low.' Prior to this ruling, passengers have been required to keep their devices switched off until the seatbelt sign was turned off, meaning passengers could not use their devices while aircrafts were taxiing, as well as through much of the climb or descent. People will be able to use laptops, e-readers, tablets and smart phones, though they are still not able to make phone calls or send text messages . The change to the policy follows a ruling last October by the United States' Federal Aviation Administration that allowed passengers flying in the U.S. to leave their electronic devices on through all stages of a flight, if individual airlines could prove it did not interfere with the operation of the aircraft. Since the ruling, experts from various airlines have been investigating the impact of personal electronic devices inflight . The changes mean passengers will be able to use smartphones and tablets weighing up to one kilogram in flight mode during take-off, landing and taxi mode. Heavier items such as laptops will still be required to be held in overhead departments with fear they could be a danger to other passengers during high turbulence if they become air-borne. Training for cabin crews will also have to be revised with necessity placed on ensuring passengers still pay attention to flight announcements . Virgin Australia released a statement on Friday from the chief customer officer Mark Hassell which claimed that the airline company had already re-lodged their submission and were waiting for approval . 'In-flight entertainment is a key driver of customer satisfaction and this application marks the next phase of that product evolution,' Mr Hassell said. 'Virgin Australia will work to immediately implement the use of hand-held personal electronic devices from gate to gate and will have further updates for customers in coming days.' Virgin Australia and Qantas have had their submissions to CASA approved .","Passengers can now use electronic devices on Virgin and Qantas flights .

"By . Dan Bloom . New light has been shed on the incredible life of Britain's first black professional footballer after his great-granddaughter discovered a long-lost box of memorabilia. The son of a wealthy missionary, Arthur Wharton arrived in Cannock, Staffordshire, in the early 1880s as a teenage immigrant from Gold Coast, now Ghana, and his talents did not go unnoticed for long. He ran the first 10-second 100 yard dash and played for Rotherham Town and Sheffield United - before spending 20 years down a South Yorkshire coal mine and dying a pauper. Making history: The son of a wealthy missionary, Arthur Wharton arrived in Cannock, Staffordshire, in the early 1880s as a teenage immigrant from Gold Coast (now Ghana) and sprinted before playing football and cricket . Mr Wharton (pictured as an amateur with Darlington FC) became known as a goalkeeper who would indulge in punching the ball as far as the halfway line and catching the ball with his legs while swinging on the crossbar . Mr Wharton's tale has been revived after his great-granddaugher Dorothy Rooney discovered a long-lost box of photographs and documents relating to his extraordinary career - including his personal bible. She took them to share with an event run by the BBC show Antiques Roadshow, where they will appear this Sunday. Ms Rooney said: 'My mother and I found some old photos (of Arthur) and traced him . back. We have actually been to Ghana and met family members, and they . didn’t know of Arthur. 'He was a Victorian sporting hero.' The 6ft teenager was sent to Britain in the 1880s to train as a Christian missionary, but soon took up athletics, winning the Amateur Athletic Association national championships two years in a row. Revealed: Mr Wharton's granddaughter Dorothy Rooney (right) found a box of memorabilia . Historic: The cache was then analysed by the BBC's Antiques Roadshow, which will be aired on Sunday . Long-lost: The items recovered by Mr Wharton's family included his bible, pictured, and many photographs . After hanging up his running shoes Mr Wharton went on to become an accomplished goalkeeper. During his amateur days, which included a debut for Preston North End in the FA Cup, he became known for punching the ball as far as the . halfway line and catching the ball with his legs while swinging on the . crossbar. Then, in 1889, he made history by signing professional terms for Rotherham Town and playing in the Football League. Riches to rags: In later life Arthur Wharton became a coal miner, dying a pauper aged 65 . The move made him the first black full-time paid footballer in the history of Britain, and quite possibly the history of the world. He later joined Sheffield United and played in the First Division, which is now the Premier League. The trailblazer played some 80 years before the likes of Bermuda-born Clyde Best played for West Ham United. His career did not stop there. Mr Wharton also became a professional cricketer, being recognised as a great all-round sportsman. He was the token professional player for local Yorkshire Greasbrough, but in 1914 he turned down a cricket coaching role at Durham to work as a miner. He spent 20 years down a coal mine in South Yorkshire and died a pauper aged 65 in 1930, having spent all his earnings from professional sport. Howard Holmes, of the Football Unites, Racism Divides campaign which installed a headstone on Mr Wharton's grave, went with his great-granddaughter to the event. 'You think of black footballers in England and you think of Clyde Best and Laurie Cunningham,' he said. 'But Arthur was 70 or 80 years before their time. 'That is why his story is so important because it shows there was a black presence in English football right at the very start of the professional game. 'But Arthur’s was a real riches-to-rags story. He would have been quite well-paid when he was a goalkeeper but after that he had to earn a living as a miner. 'He did that in an overwhelming white community in Yorkshire. 'Can you imagine some of the multi-millionaire Premier League footballers of today having to do that?' Fame: Mr Wharton ran the first 10-second 100 yard dash on what was an all-white athletics circuit .
