"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In a series of images from Nasa’s Curiosity rover, a white dot appears to descend to the surface of the Mars. The images are claimed by one Youtuber to be evidence of a UFO landing on the red planet. But, says Nasa, the anomaly can be easily explained as a so-called 'hot pixel' in one of the cameras. Scroll down for video . This image was taken by the Curiosity rover's Navcam Right camera and appears to show a white dot hovering above a mountain on Mars. In reality, according to an Imaging Scientist at Nasa, it is more than likely just a hot pixel, which is an anomaly in the camera that can happen during long exposure pictures . Claims of aliens on Mars are nothing new - many previous supposed sightings have been made. Hot pixels appear in a photograph as bright spots that are out of place when compared to the rest of the image. They are caused by camera sensors getting hot during long exposure images. With regards to the Curiosity rover, they often appear in images taken on Mars. They are also different from 'dead' pixels, which are permanently damaged pixels that receive no power. This latest ‘discovery’ was taking by the two cameras on the mast of the rover, its head and neck, known as Navcam Left and Navcam Right. The images were taken by the rover on 20 June, 665 Martian days since Curiosity first landed on Mars in August 2012. The white light appears to move downwards, suggesting it is moving towards the surface, in two images separated by 31 seconds. In the first image from Navcam Right the white light is above a mountain. But the next image from Navcam Left shows it is closer to the ground. Youtuber UFOvni2012 boldly claims in a video that it is a sign of a UFO arriving on Mars. In the images the light appears to be moving downards, but it's likely just a hot pixel in one 'eye' of the camera and a cosmic ray in the other. The first image (left) was taken by Navcam Right and the second (right) was taken by Navcam Left 31 seconds later on 20 June, a few days before Curiosity celebrated its 'anniversary' But speaking to the Huffington Post, Imaging Scientist Dr Justin Maki from Nasa explained what they thought the anomaly was. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. ‘This is a hot pixel that has been around since we started using the Right Navcam,’ he said. A hot pixel can show up when sensors get hot during long exposures. The reason for a similar white dot in the other image is apparently a coincidence, Nasa tells MailOnline, caused by a cosmic ray or another anomaly. Other ‘lights’ in the past have been attributed to sunlight glinting off rocks or cosmic rays striking the surface. Nasa also points out that these image artifacts, including hot pixels and cosmic rays, are relatively common and can be noticed in many other images taken by Curiosity. Curiosity has been operational on Mars since August 2012 and is now on its way to Mount Sharp. This 'find' came a few days before Curiosity celebrated a Martian year - 687 Earth days - on 24 June, having accomplished the mission's main goal of determining whether Mars once could support life . One infamous false claim of UFOs in the past was the ‘Face on Mars.’ On . 25 July 1976 Nasa’s Viking 1 orbiter released an image of a region . called Cydonia that seemed to show a human face on the Red Planet. In . reality it was nothing more than a phenomenon known as pareidolia, . where the human brain picks out faces in an object, in this instance a . chance aligning of shifting sand. In . 2006, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) imaged the region and again . and showed that the sand had continued shifting, erasing the ‘face’ from the surface. In 1976 the Viking 1 orbiter snapped an image of . a region of Mars that looked like a human face (left), leading some to . claim it was a sign of intelligent life, but 30 years later it was . proven to just be a sand dune (right)","Two images seem to show a white dot descending to the surface of Mars .

"By . Lydia Warren . An 11-year-old girl is tackling the Philadelphia Archdiocese after it banned her from playing on the Catholic Youth Organization football team because of her gender. Caroline Pla has played football since she was five, but the all-star offensive guard has now been told this will be her last season with the Romans in Bucks County due to an 'all boys' rule. 'I felt that they thought I wasn't good enough,' Caroline, a sixth grader, told Fox 29. 'It was discrimination, it just didn't feel good.' Scroll down for video . Team: Eleven-year-old Caroline Pla (right) has been told she can no longer play football as she's a girl . The CYO explained in a statement that its decision was based on a policy that football is 'a full contact sport designated for boys'. They said the policy is being reviewed to make the rule clearer. But speaking with ABC 6, Caroline said: 'It's not just a safety issue for girls. It could be a safety issue for anybody. As long as we know how to play . and play right.' She added that she was about the same size as her fellow players - 5 feet and 95 pounds in her first season, and 5-foot-3 and 110 pounds this last season. And many opposing players didn't even know they were playing against a girl due to her skill and how she presented herself on the field, she said. Hurt: Caroline said it wasn't nice to know people might think she's not as good as the other players . Key player: Caroline, right, said many opponents don't even know she is a girl when she is on the field . 'I had my hair pulled up,' she told the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'And I kept my helmet on except at halftime and the end of the game. There was never a time when I couldn't handle myself.' Life-long hobby: Caroline, pictured, has been playing football since she was just five years old . But she added: 'Sometimes, they used . curse words and made fun of me for being a girl and made fun of my . teammates for playing with a girl.' Still, the star player said that she does not want to give up her beloved hobby - or her friends. 'My . favourite thing was probably all the friends that I made through it and . they are all like my brothers now and that's the best part,' she said. 'At first, everybody was like ""whoa there's a girl,"" but then they accepted me. If I feel I want to stop, I will just stop, but as of now I want to keep going if I can.' An online petition against Caroline's treatment, entitled Allow Girls to Play, has now garnered more than 7,000 signatures. And Caroline's parents, George and Seal Pla, said their daughter also has the support of her teammates, her coach and other young girls who look up to her. 'She really wants the rule changed, not just for herself, but for the girls who have come up to her and said I'm going to play football,' Caroline's mother said. The Archdiocese said the policy is under review, but Caroline's father George said he does not believe it will change 'an archaic and discriminatory' rule. 'The decision whether or not you put a . child on a football field or any other field should be up to the parent . and the coach, and the assessment of the kid's ability should be done . objectively,' he said.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Reuters Reporter . California’s Central Valley was once known as America's food basket providing vast supplies of fruit, vegetables and meat, but as these recent photographs show the devastating effects of the state’s worst drought in decades has played havoc on the region leaving much of it unfit for farming. And it's not just farms in the region, as luxury homes and golf clubs have also been left with scorched earth where once there had been lush grass. The most populous U.S. state is in its third year of what officials are calling a catastrophic drought, leading farmers to leave fallow nearly a half-million acres of land and leaving some small communities at risk of running out of drinking water. Thousands of workers facing losing their jobs and farmers in the state are facing losses of $1.7 billion, according to recent economic study of what may be the state's driest year on record. A series of new ariel photos reveal the terrible impact that three years of catastrophic drought have had on California's Central Valle . Thousands of workers facing losing their jobs and farmers in the state are facing losses of $1.7 billion, according to recent economic study of what may be the state's driest year on record . ‘We wanted to provide a foundation for state agricultural and water policymakers to understand the impacts of the drought on farmers and farm communities,’ said Richard Howitt, professor emeritus of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis and the report's lead author. As many as 14,500 full time and seasonal jobs could be lost as a result of the drought, as farmers fallow land and there are fewer crops to plant and pick, according to the preliminary study. Altogether, 410,000 acres may be left unplanted in the San Joaquin Valley alone, the analysis showed, as farmers enter the growing season with about two-thirds of the water that they need. By comparison, a drought in 2009 led to the fallowing of 270,000 acres of cropland and the loss of 7,500 jobs, the study showed. It's not just farms in the region, as luxury homes and golf clubs have also been left with scorched earth where once there had been lush grass . The everlasting drought for the past 14 years has forced waters down more than 130 feet since a high-water mark was last reached in 2000 . ‘Everyone is trying to get a handle on how bad it's going to be,’ said Dave Kranz, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation. Most farmers in California rely on irrigation rather than rain, many purchasing supplies from federal and state projects that pump from the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta. But less water than normal is available from those sources this year. Last week, Lake Mead dropped to the lowest levels since the reservoir was filled upon the completion of the Hoover Dam in the 1930s. The everlasting drought for the past 14 years has forced waters down more than 130 feet since a high-water mark was last reached in 2000. As entire marinas run dry, the Bureau of Reclamation fears that an ongoing drought could force the agency to declare a shortage by 2017, which could ultimately affect the more than 40 million people that rely on Lake Mead for water. This picture taken from a helicopter shows aircrafts lining up next to fields of dead grass at the San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco, California . Altogether, 410,000 acres may be left unplanted in the San Joaquin Valley alone, the analysis showed, as farmers enter the growing season with about two-thirds of the water that they need . U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack visited drought-stricken homeowners on Friday in Central California, saying drought and climate change would require major investment to secure future water supplies. Vilsack also announced $9.7 million in new emergency drought aid to help rural Californians hurt by the state's three-year drought. A drought monitor sponsored by the federal government says 81 percent of the state is experiencing major agricultural losses and widespread water shortages or restrictions. All but one of the state's 58 counties are now federally designated disaster areas because of the drought, making farmers and ranchers eligible for emergency loans, according to the agriculture department. Outside the small city of Farmersville in Tulare County, 60-year-old Carlen Overby told Vilsack the running water in her home now came via a garden hose connected to a neighbor's well, the Fresno Bee reported. The drought could leave 14,500 workers without jobs in California's Central Valley, known as America's food basket for providing vast supplies of fruit, vegetables and meat . The Obama administration says it has designated more than $50 million in drought-related aid for California. Projects include supporting climate-change research hubs to seek ways to ease the impact . Overby's own well, like others in her area, had gone dry. She now showers each morning with the hose. ‘When you get up in the morning and turn the water on, you wonder if the water is going to come out,’ Overby told the agriculture secretary. The new drought spending is intended to help secure water supplies for 73,000 Californians in 11 counties. Recipients include Farmersville, where a $500,000 grant will connect residents who have dry wells to a water main. Vilsack called drought and climate change a major national concern. He said the country will have to invest in infrastructure, including more storage facilities. California Gov. Jerry Brown also is pushing for heavy investment to secure state water service, including a proposed $15 billion to build giant tunnels to carry water from the San Francisco Bay Area to the state's water-thirsty south .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Confession: Joel Jones, 47, turned himself into police Tuesday night after brutally raping a woman he lured on Facebook . A sex offender turned himself into police Tuesday night after brutally raping a woman he met on Craigslist through a fake ad looking for an office cleaner in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Joel Jones, 47, called 911 immediately after the attack and was waiting for Palm beach County Sheriff's deputies when they arrived outside the office building. 'I assaulted her,' he yelled. 'Take me to jail.' Jones went on to tell detectives that he lured the woman to the office building with an ad on Craigslist, asking for a cleaning person. The two first met at a gas station close to the building, and then the woman followed Jones in his car to the office building near 21300 Alternative A1a. Once inside, Jones gave the woman a tour, showing her all of the room she would be cleaning and when they came to the last room he made a pass at her, the victim told police according to the report. She refused him and tried to leave the room, but he then grabbed her arm and removed her pants. The woman tried to fight but Jones threatened her with a silver 'flip-style knife' - holding it against her neck. He then threw her to the floor and raped her. When Jones let the woman go, he immediately called 911. The woman says she saw him making the call as she was escaping. Jones told police he should be sent to prison because he 'tricked' the woman and 'brutally raped her' and that the crime was premeditated. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Jones has been to prison two times before - once for two years in 1991 for sexual battery and burglary and once for eight years for second-degree murder. The incident happened in an office building near this intersection in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida .","Joel Jones, 47, turned himself over to police in Palm Beach Gardens Tuesday night after admitting to raping a woman .

"By . Tahira Yaqoob . Great British Menu judge Prue Leith has blamed TV chefs for making Britons a nation of couch potatoes . She is the doyenne of the culinary world with more than 50 years’ experience in the kitchen. Great British Menu judge Prue Leith, 74, was running her own catering company at 20, ran the respected Leiths School of Food and Wine for nearly two decades and has published 12 cookbooks. But woe betide any chefs who try to impress her with food which is too clever for its own good. Miss Leith criticised molecular gastronomy chefs for trying to show off with clever techniques which added nothing to the flavour of dishes. And she complained the culture of celebrity chefs was breeding a generation who watch cookery shows 'while stuffing their faces with pizza, Pot Noodles and chocolate bars.' Speaking at the Festival of Literature in Dubai last weekend, the Cordon Bleu-trained septuagenarian said: 'The trouble with all these fashions is that every second chef who is half good thinks they can do it too. 'It tends to be dominated by machinery they have got in the kitchen rather than the quality of the ingredients or what things go together. 'You get too many flavours because something has been dehydrated and pulverised until it is a sort of sand or powder, or something has been dropped into a calcium bath to make it into little balls like caviar. Then there is a lump of meat that has been in a water bath for a long time…by the time they have done all that, where is the flavour?' Miss Leith also railed against 'ridiculous' celebrity culture, which she blamed for warping children’s aspirations. When she goes into schools and even catering colleges, pupils are only interested in TV cooks like Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay because they are famous rather than because they can cook. 'It is the wrong thing for children to aspire to,' said Miss Leith. 'Some of these TV chefs do not have any restaurants at all. 'It is just performance, which is fine, but when food came out of the BBC education [department], it was all rather solemn. 'No one cooks from celebrity chefs at all because it has nothing to do with cooking, it is just entertainment. 'They buy their books, which lie on coffee tables untouched. They watch the shows because the average adult in England watches five hours of TV a day and it just happens to be cheap telly. 'It is heartbreaking that we see these chefs doing beautiful things with wonderful ingredients while they are sitting on sofas stuffing their faces with pizza, Pot Noodles and chocolate bars.' Prue with fellow Great British Menu judges during a series special. She said 'ridiculous' celebrity culture was warping children's aspirations, also . The chef said schoolteachers were to blame for feeding a hunger for celebrity culture rather than educating children about food and cited one incident when she visited a school, only to be treated 'like Angelina Jolie' because the children had been primed to believe a star was coming. Chefs, she added, had become 'obsessed' with equipment and tricks at the cost of producing quality flavours. 'I would never say they have no place, it is just there is too much of a fashion,' she said. 'I am very happy to eat foam on top of a cappuccino because it is quite pleasant but the trouble with foam on most dishes is that it rapidly becomes scum so what started off looking like wonderful foamy rocks of seafood turns into some swimming pool you would not want to go near.' Miss Leith said she was a fan of Heston Blumenthal, describing him as an 'absolute genius'. When molecular gastronomy was done well, she added, it could enhance rather than detract from the flavour of dishes. Waiters who take too much time to describe food also came in the line of fire from the outspoken chef, who has just finished recording the ninth series of Great British Menu, which will be screened on the BBC later this year. Prue (right) at Leith's School of Food and Wine. She also criticised gastronomy chefs for using high-tech methods that affect the way food tastes . Miss Leith described a business lunch at Story restaurant in London, where diners were inflicted with a minimum of 10 courses, each accompanied by a lengthy description from the waiter. 'The waiter comes along and tells you a story for every mouthful you eat - and there are 10 courses so it takes forever,' she said. What to do if you can’t find an item in the shops? For Nigella Lawson the answer was simple – turn to Twitter. The celebrity chef tweeted Waitrose to demand: ‘Why does nobody sell  brioche burger buns?’ M&S jumped in to reply: ‘M&S is launching brioche burger AND hotdog buns. Would you like an advance sample?’ And Sainsbury’s PR added: ‘Our Taste the Difference Brioche . Burger Buns will be in stores next week!’ Miss Lawson, who has more than 500,000 followers, posted: ‘Let them eat brioche’, while other users called the storm in a teacup ‘briochegate’. 'All the food was delicious and it is fascinating stuff but this is a City restaurant. [My companion] had to leave before the pudding and I thought: ""This is not quite right."" They should serve a warning that it is a restaurant for foodies only.' Miss Leith was born in South Africa but spent her adult life in the UK. She launched her catering company in 1960, opened her Michelin starred restaurant Leith’s at the age of 29 and started her cookery school six years later. She was chairwoman of the School Food Trust for four years until 2010, a government quango set up to make school dinners healthier. She said she resented Jamie Oliver at first for bringing the issue to a head but was soon won over by his earnestness and dedication: 'My first reaction, I am ashamed to say, was: ‘My God, I have been banging on about this for 40 years and so have most of the cooks I know and people who are interested in education. 'We have all been to see the department a hundred times, we have lobbied and done our bit and along comes this whippersnapper, snaps his fingers and Tony Blair gives him lots of money. 'But that is the power of television and the power of Jamie, because he is really amazing and engaging. He has been terrific.'","People watching cookery shows 'while stuffing their faces' fault of TV chefs, said Prue Leith .

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . Doctors should order obese patients to undertake keep-fit classes in public parks, a new report says today. The influential think tank Policy Exchange urges ministers to adopt the New Zealand system of ‘green prescriptions’ where doctors are encouraged to try non-medical alternatives to curing problems like obesity. The potentially humiliating idea of forcing the overweight to exercise in public is likely to prove controversial with some. Scroll down for video . The influential think tank Policy Exchange urges ministers to adopt the New Zealand system of ‘green prescriptions’ where doctors are encouraged to try non-medical alternatives to curing problems like obesity . Video courtesy of Sport Auckland . But the centre-right think tank, which enjoys close links to the Tory leadership, says it will produce a number of benefits. These include helping people lose weight without resorting to costly surgery and providing a new use for parks which could help fund their upkeep. So-called ‘green prescribing’ usually involves doctors ordering patients to undergo some form of physical activity, typically outdoors. ‘Activities could range from intense physical exercise to horticultural work, depending on the needs and abilities of the patient,’ the report says. Under these proposals, the patient would pay the standard prescription charge, with the NHS topping up the cost of the exercise class and making a donation to the upkeep of the park. Green prescriptions have also been used to help patients with mental health and dementia problems. For example, a scheme in Sydenham, in south east London, provides gardening and craft sessions in a local park for people with early-onset dementia. Today’s report calls on the Department of Health to now pursue the idea by running a series of pilot schemes across the country. 'Green prescribing’ usually involves doctors ordering patients to undergo some form of physical outdoor activity to help them lose weight (file picture) ‘Green prescribing offers a considerable opportunity for public health funding to be used to support activities in public green spaces,’ the report says. ‘As additional benefits, such an approach may contribute to the maintenance and improvement of particular spaces, and attract people who have previously used parks either rarely or not at all.’ The call comes in a major report on the future of Britain’s urban parks, which urges ministers to investigate new ways to keep them maintained and safe. It suggests that local residents could be given council tax discounts in return for volunteering to clean up local parks, allotments and cemeteries. And it urges ministers to consider allowing residents to hold referendums on whether to impose small local levies to pay for the upkeep of parks in the area. The report says that funding for parks has been cut by more than 10 per cent in the last three years as council budgets have been squeezed by other priorities. Other ideas include making it easier for people to donate money for the upkeep of a specific local park, and requiring developers to provide endowments to pay for long-term maintenance of parks in areas of new housing. Katherine Drayson, author of the report, said: ‘Britain’s parks are the lungs of our great cities. They are an oasis of calm and tranquillity in an increasingly fast moving world. However, as local authority budgets have been squeezed, public funding on parks, cemeteries and allotments has declined sharply. ‘The time has come for radical new thinking to safeguard our parks and make them more accessible to everyone in society. With people’s disposable income still under pressure a ‘green guardian’ scheme that rewards local volunteers to help maintain their local parks with council tax rebates is just one way of protecting and enhancing our public green spaces.’","Policy Exchange urges UK doctors to offer patients non-medical alternatives .

"By . Reuters Reporter . A North Carolina man who spent nearly two decades in prison for murder will be released as early as this week as he awaits a new trial. Darryl Howard, 52, was awarded a new trial in May after a judge found misconduct during his 1995 conviction. On Tuesday, a state appeals court denied prosecutors’ request to keep Howard behind bars until they try him again, paving the way for his release. Seema Saifee, one of Howard’s attorneys, delivered the news to him by phone early on Tuesday. Darryl Howard, 52, celebrates on Tuesday after a state appeals court determined he could be released and denied prosecutors' request to keep him behind bars until they try him again . ‘There was just this moment of pure joy,’ said Saifee, a staff attorney with the nonprofit Innocence Project, which seeks to overturn wrongful convictions. ‘He has been waiting for this for so many years. He never gave up,’ she added. In overturning Howard’s conviction, Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson found that prosecutors withheld evidence and that a police officer misled the jury. Hudson called Howard’s prosecution one of the ‘most horrendous’ he’s seen in a 34-year career. The district attorney who initially prosecuted Howard, Michael Nifong, right, was disbarred in 2007 for his role in prosecuting several members of the Duke University lacrosse team who were falsely accused of rape . The . district attorney who initially prosecuted Howard, Michael Nifong, was . disbarred in 2007 for his role in prosecuting several members of the . Duke University lacrosse team who were falsely accused of rape. No . physical evidence connected Howard to the deaths of Doris Washington . and her 13-year-old daughter Nishonda in a Durham housing complex in . 1991. Shortly after the murders, a tipster implicated two members of a drug-related gang called the New York Boys in the crime. A police record of that account, which included references to the victims’ rape that had not been publicized at the time, was never shared with Howard’s defense attorneys. DNA tests at the time showed that semen found in the victims was not Howard’s, but Nifong argued in court that the murders were unrelated to a sexual assault. No physical evidence connected Howard to the deaths of Doris Washington and her 13-year-old daughter Nishonda in a Durham housing complex in 1991 . Recent tests have linked the samples to a convicted felon with a history of assaulting women.

"By . Reuters Reporter . and Joel Christie . The Florida Supreme Court disbarred a former circuit judge on Thursday for having a 'personal and emotional relationship' with a prosecutor that started during a death penalty case he was trying before her. The seven high court justices voted unanimously to toughen the penalty recommended by a hearing officer, who had called for a one-year suspension of Judge Ana Gardiner. The high court said such an ethical lapse in a capital case that later resulted in a death sentence being reduced to life in prison, and her initial efforts to downplay her involvement with assistant state attorney Howard Scheinberg, required her disbarment. Scroll down for video . Disbarred: Anna Gardiner was officially kicked out of the legal profession on Thursday for failing to disclose the personal relationship she started with homicide prosecutor Howard Scheinberg while presiding over a murder trial he was leading in 2007. Gardiner is pictured here testifying in 2012 . Suspended: While trying a death-penalty case before Judge Ana Gardiner in 2007, Howard Scheinberg, 53, exchanged 949 phone calls and 471 text messages with the judge and has been suspended from practicing law for two years for the relationship . Homicide: Omar Loureiro was on trial for the stabbing murder of James Lentry, 57, in Lighthouse Point on New Years Day in 2001. After Gardiner sentenced him to death in 2007, it was revealed she had shared a relationship with the lead prosecutor in the case, Howard Scheinberg. Loureiro was granted a retrial and sentenced to life in prison . The court said Gardiner had a chance meeting with Scheinberg at a restaurant during the murder trial of Omar Loureiro in 2007, and they joined some others at a bar after dinner. Between March 23, several days before a jury returned a guilty verdict against Loureiro, and August 24, when she sentenced him to death, the court said Gardiner and Scheinberg exchanged 949 cell phone calls and 471 text messages. Loureiro was charged with the fatal stabbing of James Lentry, 57, in Lighthouse Point on New Years Day in 2001. He had claimed Lentry made unwanted and aggressive sexual advances toward him. When the Judicial Qualifications Commission began an investigation in late 2008, the court said Gardiner 'failed to disclose the honest and true nature of her relationship with Scheinberg' during Louriero's trial. It was not until the following April, when the Broward state attorney was investigating, that Gardiner 'acknowledged for the first time her ongoing emotional relationship with Scheinberg'. According to The Sun Sentinel, the relationship between Gardiner and Scheinberg was not romantic. Ana Gardiner resigned from the Broward Circuit Court bench in 2010 after serving for 11 years. She now has 30 days to close out her Fort Lauderdale law practice after being disbarred on Thursday . Ana Gardiner has been a member of the Florida Bar since 1988. The Bar said Gardiner misled the Judicial Qualifications Commission into believing her contact with Scheinberg from March through August 2007 was minimal. She is seen here in an early career photo . She resigned from the bench in 2010, after 11 years as a judge. In 2013 Gardiner married David Bogenschutz, who acted as her attorney during the Scheinberg investigation. The Supreme Court suspended Scheinberg from practice for two years. He will be allowed to return to the practice of law in 2015. After the relationship between judge and prosecutor became known, Loureiro got a new trial and his sentence was reduced from death to life in prison. 'Considering Gardiner's dishonest conduct and the harm that her actions have caused to the administration of justice in a capital first-degree murder case, we conclude that disbarment is the appropriate action,' said the Supreme Court order. The court also ordered her to pay $8,117.18 in costs.","Ana Gardiner, 52, sentenced Omar Loureiro to death in 2007 after presiding over his murder trial .

"By . David Mccormack . and Reuters Reporter . The nation’s pig farmers are struggling to get to grips with a deadly virus that has wiped out more than 10 percent of the animals in less than a year and sent retail pork prices soaring to record highs. The highly contagious killer stalking U.S. hog farms is known as PEDv - Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus. Puzzled scientists are searching for its origins and a cure, while farmers are suffering devastating financial losses. Since June 2013 as many as seven million pigs have died in the United States due to the virus, said Steve Meyer, president of Iowa-based Paragon Economics and consultant to the National Pork Board. The nation's pig farmers are struggling to get to grips with a deadly virus that has wiped out more than 10 percent of the animals in less than a year and sent retail pork prices soaring to record highs . United States Department of Agriculture data shows the nation's hog herd at about 63 million as of March 1, 2014. PEDv was first diagnosed in Ohio last May and has spread within a year to 30 states with no reliable cure in sight. U.S. packing plants may produce almost two percent less pork in 2014, according to Ken Mathews, USDA agricultural economist. Last week the USDA responded to calls for more reliable data and classified PEDv as a reportable disease, a step that requires the pork industry to track its spread. ‘It's a positive step that I wish they had taken last summer when it became obvious this was spreading rapidly,’ said Meyer. Most farmers and researchers believe PEDv is transmitted from pig to pig by contact with pig manure. ‘Something like a tablespoon of PEDv infected manure is roughly enough to infect the entire U.S. hog herd,’ said Rodney ‘Butch’ Baker, swine biosecurity specialist at Iowa State University. Pork prices have soared to an all-time high of $3.83 a pound . The National Pork Board has spent about $1.7 million researching the virus, which is nearly always fatal in pigs younger than 21 days. With pork prices at an all-time high of $3.83 a pound, the loss of baby pigs cuts into profits for hog farmers. ‘If you have four weeks of mortality in a PEDv break, that's pretty devastating to the financial wellbeing of that operation,’ said Greg Boerboom, a Minnesota hog farmer. PEDv does not pose a risk to human health and is not a food safety issue, the USDA says. Months of forensic research so far have turned up no clear evidence of how the disease entered the United States. The virus is nearly identical to one that infected pigs in China's Anhui province, according to a report published in the American Society of Microbiology journal mBio. Researchers also are exploring whether the widespread use of pig-blood byproducts in hog feed might have introduced the disease. Infected piglets cannot absorb nutrients from food or water, they contract diarrhea and die from dehydration . There have been outbreaks in recent years in Europe, Japan, Mexico and parts of South America, though in milder forms than seen in the U.S. and China. The disease has taken root in Canada, too, where the pork industry is deeply integrated with U.S. pork production. PEDv thrives in cold, damp environments, and after slowing last summer its spread accelerated during the past winter. In mid-December, there were over 1,500 cases but by mid-April, that had more than tripled to 5,790, according to USDA data. Altogether, of nearly 15,000 samples tested for PEDv about 32 percent have been positive. The virus ‘acts like a lawn mower’ on the villi in a pig's intestines, which are the tiny projections that aid digestion, said Tony Forshey, chief of animal health at the Ohio Department of Agriculture. With their villi gone, the piglets cannot absorb nutrients from food or water, contract diarrhea and die from dehydration. So far, no vaccine has been able to completely protect pigs from the disease. An Iowa company, Harrisvaccines Inc., has made some progress, while pharmaceutical giants Merck Animal Health and Zoetis Inc have joined with universities to begin vaccine development. ‘There is no silver bullet for PEDv,’ said Justin Ellis, marketing manager at Alltech, which developed a feed additive designed to reduce risk of the disease. The disease is spreading even as farmers and truckers impose stricter cleanliness measures across the so-called Hog Belt, which stretches across most of the U.S. Midwest and Plains States and extends south to North Carolina, the nation's No. 2 hog producer. Iowa ranks first. Bright yellow signs marked ‘PED’ are popping up outside North Carolina farms warning the virus is present. One-third of North Carolina's 3,000 hog farms have been struck by PEDv since the first diagnosed case there in June 2013, the state says. So many piglets have died that Tom Butler, a farmer who fattens hogs for market in southeastern Harnett County, is having difficulty finding animals. His herd is down 25 percent to 6,000 pigs, costing him more than $100,000.","Pig farmers are suffering catastrophic losses as the industry has been rocked by the deadly PED virus .

"By . Reuters Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . Police in the California community where a man killed six college students said on Monday they had no grounds to search the 22-year-old suspect's home when they met with him in April over a report that he had posted disturbing videos. The disclosure that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department sent deputies to Elliot Rodger's door just weeks before Friday night's shooting rampage has raised questions about whether police could have done more to prevent the attack. Rodger's mother asked deputies on April 30 to check on him at his apartment in the town of Isla Vista, near the University of California at Santa Barbara, after she saw videos he had posted on the Internet that she found disturbing. Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said his deputies found Elliot Rodger to be 'polite' when they went to his apartment on April 30 . In his 140-page manifesto, Rodger said that 'it would have ended everything' if they had demanded to come inside. He wrote that officers would have 'found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them. I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies. 'I can’t imagine a hell darker than that. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case, but it was so close.' Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown has said that deputies found Rodger to be polite and courteous during the encounter and that he did not appear to meet the criteria to be held on mental health grounds. On Monday, sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Hoover declined to discuss that visit in greater detail, pending an internal investigation, but said that deputies in general were barred from entering a residence without a warrant. 'An exception would be if deputies felt that a person was a harm to themselves or others or there was an immediate threat,' Hoover said. Elliot Rodger said in his online memoir that if cops had searched his apartment, they would have found his three handguns and his plot to kill . 'In this case, we would have had to determine that Elliot Rodger or his roommates were in immediate danger.' Rodger wrote that he manipulated the officers to get them out of his hair. 'I tactfully told them that it was all a misunderstanding, and they finally left. If they had demanded to search my room… That would have ended everything,' he said in his manifesto. Authorities say Rodger fatally stabbed three roommates in his apartment before shooting three students to death near the University of California at Santa Barbara. He then shot himself. The two women and four men who were killed were aged 19 to 22 and students at the school. Thirteen people were wounded, including eight shot by Rodger as he sped through town in his black BMW, exchanging fire with police, authorities said. 'HE WAS JUST VERY QUIET' Officers found Rodger dead in his car with three legally purchased pistols and more than 400 rounds of ammunition. Chris Pollard, who lived in the same building as Rodger and knew him before the attacks, told Reuters in an interview that the videos that had concerned his mother should have been red flags for the sheriff's department. Sheriff Brown has ordered an internal investigation of how his deputies handled their interaction with Rodger . 'When it got to the point that the parents called the police, it makes me wonder if the police even looked at the videos,' Pollard, 22, said. 'If they'd looked at the videos, they could've done some sort of court order to do a search warrant.' But the young man conceded that deputies would have needed legal grounds to search Rodger or his home and may not have found that justification during their visit to his apartment. 'When you looked at him, there was no reason to get concerned. He didn't seem like a threatening or intimidating guy. He was just very quiet,' Pollard said. David Dusenbury, a former deputy chief of police in Long Beach, California, said the deputies could have obtained a warrant if the video explicitly threatened violence. 'If the caller said they feared he was going to harm somebody or himself based upon Internet postings, I would say the deputies did not go far enough in their investigation,' Dusenbury said. He said that deputies could also have run Rodger through their system to learn he had guns registered in his name . The deadly rampage has left the communities of Isla Vista and Santa Barbara reeling. A spokeswoman for Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital said four of the wounded were in good condition and one was in fair condition. The University of California at Santa Barbara, which is headed into its final exams, canceled classes on Tuesday for a day of mourning.","Deputies showed up at Elliot Rodger's apartment on April 30 after his mother found his online videos and was disturbed by what she saw .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Reuters Reporter . Dangerous: The FDA issued a warning against using a prescription oral viscous lidocaine 2 per cent solution (not pictured) as a pain reliever on teething babies' gums . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday against using a lidocaine solution as a pain reliever on teething babies' gums, saying it can cause deaths and serious injuries. The agency will require a boxed warning on the label for prescription oral viscous lidocaine 2 per cent solution to highlight that it should not be used for teething pain, the FDA said in a statement. Viscous lidocaine is normally used to treat mouth or throat ulcers, such as that surface from chemotherapy, or to reduce children's gag reflex during dental procedures. ’When too much viscous lidocaine is given to infants and young children or they accidentally swallow too much, it can result in seizures, severe brain injury, and problems with the heart,’ the statement said. Overdoses or accidental swallowing have led to infants and children being hospitalized or dying, the FDA said. Pain relievers and medications rubbed on gums are useless because they wash out of the baby’s mouth within minutes, it also warned. The FDA said it had reviewed 22 reports this year of serious reactions, including deaths, in children ages 5 months to 3.5 years who were given the lidocaine solution or who swallowed it by accident. Do's and Don'ts: The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends using a teething ring chilled in the refrigerator - not the freezer - or gently massaging the child's gums . The agency urged parents to follow the American Academy of Pediatricians' recommendations for treating teething pain. They call for using a chilled teething ring, or gently massaging the child's gums with your finger. FDA officials have also recommended against use of benzocaine products for children under age 2 except under a doctor's supervision. Like viscous lidocaine, benzocaine is a local anesthetic. FDA representatives could not immediately say which pharmaceutical companies make the products that will have to carry the warnings.","Prescription oral viscous lidocaine 2 per cent solution will come with warning on the box .

Park spokeswoman Amy Bartlett said, 'It was a spring-like day and they were frisky' Super-volcanoes are considered the second most globally cataclysmic event, next to an asteroid strike, The Independent reported earlier in January. The super-volcano at Yellowstone last erupted at about 640,000 years ago and sent more than 1,000 cubic kilometers of ash and lava into the air. The 4.8 magnitude earthquake that struck early Sunday near the Norris Geyser Basin in the northwest section of Yellowstone, which spans 3,472 square miles of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, caused no injuries or damages and did not make any noticeable alterations to the landscape, geologists said. Though benign by seismic standards, the earthquake was the largest to rattle Yellowstone since a 4.8 quake in February 1980 and it occurred near an area of ground uplift tied to the upward movement of molten rock in the super-volcano, whose mouth, or caldera, is 50 miles long and 30 miles wide. Super-volcanoes are considered the second most globally cataclysmic event, next to an asteroid strike. Mammoth Hot Springs, an area of the park, is visible here . But neither the quake, the largest among hundreds that have struck near the geyser basin in the last seven months, nor the uplift suggest an eruption sooner than tens of thousands of years, said Peter Cervelli, associate director for science and technology at the U.S. Geological Survey's Volcano Science Center in California. 'The chance of that happening in our lifetimes is exceedingly insignificant,' said Cervelli, a scientist with the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. Cervelli said the area of uplift that scientists have been tracking since August is rising at a rate of between 10 centimeters (4 inches) and 15 centimeters a year. Geologists who tracked uplift in the same area from 1996 to 2003 also saw elevated seismic activity, he said.","Officials said video actually shows bison running down paved road that leads into the park .

"By . Reuters Reporter . and Ap  Reporter . A federal judge has thrown out over $12 million in punitive damages awarded to billionaire William Koch in his lawsuit accusing a fellow oenophile of selling him 24 bottles of fake Bordeaux and reduced the award to $711,622. U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan agreed Monday with the defendant, Silicon Valley entrepreneur Eric Greenberg, that the jury's April 2013 award was 'exorbitant', being more than 33 times the $355,811 it awarded in compensatory damages. Oetken also lowered those damages to $212,699, reflecting Koch's prior settlement with Zachys Wine Auctions Inc, reducing the total award to $924,321 from nearly $12.4 million. 'The jury found that (Greenberg) had shamelessly defrauded customers with ''garbage'',’ Oetken wrote. Not smiling now: Florida billionaire William Koch (left) seen here with his lawyer after being awarded over $12 million in a fake wine lawsuit, has now had his damaged cut to less than $1 million because the judge thought he was being overcompensated . 'Yet his conduct did not cause a particularly egregious harm: he was dealing in luxury goods marketed to a sophisticated and wealthy subset of the population.' 'The harm was strictly economic, and the victims were far from vulnerable consumers. 'These facts merit a relatively low award of punitive damages.' Oetken said punitive damages equal to two times compensatory damages would punish Greenberg and deter other fraudsters. In letting the verdict stand, the judge said Greenberg did not meet his 'heavy burden' of showing that reasonable jurors could not have ruled against him. Greenberg had maintained that he thought the wines were authentic. The trial lasted three weeks. Oetken also denied Koch's requests to recoup $7.9 million of attorney's fees and restrict Greenberg's future wine sales. John Hueston, a lawyer for Koch, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Koch is the brother of conservative political activists Charles and David Koch, who run Wichita-based Koch Industries. Florida energy magnate William Koch arrives at Manhattan federal court in New York. Koch alleged that California businessman Eric Greenberg sold him $300,000 in vintage wine, some of it supposedly dated to 1805, that turned out to be phony . 'This is obviously a very dramatic turnaround,' said Arthur Shartsis, a lawyer for Greenberg. 'Though we maintain that Eric did not defraud anybody, the thrust of the judge's decision is correct on compensatory damages, although high on punitive damages.'In his lawsuit, Koch accused Greenberg of knowingly selling him counterfeit wine at an October 2005 Zachys auction, including Chateau Lafite from 1811, Chateau Latour from 1864 and 1865, and a magnum of Chateau Petrus from 1921. Koch has also filed other lawsuits claiming he was deceived into buying fake wine. In October 2012, a federal appeals court in New York dismissed his lawsuit against Christie's auction house over bottles that allegedly belonged to Thomas Jefferson, which had been offered by German dealer Hardy Rodenstock. Koch, 73, is the founder of the Oxbow Energy group. Forbes magazine this month estimated his net worth at $3.9 billion.","Florida energy magnate William Koch filed a lawsuit in 2013 against California businessman Eric Greenberg .

"By . Reuters Reporter . A classified U.S. Senate report found that the CIA's legal justification for the use of harsh interrogation techniques that critics say amount to torture was based on faulty legal reasoning, McClatchy news service reported on Thursday. The Central Intelligence Agency also issued erroneous claims about how many people it subjected to techniques such as simulated drowning, or 'water boarding,' according to the news service, citing conclusions from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report obtained by McClatchy. The report also concluded that the CIA used interrogation methods that were not approved by its own headquarters or the U.S. Justice Department, impeded White House oversight and actively evaded oversight both by Congress and its own Inspector General. The CIA also provided false information to the U.S. Justice Department, which used that information to conclude that the methods would not break the law because those applying them did not specifically intend to inflict severe pain or suffering, the report added. Military Police at camp X-Ray on the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, bring a detainee to an interrogation room on February 6, 2002. A new report about how the CIA handled terror suspects after September 11 has been leaked, however it is not clear what location it pertains to . The report says the CIA's were brutal and far worse than the agency communicated to policymakers' Human rights activists called for the immediate declassification of the entire document. 'The report's findings appear to show that the CIA systematically misled Congress, the White House, and the Department of Justice about its brutal and unlawful interrogation program,' said Raha Wala, senior counsel at Human Rights First in Washington. 'How does it make sense for the president to allow the CIA to take charge of declassifying a report that shows unlawful and embarrassing conduct on its part?' she asked in a statement responding to the McClatchy report. CIA spokesman Dean Boyd told Reuters he could not comment because the report is still classified. 'As we have stated previously, the CIA, in consultation with other agencies, will carry out an expeditious classification review of those portions of the final SSCI report submitted to the Executive Branch for review,' he said. 'Our response to the 2012 version of the SSCI report found several areas in which CIA and SSCI agreed, and several other areas in which we disagreed,' he added. A version of the report was finished in 2012, but it was revised before the Senate committee voted in favor of declassifying parts of it, including its findings and conclusions, on April 3. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's Democratic chairwoman, said then she hoped President Barack Obama's administration would declassify the report within 30 days. The entrance to the CIA headquarters in Langley in Fairfax County, Virginia . Feinstein declined to comment on McClatchy's story, but said: 'If someone distributed any part of this classified report, they broke the law and should be prosecuted.' The vote to lift the blackout on the summary and recommendations of the 6,200-page report followed an unprecedented clash between Feinstein and the CIA. Feinstein accused the agency of spying on Democratic committee staff who compiled it and the CIA accused staff members of illegally obtaining CIA documents. The massive undertaking has also caused tensions between Democrats on the intelligence committee, who conducted the report, and some committee Republicans, who said they considered the process politicized and the report biased. They disputed assertions that the interrogation techniques had not helped to track down now slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden or others suspected of terrorism. Once the White House and CIA finish the declassification process, the report will give the world its first official look at the regimen of interrogation and detentions in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks under Republican U.S. President George W. Bush.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters Reporter . David Beckham is facing a huge backlash against his plans for a 25,000-seater soccer stadium in Miami. An alliance of shipping businesses and a billionaire car dealer have launched a campaign protesting the football star’s venue, which would be situated at the Port of Miami in Florida, and include a restaurant and a nightclub. The consortium, which publicized their opposition in a full-page advertisement in two major newspapers yesterday, said if given the green light, it would threaten the city's plans to capitalize on the expansion of the Panama Canal. Scroll down for video . Under fire: David Beckham's plans for a 25,000-seater stadium in Miami are facing powerful opposition . New stadium: The first designs for Beckham's planned state-of-the-art stadium have been revealed . Open letter: The Miami Seaport Alliance took out full-page ads in the Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald (pictured) on Monday explaining their opposition to Beckham's plans for a 25,000-seater stadium in Miami . The as-yet-unnamed stadium would be paid for by Beckham and his partners, and the venue would host 17 Major League Soccer games, as well as additional post-season games, soccer friendlies, and other entertainment. In the Miami Herald and its sister Spanish-language paper, El Nuevo Herald, the Miami Seaport Alliance told Beckham: 'We cannot jeopardize well-paying jobs, like crane operators, longshore workers, and mechanics, for low-paying stadium jobs, such as concession sales.' The group is being led by John Fox, who has retired as Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's head of governmental affairs. The group includes billionaire car dealer Norman Braman, the one-time owner of Philadelphia Eagles, in addition to two chapters of the International Longshoremen's Association and two stevedore companies, whose workers load and unload ships. ‘There are plenty of other places for the stadium to be,’ Braman said.

Tourist attraction: The venue would host 17 MLS games, as well as additional post-season games . Impressive plans: Beckham's stadium at the Port of Miami would feature a nightclub and restaurants . Prime real estate: Port of Miami is one of the world's busiest ports . The English former football player last month unveiled detailed plans for a 25,000-seat waterfront stadium . on the island port with sweeping views of downtown Miami. Development of the 36-acre space would cost about $200m and include shops, hotels and offices connected to the mainland by a pedestrian bridge. The port is one of four potential areas for the new stadium, which Beckham's team say will create a new destination for Miami residents. Grand designs: A Royal Caribbean cruise ship docked near Miami, where the company has its headquarters . Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said: ‘There’s nothing concrete, there's no recommendation pending.’ The port's master plan calls for the development of more than 7m-sq-ft of convention, hotel and office space on the same site. Before Monday's ad, only Royal Caribbean, which is headquartered at the port, has come out publicly against Beckham's plan. Neisen Kasdin, an attorney for Akerman Senterfitt and adviser for the Beckham group, said: ‘The plan doesn't interfere with port operations. In front of the mic: Beckham attended a press conference in Miami back in February with commissioner Don Garber (left) and Mayor Carlos Gimenez (right) ‘It will likely generate more revenue for the port in the shorter term than other concepts that have been discussed.’ Yet a growing list of opponents say a stadium would jeopardise Miami's aspiration of becoming a more attractive choice for global shippers looking to distribute goods to the US market. Neither Braman nor Fox would say who paid for the two ads in Monday's papers, worth nearly $25,000. ‘I haven't given any dollars yet but I would if asked,’ Braman added.

"By . Reuters Reporter . Kids in the U.S. have been getting fatter since the turn of the century. Childhood obesity rates have . increased over the past 14 years, according to a new study published on this week. The new findings conflict directly with official government health . researchers who claimed less than two months ago there had been a sharp drop in preschool obesity rates over the . past decade. Gaining: Childhood obesity is on the rise in the U.S. after all, according to a new report after a 14 year study . The 'good . news', announced in February by researchers at the U.S. Centers for . Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), received widespread media coverage . and prompted first lady Michelle Obama to say she was 'thrilled at the . progress that had been made over the last few years. However, the new study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, used . the same data source as the CDC, but analyzed obesity rates over a . different timeframe. It found increases in obesity for children age 2 to . 19, and a marked rise in the percentage who were severely obese. Asheley . Cockrell Skinner of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, . who led the new study, said the main message of her analysis is that . childhood obesity rates have not improved. 'I . don't want a study like the previous one to change the national . discourse,' she told Reuters Health, referring to the CDC's work. Obesity . experts had already begun to question the large drop reported by the . CDC for children ages 2 to 5. In their February paper the CDC scientists . themselves acknowledged the statistical limitations of their data. CDC . researcher Cynthia Ogden, who led the study released in February, said . in response that her report described trends over the last 10 years and . found 'an apparent decline in obesity among children ages 2-5 (which we . said in the paper should be interpreted cautiously).' 'We're confident in our analysis for this time period,' she wrote in an email to Reuters Health on Monday, . Data: The analysis is based on 14 years of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of 26,690 children aged 2 to 19 . The . February report from the CDC found that the rate of obesity among . children ages 2 to 5 fell to 8.4 percent in 2011-2012 from 13.9 percent . in 2003-2004. Skinner and . her colleagues used the same data as the CDC researchers, from the . National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, but looked at a few . additional years. 'In 2003 . there was an unusual spike in the number for whatever reason - probably . an error,' Skinner said. 'When you take a long view from 1999 to now, . you don't see that decline.' About 27,000 U.S. children between the ages of 2 and 19 were included in the survey between 1999 and 2012. Children . are considered obese when their body mass index, a measure of weight in . relation to height, exceeds that of 95 percent of their peers of the . same age and sex. Expanding waistline: Though the analysis indicates the prevalence of all forms of obesity have increased overall, the rate increases were most significant among Hispanic females and black males. Overall, . obesity rates increased from 14.5 percent in the 1999-2000 survey to . 17.3 percent in 2011-2012. There was also a marked increase in the rate . of severe obesity over the study period, the researchers found. Among . preschoolers age 2 to 5, the rate was slightly lower, but that could . have been due to chance. 'Even . though we don't see huge increases in the rates of children who are . overweight or obese, there are clearly more in the categories that are . severely obese,' Skinner said. There . were especially noticeable increases in the rates of severe obesity . among black boys, Hispanic girls and white girls, Skinner said. Rates for all obesity categories remained relatively unchanged between the 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 surveys. Skinner . said there is some evidence that intensive weight loss can be . beneficial for overweight and obese children, but intensive weight loss . programs are not widely available. Referring . to the CDC's conclusion that obesity among preschoolers had fallen 43 . percent, Dr Ihuoma Eneli, medical director for the Center for Healthy . Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, . Ohio, said, 'we definitely have to look to see what the results are over . the next few years to see if that 43 percent drop is sustained and a . true decline.'","Latest report suggests no real progress has been made when it comes to combating childhood obesity .

"By . Reuters Reporter . General Motors Co approved ignition switches for cars that have been linked to 13 deaths, even though the parts did not appear to meet the company's specifications, officials of Delphi Automotive told U.S. congressional investigators. In a memo released on Sunday by the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, documents provided by GM and a federal regulator provided 'unsettling' information, according to Republican Representative Tim Murphy, who leads a subcommittee of the panel. The memo was released ahead of Tuesday's testimony from GM Chief Executive Mary Barra, who will appear at the committee's first public hearing on the recalls. She is likely to be asked why it took GM so long to identify and address the ignition switch problem. Scroll down for video . Wrongfully approved: The inside of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. during a crash test by the US government - ignition switches in the car were approved despite being faulty, part supplier Delphi says . The information from Delphi officials was detailed in the memo, which is mainly a chronology of actions taken by GM and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration since the late 1990s and through Friday, when GM expanded its global recall of cars with defective ignition switches to 2.6 million. GM switches in Chevrolet Cobalts and other models were prone to being bumped or jostled into accessory mode while cars were moving, which would shut off engines and disable power steering, power brakes and airbags, leading to dozens of crashes. Delphi told U.S. congressional investigators last week that GM approved the original part in 2002, despite the fact it did not meet GM specifications . Congressional investigators also want to know what led NHTSA, as long ago as 2007 and 2010, to determine that there was not a safety defect trend with airbags that were failing to deploy in Chevrolet Cobalts. 'What did NHTSA do to investigate whether a trend existed? What data did it consider,' the committee asked. The Energy and Commerce Committee said GM had submitted more than 200,000 documents on the ignition switches. The panel said the NHTSA submitted about 6,000 documents. Mixup: Consulting materials engineer Mark Hood shows the serial numbers are the same for the 2006 ignition switch and a newer one. McSwain Engineering, Inc. helped to conduct the engineering investigations and failure analysis that resulted in the recall of 1.65 million GM vehicles . Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican, did not give details on what was 'unsettling' about the information the panel received. His statement was accompanied by the memo, prepared by Republican investigators. 'FRAGILE' SWITCH . According to one entry of the chronology in the memo, officials of Delphi, which supplied the ignition switches to the recalled GM cars, told committee investigators that GM had approved the part, even though sample testing of the ignition switch torque was below the original specifications set by the automaker. The committee, according to aides, does not know GM's thinking on why it may have approved a part that did not meet all specifications. One aide, who asked not to be identified, noted that there were 60 specifications for the switch and it is not clear what the significance is of one specification being below-standard. That is one of the questions the committee intends to ask in hearings. GM knew as early as 2001 that it was facing problems with its ignition switch, but no auto recalls were ordered until earlier this year. A February 2005 entry in the congressional committee's chronology illustrates that engineers were grappling with what to do about the defective ignition switches. 'Engineers considered increasing or changing the ignition switch 'torque effort,' but were advised by the ignition switch engineer that it is 'close to impossible to modify the present ignition switch' as the switch is 'very fragile and doing any further changes will lead to mechanical and/or electrical problems.' The committee's memo concludes with a series of questions, which likely will dominate Tuesday's hearing with Barra. 'Why did GM approve ignition switches that did not meet its specifications for torque performance? What was GM's assessment of the implications for performance and safety,' the memo asked. It is also not clear yet which GM engineer approved a revision to the ignition switch in 2006, and why the change did not lead to an earlier recall of older model cars to fix the problem.","Parts manufacturer Delphi says it raised concerns about the ignition switches but GM approved them .
More than z dozen deaths linked to the part have sparked global recalls numbering in the millions ."
"By . Reuters Reporter . A pregnant California professor will face charges for allegedly shoving a 16-year-old anti-abortion protestor and stealing another picketer's sign during a campus demonstration earlier this month, a prosecutor said on Friday. Mireille Miller-Young, an associate professor who teaches feminist studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, faces misdemeanor charges of theft, battery and vandalism, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley said in a statement. Miller-Young was seen in a YouTube video viewed over 66,000 times clashing with members of the 'Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust' group who organized an anti-abortion event on the university campus in early March. Scroll down for video . Charged: Mireille Miller-Young, an associate professor who teaches feminist studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara, is said to have been offended by the anti-abortion imagery and took the protestors sign, with the help of two of her students (pictured) On camera: After Miller-Young allegedly took the sign, protestors started filming . The protestors: Anti-abortionist Thrin Short (right), pictured with her sister and fellow protestor Joan Short, claims to have been assaulted by Mireille Miller-Young . One of the members of the 'Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust' group claims to have had a clash with Miller-Young and been left with minor scratches . Mireille Miller-Young, Ph.D., is Associate Professor of Feminist Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Her research explores race, gender and sexuality in visual culture and sex industries in the United States . The video posted by the group begins with a written statement saying that a group was carrying signs showing 'images of abortion victims' and distributing pamphlets to provoke a dialogue among students. It then claims a professor grabbed a sign from one of the protestor's, Thrin Short, 16 gave it to some of her students that were walking with her, and then walked off, with the protesters following her through several campus buildings. 'Before she grabbed the sign, she was . mocking me and talking over me in front of the students, saying that she . was twice as old as me and had three degrees, so they should listen to . her and not me,' Short told Fox News. The protesters, who cannot be seen on camera, can be heard saying, 'She's a thief. She's a professor'. In response, Miller-Young turned around and said, 'I may be a thief, but you're a terrorist'. When the protesters attempt to enter an elevator with Miller-Young, the group claims the professor shoved a protester several times and scratched her. 'It is ironic that a female professor, who claims to be pro-woman, would resort to theft and violence against another woman in her attempt to silence a different point of view,' the group said in a statement on its website. Mireille Miller-Young allegedly called the protestors 'terrorists' as she made off with their picket sign . The university did not immediately return phone calls and an email on Friday seeking comment. Miller-Young's attorney declined to comment. In an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper on Friday, Miller-Young said she was 'triggered' by the graphic images on the sign and pamphlets carried by the protesters. She added that she was especially offended by the protesters' cause because of her focus of study and because she is currently pregnant. Thrin's father, William Short, who met with prosecutors, said he would have expected an academic to engage in thoughtful debate with someone she disagreed with. 'She was free to engage in a rational dialogue with them,' Short said after learning the professor had been charged. 'Instead, she chose to bully them, steal and destroy their property, and hit and scratch my daughter. After doing so, she said she thought she was setting a good example for her students. 'I think the goal of this prosecution should be to set a good example for her students, one that will not only deter her from repeating this conduct, but will also deter those who approve of her actions from imitating her appalling behavior.' Miller-Young is scheduled for arraignment in Santa Barbara Superior Court on April 4, it said. Her research explores race, gender and sexuality in visual culture and sex industries in the United States. In a previous interview, she described herself as a 'porn scholar' when discussing her manuscript, called A Taste for Brown Sugar: Black Women, Sex Work and Pornography.

It took until the mid-1980s for his lawyer to gain legal possession of Stroud’s manuscript but then publishers concerned about libel balked at a book that named brutal guards and supposedly on-the-take wardens. ‘To sadistic-minded persons, helplessness is always an invitation to cruelty,’ Stroud wrote in the brown, faded and stained manuscript that languished in a basement long after his death in 1963. The manuscript – more than 2,000 pages - was stored at the Springfield, Missouri home of Stroud's former lawyer Dudley Martin. Now that the people named in the book have died and the statute of limitations on libel has expired, his manuscript has been converted into a four-part book Looking Outward: A History Of The U.S. Prison System From Colonial Times To The Formation Of The Bureau Prisons. Lawyer Dudley Martin looks at handwritten manuscripts written by Robert Stroud at his home in Springfield, Missouri . Burt Lancaster starred as Robert Stroud in the 1962 movie Birdman of Alcatraz . ‘If there is anybody who could write about federal prisons, it was him,’ said J.E. Cornwell of Springfield, the book's publisher. Part I, Looking Outward, A Voice From The Grave, has recently been published in E-book form. In it, Stroud reveals that he was gay, though he had married a woman while in prison who was his partner in a bird-related business on the outside. Stroud entered federal prison in 1909 at age 19 after being convicted of manslaughter for killing with his bare hands a man in Alaska who allegedly beat up a prostitute. He spent the next 54 years in four different federal facilities. In 1916, Stroud knifed a guard to death at the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, over a dispute about visiting privileges for Stroud's mother. He served the next 43 years in solitary confinement. Stroud began studying birds at Leavenworth and wrote two heralded scientific books on bird diseases, which led to the 1962 movie about his life called Birdman Of Alcatraz starring Burt Lancaster. Stroud entered federal prison in 1909 at age 19 and died in 1963, aged 73. The photo on the left was taken in the 1920s and then one on the right during the 1930s . ‘Here is a guy with a third-grade education who somehow educated himself to write books on birds that were followed around the world,’ said his lawyer, Dudley Martin, 80. ‘My father raised gamecocks and he used Stroud's book when they got sick.’ After his transfer to Alcatraz in 1942, Stroud turned his attention to researching the history of federal prisons and interviewing inmates and guards. ‘Nobody else had written this stuff and the federal prison system did not want it out,’ Martin said. Stroud spent years trying to get his book published, finally suing the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in 1962 to allow publication. But Stroud died in 1963 before the lawsuit was resolved. And it took 21 years for Martin, the administrator of Stroud's will, to get legal possession of the manuscripts from probate. In 1942, Stroud was transferred to Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, and became inmate #594 . Martin's secretary put Stroud's hand-written notebook manuscripts into type, more than 2,000 pages single-spaced. Martin sent the book to three New York publishers, all of whom turned it down, concerned about libel suits. The manuscripts went into storage at Martin's house in the mid-1980s. Some 30 years later, the people named in the book have died and the statute of limitations on libel has expired, Martin said. More of his writings are to come, with the volumes tracing the rise and degeneration of the prison reform movement and how sex in prison contributed to character destruction. Stroud spent the last four years of his life at the federal medical center prison in Springfield. Martin took over as his lawyer after Stroud's transfer from Alcatraz and met him only once, in court. ‘He was a great big, tall man,’ Martin said. ‘I had to look up at him.’ Martin said Stroud would be pleased to know the public is finally able to read his account of the prison system. ‘He'd be honored,’ Martin said. ‘He would feel appreciated for what he had done.’","Robert Stroud gained infamy for his study of birds while in federal prison .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Reuters Reporter . A U.S. Marine facing a retrial in the 2006 death of an Iraqi civilian asked Thursday for new legal counsel, and said afterwards that he was eager to put his legal troubles behind him. Sergeant Lawrence Hutchins III did not enter a plea during a hearing at the Camp Pendleton Marine Base in California because he is seeking a new lawyer outside military ranks. A judge took the motion into consideration but ordered him to stand trial beginning on August 18. On his way out: United States Marine Sergeant Lawrence Hutchins III departs Thursday from his arraignment hearing with his wife Reyna Hutchins at Camp Pendelton . Mr Hutchins, 29, was arraigned on charges of murder, conspiracy, obstruction of justice, larceny and making false statements for his accused involvement in the murder of an unarmed Iraqi civilian. He said during the hearing that he does not believe that either the judge or his attorney could participate impartially in the trial because of their influence from military officials who have publicly spoken about his guilt, according to NBC San Diego. He told reporters gathered outside the courthouse after the hearing that 'they don't want to go against the Secretary of the Navy.' Mr Hutchins also said that he and his wife, Reyna, who is pregnant with the couple's third child, 'just want this to be over and behind us' after some eight years in court. 'I'm trying to raise my kids. I'm trying to be the best husband I can be and be the best father I can be,' he said. 'For the last eight years my life I have not been in control. Since 2006, I have not been in charge of my life' Looking for a change: Mr Hutchins asked for a new lawyer after arguing in court that his military-appointed counsel would not fully represent him since it is under the influence of the Secretary of the Navy . Mr Hutchins was the leader of a squad of Marines who planned a mission aimed at stopping militants' use of improvised explosive devices in the village of Hamdania, Iraq, in the early morning hours of April 26, 2006. Witnesses said Mr Hutchins and other Marines shot 52-year-old Hashim Ibrahim Awad, a father of 11 and grandfather of four, and placed an AK-47 and a shovel next to the corpse to suggest he had been planting a bomb. When they couldn't find the suspected bomber they had identified, witnesses claimed, they went to a nearby house and took a disabled former police officer who was not a suspect. The case touched off a furor in both the United States and Iraq. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus called the incident 'cold-blooded murder.' Public remarks: The Secretary of the navy spoke publicly abuot Mr Hutchins guilt, calling the incident 'cold-blooded murder' In 2007, a jury of Marines hearing the first court-martial at the Camp Pendleton base north of San Diego found Mr Hutchins guilty of unpremeditated murder and other crimes. He was sentenced to 15 years in a military prison. That sentence was later reduced to 11 years. A military court overturned his conviction in 2010 after finding that a statement he gave to U.S. Navy investigators while in custody should have been ruled inadmissible. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces re-instated his conviction the following year but overturned it again in 2013. Mr Hutchins is charged in the retrial with murder, conspiracy, making false statements, obstruction of justice and larceny. If convicted he faces a maximum sentence of the four years remaining in the 11-year sentence.","Lawrence Hutchins faces an August retrial on charges he killed an Iraqi civilian .

"By . Reuters Reporter . One of Miami Beach's most notorious pieces of real estate is back on the block: the asking price is almost $8.5 million. The sprawling, waterfront compound is where notorious Chicago gangster Al Capone died after being released from Alcatraz and is said to have plotted the St. Valentine's day massacre in 1929. The 10,000-square-foot baby blue mansion sits on exclusive Palm Island, sandwiched in Biscayne Bay between downtown Miami's skyscrapers and South Beach's hotel district. Opulent: One of Miami Beach's most notorious pieces of real estate - gangster Al Capone's former home - is on the market for almost $8.5 million . Prime location: The 10,000-square-foot mansion sits on exclusive Palm Island between downtown Miami's skyscrapers and South Beach's hotel district . Tough guy: Chicago mobster Al Capone's arrival in Florida created an uproar and he made a vast fortune importing and selling liquor during prohibition . The current owner, a Florida company managed by New York accountant Anthony Panebianco, purchased the home barely six months ago for $7.4 million, according to Miami-Dade property records. The mansion was built in 1922 by Clarence Busch, a member of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family. Capone, who made a vast fortune importing and selling liquor during prohibition, bought it in 1928 for $40,000 after being chased out of Chicago and later Los Angeles, according Ron Chepesiuk, a journalist and author of the book Gangsters of Miami. 'A lot of the booze he was marketing was coming through Miami and south Florida,' said Paul George, a leading Florida historian. High-profile organized crime figures were a mainstay of Miami's early days, in part because of its proximity to Havana, a popular gambling and watering hole for Americans during the prohibition era. A generation after Capone, Meyer . Lansky - known as the 'Mob Accountant' - owned a condominium on Miami . Beach and in the 1950s operated casinos in Cuba before the communist . revolution. Protected: Bodyguards were a constant presence at Capone's home and were stationed around the sprawling property . Guarded: Capone turned the property into a fortress, with heavy wooden doors, concrete walls and a gatehouse . Capone's arrival in Florida caused an uproar. Newspapers followed his every move. Then-Governor Doyle Carlton ordered sheriffs throughout the state to arrest him on sight. Capone attempted to charm the locals, promising not to break the law and giving sizeable donations to politicians. He also turned the property into a fortress, with heavy wooden doors, concrete walls and a gatehouse. Bodyguards were a constant presence both at the home and as Capone traveled through Miami, spending $1,000 at a time on clothing in newly burgeoning downtown Miami or gambling at Miami Beach casinos and dog tracks. The bodyguards' numbers doubled, according to Chepesiuk, after the Valentine's Day Massacre, when Capone's Chicago associates lured members of a rival gang into an ambush disguised as a liquor deal. Resting place: Notorious Chicago gangster Al Capone died at his Florida mansion after being released from Alcatraz . Party house: Capone used the sprawling Florida mansion to hold wild Prohibition-era parties . Bachelor pad: Capone was known for frequently bringing girlfriends to his Florida mansion for sleep-overs . Lavish: The mansion was built in 1922, and Capone bought it in 1928 for $40,000 . Seven men were lined up against a wall inside a garage and executed by men dressed in police uniforms and in suits. 'While the most spectacular gangland slaying in mob history was going down in Chicago, (Capone) was 1,300 miles away at a party at his Palm Island estate, providing him with a perfect alibi,' Chepesiuk wrote. After Capone died in 1947, the home remained in his family until sometime in the 1970s, when it was bought by Henry Morrison, a pilot for Delta Airlines, according to George. 'It was in a pretty ramshackle condition. He had girlfriends coming over, and it was a real bachelor pad,' he said. After falling into disrepair in the 1970s and 1980s, the house was restored and put back on the market for nearly $10 million in 2011. Despite being the site of Capone's death after he returned from Alcatraz as a mental patient, driven to insanity by syphilis, the house climbs in price each time it changes hands, said Albert Justo, of One Sotheby's International Realty, who is representing the owner. 'People love the fact that it's part of Miami history,' he said.

"By . Associated Press . and Reuters Reporter . Three million subscribers are set to be dropped from TV cable giant Comcast if its $45.2 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable gets the green light. The epic deal, which would combine the nation's top two cable TV companies, trumps a proposal from Charter Communications to buy Time Warner Cable for about $38 billion. If regulators approve the mega-merger, Comcast will sell off three million subscribers so that their combined customer base of 30 million represents just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. Some commentators say the planned divestment is to avoid public scrutiny, with fears the union of the country's most powerful cable firms would not be in the public interest, Los Angeles Times reported. Scroll down for video . Epic: The Comcast and Time Warner merger will create the U.S. largest . entertainment provider when the deal closes at the end of this year . At the moment, Comcast has 22 million pay TV customers . but plans to shed three million. Time Warner Cable . will contribute 11.2 million customers. The combined entity will end up with . about 30 million subscribers, as the two companies already have . strongholds in major markets like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. The companies said no decision has been made on which markets to sell. It expected to close by the end of the year, pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. The price amounts to $158.82 per share for Time Warner Cable and is about 17 percent above that stock's Wednesday closing price of $135.31. It tops a Charter Communications Inc. proposal to buy Time Warner Cable for about $132.50 per share. Charter had pursued Time Warner Cable for months, but Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus had consistently rejected what he called a lowball offer, saying he'd cut a deal for $160 per share in cash and stock. Share price rise: Shares in Time Warner Cable rose by 9 cents by 11am today on the news that it will be taken over by Comcast . For a time, Comcast, which also owns NBCUniversal, stayed in the background, waiting to purchase any chunk of subscribers that a combined Charter-Time Warner Cable would sell off. Charter had planned to finance its bid with $25 billion in new debt. As part of a plan to pay off the debt quickly, the company considered selling off some of its territories after a deal had closed. Time Warner Cable's Marcus had also balked at the huge debt burden the Charter takeover represented. Comcast Corp will buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion, in a deal expected to close by the end of the year. The Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination's total of roughly 30 million customers is believed to be a level that won't trigger the concern of antitrust authorities. Divesting subscribers could help the deal get approved more quickly. Comcast also is taking the position that because Comcast and Time Warner Cable don't serve overlapping markets, their combination won't reduce competition for consumers. Comcast operates in Chicago and mainly in northeast markets that also include Boston, Washington and its home base of Philadelphia. Time Warner Cable has strongholds around its headquarters in New York as well in Los Angeles, Dallas and Milwaukee. In many of those areas, the combined Comcast/Time Warner Cable will face competition from rivals AT&T and Verizon, which provide both pay TV services and Internet hookups. Both AT&T and Verizon are growing quickly. They ended 2013 with 5.5 million and 5.3 million pay TV subscribers, respectively. Time Warner Cable shareholders will receive 2.875 Comcast shares for every Time Warner Cable share they own. Once the deal is final, they will end up owning about 23 percent of the combined company. Comcast and Time Warner Cable are expected to save $1.5 billion in annual costs over three years, with half of that realized in the first year. Comcast also plans to add an additional $10 billion in share buybacks at the close of the deal, on top of a recent plan to boost its share buyback authority to $7.5 billion from $1 billion. Conceding that it had lost the takeover battle, Charter issued a statement Wednesday: 'Charter has always maintained that our greatest opportunity to create value for shareholders is by executing our current business plan, and that we will continue to be disciplined in this and any other (merger and acquisition) activity we pursue.' Even before the deal had been formally announced, it was being denounced. Public Knowledge, a Washington-based consumer rights group, said in a statement Wednesday that regulators must stop the deal, because it would give Comcast 'unprecedented gatekeeper power in several important markets'. 'An enlarged Comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard,' it said. Shares of Time Warner Cable jumped 7, or $9.46, to $144.77 on Thursday morning after the deal was announced, while broader trading indexes slipped less than 1 per cent. Comcast shares fell more than 3 per cent, or $1.74, to $53.50. Time Warner's subsidiary Warner Bros .

"By . Leon Watson . A former Hare Krishna devotee who spent ten years in a temple learning to be celibate is facing jail for committing a series of sex attacks. Sean Keen, 50, was a member of the International Society For Krishna Consciousness and forbidden from drinking alcohol or having sex. The worshipper spent a decade practicing the religion at a temple in Canterbury, Kent, and swore to remain celibate. Canterbury Crown Court heard Keen carried out a series of sex acts, gave a child a 'love bite' and raped a woman repeatedly . But a court heard Keen was actually a violent bully who would get drunk and force himself onto women. A jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard he carried out a series of sex acts involving dogs, gave a child a 'love bite' and raped a woman repeatedly. One of his victims claimed he had used her 'like his toy' and treated her 'as if she were a prostitute for his pleasure'. The jury also heard how he ripped off another victim's underwear and raped her - despite claiming he was 'a Hare Krishna devotee who was going to be celibate'. Christopher May, prosecuting, also said on one occasion Keen made a dog carry out a sex act. In another rape, the victim told police Keen grabbed her around the neck and pushed her against a toilet door. 'He was really angry and he had her by the throat,' Mr May said. 'She kept saying 'No'. 'She struggled with him and they ended up on the floor. He really scared her and said he could snap her neck like a twig.' His victim revealed that during a violent assault, 'He looked so evil... as if he was somebody else.' When Keen was quizzed by police, he admitted being an alcoholic and drinking five cans of strong lager every day. He told officers he wished he had 'followed his faith to a 'T'.' The Krishna religion - known officially as International Society For Krishna Consciousness - forbids sex unless it is to create children and bans drinking alcohol. He denied three sex attacks and four cruelty charges but was convicted by a jury on Friday. Now Judge Adele Williams has told Keen, from Canterbury, to expect a custodial sentence for his sexual assaults. She said: 'You have been convicted on clear and compelling evidence of grave offences. 'But before I determine what your sentence will be, I need a report. You need to know that you face nothing but a lengthy prison sentence.' The bully has now been remanded in custody while probation reports are prepared before his sentencing next month. Following the conviction a spokesperson for the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) said:  'The individual in question has no current affiliation, position or association with the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). He has not had any contact with the organisation for over ten years. 'His actions are abhorrent and criminal and we do not condone them in any way. They are not only a gross violation of our morals, values and code of conduct, but are morally reprehensible for any member of society. 'We have every confidence in the judicial system and believe his sentence should reflect the gravity of his crimes. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.'","Sean Keen, 50, was forbidden from drinking alcohol or having sex .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Boeing Co said on Friday that 'hairline cracks' had been discovered in the wings of about 40 Dreamliners that are in production, marking another setback for the company's newest jet. The cracks have not been found on planes that are in use by airlines and therefore posed no safety risk, Boeing said, adding the problem also will not alter Boeing's plans to deliver 110 787s this year. However, Boeing said the cracks, which also occurred on the larger 787-9 model currently undergoing flight tests, could delay by a few weeks the date when airlines can take delivery of their new planes. The disclosure raised questions about repair costs and a possible minor increase in the weight of the plane, but did not seem to spell major trouble for Boeing, industry experts said. Workers at South Carolina Boeing work on a 787 Dreamliner for Air India after the plant said that 'hairline cracks' had been discovered in the wings of 40,787 Dreamliner jets still in production . Wing-maker Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd notified Boeing in February of the problem, which arose after the Japanese company altered its manufacturing process. Boeing, based in Chicago, said it immediately notified customers of potential delays. It said none of the jets potentially affected by the problem have been delivered. 'We are confident that the condition does not exist in the in-service fleet,' Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said. U.S. regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether they planned to take action over Boeing's wing crack issue. Boeing shares fell 54 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $128.00 in after-hours trading. The cracks are the latest trouble for the Dreamliner, a high-tech jet largely made of carbon-fiber composite that has been beset with so-called 'teething issues' since entering service in 2011, three years behind schedule. Last year, lithium-ion batteries overheated on two Dreamliners, prompting regulators to ground the worldwide fleet for more than three months while Boeing redesigned the battery system. Another battery overheated this year. Airbus also has struggled with wing cracks on its A380 jet. 'If they can keep the delivery schedule going, it shouldn't be a major problem for customers,' said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. 'But there is an expense.' Boeing's much-delayed 787 Dreamliner has hit another production snafu after airline cracks were discovered in the wings of some 787's that are being built . He added that the manufacturing change was probably aimed at reducing the weight of the plane, as was the case with the A380. 'If they have to revisit that, it could add weight to the design, though only a modest amount,' he said. Boeing said the 787 cracks occurred in shear ties on wing ribs, and will take one to two weeks to inspect and fix. Wing ribs run parallel to the fuselage of the plane. The ties, made of aluminum, hold the rib to the skin of the wing and will be replaced with an aluminum part. 'If we find an affected area, we'll correct the issue by trimming out the area and applying a fabricated piece in its place,' Alder said. Boeing declined to discuss the manufacturing change that led to the problem. Mitsubishi wasn't immediately available to comment. Boeing expects to deliver 110 787s this year, and to earn revenue of between $87.5 billion and $90.5 billion. So far it has delivered nine, including one delivered on Friday. 'Deliveries continue as normal outside this potentially impacted 40,' Alder said. Boeing's disclosure comes as Airbus emerges from a painful two-year program of modifications and hundreds of millions of euros of financial charges triggered by the discovery of cracks on brackets attached to wing ribs on the A380. Reuters reported on Thursday that Airbus had once again ordered more frequent inspections of the wings of the world's largest passenger jet after discovering unexpected levels of metal fatigue, this time during testing on a factory mock-up. The planemaker has asked airlines to inspect the wing's 'spars' or main internal beams during regular major overhauls carried out after six years in service, and then again at 12 years, instead of waiting for the 12-year overhaul, industry sources said. An Airbus spokeswoman confirmed the discovery of unspecified 'fatigue findings' on a factory test plane. 'This will be addressed during routine maintenance inspections and the aircraft remains safe to fly,' she said. Most aircraft undergo a regular pattern of checks from small daily ones to heavy maintenance checks every five or six years. Aircraft industry experts have known for decades that metal fatigue cannot be eliminated, but they have worked out a system for monitoring it backed up by mandatory maintenance schedules.","Boeing has to inspect the wings of about 40 of its 787 Dreamliner jets .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Cut down: President Obama said he is cutting back on playing basketball as he is getting 'a little older and creakier' President Barack Obama has cut back on playing basketball because of the aches and pains of old age. Mr Obama told retired National Basketball Association star Charles Barkley he was limiting his basketball playing to about once a month because 'things happen.' In an interview that aired on Sunday, Mr Obama said: 'One is, you just get a little older and creakier. 'The second thing is, you've got to start thinking about elbows and you break your nose right before a State of the Union address. The 53-year-old was speaking about healthcare reform law in the interview, which broadcast on the TNT network before the NBA All-Star Game. Discussing the aging process, the president said: 'You wake up and something hurts and you don't know exactly what happened, right?' Mr Obama said he was enjoying watching his 12-year-old daughter, Sasha, play basketball. When Barkley commented that he struggled watching his own daughter play because he wanted her 'to be really, really good.' Mr Obama said: 'I think it's a difference if you're a Hall of Famer. You probably have a higher standard than somebody who was a good high school player.' Mr Obama is known as a big basketball fan - and recently honored Miami Heat players at the White House after a second straight NBA title in the past. Last month, Mr Obama described in detail how the Heat rallied from behind with less than a minute on the clock to win Game 6 before clinching in the seventh. The Obamas are well-known advocates of a healthy, active lifestyle - with the president regularly seen playing golf with a number of high profile guests, including Tiger Woods. In February last year, the President took a break to enjoy a 'boy's weekend' away from his wife and daughters to spend time with the golfing pro.

"By . Leon Watson . and David Mccormack . George Clooney's barrister fiancee has turned down an offer from the United Nations to become one of three experts called in to investigate alleged human rights violations and war crimes in Gaza. British-Lebanese lawyer Amal Alamuddin, 36, was named as part of an independent team observing alleged crimes by both sides during Israel's military offensive on Monday morning, but within hours she issued a statement saying she had turned the offer down, citing prior work commitments. ‘I am honored to have received the offer, . but given existing commitments - including eight ongoing cases - . unfortunately could not accept this role,’ said Alamuddin. ‘I wish my colleagues who will serve on the commission courage and strength in their endeavors.' Scroll down for video . British-Lebanese lawyer Amal Alamuddin, 36, has turned down a UN offer to be part of an independent team observing alleged crimes by both sides during Israel's military offensive . The United Nations touted Amal's supposed appointment on their website in a press release, which was still visible hours after she claimed to have turned it down . The barrister said she had only been contacted by the UN about the role on Monday morning and had had to decline because of ‘existing commitments.’ Alamuddin went on to say she was horrified by the situation in the occupied Gaza Strip, particularly the civilian casualties that have been caused. ‘I strongly believe that there should be an independent investigation and accountability for crimes that have been committed,’ she said. Hours after she denied ever accepting the role, a UN press release touting her involvement was still up online. The ongoing conflict in Gaza has prompted public statements from a number high profile actors including Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem. They were among a group who last week penned an open letter in a Spanish national newspaper calling for . Europe to condemn Israel's bombing of the Palestinian territory. The . letter described actions against Palestinians as ‘genocide’. The letter demanded a ceasefire by the military and urged Israel to lift the blockade in the Gaza Strip. Following the comments, the pair were accused of being anti-Semitic. Palestinians use a bulldozer to clear the rubble of al-Qassam mosque, hit by an Israeli air-strike . One movie producer who had previously worked with Cruz vowed not to hire her again, according to the Hollywood Reporter. George Clooney hasn't spoken out about the conflict. William Schabas, a Canadian professor of international law, was also announced on Monday as the head of the panel along with Doudou Diene, a veteran U.N. human rights expert from Senegal. The team will investigate 'all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law ... in the context of the military operations conducted since 13 June 2014,' the U.N. statement said. A month of war, marked by Israeli air strikes on Gaza and rockets fired by Hamas militants into Israel, has killed 1,938 Palestinians and 67 Israelis while devastating wide tracts of densely populated Gaza. The panel is due to report by March 2015 to the U.N. Human Rights Council. Israel has long accused the 47-member state forum of bias against it. Navi Pillay, the top U.N. human rights official, said on July 31 she believed Israel was deliberately defying international law in its military offensive in Gaza and that world powers should hold it accountable for possible war crimes. Smoke, dust and derbies rise after an Israeli strike in Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip . Israel has attacked homes, schools, hospitals, Gaza's only power plant and U.N. premises in apparent violation of the Geneva Conventions, said Pillay, a former U.N. war crimes judge. Hamas militants in Gaza have violated international humanitarian law by firing rockets indiscriminately into Israel, Pillay said. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed indirect talks mediated by Egypt on Monday on ending the war, Egypt's state news agency said, after a new 72-hour truce appeared to be holding. Hollywood star Clooney and Alamuddin have been engaged since April following a whirlwind romance when they met at a charity event in September. She supposedly refused to give her his number so he wooed her with an email which read: ‘The world’s hottest man should meet the hottest human rights lawyer’. The ongoing conflict in Gaza is proving to be a hot potato in Hollywood with some stars accused of being anti-Semitic for attacking Israel’s bombing of Gaza.","Amal Alamuddin, 36, has said she won't be joining a special team observing crisis on the Gaza Strip .

"By . Leon Watson . A Chinese man who chopped up his parents and kept their heads in a fridge has said it was their own fault for not treating him properly. Chau Hoi-leung, 30, had been raised by his loving parents who gave him everything, according to friends. But when his parents told him he should get a job and that they were reluctant to continue funding his lavish lifestyle, he severed ties with them and accused them of abandoning him. On trial: Chau Hoi-Leung killed his parents, chopped their bodies and cooked them with rice, a court in Hong Kong has heard . With the help of his 36-year-old friend Tse Chun-kei (pictured), Chau chopped up the bodies and cooked them with rice . Murder victims: Chau's parents, Chau Wing-ki, 65, and Siu Yuet-yee, 62, were chopped up and cooked with rice . Then, when Chau's parents, Chau Wing-ki, 65, and Siu Yuet-yee, 62, got an invitation to lunch at his flat in Hong Kong they thought he was prepared to put the matter behind him. But with the help of his 36-year-old friend Tse Chun-kei, Chau chopped up the bodies and cooked them with rice. The court where the pair are on trial for murder heard that they had prepared for the murder carefully over a three-month period. They bought sharpened knives and large refrigerators in which to store the cut up bodies, as well as getting microwaves and a rice cooker. Hardened detectives spoke of their shock when they turned up at the man's flat to look for clues after his parents were reported missing in March, and stumbled on the two heads that had been stored in the fridge. Chau tried to plead guilty through diminished responsibility caused by the stress of his parents' treatment .

Parts of a body that had not fitted into the freezer had been salted and packed into lunchboxes. But despite the carefully planned killing, Hong Kong's Court of First Instance heard that Chau claimed he was not to blame because he had been emotionally abandoned by his parents, and was therefore not in his right mind. He tried to plead guilty through diminished responsibility caused by the stress of his parents' treatment, but this was rejected by prosecutors who have demanded the pair be convicted of murder. He had also tried to cover up the deaths by reporting his parents missing and told police that the elderly pair had said they were going to mainland China to have some fun. Suspicious detectives however had decided to search his flat and not only found the bodies, but also found notes and receipts detailing the careful planning that went into the two murders. Michael Arthur, prosecuting, said: 'Their crime was greatly premeditated. Their planning was extensive.' The trial continues.","30-year-old Chau Hoi-leung's loving parents gave him everything .

"By . Leon Watson . Two young Britons jailed for trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.5million out of Peru could be back in the UK by the New Year. UK authorities have agreed to let Melissa Reid, 20, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 21, transfer to prisons in Scotland and Northern Ireland, near their families. They are waiting for the Peruvian government to rubber-stamp the move, a process expected to take between three and six months. Scroll down for video . Authorities have agreed to let Melissa Reid, 20, (right) and Michaella McCollum, 21, transfer to UK prisons . Michaella McCollum, 21 and from Dungannon, County Tyrone, is set to be transferred from her jail in Peru to a prison in her home country. Her lawyer has described Peruvian jails as 'horrendous' Melissa Reid, 20 and from Glasgow, is expected to be transferred to a prison in Scotland . The women, dubbed the Peru Two, were sentenced to six years and eight months in jail after they were found with a huge stash of cocaine in their suitcases as they tried to check in for a flight from Lima to Madrid a year ago. Reid, from Glasgow, and McCollum, from County Tyrone, claimed they had been kidnapped in Ibiza and forced to go on a drugs run to Peru by Colombian gangsters who threatened them and their families. But it emerged that they had willingly agreed to smuggle the drugs in return for cash after meeting the dealers on the Spanish party island. They can apply for parole halfway through their sentence, meaning they could be free by Christmas 2016. They are currently in Ancon 2, a tough desert prison a two-and-a-half- hour drive from Lima, where they share a cell with up to ten other women and the lavatory is a hole in the ground. A source in Lima said: ‘Britain has agreed to take Melissa and Michaella back. 'A prisoner repatriation agreement exists between Britain and Peru and Michaella and Melissa have paid compensation before making their transfer request, so the transfer should be approved.’ State prosecutors, a judge and two Peruvian ministries must confirm the transfer. ‘Both women have been model prisoners,’ an insider said. ‘They’ve worked or studied every day since they entered jail. Although they may have broken the law, they’ve shown they’re not really criminals.’ Behind bars: Melissa Reid of Scotland, right, and Michaella McCollum, of Ireland, pictured waiting for their sentencing hearing to begin in Callao, Peru, last year . A source close to the pair said: ‘They’re not as happy at Ancon as they were at the other prison because it’s a lot bigger but they’re coping as best they can. ‘They’ve been learning Spanish and working in areas like gardening, the prison kitchen and a hairdressing salon. 'They’ve resigned themselves to the fact they’re still facing many more nights in jail but their repatriation does represent a light at the end of the tunnel.’ The Irish government has been providing consular support to McCollum, an Irish citizen. A letter from the Republic's department of foreign affairs said: 'The Peruvian authorities have confirmed that they have accepted Michaella's prison transfer request and have passed this to the UK National Offenders' Management Service which co-ordinates prisoner transfers to the UK. 'In Ms McCollum's case, NOMS liaises with the Northern Ireland Prison Service and with the Peruvian Prison Service on all aspects of the transfer.' It could be months before she returns home as the logistics of the transfer will be complicated, the note to McCollum's solicitor stated. Prisoners must be accompanied throughout their journey; airlines and airports must be advised, with security arrangements put in place at departure, transit and final stops. Irish dancer Michaella McCollum Connolly (left),  and her friend Melissa Reid stand as they were being questioned by police at the Lima's international airport in Lima, Peru . A Northern Ireland Prison Service spokesman said: 'We don't normally comment on individual cases. All transfer requests are however dealt with as expeditiously as possible.' Reid's father, from Lenzie, near Glasgow, has said he has met Scotland's justice secretary Kenny MacAskill and is hopeful that his daughter will serve the rest of her sentence closer to home. Reid and McCollum were caught with the haul at Lima airport on August 6 last year. They were working on the Spanish party island of Ibiza when they claimed they were forced by Colombian drug lords who kidnapped them at gunpoint to board a flight with 24lb of cocaine in food packets hidden inside their luggage. McCollum and Reid faced the prospect of a maximum 15-year prison term but struck a behind-closed-doors plea bargain to secure a shorter sentence. They had previously been held at Lima's Virgen de Fatima prison but were moved to the notorious Ancon 2 prison, where horrific conditions reportedly mean McCollum is crammed into a cell with 30 other prisoners. The situation at the mixed prison, which is two-and-a-half hours from Lima, has previously been criticised by McCollum's lawyer as 'appalling'. Kevin Winters said sanitation and toilet facilities are extremely poor and all females have to use a hole in the ground which has to be covered up because of the presence of vermin.","Michaella McCollum and accomplice Melissa Reid were jailed last year .

"By . Leon Watson . Ed Balls has been spared a driving ban but fined £900 and given five points on his licence today for failing to stop after an accident. The Shadow Chancellor revealed in May he had been charged with driving away from a crash after he bumped his car in his constituency of Morley and Outwood, West Yorkshire. It was said he was trying to perform a 'seven point turn'. Today, a district judge said the incident was 'at the lower end of the scale of seriousness' and rejected the option of a total driving ban. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has been ordered to pay a £900 fine and has had five points put on his driving licence after admitting failing to stop after a minor road collision . District Judge Roy Anderson read a letter from Mr Balls's solicitors admitting the offences of failing to stop and failing to report an accident. He said Mr Balls's account was that he did not realise at the time that he had caused any damage to the parked Peugeot 308 as he moved out of the car park in his Ford Mondeo. The district judge ordered the shadow chancellor to pay a £900 fine plus a £90 Government surcharge and £85 prosecution costs. Mr Anderson said: 'Motorists who leave the scene of accidents without stopping to exchange particulars will, in serious cases, face a penalty which includes disqualification from driving. 'This, however, is a case very much at the lower end of the scale of seriousness. 'No injury was caused to any person and the damage to the car was, in reality, very slight. 'While Mr Balls was careless to a minor degree in colliding with the parked car, it's quite clear that if he had stopped at the time to exchange details, this matter would never have been the subject of criminal proceedings.' MP Ed Balls's car outside his home in Castleford that shows some damage on the rear . The car shows some damage on the rear, just above the bumper . Ed Balls attempted to perform a 'seven point turn' in this street, but crashed into another car . Earlier, Mr Anderson was told the offences carried a possible prison sentence. Smiling, the district judge said: 'I have been sent a bundle of paperwork and, having read it, that would be a most unlikely penalty.' In a blog post on his website, Mr Balls, who did not attend the hearing at Leeds Magistrates' Court today, said he bumped into another car when trying to turn his car round 'in a tight spot'. It happened as he was moving out of a car park next to the Labour Unity Club, in Morley. But instead of alerting the owner of the damaged black Peugeot 306, Mr Balls drove off. He said that he had no idea he had caused any damage. The offence of failing to stop after an accident can mean five to 10 penalty points, driving disqualification, a fine of up to £5,000 or, in the most serious cases, a jail sentence of up to six months. Pictures at the time showed Mr Balls' ageing Ford Mondeo estate clearly showing scratch marks on the bumper, but his spokesman insisted they were the result of police taking a paint sample from the vehicle. Mr Balls said he only found out that he had damaged the other motor when he was contacted by officers a week later. Mr Balls also claimed the police had no choice but to charge him and insisted he accepted it fully. That bump in April was the fourth time in recent years that Mr Balls has landed himself in trouble behind the wheel. In 2013, he received three points for driving through a red light on the Embankment near Westminster in London. The same year he was caught speeding in his constituency in West Yorkshire. He was clocked driving at 56mph in a 50mph zone. Mr Balls paid a fine and attended a speed awareness course rather than accept penalty points. And in 2010, the Labour heavyweight admitted 'stupidity' after being caught talking on his mobile phone while driving. As a cabinet minister at the time, he was fined £60 and given three points on his licence - although these points have now expired.","Shadow Chancellor was charged with failing to stop after an accident .

A conman has admitted pocketing £300,000 of donations meant for the Help for Heroes charity.

He admitted one charge of fraud by false representation and a charge of concealing criminal property, relating to the stolen donations. Judge Philip Wassall adjourned the case for pre-sentence reports but warned Copeland he faced a 'lengthy' custodial sentence. 'It is difficult to imagine a fraud with greater aggravating features,' the judge said. 'He will know that he faces a lengthy prison sentence. 'He had better sort his affairs in order in the meantime.' The fraud charge states that Copeland took the donations knowing that he did not intend to pass them on to Help for Heroes, contrary to Section 1 of the Fraud Act. Prosecuting, David Sapiecha, said Copeland will now face proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Representing Copeland, Rosaleen Collins said her client and his family had been subjected to attacks at their home since his arrest. 'When this matter was publicised before there were some serious threats to Mr Copeland and his family to such an extent that police had to fit an alarm in his property,' she said. Speaking outside court, a tearful Copeland apologised for his behaviour and said he would use his 'life’s work' to pay the money back. 'I tried to do something that was really good and I messed up,' he said. 'I am very sorry. I would really, really like to make amends. Among the supermarkets Christopher Copeland targeted during his 18 month con was Asda (file picture) 'I am really sorry and I will do anything I can.' Detective Chief Inspector Mike Robison, also speaking after the hearing, said the deception was uncovered when one of Copeland’s workers became suspicious. Mr Robison said Copeland had a number of vehicles, including a large personnel carrier and an ex-military Land Rover, in Help for Heroes livery. Officers have uncovered at least 15 occasions where Copeland’s collecting team operated at supermarkets such as Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s, around the country. The workers, who were paid expenses, would stay in Copeland’s vehicles or a nearby hotel and spend between three and four days a week collecting donations. 'We believed his motive was greed,' Mr Robison said. 'It is a rare occurrence and one that we have taken seriously along with Help for Heroes and the Crown Prosecution Service to arrive at a successful outcome. Prince William, pictured with Help for Heroes founder Bryn Parry as he officially opens Tedworth House in Tidworth, England. The charity was founded in 2007 and has raised more than £100m . 'It was a charity collector that raised the issues with us in the first place.' Jo Brookes, Help for Heroes’ Income Protection Officer, said: 'We’re appalled that Chris Copeland exploited the goodwill of so many people towards our wounded men and women in such a calculated, devious way. 'The money he stole never reached us, or the thousands of Heroes we support, because he used organised, criminal tactics to intercept it. 'Help for Heroes is grateful to our local fundraiser who first spotted what Copeland was doing, and to the police and the courts who have made sure he didn’t get away with it.'

"By . Leon Watson . A math teacher who raped her students has made a plea deal  that could get her a shorter time behind bars. Meredith Powell, 24, was arrested in February after a series of male students came forward accusing her of sending inappropriate texts and engaging in sexual activity. She then told police she had performed sex acts with multiple students, one as young as 15 years old, inside her locked classroom, as well as sending them sexualized pictures of herself. Plea deal: Meredith Powell, 24, was arrested in February after students came forward accusing her of sending inappropriate texts and engaging in sexual activity . Yesterday Lincoln High School teacher from Tacoma, Washington, admitted two counts of rape of a child in the third degree and one count of communication with a minor for immoral purposes. Tacoma Schools representatives said they were grateful she finally admitted to her wrongdoing that ultimately affected students and her colleagues. Tacoma Schools General Counsel Shannon McMinimee said: 'Ms Powell was well-liked by staff and students and they were devastated that she had violated the trust that they had placed with her.' Powell's attorney Wayne Fricke told King5.com his client has shown remorse over what happened. 'She was going through a difficult time in her personal life and obviously made a lot of bad choices, regrettable choices,' said Fricke. A fourth count of sexual misconduct of a minor was dismissed. Powell was ordered to be held without bail until sentencing scheduled on August 29. Tacoma Schools representatives said they were grateful she finally admitted to her wrongdoing that ultimately affected students and her colleagues . Powell allegedly told police the relationships began when she was intoxicated and sent a text to the students . Powell's attorney Wayne Fricke said his client has shown remorse over what happened . She could face up to five years in jail, but her attorney says that prosecutors will recommend six months of jail time with three years of treatment. Tacoma police initially began investigating Powell after learning that she wrote a letter to one of the boy’s girlfriends apologizing for 'promiscuous' and 'unprofessional' drunken text messages she exchanged with one of the boys. Powell was arrested and placed on unpaid leave. Scene: Meredith Powell was accused of engaging in sex acts with students in her classroom here at Lincoln High School in Washington . Police said Powell began a relationship with the three students - who are between the ages of 15 and sixteen - in January. Powell told police the relationships began when she was intoxicated and sent a text to the students, saying they were 'hot', following back-and-forth communication. Powell said she apologized to the students the next morning, and also sent a letter to one of the defendant’s girlfriends in an attempt to explain what happened. After interviewing the victims, who said they had sexual contact with Powell behind a lock door in her classroom, police again interviewed Powell. She then admitted to engaging in a sex act with one of the students and other sex acts with another at different times in late January. Powell also sent at least one of the victims a Snapchat photo of her in the bathtub. She told police she knew her actions were wrong, and that she would apologize to the student’s parents if she could. Powell was hired by the Tacoma Public School district in September 2012 and was described as an excellent teacher and family-oriented.","Meredith Powell, 24, was arrested in February after students came forward .

An unnamed European air safety official told CBS News: 'It did what it was designed to do - bring down airplanes.' This comes as Australian and Dutch officials sent to the crash site to recover victims' remains have been hit with fresh obstacles, after more fighting broke out in the area. Scroll down for video . Debris at the crash site of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in Ukraine's Donetsk region. Reports have emerged of fighting in the area . Unarmed police were due to be sent to the spot where Malaysian airliner came down in eastern Ukraine to help recover victims' remains. But it emerged that the rebel-held territory is still considered too dangerous. This comes as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced that more Australian Federal Police Officers were being deployed to the crash site as part of the Dutch-led humanitarian mission after Russian separatists agreed to allow access. So far there are 170 AFP officers in Ukraine with more on the way to join the 11 currently at the crash site. The 11 officers had been planning to accompany a 30-strong Dutch contingent to the crash site on Sunday guided by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). But the Netherlands' security and justice department says the situation is too unstable. There are reports of heavy shelling in rebel-held Grabove, the village next to the crash site . 'The team of 30 Dutch forensic experts currently has no safe passage to the crash site,' the department said in a statement. 'Because of fighting in the region the situation is still too unstable to safely go to the crash site to work.' The Dutch and Australians are remaining in the the rebel stronghold of Donetsk some 60km from the site. The mission will not be backed up by military personnel although the Australian Defence Force is providing some enabling support including medical and surgical teams. Alexander Hug, the deputy head of a monitoring team from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, also confirmed reports of fighting near the city of Donetsk. 'We heard indications there's fighting going on,' he said. 'The situation on the ground appears to be unsafe ... we therefore decided to deploy tomorrow morning,' he said, flanked by Dutch and Australian experts. 'Fighting in the area will most likely affect (the) crash site,' Hug said. Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko (left) visiting the National Guard training centre Novye Petrivtsy outside Kiev. The armaments will be shipped to the conflict zone in the country's south-eastern regions . It follows the deployment in Kiev of an team of EU security advisers to assist the Ukrainian government in imposing the rule of law in rebel districts. Speaking in Canberra on Sunday, Mr Abbott said, speaking of Australia's intentions: 'Our objective is to get in, get cracking and to get out.' The 11 Australian officers already at the site have largely been involved in observing and taking photographs. The latest deployment will involve recovering human remains and having them repatriated. The mission is to stay as long as possible to do a professional job but it should take no longer than two to three weeks, Mr Abbott said. 'We don't want to be there any longer than is absolutely necessary,' he said. The unarmed nature of the humanitarian mission to the site means it doesn't need the specific approval of the Ukrainian parliament. But Foreign Minister Julie Bishop hopes a deal can be ratified early this week that would allow Canberra to send a small contingent of armed police and soldiers to help with security. Ms Bishop stressed on Sunday the mission would be a non-threatening operation. 'All we want to do is secure the site so that we can inspect it thoroughly and bring back any remains,' she said. Yesterday the Kremlin accused the EU of aiding terrorists through its most recent extension of sanctions. Pro-Russia separatists have been blamed for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 with a surface-to-air missile on July 17, killing all 298 people aboard. They have also been accused of hampering the investigation into the disaster and the recovery of bodies and the property of victims from the site. Ukrainian servicemen ride on armoured personnel carriers (APC) in the village of Verhnyokamyanske, not far Artemovsk, in the Donetsk region . Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign policy chief, agreed last week to requests from the Ukrainian authorities for urgent help in bolstering the country's security services. An initial £2 million ($3.7 million AUD) is being provided by the EU to fund the unarmed advisers, but further money is expected to be committed as the conflict continues. Today the country's prime minister Tony Abbott said that by sending in unarmed police, Ukraine's parliament will not need to ratify the deployment as it would if the security force were to be armed. A Russian foreign ministry statement condemned sanctions imposed on Friday against 15 named people, including a former Russian prime minister, a former speaker of the Duma (parliament), senior intelligence officials, and leaders of the pro-Russia revolt in eastern Ukraine. It accused the EU of taking 'a complete turn away from joint work with Russia on international and regional security, including the fight against the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism [and] organised crime'. The statement went on: 'We are sure the decisions will be greeted enthusiastically by international terrorists. What it wasn't able to do over decades - drive a wedge into the international community - they've done with ease in Brussels. Russia called the latest US accusations of Moscow's involvement in the Ukrainian conflict a baseless 'smear campaign' 'At the same time, the European Union has once and for all joined the side of Washington and Kiev's fairytales regarding ongoing events in Ukraine, depriving itself of an alternative and objective source of information.

'When I realised what had happened I realised how lucky I was to be alive. If they can a few more centimetres to the side they would have taken my head off. 'But as it is, I simply got away with a grazed arm.' CCTV captured the moment the pillars fell off Zhang's lorry and he slammed on the breaks .

But when it came to a wandering hedgehog, Somerset's opening batsman was left completely stumped. Trescothick, 38, found himself having to call out rescue workers to cut through the entrance to his garden after a prickly intruder got stuck there. Scroll down for video . In a spin: Marcus Trescothick  and his family had a surprise visitor in their garden last week when a hedgehog got stuck in his garden gates . The opening batsman, who retired from internationals in 2008, tried in vain to free the wedged creature before experts from a local wildlife charity used an axle grinder to slice through his gates. The female hedgehog was given a clean bill of health before being released back into the cricketer’s garden in Taunton, Somerset. Trescothick praised the efforts of staff at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in nearby Highbridge, which is holding a hedgehog open weekend this Saturday and Sunday.

"By . Leon Watson . A former gang leader who spent 20 years in jail after allegedly being framed by police has told how he taught himself the law behind bars to win himself a new trial. Rodell Sanders, from Chicago, Illinois, spent up to 12 hours a day training himself before he was eventually able to write the court filings that led to his acquittal. The 49-year-old had been jailed for a brutal gang murder in 1994 - a crime he always denied. But after asking his family to raise $1,000 to buy legal books, he studied noon and night to get himself cleared. Emotional reunion: Rodell Sanders who was granted a new trial for a slaying he was convicted of nearly two decades ago gets a hug from his daughter Lynette Booth after being acquitted and set free . Following his release, Mr Sanders told the Chicago Tribune: 'I studied 10, 11 and 12 hours a day, seven days a week. 'I wouldn’t go on the yard... I told my family stop coming down on visits so much, and I just committed myself to the law. 'I didn't want to die in prison. I wanted to go back out there and make it to my children, make it to my family. So I wasn’t just fighting for me, I was fighting for my children.' Mr Sanders alleged he was framed by corrupt Chicago Heights police officers for the murder of gang member Phillip Atkins. Atkins was shot dead in December 1993 when four men forced him and his girlfriend, 19-year-old Stacy Armstrong, out of a car at gunpoint. They made him admit to being a member of the Mickey Cobras street gang before the leader ordered his killing. Rodell Sanders, right, who was granted a new trial for a slaying he was convicted of nearly two decades ago is joined by his attorneys Russell Ainsworth, left, and Steve Greenberg . A Cook County jury found the 49-year-old Sanders not guilty late on Tuesday night. Sanders was arrested in 1994 by Chicago Heights police and charged with murder. He spent 20 years in prison . Armstrong was also shot three times but survived. As the sole eyewitness, she told police the leader of the gang was thin and picked out a photo of Mr Sanders, a member of the rival Gangster Disciples street gang, from a line-up. Later at his trial, Armstrong identified Mr Sanders, who said he was playing cards with friends on the night of the slaying, as the man who had ordered the shootings and he was convicted. But lawyers for Mr Sanders allege that two Chicago Heights police detectives had cropped a photo of Sanders so his shoulders were cut out to make him look thinner. Further, Mr Sanders' attorneys claim that during the investigation authorities cut a deal with the man they believe committed the murder. Russell Ainsworth, who represented Mr Sanders, said the deal allowed him to plead guilty to armed robbery and serve five years in prison in exchange for his testimony against Sanders. Mr Ainsworth added: 'This case is the embodiment of a shoddy police investigation.' A judge eventually awarded Sanders a new trial based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Prosecutors appealed, but in 2011 an appeals court upheld the ruling. Last year his first retrial ended with a hung jury, with 11 voting to convict and one not. That one juror gave Mr Sanders a lifeline, and another re-trial was ordered. He was finally cleared by a Cook County jury on Tuesday night. In 2013, Sanders' attorneys filed a federal lawsuit again the officers and other members of the Chicago Heights police department as well as the town alleging they violated his civil rights. The case is pending. Sanders said that before his original trial prosecutors had informally offered him a plea deal that Ainsworth said called for him to be sentenced to about 23 years in prison, but he never considered taking it. He ultimately was sentenced to 80 years in prison after his conviction. 'I’m not going to plead guilty to a crime I did not commit,' he said Wednesday. 'If they’d allow me to walk out the same day I signed the paper, I wouldn’t of did it.'","Rodell Sanders, from Chicago, was convicted in 1994 of a 1993 murder .

She said he was 'family-orientated' and 'happy' and 'provided for all his family through hard work and did whatever needed to provide for them financially and emotionally'. Mrs Connor told how he had gained employment with First buses, which later went on to become Stagecoach, in 2005 and 'thoroughly enjoyed his job and was highly regarded by his employers'. She went on to describe how she spent the night before Mr Morley’s tragic death with him at their home watching television and last saw him at 6am the next day as she left for work. She said: 'Unfortunately later that evening the police attended to inform me that Darren had passed away and I later became aware that he had become trapped in the doors in Bryn. 'Darren will be missed by all who came to know him, especially me, his children, his family and his friends. 'He was a wonderful person. I’m devastated by his death and wonder how I will cope.'

"By . Leon Watson . Former mayor Brian Griffin  who swindled £13,000 in benefits by claiming he was so disabled he could barely walk . A town mayor who claimed he could barely walk to claim benefits was caught marching more than a mile on a Remembrance Day parade. Brian Griffin, 76, was caught on film conning taxpayers out of £13,000 when he was filmed by fraud surveillance teams. Griffin was undertaking his mayoral duties at the time on November 11, 2012. A court heard between June 3, 2009 and January 29, 2013 he received £13,448.95 in disability living allowance after claiming he could not walk more than 10 metres. But he was captured by undercover investigators marching to lay a wreath at a war memorial on Armistice Day while he was the mayor of Eastwood, in Nottinghamshire. A court heard that despite claiming he struggled to balance and was in danger of falling at any time Griffin had carried out over 130 duties in just one year as mayor. At Nottingham Magistrates’ Court the pensioner denied one count of failing to promptly notify the Department of Work and Pensions of a change of circumstances. He was found guilty yesterday after a two day trial. Adjourning sentencing to a later date chair of the bench Chris Thompson said: 'Having carefully considered all the evidence we find you guilty. 'When the claim was originally made in 2003 you said you were unable to walk a distance greater than 10 metres. 'This meant that you were given the highest level of disability allowance. 'In claim forms in 2010 and 2012 you did put that your condition varies, but we do not feel that you explained fully that your walking is better than it was in 2003. 'In those claim forms you were evasive in your answers, you continued to be evasive in interview and we felt again in your evidence today. 'We are going to ask for a report to be written on you, you will return here on August 21.' The court heard that despite saying he would regularly fall over Griffin maintained a season ticket at Nottingham Forest FC in the higher part of a stands upper tier and was an active member of the town’s bowls club. He was also spotted standing for two hours selling poppies, helping a friend fix a roof and working on his allotment. The court heard Griffin - who was injured in a fall in 1997 - first claimed DLA in 2003 after suffering from Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Scroll down for video . Town Mayor Brian Griffin is caught on video laying a wreath at the town memorial while claiming disability benefits . Brian Griffin, 76, was caught in the act conning taxpayers out of thousands of pounds when he was filmed by fraud surveillance teams undertaking his mayoral duties on November 11, 2012 . Griffin  received £13,448.95 in disability living allowance after claiming he could not walk more than 10 metres . But his condition improved over the years and he failed to inform the authorities in his change of circumstances. Prosecuting Frederick Powell told the court the DWP had first been alerted to Griffin’s improving condition by an anonymous tip from a member of the public. He said: 'The claim was this his walking was limited to ten metres, that he had problems with his balance and that he used crutches and a walking stick. 'The DWP received an internet complaint that Brian Griffin was more capable than he told, having been seen to walk long distances. 'He used his stick, but it was more for show than assistance. 'Further more it stated that he was the mayor of Eastwood and carried out his role with no problem, making numerous appearances at events. 'Surveillance was carried out between September and November 2012. 'During this period Brian Griffin was seen to walk long distances and to carry out tasks he had stated on the claim form he was unable to do. 'He was seen to attend Nottingham Forest Football Club, to work on an allotment, selling poppies in a local shop and taking part in the Remembrance Day parade. 'There he was seen to walk in excess of 1,800m. I will remind you his original form said 10m. 'He was using his walking stick, but he barely grounded it and he was also carrying a wreath and remained on foot the whole period. 'This is not a victimless crime, the DLA is there for people who need it, they are the victims, the people who need this money.' Griffin, who was mayor of Eastwood twice in 2010/11 and 2012/13, had denied the charge but JPs rejected this after they were shown nearly two hours of footage detailing Mr Griffin’s frequent exertions. He had claimed DWP investigators caught him 'on a good day' when he they filmed him at the Remembrance Day parade. Giving evidence he said: 'I was an active member of the community, my injury stopped that. It was a fall down some small steps and I thought I was OK. 'I try to walk because the doctors told me if I don’t I will lose my leg, but I suffer later for it. 'Remembrance was one of my good days, I made the effort to go and suffered for it later. I have been forced to miss it in the past.' He told the court that his season ticket at Nottingham Forest had been bought by his nephews to bring him out of a deep depression when his wife Joanne died of brain cancer seven years ago. Griffin claimed that rather than seeking assistance from fellow fans he pulled himself up the steep Brian Clough Stand steps using just his walking stick. Defending Jessica Vogel said Griffin, whose benefits were taken away from him when he was reassessed by a doctor last year, was already repaying what he owed. He was released on unconditional bail and will be sentenced on August 21. Speaking after the verdict DWP fraud manager Paul Baggaley said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system. 'Our welfare reforms are vital to close the gaps that cheats take advantage of. 'It is unfair that some people get support when they do not have a disability, while many people depend on the benefits system to provide a safety net. 'Deliberately not informing us of a change in your condition that may affect your claim is a crime. 'Don’t wait for our fraud investigators to find you. Tell us of a change now.'","Brian Griffin, 76, caught on film conning taxpayers out of £13,000 .

"By . Leon Watson . Paedophile Michael McAuliffe who was spotted by an off-duty police officer while on the run in London. He has had his sentencing adjourned . A convicted paedophile had his sentencing adjourned today after he claimed to have information on the child abuse allegedly being covered up in Westminster in the 1970s. A court heard Michael McAuliffe is also able to provide information about further child abuse and paedophile rings. James Bourne-Arton QC, defending McAuliffe, asked the court whether his client's case could be adjourned for police investigations into his claims to be made. Mr Bourne-Arton told Bradford Crown Court, West Yorkshire,  his client 'has information to the abuse covered up in the 1970s in Westminster'. 'He also said there was other evidence of child abuse and paedophile rings he was able to give information of,' he added. McAuliffe was in court to be sentenced for a string of child porn image charges after an off-duty copper spotted him in London - where he had tried to escape justice by changing his name. The 50-year-old, who changed his name to Ashley Peters, was registered with West Yorkshire Police and legally bound to notify the force of any change in address following child porn convictions. Detective Sergeant Linda Christie spotted McAuliffe handing out leaflets in the West End during an evening stroll. It led to his home being searched and the discovery of thousands of pornographic images and videos of children, some at the highest level of seriousness. Last month McAuliffe, of Haworth, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty by video link to 23 offences, including failing to comply with the sex offenders' register by changing his name and address last November. Also included were 17 further charges of making thousands of indecent photos and movies of children, and four of distributing indecent photos of children. Michael Smith, prosecuting, told the court their position 'is one of deep scepticism' regarding McAuliffe's recent claims. He said McAuliffe had earlier given evidence that he was looking at the indecent images to detect crime. McAuliffe's barrister said his client 'has information about the abuse covered up in the 1970s in Westminster' and called for the sentencing to be adjourned while he speaks to the police . Mr Smith added that the paedophile has always been 'deeply hostile towards the police' and has said 'the only good copper is a dead copper'. Mr Smith added that the police say it is highly unlikely they would make a deal with the defendant, but they would be willing to speak with him, either before or after his sentencing. Judge Peter Benson spoke briefly to the defendant to inform him of the new date for his sentencing and told him he would remain in custody. McAuliffe then said, 'Can I just say the names I've got...' before Judge Benson cut him off and sent him down to the cells. He will be sentenced in six weeks' time at Bradford Crown Court.","Michael McAuliffe claims he can provide information on child abuse .

"By . Leon Watson . Residents of a tiny Lancashire village fear their community is being wiped off the map because Royal Mail doesn't believe it exists. Loveclough in the Pennines is renowned as a beauty spot where visitors and tourists can go trout fishing and bird watching. But the people who live there have to use the name of a neighbouring village a mile away as their address because Loveclough is not recognised by Royal Mail. Now locals are campaigning to get their home formally recognised with its own mailing address to end 20 years in the postcode wilderness. The 950 inhabitants of the village of Loveclough in Lancashire  are raising a petition to demand official recognition from Royal Mail . Residents fear Loveclough is losing its identity with many visitors unsure whether it is one word or two . Since 1993 letters and parcels destined for Loveclough have been routinely addressed to the larger neighbouring village of Crawshawbooth a mile down the road and the smaller village’s name has vanished from signposts. Although local postal workers have always made sure mail arrives at the correct addresses, villagers fear Loveclough is losing its identity - with many visitors even unsure whether it is one word or two. Now the 950 inhabitants of the village which has two social clubs and a pub called The Glory are raising a petition to demand official recognition from the newly-privatised organisation. Chairman of the Lime Valley Resident’s Association, Derrick Bartlett-Smith, 62, said: 'Loveclough is a beautiful area with so much to offer. 'It is really important to us to preserve it and to do that it needs its name back. My children have all grown up here and many of them still live here and they love it. 'The way we look at it is that we are here to guard the past to protect the future. We have lost far too much of our identity at the moment. To quote Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner, ""we are a name, not a number"".' The villages of Loveclough and Crawshawbooth are a mile away from each other but Royal Mail doesn't recognise Loveclough as an actual place and post is always addressed to Crawshawbooth . Chairman of the Lime Valley Resident’s Association, Derrick Bartlett-Smith, 62, with the petition. He claims that the area which covers three wards all of which  had their separate identity in the past . Villagers fear Loveclough is losing its identity - with many visitors unsure whether it is one word or two . The sign for the neighbouring village of Crawshawbooth, which residents see upon leaving Loveclough . The village is etched with a rich history and vast natural delights and once part of the Rossendale forest. Loveclough is also reputedly home to a Quaker burial site. Also a hotspot for wildlife, Loveclough has 178 footpaths in the area with many hikers passing through. The Calico Printer’s Association founded in 1899 was based in the village and represented 46 textile companies and 13 textile merchants. Mystery surrounds the ‘disappearance’ of the village on all mail and locals initially tolerated the postcode problem until at this year’s local elections when one noted his voting registration form incorrectly stated he lived in Crawshawbooth and urged the LVRA to act. Now the petition will be doing the rounds at their summer Fete in August with the hope of getting enough support to provide reason for the Royal Mail to change the name. Mr Bartlett-Smith added: 'I am not sure how the village lost its name but it started about 20 years ago with the Royal Mail. 'Somehow we lost our name and were included in Crawshawbooth. I just think we got lost on the system and people started to realise their addresses had changed. 'Then some years later the street signs that said ""Loveclough"" were replaced and for some reason the word was not on them. 'No one knew we were here - yet obviously all of us from here did - and now it is about time we took on the plight and put things right. 'I have lived here for more than 20 years and my wife was born and bred here. Apparently it is not the Electoral Commission that does the addresses but the Royal Mail.' 'The Royal Mail said if we get enough signatures and there are no major objections they would change it. The village has two social clubs and a pub called The Glory but it doesn't have its own postcode . 'The petition was only launched this week and we have 47 signatures at this point but we are expecting more to come forward.' 'Loveclough has so much of its own history. It is the old pack horse route that people used to travel through. We also have one of the oldest buildings which used to be the Calico Printer’s Association, which is a very old association. 'It was built in 1761 originally as a manor house. It is now a social club. The villagers of Loveclough are such sociable people. 'You can go into that pub on any given day and there will be a person there who lives in one of the back to back houses in Loveclough sitting, drinking with a millionaire.' 'People may think we are being pedantic but we need to protect village life. I suppose it is the same as saying ""are you British or are you English?"" We want to know who we are and where we have come from and be proud of our area.' 'We are so lucky to be so close to everything. We have one of the main bus routes into Manchester called the ""Witchy Way"".' 'Loveclough is just near enough the city but also remote, quiet and beautiful. Everyone now these days is moving from place to place. 'From people emigrating and immigrating, to movement within this country. At the same time it is important to know exactly where you have come from.' 'We have nothing against Crawshawbooth - we work very well together as neighbours. But we are both Lancashire villages that have our own identity and we need our name back to celebrate that.' A spokesman for the Royal Mail said: 'If we receive a request to change the name of a locality, it will be investigated by our Major Address Change team to make sure there are no operational objections to the proposal. 'We will then require letters of support from the customer representatives, identified in our code practice. Once this has been received, we will then be able to arrange to carry out a consultation of all residents, to run for three weeks. 'Provided there are no more than 20 per cent of those we consult who object to the proposal, we can then amend the addresses on our postal address file.'","The village of Loveclough in Lancashire is renowned as a beauty spot .

The blaze has caused an estimated £100,000 worth of damage . Four of the six vehicles on site, dating from 1968 and 1979, were worth around £20,000 each . The structure’s fibre-glass roof melted and dripped onto the iconic cars underneath, igniting them and destroying the interiors. In some instances the heat was so intense it melted some sections of the cars’ aluminium bodywork.

He said: 'The scene was horrendous and it was quite a shock. Usually when we get a call from the alarm company there is a spider in one of the sensors or something similar. 'Each vehicle is unique. We strip them down and build from the ground up and, sadly, I think four or five of them are beyond repair. 'There was a one-vehicle gap between the parked Land Rovers and our main building which would definitely have gone up if we’d have had one there, so we’ve been very lucky from that point of view. 'A lot of us have been here a long time. We are like a family company so there is a sombre mood and a sense of shock. Luckily we are a strong business, so we will survive.'

"By . Leon Watson . Thousands of panicked pro-Russians are flooding highways and packed trains and heading out of eastern Ukraine as the crisis gripping the nation deepens. The refugees from rebel strongholds in the Donetsk region claim they are fearing attacks by government forces who have so far lost 30 soldiers to defiant militants. It follows an airstrike in eastern Ukraine yesterday that sent an apartment building crumpling to the ground, killing at least 11 people. Scroll down for video . Refugees: A pro-Russian militant kisses members of his family who leave for Russia in Donetsk . People wave goodbye aboard a bus as they leave for Russia. It came as Kiev raised fears of an imminent invasion by thousands of Russian troops . The civilian death toll from the fighting between government forces and pro-Russian insurgents has been steadily mounting in recent weeks. Rebels pinned the attack on the Ukrainian air force. The government swiftly denied blame but was not immediately able to offer an alternative explanation. The bombing in the rebel-held town of Snizhne demonstrated how airstrikes and heavy rocket fire are becoming increasingly common as the conflict drags into its fourth month. The attack came one day after a Ukrainian military transport plane was shot down in disputed circumstances. The devastation in Snizhne bore signs of a strike by several missiles and left only a mountain of smoking debris. The four-story apartment block appeared to have been hit in two separate spots, causing the collapse of several tiers. A nearby house was also destroyed.

'I heard an explosion, and suddenly I was thrown out of the apartment, out of the fourth floor,' said Chernetsov, his head swathed in a bandage. 'I woke up covered in dust and had no idea what had happened.' Health officials in the Donetsk region, which includes Snizhne, provided the number of dead. Rescue workers pulled a small child with broken legs alive from the rubble as grieving residents sifted for belongings. Dmitry Tymchuk, a military analyst who coordinates closely with Ukraine's Defense Ministry, said that since rebels are unlikely to have any planes capable of conducting the bombing, there could only be one explanation. Refugees from rebel strongholds in the Donetsk region claim they are fearing attacks by government forces who have so far lost 30 soldiers to defiant militants . 'Only Russian aviation could have performed the airstrike on Snizhne,' he wrote on his Facebook account. The Defense Ministry stopped short of that claim but insisted the bombing could not have been carried out by the air force as none of its planes were on sorties at the time of the strike. Security Council spokesman Andrei Lysenko called the incident a 'cynical and bloody provocation' aimed at discrediting the armed forces.

At least 11 people were killed early in the blast in the Russian border town of Snizhne when their apartment block crumbled after being hit by a missile. The rebels blamed the attack on Ukraine's air force - a claim denied by Ukrainian sources . Sergei, a rebel commander at the scene who declined to give his surname, said locals bore witness to Ukrainian involvement. 'Many local citizens saw the plane that dropped the bomb - it had Ukrainian markings,' he said. 'Why Ukraine would bomb its own territory is harder for me to say.' No reliable official recent death toll has been produced, but hundreds of civilians are believed to have been killed so far in the conflict.

European Union leaders will work to block loans for new projects in Russia by two multilateral lenders and broaden the scope of other sanctions in response to Moscow's actions in Ukraine, according to a draft statement. The EU leaders, who meet in Brussels later on Wednesday, will step up sanctions because pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine have not met their demands to end the violence there, the draft statement said. The 28-nation EU has been under strong pressure from the United States and Ukraine to take a hard line against Russia. The EU leaders will ask the bloc's bank, the European Investment Bank (EIB), to suspend financing of new public sector projects in Russia, the draft statement said. EU countries will work together within the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to suspend EBRD financing of new projects in Russia, it said. EU diplomats say taking action at the EBRD will be complicated as Russia is one of 64 countries that are shareholders of the bank. Russia has traditionally been the biggest recipient of the London-based EBRD's funds - the bank lent 1.8 billion euros ($2.44 billion) there last year. The EIB pledged to lend more than 1 billion euros to Russia last year. The EU will broaden the scope of asset freezes to target companies and other organisations 'that are supporting materially or financially actions undermining or threatening Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence,' according to the draft statement. Representatives for the separatist Luhansk People's Republic said that 12 more civilians were killed Monday evening in the eastern city of Luhansk following rocket attacks and airstrikes. It was not immediately possible to verify those claims. On Monday, Ukraine said one of its military transport planes carrying eight people was shot down by a missile fired from Russian territory. Security Service chief Valentyn Nalyvaichenko said he had 'unconditional evidence' that Russia was involved in downing the craft, Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported Tuesday. Rebels said they shot the plane down. Defense Ministry representatives initially suggested all those on the plane had survived and been accounted for. The ministry updated its account to specify that while four on the plane were evacuated, another two were taken captive by rebels and that the whereabouts of two more are unknown. On Tuesday, the Moscow-based LifeNews online television channel broadcast the questioning by rebels of a man identified as a pilot from the downed Antonov-26. LifeNews quoted a rebel militiaman Alexander Gureyev as saying the pilot was allowed to call his family. 'Most likely, we will exchange him for one of our militias in captivity. Nobody intended or intends to shoot him. Let his relatives not worry,' Gureyev was quoted as saying. In the last two weeks, the government has halved the territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists, who have been forced back into the cities of Luhansk and Donetsk. Many in the armed insurgency are known to be Russian nationals, but Moscow says they are simply citizens who went to fight in Ukraine on their own. Russia has denied it is helping to fuel the unrest in Ukraine and has in turn accused Kiev-commanded forces of shelling a border town inside Russia, killing one person. Ukraine denies firing shells onto foreign soil. A delegation of international military attaches and reporters visited the site of the shelling Tuesday in Donetsk in what a senior Russian Defense Ministry official termed an 'act of good will.' Officials showed a residential building damaged by rocket fire and a series of craters next to a border crossing.","Refugees claim they are fearing attacks by government forces .

"By . Leon Watson . and Daniel Bates . Pope Francis has met privately with a Sudanese mother in Rome who was put on death row for refusing to become a Muslim, blessing both her and the baby she had while in prison. The Vatican said Pope Francis had 'a very affectionate' meeting with Meriam Ibrahim, 27, her husband and their two small children. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said: 'The Pope thanked Meriam and her family for their courageous witness and constancy of faith. For her part, Meriam expressed gratitude to the Pope for the great support and comfort she received from his prayers and from so many others believers of good will.' He blessed Ms Ibrahim as she held her baby daughter Maya in her arms whom she gave birth to in prison two months ago. Scroll down for video .

Ms Ibrahim, and her family touched down at Rome's Ciampino airport at around 9.30am on a plane provided by the Italian government. She was greeted at the airport by Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, his wife Agnese and Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini. The mother-of-two was accompanied on the flight by Italy’s Deputy Foreign Minister Lapo Pistelli, who met with Meriam on July 3 and has been following the case closely.

He told journalists he had been in 'constant dialogue' with Sudan but did not give any more details on Rome's role in securing her exit. Mr Pistelli published a photograph on his Facebook page of himself with Ms Ibrahim and her two children on the plane with the caption: 'A couple of minutes away from Rome. Mission accomplished.' He also told reporters at the airport that the family was in good health and would stay in Italy for a few days before departing for the U.S. The minister, who carried one of Ibrahim's young children off the plane, said he expected her to have 'some important meetings' during her time in Italy. Meriam's stay in Italy was organised by the Italian government in collaboration with the Sudanese government . Support network: Meriam poses hours after her release in June with her husband, Daniel (left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya and all those who bravely fought for her freedom . Fight for love: Daniel Wani, an American citizen, has been fighting for his wife and children's release from Sudan . Ms Ibrahim's stay in Italy was organised by the Italian government in collaboration with the Sudanese government. Speaking to the MailOnline, Mr Wani's brother Gabriel said: ‘It’s . beautiful news. All the hard work has paid off. I want to thank everyone . who helped to free her. ‘It’s just wonderful. I don’t . have to worry any more. It’s over.' Lutz Oette, counsel for UK-based campaign group Redress, which fought for Dr Ibrahim’s release, said: ‘We very much welcome the news. But it’s an indictment of Sudan’s criminal law that Meriam Ibrahim had to face prosecution for being who she is. ‘She, and others like her, have been forced to leave the country for being different, dealing a further blow to Sudan’s traditions of tolerance and diversity . It is now time for Sudan to see to it that Meriam and her family receive justice for all their suffering’. Among those who have tirelessly campaigned for Meriam’s freedom have been Hardwired, a US based religious freedom campaign group. Its founder Tina Ramirez said: ‘Despite the many obstacles put in this family's path, we can now celebrate their freedom.’ Hardwired also spoke to Meriam's lawyer in Sudan, El Shareef Ali, who praised the Italian government for playing a key role in getting her freed. ‘The Italians had the greatest influence on Sudan and were able to secure her release,' he said. Hardwired added that charges against Meriam are still open in Sudan and it is unclear what will happen to the cases. Her original death sentence for apostasy is now with the Supreme Court in Khartoum. She also faces additional charges for falsifying documents and a new case filed by her family which seeks to annul her marriage. El Shareef said: ‘We will continue to challenge the case at the Supreme Court and seek a decision that recognises the apostasy law as inconsistent with international law and the Sudanese Constitution so no one else is harmed by these kind of charges.’ Miss Ramirez said that during Meriam’s time in prison the British embassy coordinated meetings with her lawyers. Other countries also helped including the Canadian Embassy which donated an air conditioning unit. The case drew worldwide attention in May when she was sentenced to death over charges of apostasy. A daughter of a Muslim father, Ms Ibrahim was raised by her Christian mother. 2011: Meriam Ibrahim marries Daniel Wani after they meet when the American visits Khartoum. August 2013: A  relative  alleges that her marriage to Wani, a Christian, constitutes adultery. Wani is accused of converting a Muslim, leading Ibrahim to also be accused of adultery. February 17, 2014: Meriam is transferred prison with her 20-month-old son Martin and separated from her husband. March 4: Court charges Meriam with apostasy and adultery . April 30: Meriam is convicted of all charges and is given 15 days to recant her beliefs. May 11: She is sentenced to 100 lashes and death by hanging. May 27: Meriam gives birth to a baby girl, Maya, in prison. According to her husband, Ibrahim's legs were kept in chains while she was in labour. June 8: A Sudanese appeals court has started deliberating on Meriam's case. June 12: Demonstrators  gather outside the White House to demand Meriam be freed. June 23: Meriam is released from prison. June 24: Less than 24 hours later, Meriam and her husband were arrested at a Sudanese airport as they sought to leave the country with their two children. July 24: After intense negotiations, Italy’s Deputy Foreign Minister Lapo Pistelli secures the family's release and flies to Rome with them. She married her husband, who holds American citizenship and is also a citizen of South Sudan, in a church ceremony in 2011. As in many Muslim nations, Muslim women in Sudan are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, though Muslim men can marry outside their faith. By law, children must follow their father's religion. Sudan's penal code forbids Muslims from converting to other religions, a crime punishable by death. The court in the capital, Khartoum, had also ordered Ms Ibrahim be given 100 lashes for having sexual relations with her husband. When she asserted that she was in fact Christian she was then accused of apostasy. Following the conviction Meriam was then forced to give birth to her daughter Maya in prison. Although she was freed, she was initially prevented from leaving the country. Since June 26 she has been staying at the American embassy in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, according to Corriere della Sera. Meriam's case attracted international attention and the governments of the UK, the US and the United Nations all called for her to be freed. Bill and Hillary Clinton were also among those demanding she be released after MailOnline highlighted her plight, as was human rights campaigner Mia Farrow. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, who mentioned Ibrahim during his speech inaugurating Italy’s six-month presidency of the Council of the European Union, has also expressed his outrage. 'If there is no European reaction we are not worthy of calling ourselves Europe,' Mr Renzi said. Meriam's arrival in the Italian capital follows a European Parliament resolution condemning her 'degrading and inhumane treatment' and calling for legal reforms in Sudan. Olivia Warham, director of campaign group Waging Peace, said: 'As we celebrate Meriam Ibrahim's long-overdue freedom we should also remember the millions of her fellow Sudanese Christians who daily face brutality and ethnic cleansing by the Sudanese regime. 'Three years ago President Bashir made it plain there would be no room for non-Muslims in his Islamist Sudan. 'He has been good to his word, crushing dissent and systematically killing ethnic and religious minorities. 'Regular aerial bombardment by the Sudanese armed forces destroys communities and Christian hospitals, forcing people to flee from their fields to hide in the Nuba mountains. 'It is shocking that Bashir's ideology of elimination provokes nothing more than the occasional words of regret from the international community, when we should be applying targeted smart sanctions on the architects of these atrocities.'","Vatican said Pope  had 'a very affectionate' meeting with Meriam Ibrahim, 27 .

"By . Leon Watson . A former police officer accused of being a serial rapist is paraded before a baying crowd of several thousand onlookers. This is the latest show trial in China, where the mass public courts associated with its hardline regimes of the past have been reinstated. Ai Kung, 30, was the suspect who was duly convicted as China's Communist Party sought to show its determination to crack down on crime. The outdoor court, in Hengshan county in western China's Shaanxi province, was fitted with loudspeakers so the audience could hear the evidence against him. Thousands of onlookers turned up to watch the public trial of serial rapist Ai Kung in China's Shaanxi province . Open justice: These pictures show the thousands who gathered to see Ai Kung, 30, convicted . Police officers carry the serial rapist Ai Kung to the public trial in Hengshan county in western China . China's Communist Party is using mass public trials to show determination to crack down on crime . The case was a high profile one in the region in which a series of rapes were carried out against young women by somebody who seemed to plan each attack professionally. Local media reported that police suspected it was a former soldier, but in the end DNA testing and images from CCTV cameras finally allowed police to identify Kung as the man behind the attacks. A highly decorated former police officer, Kung had only recently left the force and taken up work as a security guard in a school. His former colleagues who recognised him at first refused to act saying that they could not believe he was really to blame but images of one of the attacks and the DNA evidence proved a clear-cut case, the court heard. Prosecutor Chung Liao said that the former officer was a classic Jekyll and Hyde character - by day seeming to be an upholder of the law and at night a sexual predator of the worst sort. His victims, nine young women aged between 18 and 32, had always been attacked after dark and after being dragged to a remote location they were beaten and sexually assaulted before being robbed and then dumped back on the street. The serial rapist Ai Kung was recorded by CCTV cameras in evidence shown to the crowd who attended his trial . The moment serial rapist Ai Kung was arrested (left) and the suspect in custody (right) A procession at the start of the mass public trial in Hengshan county, western China . Public trials used to be a common event in China especially during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and 1970s, when large groups of people would gather to denounce and punish those accused of betraying the ideals of the Communist Party and taking the 'capitalist road'. Such events continued to be held in the 1980s and 1990s as the government battled rising crime fuelled by the country’s dramatic economic reforms but then they gradually fell into disfavour and were mostly phased out. They came back in recently as the country wanted to once again show it was getting tough on terrorist violence mainly linked to militants within the mostly Muslim Uyghur community in the remote north-western region of Xinjiang. And the feedback has been so positive that it seems the mass public trials of now once again the order of the day, with the practice spreading from terrorists through to more regular criminals including the recent trial against the alleged rapist Ai Kung.","Trials designed to show determination to crack down on crime .

Ann Hunnewell claimed she and her ex-husband, George Hunnewell, joined the KKK in 2008 at the request of then-Police Chief Mark Isom. She said they were trying to find out if another officer was a KKK member. After investigating,  she and her ex-husband  later left the group. Scroll down for video . George Hunnewell, left, was dismissed  from the Fruitland Park Police and Deputy Chief David Borst, right, resigned amid allegations that they're both members of a local branch of the Ku Klux Klan in Florida . Ann Hunnewell was a secretary for the police department before leaving in 2010. Her statements were contained in a Florida Department of Law Enforcement report tying officer Hunnewell and Deputy Chief David Borst to the KKK. Borst, a veteran officer with more than 20 years of law enforcement service, resigned and Hunnewell was fired last week. A phone number listed for Borst was disconnected. Hunnewell's number was not listed. The information about the former officers was given to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement by the FBI. Parts of the Florida report were redacted and it's not clear what the FBI was investigating when it discovered the officers link to the KKK. An FBI spokesman in Jacksonville hasn't responded to a voicemail. Undercover? George Hunnewell's former wife said they joined the KKK in 2008 at the request of then-Police Chief Mark Isom . It isn't a criminal offense to be in the Ku Klux Klan, but local police chief Terry Isaacs said he had to consider how the allegations might affect the officers' credibility and the perception of the department in the community (stock photo) Ann Hunnewell told investigators that she and her former husband never paid dues, attended meetings or witnessed any criminal activity. She also said there was no documentation of their undercover operation. Fruitland Park Police Chief Terry Isaacs wasn't in his office yesterday and City Manager Gary La Venia wouldn't comment. La Venia said the police chief would issue a statement on Wednesday. Previously, Isaacs has said the document was given to him to consider how the allegations might affect the officers' credibility and the perception of the department in the community. The FBI has assured the police chief that there are no other officers involved. Fruitland Park has 13 full-time and five part-time cops, and many were trained by Borst. In 2009, Fruitland Park Police Officer James Elkins resigned after pictures surfaced of him in uniform with a pointy Klan hood and robe. The police department has 13 officers for the city has about 5,000 residents. It is located about 40 miles north-west of Orlando. Fruitland Park was once known for its citrus groves and is in Lake County, where KKK violence in the 1940s and 1950s was rampant. The State Attorney's Office told city officials that pending cases from the officers will be reviewed, although Borst's job was primarily administrative and didn't involve much patrolling, La Venia said.

"By . Leon Watson . A waitress in a Chinese restaurant stunned diners  by picking up a dead cockroach and eating it in front of them. Jin Kuo, 39, got into a heated row with businessman Zhang Yen, 43,  when he complained about finding the insect in a plate of salad. Jin said it was 'perfectly normal' to find an cockroach in a restaurant and then, to prove her point, she swallowed it. The bizarre incident happened atthe Jinsha Era Plaza hotel restaurant in Chengdu, the capital of central China's Sichuan province. Scroll down for video . Chinese waitress Jin Kuo ate a cockroach that was found by a customer in his salad . One of the people who was with Zhang as a guest  grabbed his mobile phone and started to video the incident. The waitress was heard saying: 'No matter which restaurant you go to, you will always find cockroaches in the food. It is very normal.' Enraged at her attitude, Zhang told her that if it was so normal, she should eat it to solve the problem, and then there would not need to any need to argue. But to his amazement, that was exactly what the waitress did, picking the cockroach off the side of the plate and putting it into her mouth before swallowing it. Jin  grabbed it and ate it to prove that it was perfectly harmless, leaving businessman Zhang Yen, 43, stunned . The waitress was heard saying: 'No matter which restaurant you go to, you will always find cockroaches in the food. It is very normal' The restaurant owner has apologised for the incident and said the waitress had been punished . Shocked Zhang was left speechless by what she had done, and had nothing more to say. Instead he opened up his wallet, paid the bill, and left, still shaking his head in amazement. The restaurant owner meanwhile has apologised over the incident and said that the cockroach had probably crawled into the dish from outside while cooking. She added that the waitress had been punished for not accepting the fault, and had been told she was going to get a pay cut for the foreseeable future to teach her lesson. Commentators however who viewed the video on social media sites said the waitress should have been given a pay rise. It is not the first time a staff member has tried to defuse a hygiene row by eating the evidence. In May, a restaurant manager ate a condom after customers found it in their fish dish. He had rejected their claim it was a condom and insisted it was a ring of calamari and ate it to prove the point.","Jin Kuo, 39, ate the insect to prove a point to a customer .

The presenter said she finally had a good night's sleep on Thursday but was given sleeping medicine because she was 'too excited'. When asked how she came up with the name Vale, Savannah said: 'Today viewers had me convinced that we were having a boy, so when it was a girl, it was a shock. 'We had a few names on the girl list but we had not settled on it. Vale had always been on our list of names we had liked.

"By . Leon Watson . Tony Blair's involvement in the Middle East peace process came under scrutiny today as a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza collapsed, while the first Israeli death in a week of fighting has been confirmed. A civilian in his 30s was killed today when he was struck by a mortar from the Gaza Strip while delivering food to soliders at the Erez Crossing. Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in strikes in Gaza since Israel launched the campaign over a week ago to stop rocket fire at its citizens. Gaza militants have fired more than 1,100 rockets toward Israel in the fighting but mostly thanks to its ""Iron Dome"" defense system, no Israelis were killed until today. Scroll down for video .

Rosenfeld said at least 15 Israelis, including several children, have . been injured by the Palestinian rocket fire since the fighting began. The . speedy resumption of violence, less than a day after Egypt presented . its ceasefire plan, illustrated that it will be harder this time than in . the past to negotiate an end to Israel-Hamas fighting. A . key difference to a previous truce in 2012 is that Hamas does not trust . the current rulers of Egypt who deposed a Hamas-friendly government in . Cairo a year ago. Israel had . agreed to the Egyptian plan, proposed late Monday. Under it, a 12-hour . period of de-escalation was to begin at mid-morning Tuesday. Once both . sides agree to halt hostilities, they would negotiate the terms of a . longer-term truce. Gaza . militants responded by firing dozens of rockets after the proposed . start of the de-escalation, some of them reaching deep into Israel, . though not causing injuries. Israel, which had warned it would strike . Gaza harder than before if Hamas did not halt hostilities, held its fire . for several hours, but resumed air strikes by mid-afternoon Tuesday.

Earlier My Blair had praised the 'leadership of Egypt' in calling for a ceasefire. He . said: 'Such a ceasefire can halt the tragic loss of life, stop the . rockets on Israel - and open up the possibility of a genuine change in . Gaza.' The . renewed rocket attacks on Israel came after the Palestinian militant . group swiftly rejected a proposals for a truce agreed by Egypt and . Israel and warned its attacks will 'increase in ferocity and intensity'. Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior official with the Palestinian militant group, spoke moments after Israel accepted the offer. He said: 'This proposal is not acceptable.' Smoke billows from a building hit by an Israeli air strike in the town of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip .

'Our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in ferocity and intensity,' it said. The Egyptian plan had called for hostilities to end this morning, followed by negotiations on easing the border blockade of Gaza.

But the Israeli government warned that Israel would strike Gaza even harder if Hamas does not accept the truce. A spokesman said: 'If Hamas rejects the Egyptian proposal, if Hamas continues to shoot rockets at Israeli cities, we are prepared to continue our military operation and intensify it as needed to protect our people. The territory has been under a blockade by Egypt and Israel since Hamas seized Gaza in 2007. The Israeli Cabinet accepted the proposal for a ceasefire to end a week of conflict with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip that has killed 185 Palestinians and exposed millions of Israelis to Hamas rocket fire.

The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Cabinet met this morning and accepted the proposal, which went into effect at 9am local time. It called for a ceasefire to begin within 12 hours of 'unconditional acceptance' by the sides, followed by the opening of Gaza's border crossings and talks in Cairo within two days. Egypt's state news agency said that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had met with Mr Blair, envoy for the so-called Quartet of United Nations, European Union, Russia and United States, in efforts to secure a truce. An Israeli government official said Mr Blair had met with Mr Netanyahu on Friday. Today, he met with Israel's President Shimon Peres at the President's residence in Jerusalem. Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians are fleeing northern parts of Gaza after Israel warned it was targeting the area. The UN says so far 17,000 people have sought refuge in its facilities.

Two American TV series filming in Israel have been temporarily derailed by the conflict. FX's Tyrant, set in a fictional Middle Eastern country but filmed in Tel Aviv, said it has had to fly its cast and crew to Istanbul on Monday morning. The show is filming the last two episodes of its first season, which began airing late last month. And the mini-series Dig, which filmed the first of six episodes in Jerusalem, is extending a planned break for two more weeks to wait out the conflict, but might relocate to the U.S. if needed. The series, starring Jason Isaacs and Anne Heche, is scheduled to premiere this fall. 'We're looking at all options, and hopefully everything will calm down and we can go back to what we planned,' says Gideon Raff, an Israeli producer who co-created both series. Israel launched the offensive last Tuesday, saying it was responding to weeks of rocket fire out of the Hamas-ruled territory. The surge in hostilities over the past week was prompted by the murder last month of three Jewish seminary students in the occupied West Bank and the revenge killing on July 2 of a Palestinian youth in Jerusalem. Israel said on Monday three Jews in police custody had confessed to killing the Palestinian. Hamas leaders have said a ceasefire must include an end to Israel's blockade of Gaza and a recommitment to a truce reached in an eight-day war there in 2012. Hamas also wants Egypt to ease restrictions at its Rafah crossing with Gaza imposed after the military toppled Islamist president Mohamed Mursi last July. But the Egyptian proposal made no mention of Rafah or when restrictions might be eased. It said only that 'crossings shall be opened and the movement of persons and goods through (them) shall be facilitated once the security situation becomes stable on the ground'. Hamas has faced a cash crisis and Gaza's economic hardship has deepened as a result of Egypt's destruction of cross-border smuggling tunnels. Cairo accuses Hamas of aiding anti-government Islamist militants in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, an allegation the Palestinian group denies. Hamas has said it wants the release of hundreds of its activists arrested in the West Bank while Israel searched for the three missing teens. The detainees include more than 50 Hamas men freed from Israeli jails in a 2011 prisoner exchange. The proposed truce made no mention of the detainees in stipulating that 'other issues, including security issues, shall be discussed with the sides.'","Middle East envoy Tony Blair played a role in ceasefire negotiations, but Hamas are said not to trust the former UK Prime Minister .

"By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . Shawna Lynn Palmer, 22, has been charged with defrauding an insurance company after . An aspiring beauty queen is facing fraud charges after she claimed she was unable to work her grocery-store job because of a fractured toe - before being spotted in high heels at a pageant. Shawna Lynn Palmer, 22, has been charged with defrauding an insurance company after she told her employer, Stater Bros grocery store in Riverside, California, that she was unable to work because of a painful foot injury. She went to the doctor in March and was told to keep weight off the injury and given a pair of crutches. However a few days later she was posing in her bikini- and a pair of towering stilettos - at a Long Beach beauty pageant. Palmer then went back to the doctor for a second visit where she claimed, according to the California Department of Insurance, that she could not put any weight on her foot or wear shoes. The 22-year-old was told to take several weeks off work - which she used to compete in yet more beauty pageants. On July 3, she posted a  picture of herself on Facebook winning third place at a Harley Davidson bikini contest, wearing a black bikini and a pair of black stilettos. Under the grinning snap, she thanked her family, friends and boyfriend for their support. Palmer is facing three felony counts of defrauding an insurance company and was released on $5,000 bail. Palmer (pictured fourth from left) at a California beauty pageant in July, boasted on social media that she won third place in this competition, all the while claiming compensation from her workplace for a foot injury . She faces a year in jail and up to three years on probation if found guilty. She will also have to pay back the $24,000. Byron Tucker, who works with the state's deputy insurance commissioner, told KTLA: 'People might want to say here's a young lady who had beauty and bravado in making these claims, but it really didn't add up on the brains side of it.' Mr Tucker said it was easy to build a case against her because of her widespread social networking. The 22-year-old (pictured here in a pageant days after she obtained a sick note for work) is facing a year in prison and repaying the $24,000 she owes .","Shawna Lynn Palmer, 22, has been charged with defrauding an insurance company after she received $24,000 for her injury .

A convicted sex offender has been charged in the strangulation murders of his cousin and her foster daughter after investigators said he was caught taking pornographic photos of the ten-year-old. Brian Farmer, 58, is being held on $2.5 million bail and charged with murder and child endangerment, police said on Thursday. Farmer was in 62-year-old Joan Colbert's apartment in Long Branch, New Jersey when he was allegedly caught photographing ten-year-old Veronica Roach on July 30. Brian Farmer, 58, has been charged with the murder of ten-year-old Veronica Roach (right) who he had forced to perform sexual acts for pornographic images, police said today .

"By . David Mccormack for MailOnline . Airport officials in Massachusetts are calling for e-cigarettes to be added to the list of hazardous materials banned from being carried onto airplanes after a smoldering bag had to be removed from a flight. Baggage handlers at Boston's Logan International Airport pulled the bag off a JetBlue flight on Saturday and put it out with a hand-held extinguisher after first evacuating all passengers. Fire marshals believe that a rechargeable lithium-ion battery in an e-cigarette inside the bag was to blame. Airport officials in Massachusetts are calling for e-cigarettes to be added to the list of hazardous materials banned from being carried onto airplanes after a smoldering bag had to be removed from a flight . A fire marshal spokesperson told the New York Times that 'if a battery had been in the e-cigarette, it had the potential to cause a fire.' Ed Freni, director of aviation at the Massachusetts Port Authority, said he believes that lithium-ion batteries pose a hazard to flyers. ‘The more you see these type of items sold out there, the more our industry has to take a closer look at them, as we’ve done with other hazardous materials,’ he said. The list of banned items, controlled by the Transportation Department’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, currently includes matches, flares and most batteries that are ‘spillable.’ Baggage handlers at Boston's Logan International Airport, pictured, pulled the bag off a JetBlue flight on Saturday and put it out with a hand-held extinguisher after first evacuating all passengers . Officials from the airport have already met with local Federal Aviation Administration inspectors to ask for an investigation into the incident. Passengers on the plane - an Embraer 190 - were taken off via the regular passenger door, before all the bags were removed and checked. The delayed flight eventually flew to Buffalo. Concerns about lithium-ion batteries to date have focused on the possibility that one would suffer an internal flaw that would cause it to heat up, and the heat would set off nearby batteries in a runaway reaction. A commercial shipment of 1,000 e-cigarettes was blamed for a fire on a FedEx MD-11 at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport in August 2009. In January 2013, a lithium-ion battery on a Japan Airlines plane ignited while the aircraft, a Boeing 787, was parked at a gate at Logan. E-cigarettes have been blamed for countless house fires, often while the battery is being recharged.","Airport officials in Massachusetts are calling for e-cigarettes to be added to the list of hazardous materials .

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . British airlines could be barred from flying across Siberia on routes between Europe and Asia, it was revealed today. Russia is considering imposing the curbs on air companies from countries which have targeted Moscow with sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. The 'tit-for-tat' move could hit British and other EU airlines hard, adding costs and time to routes to the Far East. Russia is considering imposing cubs on air companies from countries which have targeted Moscow with sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. The BA Boeing 747 in the picture was grounded in Siberia after a previous emergency during a flight from London-Beijing . A senior government official told Vedomosti newspaper today that a ban or limit on flights across Siberia was on the agenda in the wake of the most recent EU sanctions which in particular targeted an Aeroflot offshoot airline called Dobrolet. Talks have been held by the Foreign and Transport Ministry in Moscow over curbs on Western airlines which have dozens of flights daily using Siberian airspace between Europe and Asia. 'Any unfriendly measures taken by the EU, including that concerning air transportation, will be considered and not left without the response,' said a diplomatic source. 'To fly to Asia European airlines presently use the shortest Trans-Siberian route and pay for it to Russian Aeroflot. According to the source close to the company, Aeroflot receives less than $300 million annually from foreign airlines,' reported state-owned RIA Novosti news agency. Dobrolet, launched its first commercial flights from the Russian capital to Crimea's main city Simferopol in June. In July, the air company started selling tickets for flights to cities across Russia, including Volgograd, Perm, Samara, Ufa, Yekaterinburg and Kazan - but it was included on an EU sanctions blacklist unveiled on 30 July, added the news agency. In the wake of the EU sanctions, budget airline Dobrolet was forced to suspend flights for holidaymakers. Western airlines BA, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa are among those that regularly use the skies over the east of Russia, stated The Siberian Times today. Restrictions on using Russian airspace could hit Western airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, hard with dozens of flights daily using Siberian airspace between Europe and Asia . 'Their costs could spiral if they needed to find alternative routes avoiding Russian air space,' said the website. The move comes as a former Ukraine defence minister warned about a rise in Russian troop numbers on the border with Ukraine. 'There are 33,000 members of the Russian Armed Forces and 160 tanks close the borders of Ukraine,' said Mykhailo Koval, now deputy secretary of Ukraine's the National Security and Defence Council. 'Especially powerful groups are on the territory of Crimea - 23,000 servicemen. No less powerful forces are on the direction from Chernigov to Taganrog. ' He alleged: 'All the measures that are currently under way in the areas adjacent to the east of our country.' It was 'a clear demonstration of the preparation of the armed forces of the Russian Federation to engage in active hostilities'. Ukraine said its forces are closing on the major city of Donetsk - currently held by rebels - and urged separatist fighters to allow civilians to flee the besieged city.","'Tit-for-tat' move could hit British and other EU airlines hard causing delays .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Will Stewart In Moscow . A public inquiry is to be held into the death of poisoned ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko. With tensions running high with Moscow over the downing of a Malaysian Airlines flight over Ukraine, the UK government has given the go-ahead to a probe into whether the Russian state was behind Mr Litvinenko’s murder. The former KGB officer died in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210 with two ex-colleagues at a London hotel. His widow Marina said the move sent a powerful 'message to his murderers', but one Russian MP claimed it was driven entirely by 'political expediency'. Scroll down for video . Ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko died in 2006 in London's University College Hospital after being poisoneD . Just last year Home Secretary Theresa May ruled out a public inquiry in part because she wanted to protect ‘international relations’. She insisted in July 2013 that an inquest led by a coroner was ‘more readily explainable to some of our foreign partners’. Twelve months on, and following a legal defeat, the government has said an inquiry will start by July 31. Relations between Britain and Russia are now in the deep freeze, with David Cameron threatening ‘hard-hitting economic sanctions against Russia’ over the shooting down of flight MH17, killing all 298 people on board. The Prime Minister insists the evidence is pointing in ‘one direction’ – that the plane was hit by an SA-11 missile since smuggled back across the border into Russia. EU foreign ministers will today meet to discuss tougher sanctions against Russia for fuelling the conflict in eastern Ukraine. In a written statement to Parliament, Mrs May said she had now agreed to establish an inquiry and has written to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling asking him to halt the inquest. Coroner Sir Robert Owen, who had warned a public inquiry was needed because he could not consider vital secret evidence as part of a normal inquest, is to lead the inquiry. Mrs May added: 'I am very grateful to Sir Robert for continuing to lead the independent judicial investigation into Mr Litvinenko’s death. 'It is more than seven years since Mr Litvinenko’s death, and I very much hope that this inquiry will be of some comfort to his widow Mrs Litvinenko.' The decision to press ahead with a public inquiry into Mr Litvinenko’s death will further pile pressure on Moscow. Under the Inquiries Act, Sir Robert will have the power to demand the production of witnesses and papers within UK jurisdiction, including agents and documents from the security and intelligence services. However, he has no such powers in relation to evidence from Russia. Mr Cameron's official spokesman insisted there was 'no link whatsoever' between the announcement of the inquiry and current tensions with Russia over its activities in Ukraine. Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina said the public inquiry sent a powerful 'message to his murderers' But Russian MP Andrey Lugovoy today accused Britain of a blatant political act in launching a public inquiry into the death. Mr Lugovoy - wanted by Scotland Yard to face murder charges over the former FSB officer's death - accused Home Secretary Theresa May of 'cynicism, lies, treachery, baseness. 'This is the only way I can comment on the actions of the British establishment and the decision to hold a public inquiry into Litvinenko's death.' The move was entirely one of 'political expediency', he claimed. Marina Litvinenko, the widow of Alexander Llitvinenko, won a court battle forcing Home Secretary Theresa May to reconsider her opposition to a public inquiry . 'Now due to the situation in the south-east of Ukraine, the West increases pressure on Russia, and personally on the head of state, Vladimir Putin.' Lugovoy has always denied playing any role in Litvinenko's death. Putin has ruled out extraditing Lugovoy to face charges in Britain, citing a Russian constitutional ban. Lugovoy - also a former secret services officer - recently called for the Russian intelligence agency to revert to its former name, the KGB. UK government officials have been in contact with the Russian Embassy in London before today's announcement. Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square in 2006. His family believes he was working for MI6 at the time and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin. Former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun have been identified as the prime suspects, but both deny any involvement and remain in Russia. Since his death his widow Marina and son Anatoly have battled to discover the truth about what led to his killing. Today Mrs Litvinenko said she is 'relieved and delighted' that a public inquiry is to be held into the death of her husband, known as Sasha to his loved ones. Mrs Litvinenko said: 'It sends a message to Sasha's murderers: no matter how strong and powerful you are, truth will win out in the end and you will be held accountable for your crimes. 'It has taken nearly eight years to bring those culpable for Sasha's murder to justice. I look forward to the day when the truth behind my husband's murder is revealed for the whole world to see.' Mrs Litvinenko’s lawyers argued a public inquiry needed to establish whether Mr Litvinenko was the victim of a crime committed 'for private criminal purposes' or whether it was a 'state-sponsored assassination carried out on the territory of the UK on the orders of the Russian government'.","Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London hotel in 2006 .

"By . Alan Roden, In Edinburgh . and Will Stewart In Moscow . The international row over Alex Salmond’s praise for Vladimir Putin intensified last night as the Kremlin backed the SNP leader and Ukrainian families in Scotland spoke of their ‘hurt, disgust and betrayal’. In Moscow, the Russian president's powerful press secretary Dmitry Peskov told the Mail that he ‘agrees with the viewpoint of the Scottish First Minister’. Mr Peskov – seen as the Alastair Campbell of the Kremlin – spoke out as Russian newspapers poured praise on the SNP leader, threating to further damage Scotland’s international reputation. Vladimir Putin's top spin doctor has backed Alex Salmond's praise for the Russian President which has sparked a global row . In Scotland, Ukrainians demanded an ‘unequivocal public apology’ from the First Minister. Michael Ostapko, Scottish chairman of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain, has written to Mr Salmond to condemn his ‘crass words’. In the Commons today, Labour MP Shelia Gilmore said Ukrainians had expressed Salmond 'disgust and astonishment' at remarks supporting a regime 'which oppresses its own minority groups and silences its critics'. Prime Minister David Cameron said he 'wholeheartedly' agreed with her, adding: 'I think what Alex Salmond said was a major error of judgement. 'I think all of us in this House should be supporting the Ukrainian desire to be a sovereign, independent country and to have the respect of the international community and party leaders for that ambition.' The First Minister yesterday failed to apologise and claimed he was referring to the recent Sochi Winter Olympic Games when he said he admires Putin for restoring ‘a substantial part of Russian pride’. The row was triggered by an interview with former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell for the latest edition of GQ magazine, which took place on March 14. Just days earlier, 80,000 Russian troops had amassed on Ukraine’s borders and the Crimea region of the country was annexed on March 18. In the interview, Mr Campbell asked about the Russian president, to which Mr Salmond replied: ‘Well, obviously, I don’t approve of a range of Russian actions, but I think Putin’s more effective than the press he gets I would have thought, and you can see why he carries support in Russia.’ Pressed on whether he admires Putin, . the First Minister added: ‘Certain aspects. He’s restored a substantial . part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing.’ Yesterday, Mr Ostapko said he has been ‘overwhelmed’ by the reaction of Ukrainians to Mr Salmond’s comments. ‘They . are variously insulted, dismayed and upset that a high-profile . politician aspiring to some favoured position in the history of these . freedom loving isles should make poorly considered, erroneous and . mistaken assessments and to express admiration of a dictatorial and . criminal regime,’ he said. First Minister Alex Salmond has been heavily criticised by Ukrainian families living in Scotland . ‘Even worse are the lame excuses given by his spokespersons over dates and events having already taken place in Crimea. The facts are that occupation of the Crimean parliament took place at the end of February followed by the unconstitutional illegal ‘referendum’ on March 16, organised by a government which had been taken over at gunpoint by a party that gained only 4 per cent of the vote in the 2012 election, and supported by Russian soldiers and gangs of men equipped and armed by Russia.’ He added: ‘Mr Salmond’s words can only give succour to the perpetrator of such undemocratic action. Mr Salmond has to think before he speaks and he owes us a sincere apology.’ In his letter to the First Minister, Mr Ostapko wrote: ‘The overwhelming comments are of hurt, disgust, betrayal and astonishment that any importantly placed person should have allowed themselves to apparently succumb to vanity and thoughtlessness, particularly to the sensitivities of Ukrainians worldwide, let alone those living in Scotland.’ But in Russia, there was apparent delight yesterday that a Western politician had given qualified support to Putin. A writer for the Sobesednik newspaper, Nikita Smagin, said: ‘Isn't it nice when you are admired? ‘And when you are admired by heroes on the other side of the barricade, it's a double pleasure. The First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond has such feelings for the Russian President Vladimir Putin. And the love of the Celt is really worth it.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague and leading politicians from all main parties have condemned Mr Salmond’s remarks. Writing in today’s Scottish Daily Mail, Labour MP Gemma Doyle – who visited Ukraine with a cross-party Westminster delegation earlier this month – said: ‘His words are not fitting of the First Minister of Scotland, and I know that many people in Scotland would agree with many of those whom I met in Ukraine, that Putin is not a man to be admired. And it is clear, that when it comes to this, neither is Mr Salmond.’ Armed pro-Russian militians attack the regional police building of the eastern Ukraine city of Luhansk on Tuesday . Kerry pledged yesterday that NATO partners - including those that border Ukraine or Russia - would be defended to the hilt if their sovereignty is threatened . But the First Minister said yesterday: ‘Often Putin has been displayed as a figure of fun – somebody who wrestles with bears. ‘Actually, I think that’s a severe under-estimation of Putin and therefore to portray him in that light is wrong. ‘In terms of what I said about Russian pride, and what I was thinking of, was the Sochi Games.’ A spokesman for Mr Salmond added: ‘The First Minister will reply directly to [Mr Ostapko’s] letter making clear, as he did in the GQ interview, that he disapproves ‘of a range of Russian actions’. The Scottish Government is entirely opposed to the Russian Government’s stance on human rights, homosexuality and indeed the illegal annexation of Crimea. ‘Since this interview was conducted the Scottish Government has made our position abundantly clear on the illegal annexation, including the decision to withdraw the invitation to the Russian Consul General to the annual Scottish Consular Corps dinner.’","Salmond said Putin has restored 'a substantial part of Russian pride'

Debris from the plane was strewn across a field after it crashed when it was shot down by rebels . A CCTV camera in Luhansk, Ukraine, has captured the moment a government plane carrying 49 soldiers was shot down, killing everyone on board . A rebel leader in city said the plane was shot down after the 'occupying' Ukrainian troops refused to leave . According to a government spokesman, all of the passengers were from the armed forces, with nine crew members and 40 soldiers killed in the attack . The attacks happened hours before energy talks were due to take place between Russia and Ukraine, which fears its gas supplies will be cut off from tomorrow morning, tipping the country into economic chaos. And in Kiev, a potentially devastating bomb was left near the presidential administration offices of new leader Petro Poroshenko. A man fled from the scene without detonating the device. Bomb disposal experts found a note on the bomb which read: ‘Unless you stop the war, the war will come to you. Mr Poroshenko yesterday vowed revenge on separatists for the Ilyushin attack as he declared a day of mourning today. ‘Those involved in this cynical act of terror on such a scale will certainly be punished. Ukraine needs peace. But the terrorists will receive an appropriate response,’ he said. Vladyslav Seleznyov, a Kiev defence ministry official, last night expressed sympathy to the families of those killed on the transport plane. Before Saturday's incident, at least 270 people were thought to have died in clashes between government forces and armed separatists . ‘The terrorists cynically and treacherously fired with a large-calibre machine gun hitting an Ilyushin-76 of the Ukrainian air force which was carrying troops on rotation and was about to land at Lugansk airport,’ he said. Militants in Lugansk, who have claimed independence from Ukraine, said the aircraft was downed by a surface-to-air missile. The city is in the east of Ukraine, just 15 miles from the Russian border, and is the most prone to a Crimean-style occupation or annexation by Moscow. Last week, there were reports of unmarked tanks and rocket launchers supplied to the rebels by Russia. The claims were given credence by the US. ‘We are highly concerned by new Russian efforts to support the separatists,’ said deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf. ‘We are confident these tanks came from Russia.’ The US says a convoy of three T-64 tanks, several BM-21 or Grad multiple rocket launchers and military vehicles had ‘crossed into Ukraine’. Nato yesterday released images showing Russian tank movements close to the Ukrainian border which ‘raise significant questions’ over President Putin’s intentions. The crash killed almost four times the number that died on May 29 when the rebels shot down a helicopter . Luhansk is in the east of Ukraine, near to the border with Russia. Tensions are high in the region after pro-Russia militias seized cities, before holding referendums declaring themselves part of Russia . As Kiev continues to try to retake areas under the control of pro-Russian groups, they said more than 300 Russian ‘mercenaries’ had been killed in fighting in the eastern Donetsk region, with bodies piled up in villages, and Moscow seeking to evacuate its dead. Military analyst Dmytro Tymchuk said: ‘These are Russian mercenaries, killed during the anti-terrorism operation. In Saur-Mohyla and Dmytrivka there are about 250 killed terrorists and 300 wounded.’ The latest developments are bound to increase pressure on Western leaders to impose new sanctions on Russia. Council of Europe Secretary General Thorbjorn Jagland said Mr Poroshenko could ‘count on our support’. The Il-76 is a Russian-built military plane used by Ukraine to transport soldiers and equipment (file pic) Foreign Secretary William Hague last night condemned the downing of the plane and urged Mr Putin to stop arming the rebels. ‘This tragic incident again underlines the urgency of Russia taking further measures to prevent the escalation of violence in eastern Ukraine by stopping support and the supply of arms for separatist groups. ‘The international community stands ready to impose further sanctions if Russia continues to provoke instability in Ukraine.’ There was almost nothing left of the plane following a huge blaze after it crashed into fields outside Luhansk .","Pro-Russian militants have shot down an Ukrainian aircraft in Luhansk .

"By . Alan Roden, In Edinburgh . and Will Stewart In Moscow . Alex Salmond has been accused of a 'gross error of judgment', with his praise for Vladimir Putin yesterday condemned by Ukraine's leaders, Foreign Secretary William Hague and human rights campaigners. The First Minister is under intense pressure to apologise to the people of Ukraine after revealing that he admires Putin for restoring 'a substantial part of Russian pride'. In Kiev, Serhiy Sobolev, head of the Fatherland party, said he hopes that Mr Salmond 'never experiences what it is like to have death squadrons walking on his land'. Mr Hague told the Commons that people throughout the UK would be 'horrified' by the remarks, while other critics included former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell and Mr Salmond's proindependence Green allies. Russian President Vladmir Putin (left) was praised by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond for returning Russia's pride . The Scottish Daily Mail has also learned that Ukraine's ambassador to the UK was briefed on the situation last night. But in a major humiliation for the SNP leader that could harm Scotland's reputation on the world stage, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine have gleefully seized on his comments. Several news agencies in Moscow, including one with close ties to the Kremlin, also enthusiastically published Mr Salmond's quotes. The First Minister was in Belgium yesterday, where his speech on EU relations was overshadowed by the international storm. Challenged by TV reporters to explain his remarks, he said he 'disapproves' of a range of Russian policies. The row was triggered by an interview with former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell for GQ magazine, which took place on March 14. Days earlier, 80,000 Russian troops had massed on Ukraine's border and the Crimea region was annexed on March 18. In the interview, Mr Campbell asked about the Russian president, to which Mr Salmond replied: 'Well, obviously, I don't approve of a range of Russian actions, but I think Putin's more effective than the press he gets I would have thought, and you can see why he carries support in Russia.' Pressed on whether he admires Putin, the First Minister added: 'Certain aspects. He's restored a substantial part of Russian pride and that must be a good thing.' Foreign Secretary William Hague said people across the UK would be 'horrified by Mr Salmond's remarks . 'I want to wish Alex Salmond and his beautiful country good luck, so that he never experiences what it is like to have death squadrons walking on his land and ripping open their opponents' stomachs in case of disagreements between them.'SERHIY SOBOLEVhead of the Fatherland party in Ukraine'I see Putin as modern Hitler so I cannot agree with anyone who supports him...

Good luck to them.'OLEKSIY MOCHANOVexpected mayoral candidate in Kiev'We are shocked and disturbed by the support shown by Alex Salmond to the imperial ambitions of Russian president Vladimir Putin.'ARTEM SKOROPADSKYUkrainian nationalist organisation Right Sector spokesman . Yesterday, Mr Hague said: 'I think people throughout Scotland and indeed the whole of the UK will be horrified by these comments. 'Even as Russia was annexing by force the Crimea, to pay tribute to the restoration of pride in Russia is a gross error of judgment in international relations and very concerning in the attitude of the SNP.' In Ukraine, Serhiy Sobolev, head of the parliamentary faction of ex-premier Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland party - the main force in the ruling coalition - said: 'I want to wish Alex Salmond and his beautiful country good luck, so that he never experiences what it is like to have death squadrons walking on his land and ripping open their opponents' stomachs in case of disagreements between them. 'I wish that Alex Salmond gets whatever he wants for his country and his people, and that Scotland never has any state storming its borders and killing its people, like we have it here with Putin's fascist squads.' The country's most outspoken Ukrainian nationalist organisation Right Sector claimed Mr Salmond was guilty of 'double standards'. 'We are shocked and disturbed by the support shown by him to the imperial ambitions of Russian president Vladimir Putin,' said spokesman Artem Skoropadsky. 'Ukraine has been fighting for its independence and integrity and who if not Scottish politicians should understand our feelings and aspirations? 'His words must have been spoken without thinking and they are unacceptable.' However, Denis Pushilin, leader of pro-Moscow self-proclaimed breakaway state the Donetsk People's Republic - where seven international observers are being held hostage - said: 'I totally support Alex Salmond's position. The deeds and the methods of the Russian president prove that he is right. 'I personally know patriotism, what it means to stand up for your land. And in many ways it's all thanks to Putin. The opinions like Alex Salmond's are needed here and they are needed in Kiev.' Pro-Russian protesters attack a Ukranian protester during a rally in the eastern city of Donetsk . Pro-government supporters march during a protest in the eastern city . In Washington DC, leading members of the House of Representatives condemned Mr Salmond's comments. New York Republican Pete King, who was critical of the SNP's decision to release the Lockerbie bomber in 2009, said: 'I don't see how anyone who is a democratically elected leader can in any way sanction what Putin is doing. It raises serious doubts about his leadership. 'To be praising Putin is indefensible and irresponsible and he should be ashamed.' Mr King added that Mr Salmond 'seems to have a soft spot for tyrants and aggressors'. Back home, Labour frontbench MP Jim Murphy said: 'I'm certain that the First Minister will now want to apologise to the people of Ukraine for this dreadful blunder.' Lib Dem Sir Menzies Campbell said: 'The First Minister should avoid judgments for which he is clearly unqualified.' Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: 'When Scotland takes responsibility for our own foreign policy, we'll need to show far better judgment than Mr Salmond has today.' But a spokesman for the Mr Salmond said: 'The First Minister agrees with Amnesty International, which is why he made clear in the interview that he disapproves ""of a range of Russian actions"".' Mr Salmond told BBC News: 'I disapprove of a range of Russian policy, including their attitude towards Ukraine and also the human rights agenda.'","Salmond said Putin has restored 'a substantial part of Russian pride'

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . Media tycoon Alexander Lebedev shovelled snow in a remote Russian village last week as part of his sentence for punching a fellow oligarch during a TV debate. The former KGB spy, owner of The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard, was ordered to clear snow at a nursery school in Maxim Gorky, close to a potato farm he owns 180 miles south of Moscow. He said he was 'enjoying' the work, which will amount to 150 hours of service. Hard at work: Owner of The Independent Alexander Lebedev cleared snow in front of a school . Punishment: The snow-shovelling follows a shift of digging and lifting to repair a playground in Maxim Gorky . Convenience: Lebedev changed his official residential address to the nearby village of Popovka, 177 miles south of Moscow, which meant he would serve his punishment close to his potato farm . The 53-year-old was spared jail despite a . conviction in July for dramatically striking billionaire Sergei . Polonsky during the 2011 television chat show. The trial was considered to be a political ‘show trial’ and linked to Lebedev’s ownership of a Russian investigative newspaper which spotlights corruption in Vladimir Putin’s government and entourage. Dressed in a designer jacket and gloves, . Lebedev, 53, cleared the first big snow of winter to allow children to . attend the school. Sentenced: Lebedev was sentenced to 150 hours of service for punching a fellow oligarch on TV . So far, the banker has learned to handle a chainsaw and fretsaw to mend playground apparatus - despite criticising his conviction and the penal system for failing to exploit his expertise. He said: ‘I object to the conviction in a legal sense so how can this be a meaningful punishment? Still, the law is the law and I show by doing what I am doing that I respect the law.’ He added: ‘It is a pity that such public works don’t use the most of what a person can do. ‘I would be glad to give some lectures, but no way, instead I must improve the environment and do something very simple that does not require even minimum qualifications.’ The penal authorities yesterday sought to . detain him in the tiny village for the duration of his sentence, but he . has demanded a move closer to Moscow, where his Siberian-born wife, . model Elena Perminova, lives with their two young children. The tycoon’s 83-year-old mother Maria, a teacher, came to check he was working properly in his exile. ‘She never praises. It was good she did not criticise me,’ he jokingly said. Mr Lebedev’s snow-clearing came as others convicted under by controversial court decisions in Russia are in limbo about their fate. Russia appeared last week to dash hopes that 26 foreigners - among 30 people seized during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic - would be allowed to travel home for Christmas. Verdict: Lebedev, centre left with his son and co-publisher Evgeny, at the trial in Moscow earlier this year . The powerful Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, is objecting allowing them exit visas to fly home pending trials for “hooliganism” in protesting at a Gazprom oil rig in the Arctic. Jailed Pussy Riot singers Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 24, and Maria Alyokhina, 25, are forced to wait to see if they qualify release under a state amnesty or whether their two year sentences will be quashed after the Russian supreme court, which last week ordered a view of their punishments. Mr Lebedev called for both the Greenpeace campaigners  and the Pussy Riot singers to be amnestied.","Russian oligarch sentenced to 150 hours of service for punching someone .

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . A ‘rent-a-killer’ website was still operating in Russia today after officials claimed it had been banned. The sinister site offers 'assassination services' and breaking the bones of targets in a catalogue of services said to be suitable for wives seeking revenge on cheating husbands. One option is throwing targets in a car boot and driving them to a remote location where they are threatened and attacked. Shocking: Zakazat-killera.com offers services such as 'physical elimination' on their site which was live tonight . The Russian Interior Ministry told a senior lawmaker that the site had been blocked, but tonight it was still accessible both in Russia and abroad. 'The website contained commercial offers of illegal services - physical elimination or transportation to a forest for a talk,' complained Ruslan Gattarov, a Russian senator, who called for its blacklisting. 'There is a detailed description of every service, such as the restraint of a target with ropes, handcuffs or sticky tape, the transportation of the target to a remote place and his beating with clubs, legs or fists.' The attacks are carried out by mafia gangsters, or ex-soldiers or sportsmen, it is claimed. 'Ideal for angry wives': The header touts the company's services as a good service for jealous wives . Assassinations: The company gives 'basic options' for services and says clients will not be troubled by police . Banned? Russia's interior minister claimed the site was banned but tonight it was accessible . It offers 'mercenaries for dealing with uncooperative partners, cheating husbands, rogues, thieves and the rest'. Clients are 'guaranteed' no problems with the police as the shadowy forces behind the site 'have links with the law enforcement agencies'. They are also provided with a photograph from the scene of the attack, it is claimed. The cost of assassinations are negotiated depending on their complexity, explains the site. For a 'slight shaking' of a victim, the site lists a tariff of £611, a more serious attack with bruises, teeth broken but bones intact costs £917, and causing serious injury, including broken limbs, is £1835. International: The website lists locations of Russian offices and says they can carry out their services in other parts of the world including the USA, Europe, Asia, South America, Iraq and Afghanistan . It also offers 'protection services' for businesses and brothels. The website - called zakazat-killera.com - is anonymously registered through a Chinese company and located in the former Soviet republic of Moldova, claimed Russian Deputy Interior Minister Mikhail Vanichkin. Russian police regularly detain men and women who have ordered contract killings on relatives or business partners.","Russian Interior Minister claimed site was blocked but it is still accessible .

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . Fighting resumed in Ukraine today after Kiev president Petro Poroshenko refused to extend the shaky ten-day ceasefire in the conflict with separatist rebels and vowed 'We will attack'. At the same time, Vladimir Putin claimed he could not dictate to the pro-Moscow insurgents to lay down their arms, with his spokesman declaring: 'Russia's influence on the militia should not be overestimated.' A new phase in the conflict began with the new get-tough message from recently-elected Mr Poroshenko, who defied Mr Putin and told Ukrainians in a late night TV announcement: 'After examining the situation I have decided, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, not to extend the unilateral ceasefire.' Scroll down for video . Petro Poroshenko, left, who announced Ukraine would be ending a 10-day cease fire with separatist rebels. Meanwhile Vladimir Putin, right, claimed he could not dictate to the pro-Moscow insurgents to lay down their arms . Despite lengthy talks on a fresh truce in a teleconference with Putin yesterday - brokered by the leaders of France and Germany - the Kiev president vowed to rout the pro-Moscow rebels. 'We will attack, and we will free our country,' he said. 'The decision not to continue the ceasefire is our answer to terrorists, militants and marauders.' Vladimir Putin blasted the West as Ukraine's fighter bombers and tanks launched a ferocious onslaught. A bitter Kremlin leader accused Kiev's president of going to 'war' against his own people after ending a tense ten-day ceasefire. In an ominous move, Putin last night summoned his powerful Security Council of military and intelligence chiefs to discuss what his spokesman called the 'rapidly deteriorating' crisis on his borders. A fireman tries to extinguish the flames from a burning house after shelling in the the city of Slovyansk in the Donetsk region of Ukraine . A woman examines the remains of her home after residential areas of Slovyansk came under shelling on Monday from government forces . There were unconfirmed reports of heavy casualties among rebel fighters in assaults by Ukrainian forces. One account based on sources in the 25th Dnipropetrovsk airborne brigade claimed as many as 250 fighters - two thirds of them Chechens - were killed on Tuesday, said reports in the Ukrainian media. Separatist sources denied the claims as 'ridiculous'. As Putin held talks with his security chiefs, he warned the West he would protect Russians and those speaking his language. 'I want everyone to understand that our country will in  future stand for the rights of our compatriots abroad as energetically as now, using all OUR arsenal of powers, from political and economic to humanitarian operations and the right for self defence allowed by international law,' he said. Putin said the West should have expected a hostile reaction from him to the take over of power by pro-Western forces ousting president Viktor Yanukovych. 'Of course we had no right to leave people of Crimea and Sevastopol to the mercy of militant nationalists and radicals, we could not allow to have our access to the Black sea significantly restricted and to have NATO troops stepping - and quite quickly - on Crimean soil and into Sevastopol.' He claimed: 'Practically everything Russians fought for since the times of Peter the Great, or even from before - historians know better - would have been overruled.' Both sides have been accused of ignoring the ceasefire, which has now ended, with this man examining a room in his house which has been destroyed by shelling . A man tries to rescue his pet cat after fighting resumed in Ukraine despite lengthy peace talks . Moscow reacted with dismay to the ending of the ceasefire. Sergei Naryshkin, speaker of the Russian parliament, said: 'Without a truce, without the start of dialogue, it is simply impossible to restore peace, justice and law and order in Ukraine.' And Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told newspaper Kommersant today that that despite Western demands there was a limit to how much Moscow could do. 'Russia is not a party to the confrontation, it is an internal Ukrainian conflict,' he said. 'And Moscow cannot tell self-defence forces what to do and how to do it. It can appeal to self-defence forces and use its existing influence.' The US and EU have threatened a new round of tougher sanctions on Russia, blaming Moscow for failing to put pressure on the rebels.","Petro Poroshenko refused to extend ceasefire vowing 'we will attack'

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . and Helen Pow . The mother of an unruly teen who was shipped to Siberia in 2011 has refused to bring the desperate 17-year-old back to America, claiming she didn't live up to her end of the bargain. Natalie Roberts, 36, sent her daughter, Sofia Petrova, from Chantilly, Virginia, to live with her biological father in the frigid city of Novosibirsk after she failed at school, ran away from home and stole $1,000. But two-and-a-half years later, the stern mother insists the teen still hasn't learned her lesson, even though she claims her dad abused her. 'She had to meet two conditions to come back; finish school and show she's changed,' Roberts told People Magazine. 'She didn't.' Hard: Natalie Roberts, 36, sent her daughter Sofia Petrova, pictured, from Chantilly, Virginia, to live with her father in the frigid Novosibirsk after she failed at school, ran away from home and stole $1,000 . Sofia is growing increasingly desperate, as when she turns 18 she'll find it tougher to get back to America. This is because she's a Russian citizen, despite growing up her whole life in America. 'I can't understand it,' she told People. 'I just want to come home.' Last month, Sofia launched an online campaign to get home, claiming she was beaten by her father, Igor, and was so miserable she tried to commit suicide. This week, The Siberian Times reported the teen is planning to press criminal charges against Igor for alleged inappropriate behavior. In a recent visit to his flat, which was caught on video and broadcast around Russia, he is seen shoving her friend Nikita. Sofia was a typical American teenager attending Chantilly High School when she was sent away. She was born in Siberia and her Siberian father still lives there - but she hadn't been there since she was two and did not speak any Russian. Despite this, she was packed off almost 6,000 miles to meet her birth father Igor - who spoke no English - as an apparent punishment for her teenage transgressions. Originally she was told she would stay three weeks, but once in Siberia, her mother - who is a US citizen -  told her that it would be much longer, and she is now well into her third year in Russia. Plea: She has written yet another letter (pictured) to her mother, who lives in Virginia, but she said that she is not helping to speed up her return. She claims she has been beaten by her Siberian father . Since arriving there in March 2011, she . revealed how she was forced to leave her father's home because he beat . her and was often drunk. In a children's center, with the . possibility of being consigned to a grim orphanage, she tried to take . her own life before going back to her father - because she thought if . she did so her mother would allow her back to America. Her . appeals to the US embassy and Vladimir Putin's ombudsman for children, . Pavel Astakhov, have all met with no response, she said. In October, she was tracked down by The Siberian Times to a Novosibirsk hostel where she lives and works a 60 hour week, including nights, to earn her keep and pay for her studies. Now . 17, she penned a heartfelt letter to her mother in her latest desperate . bid to be allowed back from Siberia where she says she has few friends . and feels an outsider. Mom: Natalia Roberts, pictured, says, two-and-a-half years later, the teen still hasn't learned her lesson . 'Mom - . With all that is going on I really hope that our relationship could . improve rather than be completely destroyed to shreds,' she wrote. 'I . love you so much and I miss you and Maria (her half-sister). I want to . come home. To come back to you. 'I ask you one more time, please take me back. Please find it in your heart to forgive my mistakes that I made as a pre-teen. You are the only family that I have. I need you. With love, Sofia.' Her step-father James Roberts is an . immigration attorney who has said her behavior as a teen was . 'uncontrollable', including inviting boys home without permission. 'The . behavior was becoming worse and we saw no solution. Worse, it was . affecting the other children in the house, especially the outbursts that . would last until 2am,' he told WUSA9 in an email. Sofia is convinced he was behind her Siberian punishment, and that without him, her mother would not have sent her into exile. Natalia . added: 'Sending Sofia to her father, grandparents, uncle, aunt, and . cousin was not an easy choice that we had to make, but it was the right . choice.' But Sofia she said she has hardly seen these other relatives. Sofia confessed her behavior was . poor before she was sent away - she once stole more than $1000 in cash, . but she denies she ever took drugs and believes she has more than paid . the price for any adolescent excesses. 'I was 14 years old. I made many mistakes,' she admitted. 'The one big mistake I made, I did take money. It was not preplanned. I entered into the room and just saw it. I don't know why, I just took the money. 'And then my mother asked me, where I got this money from and I panicked and I told her that I sold drugs. It was biggest mistake of my life. Desperate: 'I can't understand it,' Sofia, pictured, told People this week. 'I just want to come home' New home: Sofia, who spoke no Russian when she moved to Siberia, now lives in a hostel in Novosibirsk . Drama: This week, The Siberian Times reported the teen is planning to press criminal charges against Igor, pictured, for alleged inappropriate behavior . 'I never did drugs, I never sold . drugs. I told her later, that it was not true, that I stole the money. She told me - do you understand, you said that you sold drugs and it is . too late now. 'I was already . here, when I told her. Because after that day, I was on the plane two . days later. It was one week after my 15th birthday.' She . was put into a Russian school in the Siberian outpost of Berdsk and . only a friendly English language teacher helped her survive, she said. Later she was helped to find a job in Novosibirsk, Siberia's largest city where she works 60 hours a week. 'I pay for my school. I study via the Internet. I study in American high school. I want to graduate in an American school. And I just hope it is not a scam,' she said. More than anything, her dream is to be home - in America - for Christmas. 'I begged her millions of times. Take me home. I said, ""I want my mom. I need my mom. I need my home. I don't have anything here,""' she said. Her case has been publicized in the US thanks to the heroic action of her school friends like Michaela Bennett and Robert Buttaro who cannot bear the cruelty she is suffering. Yet it is far from certain she will return to the US. If she turns 18 before being allowed back, and her birthday is next March, immigration rules will make it harder for her to return.","Sofia Petrova, 17, was sent from Chantilly, Virginia, to live with her father in Siberia after she failed at school, ran away from home and stole $1,000 .

'Mom - With all that is going on I really hope that our relationship could improve rather than be completely destroyed to shreds,' she wrote. 'I love you so much and I miss you and Maria (her half-sister). I want to come home. To come back to you. 'I ask you one more time, please take me back. Please find it in your heart to forgive my mistakes that I made as a pre-teen. You are the only family that I have. I need you. With love, Sofia.' Fallout: Her mother Natalia Roberts said she will happily allow her daughter to return if she shows she's changed . Her step-father James Roberts is an immigration attorney who has said her behavior as a teen was 'uncontrollable', including inviting boys home without permission. 'The behavior was becoming worse and we saw no solution. Worse, it was affecting the other children in the house, especially the outbursts that would last until 2am,' he told WUSA9 in an email. Sofia is convinced he was behind her Siberian punishment, and that without him, he mother would not have sent her into exile. Natalia added: 'Sending Sofia to her father, grandparents, uncle, aunt, and cousin was not an easy choice that we had to make, but it was the right choice.' In fact, she no longer lives with her father and has hardly seen these other relatives, she said. Sofia confessed that her behavior was . poor before she was sent away - she once stole more than $1000 in cash, . but she denies she ever took drugs and believes she has more than paid . the price for any adolescent excesses. 'I was 14 years old. I made many mistakes,' she admitted. Desperate: She said that she was forced to live in a children's home and tried to commit suicide . 'The one big mistake I made, I did take money. It was not preplanned. I entered into the room and just saw it. I don't know why, I just took the money. 'And then my mother asked me, where I got this money from and I panicked and I told her that I sold drugs. It was biggest mistake of my life. 'I never did drugs, I never sold drugs. I told her later, that it was not true, that I stole the money. She told me - do you understand, you said that you sold drugs and it is too late now. 'I was already here, when I told her. Because after that day, I was on the plane two days later. It was one week after my 15th birthday.' She was put into a Russian school in the Siberian outpost of Berdsk and only a friendly English language teacher helped her survive, she said. Later she was helped to find a job in Novosibirsk, Siberia's largest city where she works 60 hours a week. New home: Sofia, who spoke no Russian when she moved to Siberia, now lives in a hostel in Novosibirsk . 'I pay for my school. I study via the Internet. I study in American high school. I want to graduate in an American school. And I just hope it is not a scam,' she said. More than anything, her dream is to be home - in America - for Christmas. Her mother has not closed the door on her but nor is she doing anything to fast-track Sofia's return. 'I begged her millions of times. Take me home. I said, ""I want my Mom. I need my Mom. I need my home. I don't have anything here',"" she said. Her case has been publicized in the US thanks to the heroic action of her school friends like Michaela Bennett and Robert Buttaro who cannot bear the cruelty she is suffering. Yet it is far from certain she will return to the US. And if she turns 18 before being allowed back, and her birthday is next March, immigration rules will make it harder for her to return.","Sofia Petrova was 15 when her mother sent her to Siberia for 3 weeks to meet her father - but she was not allowed to come home .

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . A stunning bronze ring made 2,000 years ago is proof that ancient Siberians actively worshipped the brown bear, say archeologists. The ring - which is as old as Christ - was unearthed during a dig this summer in Salekhard right on the Arctic Circle, and is too small to fit on a woman's finger. Instead, say experts, it was attached to the claw of a slain bear 'to honour the animal's memory'. A stunning bronze ring (pictured) made 2,000 years ago is proof that ancient Siberians actively worshipped the brown bear, say archeologists. It was attached to the claw of a slain bear to honour the animal's memory . The ring as old as Christ was unearthed during a dig this summer in Salekhard (pictured) at the Ust-Poluo archeological site right on the Arctic Circle and is too small to fit on a woman's finger . It is a key sign of a 'cult of the bear' adhered to by ancient tribes who came to a site described as an ancient sanctuary of spiritual importance called Ust-Polui around the time of the birth of Christ, reported The Siberian Times. The ring, which includes images of a bear's head and paws, is made of high quality bronze and was initially thought to have been made for a woman or girl. Archeologist Andrey Gusev, from the Scientific Research Centre of the Arctic in Salekhard, said: 'Bronze items for this period, and this area of Northern Siberia, are sparse and each bronze thing is a significant addition to our database.' Other small and precious objects were also found at Ust-Polui - a site described as an ancient . sanctuary of spiritual importance -including a small carved figure (left) and a pendant depicting an animal biting a bird (right) Pictured is an interesting container with a carved bird inside found at the site, which archaeologists believe dates from around the last century BC . The newly-found ring 'is tiny in diameter so even a young girl, let alone a woman, cannot wear it. 'We concluded that it was used in a ritual connected with a bear cult and was put on a bear claw,' he said. The theory is that the ring was fitted to the claw of a slain bear, an animal worshipped by ancient Khanty tribes as an ancestor and a sacred animal. Brown bears like the one pictured were worshiped by ancient Khanty tribes as an ancestor and a sacred animal . Here archaeologists work at the site where they found the tiny ring which is so small in diameter it could not fit a girl, leading scientists to conclude it was used in a ritual connected with a bear cult and was put on its claw . Archeologist Andrey Gusev, from the Scientific Research Centre of the Arctic in Salekhard, said: 'Bronze items for this period, and this area of Northern Siberia, are sparse and each bronze thing is a significant addition to our database.' A bronze bird with a mask on its chest is pictured . Mr Gusev said: 'After killing the bear they had a bear festival to honour the animal's memory. 'The head and front paws a bear was adorned with a handkerchief, rings, and for a few days was lying in the house. 'This combination of the images on the ring and the fact that it was found in the sanctuary of Ust-Polui led us to believe that a bear cult was also practiced here.' While the scientists will search for more evidence,they said  the ring 'brings us closer to understanding what rituals the ancient inhabitants had here'. It is hard to believe that this head of a duck made from antler is around 2,000 years old . The site was originally excavated in the early 1930s but work was halted after Stalin arrested the chief archeologist Vasily Andrianov who was later shot after falsely being found guilty of participating in a plot  to assassinate Soviet apparatchik Sergey Kirov. Here a small carved person is pictured . Other remarkable finds in the Arctic treasure trove this year include a bird with a mask on his chest and a pendant showing a fur animal biting a bird, both made from bronze. Another is a fragment showing the head of a waterfowl, made from antler. All are believed to date to around the last century BC or first century AD.

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . A glamorous Russian TV presenter with links to Vladimir Putin has told how she was forced to strip naked at Miami Airport after a security check wrongly indicated traces of explosives on her fingers. Ksenia Sobchak, 32, claimed that the alert came soon after she had a jojoba oil massage prior to boarding her flight. The ingredients of the massage oil triggered the security equipment, and she was told this happens two or three times a day at the airport, she said. Problem solved: TV host and political activist Ksenia Sobchak, pictured here in her Moscow apartment, was strip searched in a Miami airport because they believed she had traces of explosives on her . Close: Vladimir Putin, then-President of Russia, attended Ms Sobchak's (right) father's funeral in 2000 as he was a well-known mayor who helped transform Soviet-era Leningrad into democratic St. Petersburg . 'At the departure security check at Miami, explosives were detected on my fingers. It was the first time that I was searched naked,' tweeted the television anchor who is also sometimes called 'Russia's Paris Hilton'. After the strip search, she was allowed to proceed to her flight to Moscow. 'I had a jojoba oil massage - and there was glycerin, mixed with something else. This got their equipment activated. They said they get two or three cases like mine each day.' Sobchak, who has known Kremlin leader Putin since she was a child, said: 'It was a gruelling check.' She told her 783,000 Twitter followers: 'I was warned several times by a big black woman that she will be touching sensitive areas only in gloves and with the reverse side of the hand. Using her fame: While sometimes called Russia's Paris Hilton, Sobchak is also a well-known member of the country's opposition party and is considered to have 'protected' status because of Putins affection for her family . Strip searched: Sochak said that the so-called explosives were actually traces of massage oil . 'And if I saw this as a sexual action then I should let them know right away. I was lost for words. 'So the sensitive areas were checked with the back side of the hand only. 'Thank God there was no internal check. 'But this is what it means to have a jojoba oil massage right before departure.' She added: 'Alas my friends this time there won't be a proof shot.' Prominent: Ms Sobchak, seen right with her mother Lyudmila Narusova and current President Dmitry Medvedev at a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of her father's death, has over 780,000 Twitter followers . Politically active: Sobchak (right) posted a photo of herself posing with two of the members of the controversial band Pussy Riot . Sobchak, whose late father Anatoly Sobchak gave Putin his break in politics, graduated from being a celebrity socialite and Moscow 'It girl' to a prominent television personality who has joined protests against Putin. Her father was mayor of St Petersburg and employed Putin - his former law student - when the strongman returned from his stint as a KGB spy in East Germany. Putin is said to have helped her father flee abroad when he was wanted on corruption charges. One Moscow newspaper claimed: 'Putin's reported affection for the Sobchak family is widely believed to give Ksenia Sobchak a protected status, which may also explain her boldness.'","Ksenia Sobchak, a Russian TV presenter-turned-political activist, was strip searched in Miami .

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . An outbreak of the deadly bubonic plague has tormented the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan after the death of a 15-year-old boy. Three more people showed symptoms of the 'Black Death', and in total 131 came into contact with the victim. More than 800 people have been screened in the town of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. More than 800 people were screened in the town of Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan in the wake of the boy's death . The disease wiped out tens of millions in . 14th century Europe. It was reported that 15-year-old Temirbek Isakunov  died . after eating a barbecued groundhog infected with the lethal virus, yet another account suggests he became infected after being bitten by an oriental flea carried by a marmot that he reportedly prepared for food. Eastern districts of the mountainous country were in 'lockdown' last night as officials sought to prevent the plague spreading. Neighbouring Kazakhstan has warned residents not to travel to the country for fear of contracting the disease . Neighbouring Kazakhstan urged its people not to travel to the country, and introduced 'special monitoring' of those crossing the border. Three villagers who were in contact with the dead teenager - a woman with a toddler and a teenager - show  symptoms of bubonic plague, admitted a government source. Symptoms include fever and swollen lymph nodes in their armpit and neck areas. 'They had contact with the deceased 15-year-old,' said the government source. The outbreak is in the easternmost district of Ak-Suu in the Central Asian country, bordering China, where more than 800 people have been screened. Emergency officials have gone door to door in the boy's village searching for signs of infection which is more common among animals than humans. The country's health ministry last night played down the threat, saying there was no evidence the disease had spread beyond the boy who died. The Ak-Suu district, which borders Kazakhstan and China, lies close to the Issyk-Kul lake and is a popular tourist destination. Chaos apparently jeoprodised treatment of the boy, leading to a failure to initially diagnose the cause of his illness. 'While fighting for the life of the teenager, doctors gave the boy 17 different drugs which made it difficult to make an accurate diagnosis,' admitted Kyrgyzstan's Health Ministry. The bubonic plague killed tens of millions in the 14th century in Europe. The 15 year-old Temirbek Isakunov reportedly contracted the disease after eating infected groundhog . As many as 19 doctors are among those being monitored for signs of the disease.  All have been put in quarantine and are undergoing preventative treatment. Groundhogs are a natural carrier of the deadly disease and were targeted for extermination in the Soviet Union, but the Kyrgyz authorities stopped poisoning them from 1982 onward due to the costs involved. 'The teenager turned for medical aid in the district hospital with the health complaints for running temperature and bubonic inflammations on August 22,' said the healthy ministry in capital Bishkek. 'He was immediately taken to hospital in the surgery ward. The bubonic plague was only detected after he died. Health minister Dinara Saginbayeva said: 'There will not be a bubonic plague epidemic. 'The form of the disease in the teenager is not conducive to a plague epidemic. So there are no grounds for closing the borders.'","Fifteen year-old Temirbek Isakunov died after contracting disease from eating infected groundhog .

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden is enjoying his new life in Russia and believes he is out of danger, his father Lon claimed on today. 'He feels safe here and totally happy,' said Snowden senior as he left Moscow after an 'emotional' reunion with his controversial 'whistleblower' son. 'He is grateful to Russia, and admits that he imagined it to be a very different country.' Former CIA contractor Snowden, 30, has . applied for political asylum in Russia after spilling US - and British - . secrets over telephone and internet snooping.

'Being a true American . he used to think of Russia differently. He expected to find Moscow . rather a bleak city, but what he found was a modern metropolis with . multiple possibilities,' he enthused. 'He has walked Moscow's streets and been to museums and Red Square. People recognised him and he realised Muscovites take to him in a very friendly manner. 'He hasn't changed a bit and he is absolutely happy since he feels that his life is totally our of danger.' This . contrasts with his lawyer Anatoly Kucherena's regular claims that .

'It is a pleasure . for me as well, as it would be for any father, because I can see my . child living happily in Moscow and not worry about a single thing,' he . was quoted saying by Life News. 'My son is a very clever young man, a very perceptive one, and Moscow offers thousands of possibilities for self realisation. 'But the question of his employment is not sorted yet and he doesn't know just where he will be working.' Fears have been expressed in the West that Snowden may have been forced to give away his secrets to the Russian FSB in return for his safe haven. Snowden's own view of Russia has not yet emerged.

The bespectacled analyst has remained largely in the shadows since arriving in Moscow in June, emerging more than a month later from the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport to begin life as an asylum applicant. Details of where and how he lives have been deemed too sensitive to reveal. 'Snowden senior is very happy with the way he was received in Russia and the way that his son is being treated,' added lawyer Kucherena. 'He still loves his son very much and views him as a completely honest person who did the right thing.'

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . and Reuters . A deluge of storms has soaked the eastern United States - dumping two months of of rainfall on Long Island, New York in just two hours this morning. Flash floods caused hundreds of motorists in New York to abandon their cars of their morning commutes this morning. The story was similar in Baltimore, Maryland, for commuters on Tuesday night. In Detroit, at least two people have died - including a 100-year-old woman - in flooding caused by the heaviest rainfall in more than 80 years. Torrential rain also battered parts of the western U.S. - forcing daring r escues in Phoenix, Arizona, and causing floods so powerful the water broke down the doors of a hospital in Nebraska. The storm that passed over New York today ended mid-morning - but not before it dumped a total of 13.1 inches at Long Island's MacArthur Airport in Islip, said Christopher Vaccaro, spokesman for the National Weather Service. Scroll down for video . Waterlogged: Torrential rains caused chaos Wednesday morning as hundreds of commuters abandoned their cars on from flooded highways on Long Island. These cars are seen on a highway in Islip Terrace, New York . Dozens of cars can be seen abandoned on the Southern State Parkway in Long Island on Wednesday with flood waters up to their windows. The torrential rains caught commuters off guard as they drove to work . Firefighters from Bayshore, New York, help free a stranded motorists after he was caught in flash flood waters Wednesday morning. Torrential rain dumped five inches in just one hour . Stranded: Motorists were forced to abandon their cars in Royal Oak, Michigan, as flash floods turned highways outside Detroit into rivers . Five inches fell in a single hour, according to some reports. 'Wow, they had more than two months of rainfall in two hours,' Vaccaro said. 'It's really quite a dangerous situation. Heavy rainfall coupled with the morning commute is a problem.' The Seaford Oyster Bay Expressway was partially closed due to flooding, police said, and television video of other roadways showed cars submerged up to their windows. Authorities say hundreds of cars were abandoned across Long Island. Flash flood warnings for Long Island and southeastern Connecticut remained in effect through the morning. The weather system was the same one that drenched Washington and Baltimore on Tuesday, Vaccaro said. In Detroit, Michigan, near-record rainfall has caused massive flooding has made roads impassable, swamped vehicles and flooded basements. The heaviest rain since 1925 engulfed the area on Monday, the second-wettest day on record, according to the National Weather Service. Up to 6 inches of rain fell on Monday in a four-hour period and parts of five interstate highways that run through Detroit and many interior roads remained impassable on Tuesday, said Nicole Lisabeth, a Michigan State Police spokeswoman. Leap of faith: A driver in Phoenix, Arizona, was forces to leap from his car to a firetruck after it began to get washed away in the torrential flood waters . This aerial photo of Interstate 696 outside Detroit shows that the highway has become completely impassable by flood waters. Officials say the theft of copper from pumping stations has made the flooding even worse . On Long Island, New York, five inches of rain fell in just one hour - and 13.1 inches on Wednesday morning - forcing morning commuters to leave their cars and head to higher ground . Deep water: In East Islip, New York, the water was so deep on some roadways that cars were submerged up to their roofs . A 30-year-old woman died Monday after suffering a seizure in her car on a flooded road in Warren, a suburb north of Detroit, Lisabeth said. The storm may have also claimed a 100-year-old woman, whose body was found in her basement, she said. Detroit's sewer systems were overwhelmed by the rain, Mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement. The Detroit Free Press reports that the flooding may be even worse because pumping stations that are meant to channel waters away from highways have been been working correctly because thieves have stolen copper pipe from them to sell for scrap. Area residents on Tuesday dealt with flooded basements and power outages, and flood warnings from the National Weather Service remained in effect on Tuesday night. Divers had checked about 70 vehicles left behind by motorists on flooded roadways and have found no one trapped, Lisabeth said. About 1,000 vehicles were abandoned on Monday in Warren, the city's mayor, Jim Fouts, told the MLive.com website. The flooding forced General Motors Co to close a technical center in Warren and slowed operations of U.S. automakers in the region. In Arizona, firefighters had to rescue 16 people after their cars were inundated with flash flood waters on Tuesday night. Phoenix resident Illiana Hernandez showing the dramatic moment a man who was stranded on the roof of his car made a harrowing leap to a firetruck as his vehicle was carried away by surging waters. Over the weekend, flooding in Nebraska and a backed up sewer pipe caused a wall of water to hit Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearny that burst through the doors and filled the first floor.

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Alex Salmond, the Scottish Nationalist Party leader, has launched a bitter attack on the Australian prime minister after he warned against Scottish independence, branding his comments 'bewildering, hypocritical and foolish'. Mr Salmond spoke out after Tony Abbott weighed into the debate. Mr Abbott said separatists who back the 'break-up' of the UK 'are not the friends of justice or freedom'. Mr Abbott, who leads the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, said it was 'hard to see' how independence would benefit the rest of the world. Scottish Nationalist Party leader Alex Salmond, pictured left, launched a furious attack on Australian prime minister Tony Abbott after he warned separatists backing the 'break-up' of the UK were 'not the friends of justice or freedom' He added that those who 'cheer' at the prospect of independence 'are not the countries whose company one would like to keep'. But Mr Salmond reacted angrily, saying Mr Abbott's comments had 'all the hallmarks of one of the Westminster's international briefings against Scotland'. He added that the comments were 'hypocritical' because independence 'does not seem to have done Australia any harm'. The Yes Scotland campaign, spearheaded by . Mr Salmond, and the Better Together campaign, launched by Alistair . Darling, will go head-to-head at the polls on September 18. Mr Salmond said: 'Tony Abbott has a reputation for . gaffes, but his bewildering comments have all the hallmarks of one of . the Westminster Government's international briefings against Scotland. 'Many . Australians, including the great number with close Scottish . connections, will look on in bafflement at these remarks - Australia is a . country that has gained its independence from Westminster and has never . looked back. 'An . independent Scotland will be a beacon for fairness, justice and . cooperation in the international community - and a great friend of . Australia.' He later told the BBC: 'Mr Abbott's comments are hypocritical because independence does not seem to have done Australia any harm.' Mr Abbott, a staunch monarchist with an English father, told the Times: . 'What the Scots do is a matter for the Scots and not for a moment do I . presume to tell Scottish voters which way they should vote. 'But . as a friend of Britain, as an observer from afar, it's hard to see how . the world would be helped by an independent Scotland. 'I . think that the people who would like to see the break-up of the United . Kingdom are not the friends of justice, not the friends of freedom, and . that the countries that would cheer at the prospect of the break-up with . the United Kingdom are not the countries whose company one would like . to keep.' His comments came after US president Barack Obama . said in June this year that his administration had a 'deep interest' in ensuring the United . Kingdom remained united. Pope Francis, Hillary Clinton, Chinese premier Li Keqiang and more than 200 public figures from the arts and media, including Mick Jagger and Eddie Izzard, have also previously made comments widely seen in support of the Better Together campaign. Scroll down for video . Earlier this year, Barack Obama also made comments about the independence debate, saying the UK should remain 'strong, robust and united' During the interview, the leader - who was . born in England and studied for two years at the University of Oxford - . admitted he was 'an incorrigible anglophile' and said he 'loves . England'. He also praised Scotland, . describing the Scottish enlightenment as the 'intellectual foundation . for so much of what's best in the modern world'. But the leader told the paper that the . UK, Australia and other English-speaking countries need to . stay strong at a time when he says there is a great threat to freedom. Despite that, he would not be drawn on Britain's relationship with Europe, saying membership to the European Union would be 'left to others to judge'. Earlier this year, Mr Obama said he wanted to see the UK remain 'strong, robust and . united' during a joint news conference with Mr Cameron at the G7 in . Brussels. Yes campaigners claimed Mr Cameron was . involved and said it showed the 'growing desperation' of the pro-Union campaign. That same month, Pope Francis made comments which were widely seen as endorsing the no campaign. He said the break-up of countries such as the former Yugoslavia was justified because its people were so diverse. Alex Salmond is leading the Yes campaign, which per-referendum polling shows has backing from around 38 per cent of would-be voters . But when asked about breakaway regions such as Scotland and Catalonia in states where people had long been united, he said the case for independence was ‘not so clear’. He said: ‘All division worries me. There will be cases that are just, but the secession of a nation without a history of enforced unity must be taken very carefully and analysed case by case.’ Hillary Clinton, who is tipped to replace Mr Obama as US president in 2016, also previously told BBC’s Newsnight: ‘I would hate to have you lose Scotland.’ Harry Potter author JK Rowling also donated £1million to the Better Together campaign against independence. And earlier this month, more than 200 public figures from sport, cinema, television and . literature wrote an open letter to the people of Scotland in . advance of next month’s referendum which says: 'Let’s stay together'. The letter was signed by the likes of Sir Mick Jagger, Dame Judi Dench and Stephen Hawking. Helena Bonham Carter, the actress, Tom Daley, the Olympian, and rower Sir Steve Redgrave also gave their names to the plea. After a long-running referendum campaign, Scots . will finally go to the polls on September 18 to answer the question, 'Should Scotland be an . independent country?' The Yes campaign, led primarily by the Scottish National Party, believes the nation would be strengthened by independence but the UK government is opposed to the breakaway. Turnout in the historic ballot is widely expected to be high - it has been suggested as many of 80 per cent of those registered to vote will choose to do so. Latest opinion polls by TNS show the 'no' vote's lead has reached a record low, but is still ahead with around 46 per cent. Those who are intending to vote 'yes' is at around 38 per cent, while those who are undecided is at 16 per cent. After his comments were published, a Yes Scotland spokesman said: 'Independence seems to be working well for Australia. 'These . comments have echoes of Lord George Robertson's ""forces of darkness"" speech in April which was widely ridiculed, even by No supporters, as . one of the anti-independence campaign's most outlandish scare stories. 'The . decision about Scotland's future is one for the people of Scotland to . make - a point that even David Cameron asserts. 'After a Yes vote, . Scotland will take her place as a normal and valued member of the . international community - just as Australia did when she gained . independence at the turn of the century.' During Mr Abbott's 24-hour trip to London, the . Australian leader also met foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and his . predecessor, William Hague. He also had a meeting with Tony Blair. His . visit to London came after a visit . to the Netherlands, in the wake of the Flight MH17 disaster.

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Reuters . A city in China's restive western region of Xinjiang has banned people with head scarves, veils and long beards from boarding buses, as the government battles unrest with a policy that critics said discriminates against Muslims. Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people who speak a Turkic language, has been beset for years by violence that the government blames on Islamist militants or separatists. Authorities will prohibit five types of passengers - those who wear veils, head scarves, a loose-fitting garment called a jilbab, clothing with the crescent moon and star, and those with long beards - from boarding buses in the northwestern city of Karamay, state media said. Scroll down for video . Uyghur men leave the Id Kah Mosque following the Eid prayers on July 29 in old Kashgar, Xinjiang Province. Hundreds have died in unrest in Xinjiang in the past 18 months . The crescent moon and star symbol of Islam features on many national flags, besides being used by groups China says want to set up an independent state called East Turkestan. The rules were intended to help strengthen security through August 20 during an athletics event and would be enforced by security teams, the ruling Communist Party-run Karamay Daily said on Monday. 'Those who do not comply, especially those five types of passengers, will be reported to the police,' the paper said.

Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say the government's repressive policies in Xinjiang, including controls on Islam, have provoked unrest, a claim Beijing denies. 'Officials in Karamay city are endorsing an openly racist and discriminatory policy aimed at ordinary Uighur people,' Alim Seytoff, the president of the Washington-based Uyghur American Association, said in an emailed statement. While many Uighur women dress in much the same casual style as those elsewhere in China, some have begun to wear the full veil, a garment more common in Pakistan or Afghanistan than in Xinjiang. Policemen investigate the scene outside the train station after a deadly attack by a group of knife-wielding men in Kunming, in southwest China's Yunnan province on March 2. At least 29 were stabbed to death in the attack. An official investigation found that the more than 10 attackers were separatist Uighurs . Police have offered money for tips on everything from 'violent terrorism training' to individuals who grow long beards. Hundreds have died in unrest in Xinjiang in the past 18 months, but tight security makes it almost impossible for journalists to make independent assessments of the violence. About 100 people were killed when knife-wielding attackers staged assaults in two towns in the region's south in late July, state media said, including 59 'terrorists' shot dead by police. A suicide bombing killed 39 people at a market in Urumqi in May.","Five types of passenger will be banned from buses in the city of Karamay .

"By . Emma Innes . and Afp . A Chinese factory worker says walking in huge iron shoes weighing more than 31st each can cure back pain. Zhang Fuxing says he has been walking in the shoes for seven years and that walking just 15 metres a day in them can cure a bad back and treat haemorrhoids. He said: ‘After they reached 400kg (62st), I felt very proud. Next spring I plan to add 50kg (7.8st).’ Scroll down for video . Zhang Fuxing says walking in huge iron shoes weighing more than 31st each can cure back pain . Mr Fuxing, 52, credits his ability to move the shoes -- which he leaves outside, safe in the knowledge that they are close to impossible for most people to lift -- to the Chinese spiritual martial art Qigong which is said to involve controlling the flow of ‘bodily energies’. He said: ‘It's not strong muscles that make you able to walk like this, the power comes from internal organs. When you walk with your heart it will work.’ Mr Fuxing believes his shoes to be the heaviest in China, but admits that competition from a number of other people renders his claim uncertain. One of two Chinese iron shoe wearers to share a Guinness World Record for walking 10 metres backwards in heavyweight iron boots is Zhang Zhenghui. According to a 2010 report by the Xinhua news agency he has gold-painted shoes weighing more than 31st. Lai Yingying, an entertainer from Fujian, was shown by state broadcaster CCTV wearing shoes tipping the scales at a total of 47st. Mr Fuxing manufactures a range of the weighted metal footwear in a small factory near his hometown in the northern city of Tangshan, and sells them online . He said: 'After my pair reached 400kg (62st), I felt very proud. Next spring I plan to add 50kg (7.8st)' A runner, Liu Mei, also took to exercising in metal footwear after growing bored of tying sandbags onto his trainers, the state-run China News Service reported, and challenged other metal show enthusiasts to compete for the title of ‘Iron Shoe King’. His call ‘hit the world of eccentric stunt people like a tidal wave’, the report said, but there is no record of the contest having taken place. Mr Fuxing -- who runs a workshop making machine parts -- says he was inspired by one of these pioneers. He said: 'It's not strong muscles that make you able to walk like this, the power comes from internal organs. When you walk with your heart it will work' Mr Fuxing credits his ability to move the shoes - which he leaves outside, safe in the knowledge that they are close to impossible for most people to lift - to the Chinese spiritual martial art Qigong. Image shows two men trying to lift one of the shoes . ‘I saw someone wearing iron shoes on TV. They said it was good for the heart and bones,’ he said. At the time, Mr Fuxing was suffering from back pain ‘so bad that I couldn't bend over to wash my face’, but claims his symptoms disappeared just months after donning the footwear, an experience which left him wanting to share them with a wider audience. He now manufactures a range of weighted metal footwear in a small factory near his hometown in the northern city of Tangshan, and sells them online. Mr Fuxing says he has been walking in the shoes for seven years and that walking just 15 metres a day in them can cure a bad back and treat haemorrhoids . Mr Fuxing claims to have sold several hundred pairs of the shoes, including at least 10 to his neighbours. Image shows the factory where he produces them . A red pair weighing 1.5st each costs 550 yuan (£55), while the heaviest 9.4st boots sell for 1,450 yuan (£145). He claims to have sold several hundred pairs, including at least 10 to his neighbours. ‘We've all worn his iron shoes, it makes your legs feel better,’ said Chen Guanghua, a woman in her sixties. ‘We can't all play badminton, but anyone can wear shoes.’","Zhang Fuxing says walking 15 metres a day in the shoes cured his back pain .

"By . Damien Gayle . and Reuters . A two-year-old boy from a remote village in Guinea was 'patient zero' in the deadliest-yet Ebola outbreak, epidemiologists believe. The boy from the village of Meliandou, Guéckédou province, suffered with fever, black stools and vomiting for just four days until he died on December 6. Seven days later, his mother died too, followed by his three-year-old sister, who fell sick on Christmas Day and was dead before she could see the New Year. Scroll down for video . Health workers screen people for Ebola virus before entering the Kenema Government Hospital in Kenema, 186 miles from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, one of the three countries at the centre of the outbreak . Guéckédou sits by the borders with both Sierra Leone and Liberia. In a region where borders are porous, it gave the Ebola virus a route into three nations where medical infrastructure is under strain at the best of times. Researchers charted the spread to nearby communities by two mourners at the funeral of the original victim's grandmother, who died January 1, and the village midwife, who died February 2, but not before infecting one of her relatives who had cared for her. But it wasn't until March that the mystery sickness was recognised as Ebola and, by that time, dozens of people had died in eight communities in Guinea and suspected cases were emerging in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nine months after the first suspected case, described in The New England Journal of Medicine, and the West African Ebola outbreak, centred on Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, is the worst in history with nearly 1,000 victims so far. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday it is an international health emergency likely to continue spreading for months. Infection control: A health worker sprays disinfectant in an effort to curb the spread of the deadly Ebola virus, which has killed nearly 1,000 so far this year . The disease has put a severe strain on the health systems of affected states and governments have responded with a range of measures, including the declaration of national emergencies in Sierra Leone and Liberia. Nigeria has also declared a national emergency after seven confirmed cases of Ebola in Lagos, the country's most populous city. Today it was claimed that UK border staff are threatening to go on strike, angry that not enough is being done to protect them from the chance that passengers arriving in Britain are infected with Ebola. Border Force agents at Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London are angry no measures have been put in place to protect their health from the deadly illness, the Daily Star Sunday reported. An unnamed source told the paper there was 'panic' among border staff. 'People are scared and you can't blame them. Many aren't confident we are going to be kept safe and this has led to strike talk among the staff,' the source, described as an 'insider', said. The report came as medics announced the first person in Europe to be treated for Ebola will be given an experimental drug to treat the deadly virus. Spanish priest Miguel Pajares, 75, remains in isolation in a hospital in Madrid after being flown back from Liberia on Thursday. He is believed to have contracted the disease while treating patients with Ebola at a hospital his Catholic humanitarian group runs. Doctors were today given the go-ahead to treat him with ZMapp, which has already been administered to two American health workers repatriated to the States after falling ill with the disease. Supplies of the drug were flown from Geneva in Switzerland to Madrid's Carlos III hospital where Mr Pajares is being cared for round-the-clock. He remained in a stable condition today and did not have the profuse bleeding which is a sign the virus is at an advanced stage. Mr Pajares brother Emilio said: 'We have scant news and are just waiting. 'We'll go to see him when they say we can but at the moment what interests us is that he remains stable.' Ebola is not easy to catch. It is not airborne and can only spread through contact with the bodily fluid of victims. But it has reaped a high toll on health workers. Liberia alone has lost at least three doctors to the virus and 32 health workers. Sierra Leone's Health Ministry said a senior physician had contracted the disease at the Connaught referral hospital in the capital, Freetown. Dr. Modupeh Cole contracted the disease 'after treating a patient ... who was later proved to have the virus and died,' said ministry spokesman Sidi Yahya Tunis. Dr Cole was taken to an Ebola treatment centre in eastern Kailahun district, run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, Dr Tunis said. He is the latest Sierra Leonean doctor to contract the virus. The country's leading Ebola doctor, Shek Umar Khan, died of the disease last month and several nurses have also died after caring for patients. Health workers wearing protective clothing and equipment sit at a desk at the Kenema Government Hospital . A Guinean government minister said earlier on Saturday at a news conference that the country had closed its borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia to halt the spread of Ebola. Authorities said the decision was taken primarily to prevent infected people crossing into Guinea, where at least 367 people have died of Ebola since March and 18 others are being treated in isolation. However, state television later said the borders remained open, in an about-face that appeared to highlight the difficulties governments face in coordinating policy in the face of the fast-moving outbreak. 'Guinea has not closed its borders with Sierra Leone or with Liberia. It's rather that we have taken health measures at the border posts,' the television channel said. A government source said the minister who made the original announcement had not been in possession of accurate information. One of the deadliest diseases known to humanity, Ebola has no proven cure and there is no vaccine to prevent infection. The most effective treatment involves alleviating symptoms that include fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. The rigorous use of quarantine is needed to prevent its spread, as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with the disease. These measures have proved hard to enforce given that Ebola has spread in rural parts of some of the world's poorest countries. The task is made harder because of mistrust of health workers in areas with inadequate public health services. Medics await patients to screen for Ebola in the tent outside the Kenema Government Hospital . The WHO said on Friday 961 people have died during the outbreak and 1,779 have been infected. The infections and deaths have led to tests on suspected Ebola cases around the world. Authorities in Ghana said they were testing samples from a man from Burkina Faso who died while being transported to hospital in the Upper East region. 'He had fever and was bleeding from the nose so we are testing him for Ebola because we don't want to take chances,' Yaw Manu, medical head at Bawku Presbyterian Hospital, said by telephone. Ghana has previously conducted about 20 Ebola tests, though none has proved positive. Test results for a patient being treated in a Toronto-area hospital for a suspected case of Ebola are due within 24 hours, Ontario's health ministry said on Saturday. The patient recently came to Canada from Nigeria. Authorities in Benin also said they were testing a patient for Ebola, the second suspected case in the country, while Saudi Arabia's Health Ministry said initial tests on a dead Saudi citizen suspected of having Ebola were negative. International alarm over the spread of the disease increased last month when a U.S. citizen died in Nigeria after travelling there by plane from Liberia. Since then, other countries with no cases of the disease have taken measures as a precaution. Zambia said it would restrict the entry of travellers from countries affected by the virus and would ban Zambians from travelling to those countries, in one of the strictest actions by any nation outside of West Africa. Zambia's Health Ministry also advised against holding any 'international events' such as conferences and other gatherings, citing concerns about controlling potential outbreaks. Gambia's Ministry of Transport said any planes flying to the capital, Banjul, should not pick up passengers at airports in Conakry, Freetown or Monrovia.","Boy died on December 6 after four days of vomiting, black stools and fever .

"By . Reuters . and Associated Press . The Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs has ordered an urgent investigation into the school's sports teams after shocking allegations emerged on Sunday of endemic rape, recreational drug use and academic cheating, primarily among football players at the institution. Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson said in a statement that she told the U.S. Inspector General's office to look into the 'troubling' allegations, including claims that women were plied with date-rape drugs and then assaulted - specifically at parties dating from 2010. 'These efforts will help in eliminating subcultures at the Air Force's Academy whose climates do not align with our institutional core values,' said Johnson, who graduated from the facility in 1981. Scroll down for video . Troubling probe: The probe was announced following a report in the Colorado Springs Gazette newspaper, which chronicled a pattern of recruiting irregularities, preferential treatment given to student-athletes by certain professors, drug use by cadets, and alcohol-fueled parties . The academy, located in Colorado Springs, has a student body of 4,000, known collectively as the Cadet Wing. Graduates of the school are commissioned as 2nd lieutenants in the Air Force. The probe was announced following a report in the Colorado Springs Gazette newspaper, which chronicled a pattern of recruiting irregularities, preferential treatment given to student-athletes by certain professors, drug use by cadets, and alcohol-fueled parties. Investigation: Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson has launched a probe into incidents dating back to 2010 and 2011 . While Johnson's statement referenced the misconduct in general terms, the Gazette reported that at a Dec. 2011 off-campus party, cadets smoked 'spice,' a synthetic compound that mimics the effects of marijuana. When Johnson was appointed last year as the first female superintendent in the academy's 60-year history, it was widely viewed as an effort to change the culture at the school. In 2003, reports surfaced that dozens of female Air Force Academy cadets had been sexually assaulted by fellow cadets over the previous decade, but that academy officials ignored or downplayed their complaints. The Gazette reported that in the 2012-2013 school year, 45 Air Force cadets reported sexual assaults, representing 'nearly two-thirds' of all assaults reported at the nation's three major military academies. The Gazette reviewed hundreds of pages of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act that shed new light on the 2011 party and an earlier one in 2010. Air Force investigators looked into allegations of heavy drinking and drug use at both parties, and claims of the use of date-rape drugs and sexual misconduct at the 2011 party, the documents showed. Several weeks after the 2010 party, investigators seized synthetic marijuana during a raid on six dorm rooms. Twenty-one cadets were expelled and five resigned, but it's not known how many were athletes. Prestige: The academy, located in Colorado Springs, has a student body of 4,000, known collectively as the Cadet Wing . No one was prosecuted as a direct result of the 2011 party, but it prompted an investigation of 32 cadets for alleged misconduct. Johnson said three cadets were court-martialed, convicted and expelled — two football players and a female basketball player. Five other athletes received administrative punishment that resulted in expulsion, and six cadets resigned. Three other cadets were expelled for what was described as unrelated misconduct. Johnson said the alleged drug use and sexual misconduct 'obviously is unacceptable.' She also said academic standards have been raised for the academy's preparatory school, which helps athletes and other potential cadets meet the institution's admission requirements. Mueh acknowledged that some Air Force athletes convicted of crimes or found culpable for other violations never should have been recruited. 'Obviously, we shouldn't have brought any of them in — in hindsight,' he said. Mueh and head football coach Troy Calhoun said the school is now focusing more on the character of potential recruits, interviewing teachers, school janitors, parents and neighbors. Coaches have been told if they ignore a recruit's problems or an athlete's misconduct, they will be fired, Calhoun said. Focus on the football team: The Gazette reported that in the 2012-2013 school year, 45 Air Force cadets reported sexual assaults . 'If you're an enabler in any way, if you're tolerating — that's out of line,' he said. 'You're not going to work here.' Johnson said that after she became superintendent in August 2013, she noticed some cadets were more loyal to teams, cliques or friends than they were to the school's honor code. The code states, 'We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably.' Johnson said the investigation, the new standards, her expectations for coaches and the new programs in the athletic department are designed to root out what she called 'certain subcultures' that are out of step with the school's standards of commitment and respect. She said all cadets are being told to take greater responsibility for discipline, and if they see misconduct, they are ordered to protect victims and take steps to ensure lawbreakers are punished. A few cadets will still make 'poor choices,' Johnson said, but she pledged to focus on creating a better culture.","Air Force Academy has launched an investigation amid reports of sexual assaults, drug use and academic cheating .

"By . Reuters . and Associated Press . An independent medical examiner testified on Thursday that a black teenage girl's hands were swollen from pounding on the door of a white suburban Detroit man's home, which could support the man's claim that he thought the teenager was trying to break in. The testimony came during the trial of Theodore Wafer, 55, who told Dearborn Heights police that he was in fear for his life when his shotgun went off accidentally, blasting through his screen door and killing 19-year-old Renisha McBride on his front porch in November. Wafer is charged with second-degree murder in the racially-charged case and faces up to life in prison if convicted. Scroll down for video . Renisha McBride, 19, was killed in November after she was shot on the porch of a white suburban Detroit man's home. A medical examiner said on Thursday she was pounding the door, which could support the defendant's claim . Theodore Wafer pictured at his trial on Monday. He is the Dearborn Heights homeowner charged in the shooting death of Miss McBride . Dr. Werner Spitz, a veteran forensic pathologist testifying for the defense, said that photos from the crime scene indicated swelling of McBride's hands. 'A blunt impact to the hands causes swelling,' said Spitz, who did not conduct McBride's autopsy but reviewed case reports. Dr Spitz sparred with a prosecutor on Thursday over a wound on the hand of Miss McBride. On cross-examination, prosecutor Athina Siringas noted that Miss McBride was in a car wreck three-and-a-half hours before arriving at Wafer's porch. She asked Dr Spitz if the victim could have injured her hand in the crash and pressed him to give a scientific reason for his opinion. 'It may not always sound scientific... I'm told somebody at 4:30 in the morning pounded at (Wafer's) door in various places - on the window, on the door, on another door around the house,' Spitz said. 'And that same person now has a superficial laceration on the hand, a runoff of fresh blood, which means it probably just happened.' He said photos show McBride's hands were swollen, one more than the other. 'There's no way of associating these findings with anything but the event that led to the death,' Spitz testified, referring to the pounding. Walter Ray Simmons reacts to photos of his deceased daughter Renisha during the Theodore Wafer trial on Thursday in Michigan . Dr Kilak Kesha, the Wayne County medical examiner who conducted McBride's autopsy, had testified on Wednesday that he believed there had been no need to examine the teenager's hands. The killing of McBride, who had been unarmed, has sparked protests in Dearborn Heights and comparisons to the 2012 shooting death of black unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Wafer's attorneys haven't said if he will testify, but legal experts believe he must if he wants to show jurors that he reasonably acted out of fear. The prosecution rested its case on Wednesday.

LinkedIn Corp has been forced to pay $6 million in back overtime and damages to 359 current and former employees after a US Department of Labor investigation found the company violated wage laws. The career networking company will pay more than $3.3 million in retroactive overtime wages and more than $2.5 million in damages to workers in California, Illinois, Nebraska and New York. A Labor Department representative said LinkedIn has mailed the payments to the workers covered by the settlement. Scroll down for video . Payout: LinkedIn will pay more than $3.3 million in retroactive overtime wages and more than $2.5 million in damages to workers in California (pictured), Illinois, Nebraska and New York . LinkedIn has 'shown a great deal of integrity by fully cooperating with investigators and stepping up to the plate without hesitation to help make workers whole,' said David Weil, the administrator of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division, in a statement. A spokeswoman said that talent is LinkedIn's No. 1 priority, adding that the company was eager to work closely with the Labor Department to reach the settlement. 'This was a function of not having the right tools in place for a small subset of our sales force to track hours properly,' said Shannon Stubo, vice president of corporate communications. The Labor Department's investigation revealed that LinkedIn, based in Mountain View, California, failed to record and compensate workers for all hours worked, violating provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). In addition to the settlement payment, LinkedIn will train all employees that 'off-the-clock work' is prohibited for all non-exempt workers, the Labor Department said. Taking action: The Department of Labor announced Monday that LinkedIn has agreed to issue $3.3 million in overtime back pay as well as $2.5 million in damages to 359 current and former employees . The FLSA requires that non-exempt workers, who are not salaried managers, be paid the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25 plus overtime pay at the minimum rate of 1.5 times the regular hourly rate for hours worked past 40 in a given work week. LinkedIn's shares closed at $202.50 on Monday, up 0.4 percent on a day when the major U.S. stock indexes bounced back after Friday's sharp selloff.

"By . Reuters . and Joshua Gardner . Utility crews working around the clock on Wednesday labored to clean up and repair damage from a major water main break that unleashed a 40-foot-tall (12-meter-tall) geyser and flooded part of the University of California campus in drought-stricken Los Angeles. The late-afternoon rupture on Tuesday beneath Sunset Boulevard, a key thoroughfare on the city's west side, opened a gaping sinkhole in the street and sent an estimated 8 million to 10 million gallons of water gushing across the north end of the UCLA campus for several hours. It took crews from the Department of Water and Power some 3.5 hours to halt most of the water flow, though shutoff valves were still stuck partially open and water continued to drain into the work area as of Wednesday morning, slowing repair efforts, DWP officials said. Like new? officials were hopeful no catastrophic damage was done to the Bruins' newly renovated Pauley Pavillion Wednesday as crews cleaned up the last of water the flooded in after a major water main broke beneath nearby Sunset Boulevard on Tuesday . Awash: Crews began pumping out water immediately on Tuesday night after some of the millions of gallons of fresh water inundated the UCLA basketball stadium . The torrent flooded several campus buildings, including the basketball court at UCLA's newly renovated Pauley Pavilion, swamped the school's track stadium and inundated the underground floors of two parking structures. Millions of gallons of water flowed across the school's athletic facilities, including the famed floor of Pauley Pavilion, the neighboring Wooden Center and the Los Angeles Tennis Center, and a pair of parking structures that took the brunt of the damage. The arena - where Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Reggie Miller and Kevin Love starred and John Wooden coached for 10 years - recently underwent a $132 million renovation that was completed in October 2012. UCLA Assistant Vice Chancellor Kelly Schmader suggested Wednesday that Pauley Pavilion may well make it out of this without catastrophic damage. Things got ugly: The 30-inch pipe burst beneath Sunset Boulevard, sending a geyser many feet into the air and shutting down the major thoroughfare and causing chaos on UCLA campus . Sinkhole: The pipe left a 15-foot crater in Sunset Boulevard in addition to about 10 million gallons of wasted water to clean up . 'We’re currently in the drying process,' he told KTLA. He said, despite the 8-10 inches of water that were there last night, the floor is 'showing  little signs of buckling and expansion.' Firefighters dispatched to the scene helped five people to safety on Tuesday as water poured into the garage buildings, and no injuries were reported. Several hundred cars remained stuck in the two parking facilities, which have been closed while damage is assessed, school officials said. A stretch of Sunset Boulevard also was shut down for repairs. Aftermath: A parking structure is shown Wednesday after the water receded. Workers worked around the clocked into Wednesday dealing with the massive cleanup . Precious items: Carpet has been pulled up and fans dry the floor at the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in the J.D. Morgan Center Wednesday . Still flowed: Smaller leaks filled the repair site even after the main was shut off, hampering repair efforts on Wednesday . Pushing water: The process of cleaning up UCLA began before the pipe was even shut off and will likely continue for months . DWP spokesman Albert Rodriguez said crews working through the night had finished removing mud and debris by morning, and that the cause of the rupture was under investigation. The 93-year-old riveted steel pipe, 30 inches in diameter, normally carries an estimated 75,000 gallons of water per minute from a reservoir to L.A.'s Westwood neighborhood and appears to have broken at the junction of another water trunk line, the utility said. DWP general superintendent for water distribution Jeff Bray described the repair process to KTLA as 'very complex.' Water rushes down UCLA campus stairs after a  water main ruptured nearby and sent 10 million gallons of precious Southern California fresh water across campus . Scary situation: Los Angeles city fire search and rescue walking under falling water to a lower level parking lot to check for any victims . Water filled stairs to a parking structure adjacent to the main entry doors of Pauley Pavilion, home of UCLA basketball . Big problem: Millions of gallons of water flowed across the school's athletic facilities, including the famed floor of Pauley Pavilion, the neighboring Wooden Center and the Los Angeles Tennis Center, and a pair of parking structures that took the brunt of the damage . Massive breach: A man poses for a photo on stairs to a parking structure outside UCLA's Pauley Pavilion sporting arena as water flows down from a broken thirty inch water main that was gushing water onto Sunset Boulevard in Westwood . 'The location of the leak is creating issues for us as far as the location of the pipe,' he told the CW affiliate.' Normally, a break of this size, we would just go in and cut out a section of pipe and replace it real quick. But this is located where two large-diameter pipes come together.' The rupture underscored the aging condition of much of the city's infrastructure. The DWP predicted in 2012 that 1.4 million feet of its water delivery pipeline, or 27 percent of the total, would be at least a century old by this year, according to the Los Angeles Times. The mishap occurred as California suffers through a record drought that has prompted state and local authorities to impose strict water conservation measures, including fines for wasting even a few gallons on excessive lawn irrigation.

A Florida family scavenging for sunken treasure on a shipwreck has found the missing piece of a 300-year-old gold filigree necklace sacred to Spanish priests, officials said on Tuesday. Eric Schmitt, a professional salvager, was scavenging with his parents when he found the crumpled, square-shaped ornament on a leisure trip to hunt for artifacts in the wreckage of a convoy of 11 ships that sank in 1715 during a hurricane off central Florida's east coast. After the discovery last month, a team of Spanish historians realized the piece fit together with another artifact recovered 25 years ago. Scroll down for video . Puzzle complete: A Florida family scavenging for sunken treasure on a shipwreck has found the missing piece (left) of a 300-year-old gold filigree necklace sacred to Spanish priests, officials said on Tuesday . Ornate: The high karat gold Pyx which was believed to have been hand crafted in the late 1600's - early 1700's was used for transporting a Eucharist (communion wafer) and worn on a chain around a high priest's neck . It formed an accessory called a pyx, worn on a chain around a high priest’s neck to carry the communion host. The dollar value is uncertain. 'It's priceless, unique, one of a kind,' said Brent Brisben, operations manager for Queens Jewels, which owns rights to the wreckage, located in 15-foot (4.5-meter) deep Atlantic Ocean waters. Schmitt, who lives near Orlando, last year discovered about $300,000 worth of gold coins and chains from the same wreckage, Brisben said. Jackpot!

"By . Reuters . Philadelphia's Temple University said today it will no longer require prospective students to submit a standardized test score when they apply, joining a small but growing group of schools that believe there are other ways to gauge talent. Temple said it is the first public research university in the United States' Northeast to broaden its admissions policy in this way. Most U.S. schools still rely on students' SAT or ACT test scores when choosing whom to admit. Temple said it is the first public research university in the United States' Northeast to broaden its admissions policy in this way (Bill Cosby speaking at the Philadelphia institution in 2003) A prospective student's high-school grade point average, class rank or even his or her 'grit, self-determination and self-confidence' may all be better predictors of success in higher education, Temple said in its announcement. Although applicants can still submit test scores if they choose, they will also be allowed to write short answers to what the school called 'self-reflective' questions as an alternative. Neil Theobald, the school's president, suggested the move, which will apply to those who apply for fall 2015, will lead to a more diverse student body. Should SAT requirements for college be scrapped? 'By giving students more choices, we open doors to more first-generation students and those from underserved communities whose enormous academic promise may be overlooked by conventional measures of achievement,' he said in a statement. More than 800 four-year colleges and universities in the U.S. do not require applicants to submit either SAT or ACT scores, according to FairTest, a group that advocates for alternatives to standardized testing in university admissions. Last week, Bryn Mawr College, a private liberal arts college for women not far from Temple in Pennsylvania, also said it will no longer insist on SAT or ACT scores from applicants. However, Temple said that prospective students who scored highly in their SAT exams should continue to include their scores in their application all the same.","It is the first public research university in the USA's Northeast to broaden its admissions policy .

"By . Matthew Blake . and Reuters . Fighting broke out near the railway station at the heart of the rebel stronghold of Donetsk on Monday in what separatists said was an attempt by government forces to seize back the east Ukrainian city. The government in Kiev denied sending the regular army into the centre of Donetsk, which the separatists captured in April, but said small 'self-organised' pro-Ukrainian groups were fighting the pro-Russian rebels in the city. Four people were killed in clashes near the railway station and close to the airport outside Donetsk, local health officials said in the industrial city which was home to about one million people before many fled the fighting in the region.

But almost as quickly as the shelling started, it eased, leaving a control tower at the railway station with shattered windows. Shakhtar Donetsk, the city's biggest football club, was plunged into turmoil today as six of its star foreign players refused to return to Ukraine for training. Brazilians Douglas Costa (pictured), Fred, Dentinho, Alex Teixiera and Ismaily plus Argentine striker Facundo Ferreyra remained in France following a friendly against Lyon on Saturday. Shakhtar's owner says the six players will be punished financially if they fail to return. 'If they don't come then in the first instance they will suffer,' the club's billionaire owner Rinat Akhmetov said in a statement on the Shakhtar website. Meanwhile, Brazil winger Bernard, . Shakhtar's most high-profile player who chose a move to Ukraine over a . transfer to Arsenal last summer, is yet to rejoin the squad after his . World Cup exploits in his native country. It is not yet known whether the 21-year-old will join his compatriots in their refusal to return to the war-torn country. Refusing to fulfil their contracts could cost the players 'tens of millions of euros' in compensation payments to the club, he warned. 'I don't rule out that these players will return to the club soon,' Akhmetov said, adding that several of them could arrive Monday and that the club would not seek to sell them. By early afternoon, local authorities . said the trains were running normally and the station had been only . slightly damaged, but a Reuters witness could still hear shelling. An electricity substation was partially destroyed and people with suitcases were leaving the area. 'It is dangerous near the railway station!' the Donetsk city council said in a statement on its website after the shooting began, asking residents in the area to stay indoors. It said a nine-storey house had been damaged in the shelling and that transport had been halted in the area. 'In the morning there were explosions, people are extremely worried,' said a local resident who gave her name as Natalya. Donetsk is central to the rebel uprising against rule by Kiev, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has vowed to retake the city as part of what Kiev calls its 'anti-terrorist operation' against the separatists. He has, however, instructed the army not to fight within a 40 km (25 mile) diameter of the site where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 came down on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board. But that does not cover Donetsk. A statement from the headquarters of the 'anti-terrorist operation' said the army had taken control over a suburb of Donetsk and the president said soldiers were 'freeing' the village of Dzerzhinsk, about 60 km north of Donetsk. Security Council spokesman Andriy Lysenko said work was under way around Donetsk on 'clearing approaches to the city, on destroying checkpoints of the terrorists.' 'If there are explosions in the middle of the city - then it is not Ukrainian soldiers,' he told a news conference. 'We have strict orders not to use air strikes and artillery in the city. If there is fighting in the city, we have information that there is a small self-organised group who are fighting with the terrorists.' The pro-Western authorities in Kiev accuse the rebel fighters of shooting down the airliner. The separatists deny they are to blame. Earlier on Monday, three members of a Dutch Disaster Victims Identification team arrived in Donetsk, hoping to check the remains of some of the victims of the plane crash. A team of Malaysian officials were also due to arrive on Monday. The downing of the airliner has intensified calls for the fighting to end in eastern Ukraine and served as a reminder of the dangers the experts face working in a war zone. International inspectors got access to the remains of hundreds of victims stored in refrigerated railway wagons near the crash site but governments expressed concern over broader access to the rebel-held area.

"By . Associated Press . and Reuters . The chief financial officer of Donald Sterling's properties says the billionaire may be forced to sell a large portion of his real estate empire to cover $500 million in loans if he persists in refusing to sell the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion. Darren Schield, who oversees the finances of The Sterling Family Trust, testified Monday that three banks are ready to recall their loans to Sterling because of his decision to dissolve the trust. His move was designed to rescind agreement for the sale of the Clippers, a team he bought for $12 million. Schield said if Sterling has to dump $500 million worth of apartment buildings he could destabilize the Los Angeles real estate market. Indebted: As Donald Sterling continues to fight the forced sale of the Clippers, it was revealed in court Monday that his massive debts could force him to . 'We would have to start selling our real estate,' Schield said in Los Angeles Superior Court, adding that Sterling owns about $2.5 billion in property. 'We'd have no choice.' Schield was called to testify by lawyers for Sterling's wife, Shelly Sterling, who has asked a probate court to confirm her as having the authority to sell the Clippers to former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer. Schield is a witness to Shelly Sterling's claim the deal must be completed even against her husband's wishes so debt can be paid off. Schield testified that he warned Sterling against revoking the family trust that owns the Clippers and other holdings as a maneuver to block the sale because it would allow banks to call its loans. 'I told him this revocation would open up Pandora's Box and there would be severe consequences for us,' Schield said. Sterling's lawyer suggested there are other options for raising the money. Under cross-examination by Sterling's attorney Maxwell Blecher, Schield said that if Bank of America would foreclose, no other big banks would lend to the company and its current below-market interest rate would likely go up. Claims: Shelly Sterling, pictured with her husband Donald at a Clippers game, told a court he encouraged her to sell the team . Schield also cast doubt on Blecher's . suggestion that Sterling could raise enough cash to pay back the loans . by issuing public stock. 'There's huge reputational issues,' Schield said. 'I don't think anyone would want to go into partnership with us right now.' Bank . of America Corp told Sterling's company it plans to issue a notice of . default on the $350 million Sterling owes the lender after he moved last . month to revoke trust, said Adam Streisand, the attorney for Ballmer. Sterling, the volatile owner of the . team, agreed to the sale but then tried to revoke consent in spite of a . signed letter instructing his wife Shelly Sterling to sell for the . highest price she could get. A . probate trial to resolve the matter has been underway since last month . but was in recess for a week. With three days of hearings ahead, Donald . Sterling's lawyers suggested they would call the battling couple back to . the witness stand separately to address unanswered questions. Superior . Court Judge Michael Levanas was ambivalent about the need for more . testimony from the pair but said he would permit it only if lawyers show . that they are raising matters not covered during lengthy testimony by . both Sterlings. 'This is a case that has many unusual . twists and turns,' said the judge, noting that Donald Sterling's lawyers . had suddenly come up with 'witnesses we've never heard of.' Deal: Former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer has made a record bid to buy the Clippers . The . judge firmly refused to allow Sterling's lawyers to call opposing . counsel to testify. He also rejected a bid to strike the testimony and . reports of two doctors who found the 80-year-old has Alzheimer's disease . and is incapable of acting as administrator of the family trust that . owned the Clippers. The . judge's rulings Friday shortened the list of witnesses planned by . Sterling's lawyers and both sides were juggling schedules of other . witnesses. The lawyer . for the man who wants to buy the Clippers, former Microsoft CEO Steve . Ballmer, stressed that time is running out on the contractual deadline . for the sale which was supposed to be completed by Aug. 15. Attorney . Adam Streisand urged the judge to make a quick decision once testimony . ends, anticipating lengthy appeals if Shelly Sterling wins. If the sale doesn't go through by Sept. 15, the NBA can seize the team and sell it at auction, Streisand said. Donald . Sterling has vowed he'll never sell the team and is suing to block his . wife's single-handed deal to do so after the NBA banned him for life for . making racist statements. He has denied he is a racist from the witness . stand and claims he is the victim of illegally recorded conversations . that invaded his privacy. Outside court, Streisand said Donald Sterling's refusal to sell the team is 'a suicide mission by a madman.' Attorney . Bert Fields, who cross-examined Sterling, said he revealed himself as . 'a mean, nasty man who doesn't give a damn about his own family. For his . ego, he's willing to give up benefits to his children and grandchildren . from this sale.' Outside . court, Donald Sterling's lawyer, Bobby Samini, echoed his client's . wishes. 'We're going to do everything in our power to stop the team from . being sold,' he said. 'It's . not about his ego,' Samini said. 'He's made it clear he believes his . privacy rights were violated and what the league did wasn't legal.'","Chief financial officer of Sterling's vast property empire testified Monday the billionaire would be forced to sell properties if he holds onto the team .

"By . Ap . and Reuters . Mexican authorities said Thursday that genetic testing had confirmed that human remains found near a Pacific Coast beach town were those of a New York man who vanished while riding his motorcycle to Brazil for the World Cup. The badly decomposed remains that were discovered last week near the Pacific beach resort of Zihuatanejo were identified as Harry Devert by DNA tests, according to a spokesman for the Guerrero state prosecutors office. Devert worked as a stock trader and said on his website that he had spent the last five years traveling. He had planned to ride across Mexico and Central America to reach Brazil in time for the recently concluded soccer World Cup.

Devert had been traveling through rural areas of western Mexico where drug gangs control vast swathes of territory. Devert, who held both French and U.S. citizenship, was an adventurer who had already spent five years traveling through Europe and South Asia, keeping friends and followers apprised of his wanderings on anewyorkertravels.com. One blog post begins like this: 'I’m the owner of a big smile and a broad taste for adventure.'

Risks: Devert was a seasoned adventurer who had previously traveled around the world for years . A statement from the Guerrero office of public security said authorities found Devert's abandoned motorcycle along a dirt road leading to La Majahua beach in the township of Union Isidoro Montes de Oca. The statement said authorities also found '10 packages of what appeared to be narcotics (marijuana and cocaine)' near the motorbike and body. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said issued a brief statement: 'We are aware of the news reports that indicate a motorcycle and human remains were discovered in the state of Guerrero near the town of Lagunillas and are working closely with the authorities to get more information.'

"By . Reuters . From his cell on Florida's death . row, Paul Hildwin has spent 28 years fighting for his life, waiting . between cancer treatments for the state to acknowledge decade-old DNA . evidence supporting his claims of innocence. More than two weeks after the Florida Supreme Court threw out his death . sentence for a 1985 murder, Hildwin remains in a cell measuring 6 by 9 . feet, one of 395 inmates on the nation's . second-largest death row. In . Florida, two dozen death row inmates have been found innocent, the most . in any state. But as Hildwin's fight shows, a court backlog can delay . justice even when strong DNA evidence exists. Paul Hildwin has spent 28 years of Florida's death row, fighting for his life with cancer treatments while he waits for the state to acknowledge decade-old DNA evidence supporting his claims of innocence . 'Hildwin really is a report card that there is a serious problem in the . system that took this long,' said Martin McClain, his attorney. 'They . were hoping he would die, and it would go away.' McClain visited with Hildwin on Monday at a state prison in Raiford, in . northern Florida, where he is waiting to be transferred to a local . jail. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi's office said last week it . would not challenge the 5-2 state Supreme Court decision ordering a new . trial for Hildwin. Prosecutors say it may take several months to decide whether to retry the case, or drop the charges. 'We are literally back to square one,' said Ric Ridgway, chief . assistant state attorney for Florida's Fifth Judicial Circuit Court. Now 54, with his blood cancer in remission, Hildwin was the second . death row case in a month overturned by the Florida Supreme Court. Experts blame the backlog in addressing such appeals on the size of . Florida's death row and limited resources. The state, one of a very few . where juries can recommend a death sentence without a unanimous vote, . adds more new death sentences each year than almost any other. 'If you are innocent, delay is bad and justice is not being served,' said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information . Center in Washington. Hildwin was arrested after forging a check from Vronzettie Cox, a . 42-year-old woman found strangled in the trunk of her car hidden in the . woods in west-central Florida. Hildwin said he hitched a ride . with Cox and her boyfriend several days before the body was found, but . said he left them by the roadside after the two got into an argument. In Florida, two dozen death row inmates have been found innocent, the most in any state . He was convicted after prosecutors linked Hildwin to a pair of . semen-stained underpants in her car. Using available science, . prosecutors argued it could not have come from boyfriend William . Haverty, the person the defense said should have been the suspect. A 2003 DNA test proved Hildwin was not the source. But the state . opposed running the evidence through a DNA database to search for . another match on procedural grounds, arguing the evidence was not . eligible. 'It was just a stunning instance of foot dragging,' said Nina Morrison, an Innocence Project attorney representing Hildwin. In 2011, the results matched the DNA to Haverty, who is finishing a . 20-year sentence for child sex abuse. Hildwin thought his ordeal was . done, his attorneys said. Two and a half years later, he is still nervous after nearly three decades spent largely in isolation, imagining the night sky. 'It just keeps seeming to get closer, but it just keeps being out of reach,' said McClain.","Paul Hildwin was convicted of the 1985 murder of Vronzettie Cox .

"By . Reuters . and Michael Zennie . Rupert Murdoch offered $80billion to buy Time Warner, but was rebuffed by the company's board of directors, it has been revealed today . The 83-year-old Australian billionaire has his eye on the media conglomerate, which owns CNN, HBO, Warner Brothers, among other big-name media properties. Experts say he isn't likely to give up after one rejection. The move could create a mega-sized media conglomerate that owns rights to dozens of popular TV shows and thousands of films, as well as cable TV networks and local broadcast TV channels. Such a company would be a content provider powerful enough to aggressively negotiate with cable companies and internet service providers. Gunning for them: Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Twenty-First Century Fox, is expected to ratchet up pressure on Time Warner until the company sells . Twenty-First . Century Fox offered $85 per share in cash and stock for Time Warner, a . source familiar with the situation told Reuters. Time Warner's stock skyrocketed nearly 18percent early Wednesday to more than $84 a share after the New York Times broke the news. Both sides confirmed that it had made the formal proposal to Time Warner last month. 'The Time Warner Board of Directors declined to pursue our proposal. We are not currently in any discussions with Time Warner,' Twenty-First Century Fox said in a statement on Wednesday. On Wednesday morning, Time Warner issued a statement explaining why it had rejected the bid. It listed several reasons - though most revolved around the idea that Time Warner's companies were worth more than Murdoch had bid. 'The Board is confident that continuing to execute its strategic plan will create significantly more value for the Company and its stockholders and is superior to any proposal that Twenty-First Century Fox is in a position to offer,' the Board of Directors said in a statement. Fox first approached Time Warner, owner of the Warner Bros. movie studio and cable channels such as HBO and CNN, in early June and delivered a formal takeover proposal later that month, the Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Fox, which owns movie studio 20th Century Fox and cable news channel Fox News, offered to sell CNN as part of its proposal to buy Time Warner to clear any regulatory hurdles, the Times said. The price of Time Warner shares skyrocketed on Wednesday morning after news of the bid broke - jumping to more than $84 a share at one point . 'I think fair public value is $82. (It) would be good deal for Fox if it goes through Washington (regulators) with CNN sales,' Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan told Reuters in an email. Time Warner's board discussed the proposal at length and sent a terse letter rejecting the offer earlier this month, saying that it was better off remaining independent, the newspaper said. It said the deal fell through because the stock portion of Fox's offer consisted of non-voting shares. Fox had estimated that a combined company would save $1 billion in costs and possibly more, primarily by cutting sales staff and back-office functions, the paper said. The combined company's revenue would be over $60 billion. Twenty-First Century Fox is in the middle of a reorganization of its television business as the network seeks to lift itself out of last place among the big U.S. broadcasters. The shakeup of Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox's TV units also comes a year after the film and TV company was spun off from Murdoch's News Corp, which now operates publishing assets, including the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, the Sun and Times of London in Britain and dozens of newspaper in Australia. Twenty-First Century Fox is being advised by Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners, while Time Warner has hired Citigroup and other advisers, the paper said. Time Warner owns several major TV stations and movie studios. Its properties - in addition to CNN - include: New Line Cinema, HBO, Warner Bros., TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, DC Comics, MLB Network and Castle Rock Entertainment. Those assets would improve an impressive stable of media and entertainment properties already owned by Twenty-First Century Fox, including: 20th Century Fox movie studios, Fox News, local Fox TV stations in 18 markets, Fox Sports Network and the National Geographic Channel. Time Warner once owned Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable provider in the country, magazine publisher Time Inc., and AOL - though all three were spun off into independent companies.","Twenty-First Century Fox, owner of Fox News, would sell off CNN to avoid anti-trust problems .

"By . Reuters . Germany coach Joachim Low is leaving no stone unturned as he prepares for Sunday’s World Cup final against Argentina and he was still hard at work while strolling along the beach on Thursday. Low was walking at the squad’s training base with scout Urs Siegenthaler, who suddenly stopped, bent down and started drawing lines in the sand. Siegenthaler, who has been gathering intelligence on Germany’s opponents for a decade, spent a minute sketching out a diagram which Low studied intently before it was washed away by a wave. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Klose not thinking about records . Life's a beach: Germany coach Joachim Low took a stroll with match analyst Urs Siegenthaler along the beach in front of their base at Campo Bahia, Santo Andre as they devise their masterplan for the World Cup final with Argentina . Thick of it: Low donned full training gear to get involved in Thursday's session as Germany count down to the showpiece in the Maracana . Shooting practice: Germany's Philipp Lahm leads his team-mates Ron-Robert Zieler, Erik Durm, Matthias Ginter, Christoph Kramer and Sami Khedira out on the training ground . Pedal power: Manuel Neuer (left), Mats Hummels (middle) and Miroslav Klose get on their bikes . Laugh a minute: Arsenal pair Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil find themselves on the same side during a game of head tennis . VIDEO Team Profile - Germany highlights . Low and Siegenthaler, both barefoot and in shorts, had earlier been engaged in an animated discussion while walking on the beach a few dozen metres away from photographers, autograph seekers and Germany fans. Meanwhile, defender Benedikt Howedes remains calm ahead of Sunday’s showpiece. He has been used as left-back by Low during the tournament and the Schalke defender is likely to be the one assigned to Argentina star Lionel Messi. ‘I’ll do my part, but it will be a collective effort. That’s how even a player of such quality can be stopped,’ Howedes said.

Howedes has already had to deal with another scoring sensation, Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal. The Real Madrid superstar failed to score as Germany won its World Cup opener 4-0. Usually a centre back, Howedes has defied skeptics with his performances at left back. ‘Since we are in the final, I must have done something right,’ he added, . ‘I am playing in a position for which I haven’t trained. But I think I am helping the team with my presence.’ Germany started the tournament with four centre backs in its last line of defence but Philipp Lahm has since returned to right back from the midfield.

Howedes has played right back for Germany and Schalke when necessary but being on the left is a novelty. ‘For me, it’s completely crazy what’s going on. I still can’t believe it,’ he said. ‘It’s huge what’s happening to me and the final will be the highlight. We want the title.’ Hoewedes does not provide much attacking spark on the left flank but says that that’s his not priority anyway. ‘It’s not my job to send sensational crosses with my strong left foot,’ he said.","Low was spotted walking along the beach with match analyst Urs Siegenthaler .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters . U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc is in talks to acquire rival Lorillard Inc in a multi-billion dollar deal that would reshape one of the world's biggest and most profitable tobacco markets, the companies said on Friday. A deal would also involve the sale of some brands to Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group to address potential antitrust concerns, as well as the purchase of more shares in Reynolds by British American Tobacco (BATS), its largest shareholder. In a statement confirming what people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters, Reynolds, No.2 player in the United States with brands including Camel and Pall Mall, said the talks were consistent with its strategy of weighing options that would help boost shareholder value. Merger: Reynolds American, which manufactures Pall Mall and Camel brand cigarettes, plans to merge with rival Lorillard Inc. Buying Lorillard, which had a stock market value of $22.9 billion on Thursday, would give Reynolds the leading U.S. menthol cigarette Newport and its leading e-cigarette blu. Analysts say the combination could also generate $500 million in annual cost savings, helping the No.2 and No.3 U.S. players compete with Marlboro maker and No.1 Altria Group Inc in a market where sales volume is falling about 4 percent a year as more Americans quit smoking. Despite the decline, the U.S. remains the biggest tobacco market in the world after China and the most profitable. 'Reynolds is getting both a fantastic brand in Newport and strong intellectual property in the e-cig category,' said analyst Philip Gorham at research firm Morningstar. 'It's a good deal strategically, we just need to know what they're paying. If they pay a premium to today's price, it's going to be on the rich end of historical deals.' Billions: The Lorillar/Reynolds American merger would give Reynolds control of Newport brand cigarettes, the most popular American menthol cigarette . Historically, he said tobacco deals have fetched an average enterprise value (equity plus debt) of about 12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which is about where Lorillard's stock was trading on Friday, up 4.8 percent in New York. BAT, which owns 42 percent of Reynolds, said that if the deal proceeds, it would expect to support it by buying more shares in Reynolds with the aim of maintaining its current stake, which is the company's only exposure to the U.S. market. Over the last 50 years, the United States has seen several waves of lawsuits against tobacco firms, including complaints by individuals, class action suits and a massive racketeering case. Cases have concerned the industry's negligence, disclosure of health risks and advertising practices. Litigation risks contributed to the 2008 separation of Altria and Philip Morris International, which is now the world No.1 selling Marlboros everywhere except the United States. But analysts say the litigation risk has waned, so there is now more openness to trade there. blu: The merger also would also give Reynolds control over blu, the most popular e-cig in America . 'A lot of the more extreme class action suits haven't really made the progress people thought they might,' said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo, who questioned whether by buying into the United States, Imperial would be taking on additional risk. 'I'd have thought that given Imperial's leverage in the negotiations, they will be able to insist that they don't,' he said. Imperial, known for its Gauloises and Davidoff cigarettes, said it was in talks with Reynolds and Lorillard about buying certain assets they might sell but saw no guarantee the proposed deal would come off. A source familiar with the situation said Imperial was lining up about $7 billion to finance the potential purchase of brands such as Kool and Salem, which would ease antitrust concerns thrown up by a Reynolds-Lorillard combination. Reynolds, Lorillard and BAT said there were no assurances a deal will be reached. They added that unless circumstances dictate otherwise, they did not intend to comment further.","Reynolds American Inc. is in talks to acquire Lorillard Inc, which manufactures Newport cigarettes .

"By . Reuters . Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told his friends about martyrdom and bomb-building over lunch before the attacks last year, an FBI agent testified on Friday in the trial of one of the friends for obstruction. Azamat Tazhayakov is the first of Tsarnaev's friends to face trial. He is charged with removing evidence from Tsarnaev's room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and throwing away a backpack containing fireworks casings as the FBI searched for the suspect, accused of killing three people and injuring 264 in the April 2013 bombings. Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told his friends about martyrdom and bomb-building over lunch before the attacks last year . FBI Special Agent Timothy Quinn said Tazhayakov told him that Tsarnaev had discussed martyrdom and his knowledge of bomb building during a conversation over lunch with Tazhayakov and his roommate and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev before spring break last year. 'Dzhokhar had explained that people who die in an act of martyrdom die with a smile on their face and go straight to heaven,' said Quinn, who interviewed Tazhayakov in the days after the alleged visit to Tsarnaev's room. ""He also explained that during the same conversation, Dzhokhar said he knew how to build bombs,"" Quinn testified. An FBI testified Tsarnaev had discussed martyrdom and his knowledge of bomb building during a conversation over lunch with Tazhayakov and his roommate and fellow Kazakh exchange student Dias Kadyrbayev before spring break last year . Tsarnaev was captured in the days after the bombing and is awaiting trial in November on terrorism charges. His older brother Tamerlan, also a suspect in the bombing, was killed following a shoot-out with police. FBI agent Farbod Azad had testified on Thursday that Tazhayakov told him in an interview after the bombing that he and Kadyrbayev and a third man, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, had removed the backpack and a laptop from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room. Tazhayakov's attorneys say he never touched the backpack or fireworks, and that it was Kadyrbayev who threw them out. FBI Special Agent Kenneth Benton testified on Friday he recovered the backpack at a landfill on April 26, 2013. Tazhayakov's attorneys say he never touched the backpack or fireworks, and that it was Kadyrbayev who threw them out . The backpack contained fireworks with the gunpowder removed, a spiral notebook, a jar of Vaseline and a homework assignment from an ethics class in which Tsarnaev was enrolled, he said. An FBI forensic examiner, David McCollum, testified Vaseline could be used to make an improvised explosive device. Tazhayakov could face up to 25 years in prison. Kadyrbayev faces the same charges. Phillipos is accused of the lesser charge of lying to investigators. Tsarnaev's trial is set for November, on charges that carry the death penalty if he is convicted.","Azamat Tazhayakov is the first of Tsarnaev's friends to face trial .

"By . Reuters . German Chancellor Angela Merkel said today that allegations a German man worked as a double agent for US intelligence were serious and if true contradicted the true nature of cooperation between partners. 'If the reports are correct it would be a serious case,' Merkel said during a news conference in Beijing with Chinese Premier Li Kegiang. 'It would be for me a clear contradiction as to what I consider to be trusting cooperation between agencies and partners.'

"By . Reuters . and Daily Mail Reporter . New York became the 23rd state to legalize medical marijuana when Governor Cuomo signed into law a bill approving the drug's use by patients with very serious or terminal illnesses. Gov Cuomo called the new program, which forbids smoking of the drug and includes strict limits, the 'smartest' any state has taken so far. Under the guidelines, access to the drug will be limited to patients with very serious and terminal illnesses, the drug can only be administered through vaporizing, oils and edibles, and Cuomo reserves the right to disband the program at any time. Scroll down for video . A smile of relief: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law on Monday a bill which legalizes medical marijuana in the Empire State. Gov Cuomo pictured above with 10-year-old girl Amanda Houser. Young Miss Houser suffers from seizures and will qualify to use the drug . 'This new law takes an important step toward bringing relief to patients living with extraordinary pain and illness,' Cuomo told a news conference at the New York Academy of Medicine, flanked by lawmakers and 10-year-old Amanda Houser, who suffers from seizures. The legislation 'gets us the best that medical marijuana has to offer in the most protected, controlled way possible,' the Democratic governor said. 'I really believe that this is the smartest approach that any state has taken thus far.' Other states have approved far more permissive laws. Washington state and Colorado decriminalized recreational use of marijuana in 2012. Smart plan: Gov Cuomo called the new program the 'smartest' any state has come up with since. The new program will limit marijuana's use only to patients with very serious or terminal illnesses . In other states, patients can grow their own pot, obtain it from a dispensary, or both. Medical marijuana is also legal in the District of Columbia. The signing of the New York law came after years of advocacy by proponents of medical marijuana. While applauding passage of the new law, advocates said it was not as comprehensive as patients had hoped and the timeline was too slow. 'I’m heartened that the governor understands the medicinal benefits of medical cannabis. My son and so many others need this medicine right away,"" said Missy Miller, whose son Oliver suffered a brain stem injury in utero and now as a teenager has hundreds of seizures a day. 'The eighteen month timeline for implementation suggested in the bill is simply too long for Oliver,' Miller said in a statement issued by the Drug Policy Alliance. State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the state's goal would be to get the program up and running 'swiftly, safely and efficiently.' The assembly has been approving versions of the bills for the better part of two decades. The current bill passed both houses of the Legislature on June 20. The conditions covered include cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, certain spinal cord injuries, irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, neuropathy and Huntington’s disease.","Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill into law on Monday which legalizes marijuana to treat certain medical ailments .

"By . Reuters . and Ap  Reporter . The U.S. deported Honduran children as young as 1-1/2 years old on Monday in the first flight since President Obama pledged to speed up the process of sending back illegal immigrant minors from Central America. Fleeing violence and poverty, record numbers of children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have crossed into the United States over the past year, sparking intense debate about how to solve the problem. Monday's flight from New Mexico to San Pedro Sula, the city with the highest murder rate in the world, returned 17 Honduran women, as well as 12 girls and nine boys, aged between 18 months and 15 years. Scroll down for video . First wave: Women and their children walk on the San Pedro Sula airport tarmac after being deported from the U.S. as part of the first wave of immigrants being shipped back to Honduras, Guatemala and Salvador amidst the southern border immigration crisis . Heading south again: The chartered aircraft will likely be the first of many that fly from New Mexico to points south in Central America . Watching their return: A boy watches as the plane carrying the 40 deportees taxis at the San Pedro Sula airport. The flight was the first of many according to immigration officials . The Hondurans were from among a group of immigrants who've been housed at an Artesia, New Mexico emergency detention facility opened as other centers became completely overwhelmed. The Artesia Center was opened in barracks of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. It eventually will hold about 700 women and children. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson visited the facility in a visit that seemed crafted to show detainees that America is not the welcoming place they may have thought. 'Our border is not open to illegal immigration,' he said. 'Our message to those who come illegally is we will send you back.' Looking happy, the deported children exited the airport on an overcast and sweltering afternoon. One by one, they filed into a bus, playing with balloons they had been given. Full: Child detainees in a Brownsville, Texas detention center sleep atop one another last month. The Artesia center was opened as an overflow facility as centers elsewhere have become too full to house any more . Gonzalez shows a play room in an area where immigrant families are housed in the Artesia center, which will eventually hold around 700 detainees . Overflow: Barbara Gonzalez, public information officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shows a dormitory where immigrant families are housed at the Artesia Residential Detention Facility inside the Federal Law Enforcement Center in Artesia, New Mexico . Nubia, a 6-year-old girl among the deportees, said she left Honduras a month ago for a journey that ended when she and her mother were caught on the Mexico-Texas border two weeks later. 'Horrible, cold and tiring,' was how Nubia remembered the trip that was meant to unite the pair with her three uncles already living in the United States. Instead, her mother Dalia paid $7,000 in vain to a coyote, or guide, to smuggle them both across the border. Once caught, U.S. officials treated them like 'animals', holding them in rooms with as many as 50 people, where some mothers had to sleep standing up holding children, Dalia said. During the eight months ended June 15, some 52,000 children were detained at the U.S. border with Mexico, most of them from Central America. Unhappy return: A bus was set to take the wary travelers back to the homes they so desperately wanted to leave . Dangerous: A girls stands next to the bus (right) that will drop the 40 Honduran deportees from the United States near their homes or at the bus station in San Pedro Sula, which has the highest murder rate in the world. At left, another mother wrangles her daughter as she gathers their belongings in a plastic bag and prepares to head home . Spectacle: Honduras' First Lady Ana Garcia de Hernandez even showed up to see the repatriated deportees off the plane . Political problem: Fleeing violence and poverty, record numbers of children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have crossed into the United States over the past year, sparking intense debate about how to solve the problem . That was double the previous year's tally and tens of thousands more are believed to have slipped through. So . chaotic are the circumstances of the exodus that some of the children . are not even correctly reunited with their parents, said Valdette . Willeman, director of the Center for Attention for Returned Migrants in . Honduras. 'Many of the mothers are sometimes not even the real mothers of the children,' she said. Monday's flight departed as Obama faces increasing pressure to address the surge of unaccompanied minors. Immigrant . advocates urge him to address the humanitarian needs of the migrants. At . the same time, Republicans in Congress have blamed the crisis on . Obama's immigration policies and have called on him to secure the . border. Obama's . administration has stressed that Central American children who cross . the border illegally will be sent home, and last week said it would . speed up the deportation process. Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala have suffered from gang violence and incursions from Mexican drug cartels using the region as a staging post for their trafficking operations. Honduran President Juan Hernandez, in an interview published on Monday, blamed U.S. drug policy for sparking violence and ramping up migration to the United States. His wife urged the United States to do more to help. 'The countries consuming drugs need to support (us) and take joint responsibility because if there wasn't demand, there wouldn't be production and we wouldn't be living like we are,' Ana Garcia de Hernandez said as she awaited the children. Obama's administration has projected that without government action, more than 150,000 unaccompanied children under the age of 18 could flee the three Central American nations next year. The proposed actions will test Obama's ability to negotiate effectively with Republican lawmakers who have blocked much of his agenda ahead of a November election when they hope to capture the U.S. Senate from his Democratic Party. Meanwhile, in Guatemala: Part of a group of 16 Guatemalan children caught in Mexico while trying to migrate illegally into the United States queue before climbing into a minibus at Aurora international airport in Guatemala City . These children likely would have become part of the thousands held at the southern American border had they not been nabbed by Mexican authorities before they were able to make the crossing. They're now headed back to Guatemala . President Obama's administration wants to take more action to send home children who cross the border from Central America on their own, writes BRYAN KEOGH. The government claims more than 150,000 children could flee three nations south of the border next year - and there is no lower limit on their ages. Last month it emerged hundreds of toddlers under the age of two were caught travelling alone in a desperate bid by their parents to get them into the U.S. The growing number of immigrants trying to make it into the U.S. is being driven in part by a misconception that children won't be deported. But this is a misinterpretation of a 2012 policy that delays the deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children prior to 2007. The sheer numbers and complexity mean unaccompanied children are more likely than adults to slip through the cracks and ultimately remain in the U.S. for months or even years. Once captured, most minors are processed and reunited with family members or a guardian in the U.S. while they await deportation proceedings. But detention facilities are generally not equipped to handle young people, especially infants and toddlers. Because of the significant backlog and lack of resources put into tracking them, few are expected to ever return and face immigration judges.","Around 40 Hondurans were loaded into planes in Roswell, New Mexico and flown to San Pedro Sula .

"By . Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia . While there are many threats to the endangered bilbies, a new technique to measure stress levels by testing their droppings could save them from being extinct, new research has found. The study published in the European Journal of Wildlife found levels of the stress hormone cortisol in captive bilbies breeding programs were relatively low. Bilbies are nearing extinction through habitat loss, predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events but scientists found the marsupials were 'breeding well' and had healthy level of stress hormones during the study. The popular Australian icon at Easter is currently listed as endangered in Queensland, with less than 500 of the animals estimated to remain in the wild. The large rabbit like ears Bilbies are nearing extinction from habitat loss, predation by feral animals and unpredictable climatic events . Queensland's Griffith University Professor Jean-Marc Hero told Daily Mail Australia that the results showed captive bilbies had low stress hormone levels. 'The results tell us that they're happy in a captive environment, with unlimited food and water. They are more relaxed and breeding well - doing what we need them to do so we can get them back into the wild. 'But signs of some stress can also be a good thing - it tells us that they're ready for the real world, and help defend themselves, as well as escape from predators in the wild. 'They're a little bit higher in semi-wild captive populations and they're even higher in areas where the bilbies have been re-released in the wild. Professor Hero said the testing process of the droppings is quite simple. 'The technique can be used for any animals, especially those that are difficult to catch,' he said. 'Once we get the poo samples, we then need to dry them out, grind them up, then extract the hormones from the powder before we examine them. Previous researchers had to catch bilbies to test their stress levels, which Professor Hero said had obvious drawbacks, according to ABC. 'The testing process is much easier than catching the animal, as bilbies would show signs of high stress levels, which is expected when you catch an animal,' he said. Bilbies are currently listed as endangered in Queensland, with fewer than 500 of the animals estimated to remain in the wild . Al Mucci, from Dreamworld's bilby breeding program, told ABC it was important that captive bilbies were prepared for life in the bush. 'We want to make sure that we give them a little bit of stress, because out in the wild they are going to be finding their own food and foraging and doing all the things bilbies have to do out in the wild,' he said. 'At the moment we are in breeding mode, so we are building up the captive population because hopefully next year we will be releasing some back into the wild.' Dreamworld's breeding bilbies will be released in a 29 square kilometre 'non-predator exclusive fence' specially designed to keep out feral cats in Currawinya National Park of western Queensland. 'They can breed like rabbits so to speak, so breeding them isn't the issue - the biggest threat to bilbies out in the wild is feral animals, he told ABC. 'It's a crying shame we've allowed this animal to reach such critical numbers.' Dreamworld's breeding bilbies will be released in a 'non-predator exclusive fence' specially designed to keep out feral cats in western Queensland . Professor Hero said wild bilbies had been pushed into extreme desert conditions. 'It certainly looks very grim with the condition of the environment at the moment after two years of good rains and cat populations are very high,' he said. The study has successfully validated a non-invasive tool for monitoring physiological stress in bilbies and will continue to evaluate the success of predator free enclosures and support the survival of the species. 'We can use this powerful tool to measure the condition of animals when we release them back into the wild and will continue to monitor their wild populations,' Professor Hero said. 'Save the Bilby Fund and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy have been a major help to this research and we really want to find more results but we need funds to get there.'","A new technique to measure stress levels by testing Bilby droppings could save them from being extinct, new research has found .

Police were called to a home in Brisbane's west after a large amount of explosives and drug paraphernalia were found . Bomb disposal experts carried out two controlled explosives overnight and will examine the scene to determine the explosives are stable enough to be moved. The street has been blocked off for more than 11 hours to detonate explosives and will continue  searching the property through to 4.30pm Thursday. Nearby residents were warned to remain inside their homes and take precautions. Acting Inspector Mark Bradford told 612 ABC Radio that police then arrived at the scene and found the explosives in a detached shed. 'Sometimes in situations like this the safest method of disposal...is for a controlled detonation to occur,' Acting Inspector Bradford said. 'Throughout the course of today, the scene will be further examined by specialist police and we’ll go from there in terms of what we’ll actually find.

Ms Thomas said she was walking dogs on August 12 but they had ran out of sight when she heard growling. 'Immediately I thought ‘That’s not a plane -- that’s something else,' said Thomas. 'He just started biting me. I’m yelling ‘No! No!’' she said. She described the bear as standing almost seven feet tall on its two hind legs and as having a thick coat of fur. 'I kept thinking he was going to stop,' Thomas said. The trail: Thea Thomas said she has never had any trouble with bears on the Heney Ridge Trail . Thomas said the bear walked away but then turned back moments later. At one point she tried to get up but the bear stopped her. 'He wanted revenge; that’s what he acted like,' Thomas said. In order to protect her head and neck, Thomas went into a fetal position with her right arm over her head. 'He took a pretty darn good chunk out of my right arm, my right leg, my right side,' she said. Once the bear finally calmed down, she tried to escape. 'I’ve just got to start walking,' she thought. She was bitten around seven times and the worst of the damage was on her back and inner thigh and was lucky that the bear didn't get any of her internal organs. Thomas says she feels fine but that her deep wounds will take time to heal and she may eventually get plastic surgery. Taking precaution: 'I will never go into the woods without bear spray, or a horn, or a gun, again,' said Thomas . She also said that she won't be hiking without protection next time and that she’ll think twice about bringing an animal with her. 'I will never go into the woods without bear spray, or a horn, or a gun, again,' she said. Ms Peters, troopers spokeswoman, said: 'The . trooper told me that when she checked herself into the hospital, he . said it was almost like the people who were working on her were more . shocked than she was. 'The trooper said she was very pragmatic and calm about everything.' Thomas was listed as in a stable condition at an Anchorage hospital, where she was transferred after checking in at her local hospital. Hungry: Thea Thomas was attacked by the brown bear hiking on Heney Ridge Trail (file picture) Salmon were actively spawning in a nearby stream as Thomas hiked alone with her dog and a friend's dog, Peters said. The dogs ran off, then returned shortly with the bear running after them. After . the attack, Thomas walked 1 ½ miles back to her truck. She found one of . the dogs while walking back and the other dog was waiting at her . vehicle. After . arriving in the local hospital, Thomas was eventually flown to . Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage, about 150 miles northwest . of Cordova. Troopers said the trail is now closed for a week. There are no plans to look for the bear. The . attack did not appear to be predatory in nature, according to Peters, . who noted the attack was likely prompted by the dogs in an area where . salmon have already begun to die.'The . thought process is that the bear was more than likely being irritated . by the dogs and also protecting its food source,' she said. 'So it was a . bear being a bear.'","Thea Thomas, of Cordova, was attacked by brown bear in Alaska .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . The president of Kentucky State University (KSU) wants his employees to get a raise so badly, he's willing to give up 90,000 of his own salary to make sure they do. Raymond Burse, 63, once was president of KSU from 1982 to 1989 and agreed to return again under one condition: that the school's clerical and maintenance workers get a raise from the federal minimum wage of $7.25 up to $10.10. 'It was something I was in a position to do, and it was something I wanted to do,' Burse told CBS. Giver: Raymond Burse thinks low-paid workers at Kentucky State University deserve a raise, and he's personally willing to give up more than $90,000 to make sure they get one . 'I told the board I was billing to work for less provided that what I gave up would raise employees from $7.25 an hour to $10.10,' he continued. The board agreed to the change and he agreed to act as the school's president. Burse graduated from Harvard Law School and after working at KSU in the 1980s he went on to work for General Electric for 17 years. Now that he's back at the University after retiring in 2012 from his position as corporate officer and general counsel of its appliances and lighting division, he's aimed at helping his staff. 'You can live [on $7.25 an hour], but it's hard living, tough living,' he said. 'It forces individuals to make a choice between some necessities of life and the things they want to do. We want our employees to have a better life. In return, I expect them to make a commitment to the institution and to help us with what we need to do to move education forward at KSU.'

The suspect, identified as Javier Mendiola-Soto, 38, was charged with 21 counts of criminal violation. Mendiola-Soto's alleged lechery came to light after a woman found a tiny camera hidden inside a tampon dispenser in early July, reported FOX. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Suspected Peeping Tom: 38-year-old Javier Mendiola-Soto of Mexico has been arrested and charged with 21 counts of criminal violation of privacy for allegedly filming girl in campus bathrooms . Police say they confiscated 1,500 video files of women using the restroom from Mendiola-Soto. Authorities found recordings from bathrooms in five different buildings, including the Delaware Biotechnology Institute where he was a former employee. Students at the University of Delaware learned about the suspect's X-rated peeping and about the arrest on Friday. 'It’s pretty disturbing knowing that he did it in more than one bathroom and you have to take the time to actually plan all that stuff out is just really scary,' UD Senior Joe Borowski said. 'That's gross. Why would you even want to see someone using the bathroom? That's weird,' said senior Phoebe Connell. Eyes everywhere: Javier Mendiola-Soto allegedly installed the hidden cameras in restrooms in five different building on campus . Mendiola-Soto has had his visa revoked and is being held at Howard Young Correctional facility in Wilmington, Delaware without bail. 'It is extremely disturbing that this crime was perpetrated against our community invading the privacy of so many women on and around this campus,' said University of Delaware President Patrick Harker . 'We are taking this matter extremely seriously, cooperating with the Delaware Attorney General’s office and conducting this investigation with urgency and a deep respect for the privacy of the victims, in coordination with the Middletown Police forensics team,' he continued. The University is offering counselling for students and employees whose privacy was violated, reported the New York Daily News. Police say that there are hundreds of victims and they hope that some of them will testify. Campus security is already planning measures to ensure that a privacy breach such as this one does not happen again. 'It’s very discouraging. This was a really serious crime, not just for the victims and we have several, several victims, but for the University of Delaware community as a whole. You somewhat feel violated that somebody would do something heinous like this,' said the executive director of public and campus safety Skip Homiak.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A popular American cruise line is under scrutiny after refusing to let a Long Island, New York family re-book a $4,000 summer vacation after their son was diagnosed with cancer. Tara and Philip Colucci are outraged with Norwegian Cruise lines after they refused to let them reschedule their June 1st cruise to a later date after their son Nicolas was diagnosed with cancer on May 19. The cruise line has a strict cancellation policy stating that if a cruise is cancelled less than 14 days before the trip that there is a 100 per cent cancellation fee of $4,000. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Policy overboard: Norwegian Cruise Line is refusing to let the Colucci family reschedule their dream vacation after their son Nicolas (second right) was diagnosed with cancer just a day late of the 14 days cancellation policy . On May 19 Nicolas (pictured) was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo surgery and chemotherapy . Family friendly?: Norwegian Cruise Line prides itself on being a family cruise line despite denying the Colucci's request to reschedule the trip for their 5-year-old son with cancer . Nicolas' mother Tara (left) explained their family's tragic situation to the cruise line who simply said that she should have bought travelers insurance . Nicolas, who dreamed of going on his first cruise, is still undergoing half of his chemotherapy treatment and recently had 60 percent of his liver, his gallbladder, diaphragm, and lymph nodes removed and is in no shape to travel. Even when Tara told Norwegian Cruise Line about her situation, she says they gave her little to no sympathy and instead suggested that she get travelers insurance. Tara's husband was shocked to learn the cruise line's response to their family's request. 'I felt that a cruise line that is family-oriented, who caters to families . . . it was a Nickelodeon cruise; I was just astounded,' he told Fox. 'I couldn’t believe that they wouldn’t have helped us out.' Norwegian Cruise Line later issued a statement to Fox & Friends saying, 'Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the Colucci family and we wish Nicolas a speedy recover. . . After reviewing the request of the Colucci family, we spoke with the family and explained that while we couldn’t make an exception to our policy, we would assist them when they were ready to re-book their cruise.' Happy family: Nicolas pictured here with his parents at his younger brother Brody's birthday hopes he will recover soon so he can go on his dream vacation . New found hope: A CEO of another cruise line, who wished to remain anonymous, told Tara that when her son Nicolas is healthy again that she and her family are treated to a free vacation .

Brave: Even though Nicolas in only 5-years-old and has cancer he's made it half-way through his chemotherapy treatment and is looking forward to going on a vacation with his loving family . Tara told Fox that while Norwegian expressed solace in their press statement, they couldn't guarantee her a spot on a future cruise. 'It’s not like our son got the flu or a cold and we couldn’t go,' Tara Colucci told MyFoxNY.'I just never imagined, especially a company as big as Norwegian, that they would be so heartless, basically.'Even though the Colucci family felt as though they were being mistreated by Norwegian Cruise Line, another cruise line stepped up and offered the family a cruise free of Charge. Tara Colucci says she received a personal phone call from the CEO of a mystery cruise line who offered them a free cruise whenever their son is feeling healthy again. Colucci recognized the CEO's kind actions and also told FOX that travellers should always take out travelers insurance and that they should opt out from using Norwegian Cruise Line.","Nicolas Colucci, 5, was diagnosed with cancer on May 19 .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A tow truck owner was arrested on Friday for illegally towing cars of people who participated in Gay Days pride events in Orange County, Florida. Jason P. Combs, 44, is charged on 49 counts of grand theft of a motor vehicle and various charges after being accused of towing more than 100 cars from the Westwood Town Center parking lot across the street from the Doubletree, Hilton is Orlando where the Gay Days events took place. Combs, who owns ASAP towing, didn't have an up-to-date contract to tow vehicles, said police. Jason P. Combs, 44, is charged on 49 counts of grand theft of a motor vehicle for allegedly targeting gay event goers by towing their vehicles . Gay Days is an event that attracts thousands of people to central Florida and encourages gay and lesbian visitors to wear red and meet at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom on the first Saturday in June. The event draws in lots of clientele for local businesses some of which say it's their highest revenue-generating event every year. The Orlando Sentinel reports that Combs' attorney, R. David de Armas, claims that Combs had a contract with the owner and only illegally parks vehicles were towed. Combs' attorney has also said that his client has nothing against homosexuals or the Gay Days event . 'The fact that the [criminal] complaint said something about Gay Days makes me wonder what's behind it,' de Armas said. 'If someone shoplifted during Gay Days would the complaint mention that it happened during Gay Days?' 'This was total predator towing. There's really no other word for it.' Schmeltzer said that a tow truck would hide around the corner awaiting word from the spotters as to which car to tow just minutes after the car's owner went to attend the event. The complaint states that ASAP Towing had a contract with Westwood that expired in May. This is the Westwood Town Center parking lot across the street from the Doubletree, Hilton where the Gay Days event is hosted . Gay Days is an event that attracts thousands of people to central Florida and local businesses benefit substantially . The complaint also said that the people whose cars were towed were forced to take a cab to the towing company, pay $165 to get their car back, and also pay a $40 gate fee which 'isn't permitted under Florida law.' The complaint explains that ASAP Towing renewed their contract in mid-June after Gay Days implying that they knew they didn't have a valid contract during the event. 'This is further evidence that Jason Combs knew he had no contract in place and was not authorized to tow vehicles from Westwood Town Center,' the complaint said. Police say that Combs further broke the law because they towed the cars 10-miles-away to their Belle Isle location. 'He's one of those [business owners] that wants to pick and choose what [laws] he's going to follow,' Schmeltzer said. Victims say that they felt employees were rude to them and that they felt 'bullied' because of their sexuality. The Orlando Sentinel reports that the president of the Gay Days event Chris Alexander-Manley believes that Combs should be 'prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,' if the allegations are true. 'Definitely it will take hearing more of the story,' he said before accusing Combs of a hate crime. Attendees of the Day Days event (pictured) felt as though they were bullied by Combs and his employees when they went to pick up their cars .","Tow truck company owner Jason P.

An anonymous donor helped Jim Farrell, 97, find a new home after being thrown out by Redwood Retirement Center with no place to go but the homeless shelter. 'Management continually suppressed my talents,' said Farrell to KPIX 5. Jim Farrell, 97, loves the ukulele but says it's his playing that got him kicked out of his Napa retirement community . Farrell was forced to leave Redwood Retirement and he says it's because he played the ukulele too much . Farrell told reporters he had some problems with the bosses at the retirement home because they tried to get him to stop playing his ukulele. 'Management would stop me and say these words: ""Go back to your room!"" Like a kid,' said Farrell.Farrell's caretaker Carol Eldridge, who was once an employee at Redwood Retirement, found out that Farrell was being evicted a few weeks ago. She says he told her, 'I'm not sure my heart can take this.' Eldridge is angered that the retirement home evicted Farrell without giving him other options.'You just don’t put a 97-year-old on the street,' she said.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and Associated Press . A mother from Phoenix who left her two boys in a hot car while she went to a job interview says it was  'a moment of desperation'. Shanesha Taylor, 35, avoided prosecution on Friday after agreeing to set aside funds for her children's education and completing parenting programs. She went on the Today Show with Matt Lauer today and spoke about what lead her to make the difficult decision to leave her 6-month-old and 2-month-old sons in a sweltering car while she went to the interview. 'It was a moment of desperation,' she said after revealing she was in dire financial straits and felt this interview would be crucial in providing for her children down the line. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Made a difficult choice: Shanesa Taylor said that she left her children in a hot car in a 'moment of desperation' due to her dire financial straits . 'It was me knowing my family was in . crisis and knowing that I had to make a choice between providing for my . children or caring for my children.' Taylor tells Lauer that she had a sitter lined up but that the babysitter cancelled last minute. 'Flaked on me, is the best way to say it, ‘said Taylor. Despite receiving criticism for leaving her children in a car, many hearts went out to Taylor who felt bad for her impoverished situation. After seeing media coverage of Taylor's case, a sympathetic woman from New Jersey helped to start a campaign to collect money for Taylor and her family and managed to raise almost $115,000 which Taylor will put in a trust fund for her children's education. Taylor couldn't feel more blessed about the deal. 'I think I’ve been treated fairly. The type of resolution I had not many people get so I think it’s an excellent job they did,' she said. Today asked viewers in an online poll whether or not they were sympathetic to Taylor’s story. The poll found that a majority of 58 per cent of viewers felt for the mother of two.Prosecutors and a Phoenix woman reached a deal on Friday that would allow her to avoid prosecution for leaving her two young sons alone in a hot car while she was at a job interview. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said his office and 35-year-old Shanesha Taylor have an agreement under which he'll dismiss two felony child abuse charges against her if she meets several conditions. Those include completing parenting and substance abuse treatment programs and establishing education and child care trust funds for her children. In tears: Shanesha Taylor, 35, (pictured in her police mugshot) has reached a deal with prosecutors today to dismiss felony child abuse charges against her if she completes parenting and substance abuse treatment programs . Authorities arrested Taylor after bystanders in Scottsdale reported seeing her two sons alone in her car in March. Taylor told police that she wasn't able to find a babysitter for the boys, who were 2 years and 6 months old at the time. A witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV exceeded 100 degrees. According to court documents, firefighters found the vehicle's windows rolled down an inch and no running air conditioning to keep the children cool. Trying her best: Authorities arrested Taylor after bystanders in Scottsdale reported seeing her two sons alone in her car in March . 100F: Police claim the keys were in the ignition but the air conditioning was off, so the fan was blowing hot air . Montgomery called the agreement a 'just resolution' that holds Taylor accountable while serving the best interests of her family. Taylor, who previously pleaded not guilty to the charges, appeared in court on Friday for what had been scheduled as a settlement conference. Judge Joseph Welty of Maricopa County Superior Court accepted the agreement but warned Taylor that it included an admission that she had endangered her children. That admission could be used against her if the case ends up being prosecuted in the future, the judge said. Taylor, who spoke little during the proceeding, acknowledged she understood what the judge said. In May, a court commissioner granted her visits with both children under the supervision of a Child Protective Services worker. She has been able to maintain steady visits since then, Taylor's defense lawyer Benjamin Taylor said. The two are not related. Shanesha Taylor has used some of the money to secure a new place to live, her lawyer said.","Shanesha Taylor, 35, went on the Today .

WTSP reports that so far in Florida there have been 82 reported cases of chikungunya . 'To prevent chikungunya, it is vital that Floridians and visitors continue to avoid mosquito bites' said Dr. Jennifer Bencie, DOH-Manatee Administrator.

Market Basket supermarket employees and supporters hold a rally Friday to back ousted former CEO Arthur T. Demoulas . A decades-long family feud, which brought about the ouster of Arthur T.

A . workers' revolt at the Market Basket supermarket chain has led to empty . shelves, angry customers and support for a boycott from more than 100 . state legislators and mayors. Industry . analysts say worker revolts at non-union companies are rare, but what's . happening at Market Basket is particularly unusual because the workers . are not asking for higher pay or better benefits. They are demanding the . reinstatement of beloved former CEO Arthur T. Demoulas, whom they . credit with keeping prices low, treating them well and guiding the . company's success. The New England grocery store chain is embroiled in a family feud featuring two cousins who have been at odds for decades. While . earlier squabbles between Arthur T. Demoulas and Arthur S. Demoulas . were fought in courtrooms, this dispute has spilled into the stores. Cashiers and baggers sit idle at the Market Basket supermarket chain . For . the past week, warehouse workers have refused to make deliveries to . Market Basket stores, leaving fruit, vegetable, seafood and meat shelves . empty. Workers have held protest rallies and organized boycott . petitions through social media, attracting thousands of supporters. Customers . are switching to other grocery stores. In some cases, customers have . taped receipts from competitors to Market Basket windows. 'We . are going to go somewhere else from now on,' said Soraya DeBarros, as . she walked through a depleted produce department at the Market Basket in . West Bridgewater this week. 'I'm sad about it because of course I want . to keep the low prices, but I want to support the workers.'

The . new executives have assured workers they are not planning drastic . changes in the way the company is operated and have urged them to return . to work. On Friday, the company again . appealed to workers to return, saying they won't be punished or face any . change in compensation and benefits. 'We welcome back associates who are committed to Market Basket's customers,' it said in a statement. Massachusetts . Attorney General Martha Coakley, who is running for governor, and New .

Basket stores have long been a fixture in Massachusetts. The late . Arthur Demoulas - grandfather of Arthur S. and Arthur T. and a Greek . immigrant - opened the first store in Lowell nearly a century ago. Gradually, Market Basket became a regional powerhouse, with 25,000 . employees and 71 stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. Workers are fiercely loyal to Arthur T. 'You . know the movie, `It's a Wonderful Life.' He's George Bailey,' said Tom . Trainor, a district supervisor who worked for the company for 41 years . before being fired last weekend over the protests. 'He's just a . tremendous human being that puts people above profits. He can walk . through a store, and if he's met you once, he knows your name, he knows . your wife, your husband, your kids, where they are going to school.' Meat manager Dave Fillebrown wipes down largely empty shelves at a Market Basket supermarket in Haverhill, Mass. Earlier Friday, board members said they will consider an offer Arthur T. made this week to buy the company. 'Consistent . with its fiduciary obligations, the board will evaluate and seriously . consider this proposal, along with any other offers previously received . and to be received,' the board said. The board also decried what it called the 'negative behavior' of some current and former employees. 'It . is now clear that it is in the interests of all members of the Market . Basket community for normal business operations to resume immediately,' it said. As the board met, up to 10,000 . employees, customers and supporters attended another protest rally at a . Market Basket store in Tewksbury. Employees . said they believe the fight between the family members loyal to Arthur . T and Arthur S is largely over money and the direction of the company. They say Arthur S and his supporters have pressed for a greater return . to shareholders. Arthur T and his supporters have focused on keeping prices low. Many . employees are distrustful of Arthur S and two co-chief executives who . were brought in from outside the company: Felicia Thornton, a former . executive of the grocery chain Albertsons, and Jim Gooch, former . president and chief executive at RadioShack Corp. Arthur S. has not spoken publicly about his ouster or the striking workers supporting him . The company statement Friday acknowledged 'the strain this change of leadership has placed on our associates.' Valerie Burke, a worker in the West Bridgewater store, said she's worried about her job. 'It's . a great company to work for now, but we are worried it won't stay that . way,' she said as she picketed outside the store Tuesday. Arthur S. has not spoken publicly, except a short response to 7 News when he said he wouldn't consider selling until he had seen his cousin's offer. Gooch and Thornton have communicated only through prepared statements. Steve . Paulenka, who started in 1974 as a bag boy and rose to facilities and . operations manager before being fired last weekend, said he sees no end . to protests unless Arthur T. is reinstated. 'A . big part of me doesn't like what's going on - it's like breaking your . favorite toy on purpose,' he said. 'But we'll get through this.'","Market Basket workers must return to work on Monday .

A 20-year-old man was arrested at John Wayne Airport in Irvine, California after he tried to board a Delta Airlines flight to Turkey with a fake passport so he could allegedly go to Syria to join the terrorist group ISIS, reports federal court documents. On July 2,  Adam Dandach, who also goes by the name Fadi Fadi Dandach, was stopped by FBI's Orange County Joint Terrorism Task Force just as he was about to board a plane to Istambul to allegedly pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or Isis, rebels, reports NBC. Adam Dandach is scheduled to be arraigned in a federal Santa Ana, California court on Monday. Adam Dandach allegedly tried to board a plane (not pictured) from John Wayne Airport in Irvine, California to Istambul, Turkey so that he could allegedly join the terrorist group ISIS . ISIS is an al-Qaida group overseeing Sunni militants in Iraq. 'What this man in Orange County was attempting to do is probably one the paramount security threats to the country,' said Adam Schiff, a member of the House Intelligence Committee. 'Americans and Europeans going to Syria, joining the fight, becoming radicalized, learning how to build bombs. And then coming back to try and attack targets here at home,' he continued. Federal court papers state that Dandach told law enforcement that, 'he was traveling to Syria for the purpose of pledging his alliance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, a known terrorist organization, that he would assist ISIS with anything that ISIS asked him to do, and that he believed the killings of U.S. soldiers are justified killings.' Dandach applied for a passport in June and told officials he accidentally threw his passport in the trash while he was cleaning. Authorities say that Dandach's mother allegedly hid his original passport in a closet so that he wouldn't fly to the middle east back in December. O.C. Weekly, who originally reported the story, explains that it's a felony to falsify a passport application and to obtain one by lying.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Alexandra Klausner . and James Nye . An ex-Marine has been charged in the brutal murder of a young Long Island mother whose raped, stabbed and beaten body was found last month in the woods after she had gone missing. Dante Taylor, 19, was picked up Friday by U.S. Marshals and Suffolk County Police on an unrelated warrant for first-degree rape and charged in the killing of 21-year-old Sarah Goode. Authorities are not sure how the two met, but sources told WABC they may have met at a house party only days before Goode went missing and Taylor went on the run. They may have met at a party: Dante Taylor (left) has been charged in the killing of Sarah Goode (right) Taylor was found by authorities in Vero Beach, Florida and taken back to Long Island for his Saturday morning arraignment. Prosecutors told the courtroom that Taylor raped and savagely stabbed and beat the woman to death - a piece of metal was found in her skull and her car was covered in blood. Dozens of Goode's relatives cried in the courtroom while hearing the details of the killing, and some had to be physically restrained and removed from the chamber, News 12 reported. It was the first time they found out how Goode died. 'Hope you burn in hell,' Nick Giannetto, Goode's brother-in-law, shouted at the accused killer before being taken out of the courtroom, according to Newsday. Taylor's bloody palm print was found on the car and his semen was found on the tortured and killed woman, the prosecutor said. He was also linked to the crime through CPS tracking on his cell phone, and phone records showing the pair exchanged multiple phone calls the night she went missing, Newsday reported. Perp walk: Taylor is led from a holding cell to the bus that took him to his Saturday morning arraignment . Shaken: Family members openly cried as the details of Goode's rape, stabbing and beating were read aloud in court . Taylor was also charged during the same hearing with the attempted rape at knifepoint of another woman back in 2011 - he was only 16 when that crime happened. That victim was fortunate enough to escape. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. It has also been revealed that Taylor joined the Marine Corps on September 23 or last year only to see the 'end of his active service' on April 22, according to Newsday. A military spokesperson declined to discuss the circumstances surrounding the end of Taylor's time in uniform. A friend of Goode's who also once had a romantic relationship with Taylor called him a 'violent person' and said 'he just wasn't normal. We were scared of what he might do because of his temper.' The shocking details come almost one month after Goode, mother to a four-year-old daughter, vanished after spending a night out with friends. Her partially decomposed body was discovered about a week later after an intense search effort involving police, family and dozens of volunteers. Police first found Goode's 1999 BMW parked a mile away from her house on Fire Avenue near new London Avenue in Medford. Where she was found: The woods where police found Goode's remains, less than a mile from her bloody car . The car showed obvious signs of a struggle, investigators said. Detectives found Goode's body within a mile of where her car was found earlier this week, nearly a mile from her home. Family and friends had been leading the search for Goode and called the situation a 'nightmare.' 'I feel horrible for them and her 4-year-old daughter,' said family member Joseph Miller to PIX11.  'She loved her daughter so much, I know that.' Goode worked as a medical technician and lived with her mother and her daughter.

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency released more than 600 criminal aliens into the U.S. amid a budget shortfall in 2013, an audit of the department released today revealed. The year-long investigation found that ICE released 2,226 illegal immigrants in February 2013 just before the sequestration went into effect in an effort to cut costs. On the weekend of February 23 alone, the inspector general report says ICE released 1,450 illegal immigrants. Conservative news website The Daily Signal, which first obtained the audit, reports that 617 of the aliens released were criminals whose detention was mandatory. The surge of Central Americans illegally entering the country throughout the last two years has overwhelmed Immigration Customs and Enforcement officials. An audit of ICE found that it released 2,226 detainees, including 617 criminals, last year in the face of a budget shortfall . The Houston and Phoenix areas saw the largest number of criminals releases, while the largest total number of immigrant releases occurred in the Phoenix and San Diego areas . The Houston and Phoenix areas saw the largest number of criminals releases, while the largest total number of immigrant releases occurred in the Phoenix and San Diego areas. Immigration officials 'did not release aliens they considered a danger to the community,' however, the audit states. While ICE initially told Congress that the releases were tied to budget cuts caused by the sequestration the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General says the agency was already facing a $90 million budget shortfall. 'ICE did not anticipate the potential consequences of its decision to release 1,450 immigration detainees over one weekend,' the watchdog agency's report states. 'As a result, ICE was unprepared to respond to congressional inquiries about the detainee releases and provided incorrect data.' According to the report, ICE secretly ran into financial trouble after the U.S. border with Mexico began being inundated by Central American immigrants. Between fiscal year 2011 and 2012 the . number of illegal immigrants captured in the Rio Grande Valley area of . Texas rose by 66 percent, the report states. 'ICE executive leadership did not plan adequately for increased Border Patrol apprehensions on the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley,' the audit found. Compounding the issue is that the same area saw a 139 . percent increase in non-Mexican arrivals. Non-Mexican immigrants take longer for ICE to process because they must have certain travel documents and have to be flown home. Mexican immigrants can be immediately deported and bused home. Congress requires ICE to be able to hold 34,000 immigrants at all times, but only provides funding for 31,300 detainees, or beds, as immigration officials say. The rest of ICE's funding comes from other, less reliable means, the report explains. 'This funding structure leaves ICE with inadequate resources when there is an increase in detainees,' it said, noting in its recommendations that ICE needs to request of Congress funding for the total amount of beds it needs. The IG audit state that each bed costs ICE $122 a day, or $4.15 million a day or 34,000 detainees. If ICE maintains the bare minimum detainee population at its facilities, that makes for a grand total of $1.5 billion a year. Deporting non-Mexican illegal immigrants takes longer, causing pile ups at ICE detention centers . The influx of illegal immigrants put ICE over its legally required capacity at 35,610 beds at the beginning of 2013, causing a budget shortfall just as additional budget cuts from sequestration were scheduled to kick in. ICE had intended to meet its budgetary obligations by releasing even more illegal immigrants and reducing it's number of detainees to 25,700, but Congress informed the agency of the 34,000 requirement. The Office of Inspector General says that ICE then asked the Office of Management and Budget for $22 million in additional funding, but before it could make a final decision ICE secretly released the 2,226 illegal immigrants without permission from its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security. Because ICE's 'detention population included few . detainees whose detention was not mandatory and who did not have . criminal convictions,' many criminals were included in the release, the Inspector General audit released today found. Other non-criminals 'were not suitable for release' the report said. 'This . caseload included national security and extradition cases, aliens . awaiting sentencing in criminal cases, and aliens already scheduled for . removal' After the initial release, ICE reportedly redetained 54 aliens but did not say why. The Associated Press first reported the massive discharge of detainees in early March, a charge that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano denied, claiming that hundreds, not thousands, of aliens were released. Later that month, ICE director John Morton publicly admitted that the number did run in the thousands. 'We were trying to live within the budget that Congress had provided us,' he told Congress. 'This was not a White House call. I take full responsibility.'","A year long investigation of Immigration and Customs Enforcement found the agency released 2,226 illegal immigrants in an effort to cut costs .

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest had a quote from President Barack Obama about ISIS being 'jayvee' level terrorists thrown back in his face by a reporter today, hours after the U.S. launched air strikes on the Islamic militants in Iraq. Speaking about ISIS to The New Yorker in January, Obama said: 'The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, . is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe . Bryant.' Asked today by CNN reporter Jim Acosta if the president still thinks ISIS is an amateur terrorist group, Earnest dribbled around the question before claiming that the White House does 'remain concerned about the military proficiency that's been demonstrated' by Islamic militants in Iraq. Scroll down for video . 'Is it safe to say that ISIS - they're no longer the jayvees': White House spokesman Josh Earnest had the president's brassy comment that ISIS was the equivalent of a jayvee basketball team thrown back in his face today . This handout image released by the US Navy shows sailors launching aircrafts from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush. Two US F/A-18 aircraft dropped 500-pound laser-guided bombs on mobile artillery belonging to the jihadist group near Erbil today . This image, posted to twitter, depicts ISIS extremists lining up followers of the Yadizi religion for execution . 'There is no question that . the Laker uniforms that were worn - . . . to draw out that analogy a . little bit - that were worn by the Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan . has been decimated and defeated in Afghanistan,' Earnest said. 'There's no question about that,' he added. Earnest said it 'also true' that there are other terrorist networks that 'subscribe to the violent extremist ideology that's espoused and promulgated by Al Qaeda.' 'Many of those groups, in nations across the globe, are not particularly sophisticated, are focused on local sectarian conflicts that don't pose a significant or immediate threat to U.S. interests or the U.S. homeland.' 'There are of course a couple other organizations that do pose a more substantial threat to the United States and our interests,' he continued. Among those, he admitted, are the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, also known as ISIL, a militant group that was expelled from the Al Qaeda because of its ultra violent practices. 'We do remain concerned about the military proficiency that's been demonstrated by ISIL, and it's why you've seen the president take steps, including the authorization of military force that would protect American citizens who might be harmed by ISIL,' Earnest said. The statement was a near 180 degree turn about from the president's earlier claim that ISIS wasn't a terrorist group worth taking seriously. Since then ISIS has barreled through Iraq, destroying towns and murdering civilians. Since the extremists began its rampage they have taken over 17 towns, including the city of Mosul. Most recently the Islamists took control of the dam there - Iraq's largest - giving it control over a significant amount of water and electricity. As many as 200,000 religious minorities have fled from their homes in recent days to the mountains or refugee camps in the nearby town of Erbil, the capitol of the independent region of Kurdistan, after ISIS threatened them with death if they did not convert to Islam. More than 40,000 followers of the Yadizi religion escaped to Mount Sinjar, where they remained hidden away for several days without food or water until the U.S. air dropped supplies last night. The U.S. also dropped two 500-pound bombs on ISIS artillery stockpiles just outside of Erbil in an effort to stop the humanitarian crisis from turning into 'genocide.' 'For anyone who needs a wake up call, this is it,' Secretary of State John Kerry said this morning.","Obama insinuated in January that he didn't take ISIS seriously .

"By . Ben Spencer . A rare butterfly has been spotted in Britain for the first time in 60 years, having migrated from Eastern Europe. The only previous record of a wild Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell in Britain was in 1953, when it was seen just once in Sevenoaks, Kent. In the past week there have already been four confirmed sightings, along the East coast in Norfolk, Suffolk and Kent, and six further reports of the butterfly in coastal areas stretching as far north as Lincolnshire. Conservationists are very excited about the sightings, which are as rare an occurrence as anything in the butterfly world. There have been four confirmed sightings of a Yellow-legged tortoiseshell butterfly on the east coast this week and another six possible sightings as far north as Lincolnshire . Richard Fox, of the Butterfly Conservation charity, said: ‘The Yellow-legged Tortoiseshell usually is seen in Eastern Europe - we have only one recorded sighting in this country before now, and that was in 1953. ‘So to have up to ten sightings in a week is incredibly exciting.’ The butterflies are thought to have flown on easterly winds across Europe in the last few weeks. Mr Fox said: ‘We were tipped off by colleagues in Netherlands that they had seen about 40 of these butterflies, the first time they had ever been seen in their country before. ‘When they reached the Dutch coast they told us to keep an eye out for them coming over.’ The large and colourful insect has a territory stretching from from Eastern Europe to Japan. In recent years it has spread into Scandinavia and thrives during warm weather. Also known as the Scarce Tortoiseshell, it has an orange and blue colour, measuring just over two inches (6cm) from wing-tip to wing-tip, and is about one third bigger than our own Small Tortoiseshell. Sir David Attenborough, President of the Butterfly Conservation, is this week promoting the Big Butterfly Count . Butterfly Conservation is this weekend launching its annual Big Butterfly Count, a yearly survey of the butterflies across the nation. It has been a terrific summer for butterflies so far, and the charity is hoping to record sightings of 1 million butterflies in the next three weeks. Sir David Attenborough, president of the charity, said: ‘The UK is a nation of amateur naturalists and we have a proud tradition of celebrating and studying our wildlife. ‘By taking part in the Big Butterfly Count this summer you can contribute to this heritage and discover the fantastic butterflies and other wildlife that share your garden, parks and countryside. ‘The spectacle of Red Admirals and Small Tortoiseshells flitting around buddleia bushes is one of the classic sights of British summertime. ‘Butterflies fought back last year after a terrible 2012 but despite this, butterfly numbers were still below average. Three-quarters of the UK’s butterflies are in decline and one-third are in danger of extinction. ‘This is bad news for butterflies and it is bad news for the UK’s birds, bees, bats and other wildlife. This is because butterflies are a key indicator species of the health of our environment – if they are struggling, then many other species are struggling also.’ Taking place in the Butterfly Count is simple - to participate, find a sunny spot and spend 15 minutes counting every butterfly seen.

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer awkwardly told a room full of Africans yesterday that he doesn't actually 'whip' his colleagues. In an attempt to make a joke about his job title at the top of his remarks Wednesday at a U.S.- Africa Leaders Summit event Hoyer, a Democrat, said: 'First of all, let me tell my friends from Africa, I do not whip people! 'And if you’ve watched House of Cards, it is not accurate!' he added. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, pictured here at a press conference in Washington last week, joked to African leaders yesterday that he doesn't actually whip his colleages . In the political thriller House of Cards the main character, Frank Underwood, serves as the Democratic Whip in the House of Representatives before scheming his way into the Vice Presidency. Both Republicans and Democrats in the House have whips who are elected by members of their party at the start of every legislative session. The whip's job is to convince colleagues on his or her side of the aisle to vote for legislation backed by party leadership. The whip is the second highest ranking member of the party that is not in power and the third highest ranking member of the party that controls the House after the Speaker and the Majority Leader. While there's no doubt Hoyer's audience understood his joke about being his party's whip, attendees were likely not as familiar with the plot line of House of Cards, as the show is only available on internet streaming website Netflix. As the Daily Caller pointed out, relatively few Africans have working electricity - let alone broadband internet - a fact that Hoyer pointed out in his speech. 'Right now, there are 600 million sub-Saharan Africans living without reliable access to electricity.  That’s 70% of the population – and a significant barrier to growing Africa’s middle class,' Hoyer stated. As a result, the U.S. has been coordinating public and private investments into a program called Power Africa which benefits Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania, he explained. Yesterday marked the final day of the White House's first-ever summit with African leaders. The theme of the three day conference was 'Investing in the Next Generation.' The event Hoyer spoke at was a side event organized by the Congressional Black Caucus.","'First of all, let me tell my friends from Africa, I do not whip people!' he said .

"By . Ben Spencer . People decide how trustworthy strangers are within the blink of an eye, psychologists have found, and it is all down to the shape of their face. We tend to judge someone with high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones to be more honest, while we are less likely to trust someone with a furrowed brow and sunken cheeks, researchers suggest. The findings give new weight to the principle that first impressions count. Scroll down for video . Russian spy Anna Chapman (left)  has eyebrows rather close to her eyes while Fiona Bruce (right) is blessed with higher eyebrows and cheekbones . There is no evidence, however, that facial features demonstrate how honest someone really is– simply that they may be perceived to be trustworthy or untrustworthy depending on their looks. Psychologists from New York University found that a section of the brain decides a person’s trustworthiness even before we have consciously perceived who they are. The brain takes just 33 milliseconds - three hundredths of a second, or a tenth of a time it takes to blink - to decide whether someone is to be trusted. The study, published last night  in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggests that our brains are set up to be instantly wary of people we decided we should not trust. Jonathan Freeman, assistant professor at New York University’s Department of Psychology, said: ‘Our findings suggest that the brain automatically responds to a face’s trustworthiness before it is even consciously perceived. ‘The results are consistent with an extensive body of research suggesting that we form spontaneous judgments of other people that can be largely outside awareness.’ Applying the findings to public figures, the Mail found that trusted individuals such as newsreader Fiona Bruce and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby indeed have high cheekbones and eyebrows. Former US president Richard Nixon (left)  former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (right) have sunken cheeks . Former MP Chris Huhne (left) has furrowed brows while trusted individuals such as Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (right) have high cheekbones and eyebrows . Conversely, public figures who have been roundly condemned for their dishonesty – including lying MPs Jonathan Aitken and Chris Huhne – have sunken cheeks and furrowed brows. The New York research team presented a panel of ten volunteers with 300 computer generated faces, and asked them how trustworthy each was. Those faces with high cheekbones, high eyebrows and a smile were perceived to be the most honest. The scientists also presented the panel with real pictures of strangers, and the same facial attributes were found to be deemed as trustworthy. In a second set of experiments, a new set of 37 volunteers were presented with the ‘trustworthy’ and ‘untrustworthy’ images for a split second, while their brain activity was monitored. The images were then immediately replaced with a neutral picture so the brain could no longer process the previous image. The scientists found that a region of the brain called the amygdala, which is vital in social and emotional behaviour, activated within 33 milliseconds even when the images were flashed up just momentarily. Actress and human rights activist Angelina Jolie (left) has high cheekbones, as does Jeremy Paxman (right) Faces with the high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones prompted activity in a different part of the amygdala than faces with furrowed brows and sunken cheeks. Dr Freeman said: ‘The findings suggest that we can assess another person’s trustworthiness from their face extremely rapidly and without conscious awareness, and that the amygdala plays an important role in this process. ‘One possibility is that faces that appear more untrustworthy and likely to inflict harm, or faces with stronger trustworthiness cues in general, are spontaneously tracked by the amygdala, so the amygdala could then quickly alter other brain processes and coordinate fast, appropriate responses to people --- approach or avoid. ‘This tracking would be especially pronounced for untrustworthy faces, who might inflict harm, which is consistent with what we found.’ Dr Bessam Farjo, a British cosmetic surgeon who specialises in hair transplants, including eyebrows, said: ‘The study’s findings are fascinating and further emphasises that we do make first assumptions which are not necessarily based on our experiences or what information we have been exposed to.'","New York psychologists  found people judge trustworthiness on features .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Tania Steere . Tesco was last night accused of undermining farmers by promoting foreign lamb during the peak British season. The supermarket chain currently has an offer on New Zealand lamb. But furious sheep farmers say British lamb is now at its best and most abundant – so there is no need to stock foreign lamb at all, let alone cut prices. The National Farmers Union accused Tesco boss Philip Clarke of breaking a promise made less than 18 months ago, at the height of the horsemeat scandal, to sell as much home-grown meat as possible. The New Zealand lamb offer has led the National Farmers' Union to accuse Tesco boss Philip Clarke, pictured, of breaking a promise to sell as much homemade meat as possible . Last night Tesco was selling two 300g packs of New Zealand lamb chops for £6 – a saving of around 30 per cent. New Zealand leg steaks were also on offer, with a 270g pack usually priced £4 available at two for £7 or three for £10. However, at the Tesco store the Mail visited, British lamb was available only in the premium Finest range. NFU President Meurig Raymond said: ‘Our members are upset and quite angry that when their product is at its very best, and at its most abundant, Tesco is actively marketing foreign produce. British lamb can never be better than it is in July. There is no reason at the moment to price-promote lamb from the other side of the world.’ The Government has been trying to persuade consumers and retailers to buy fewer imports and more home-grown food – both in order to support agriculture and to end our reliance on unreliable foreign supply chains. We import 40 per cent of our food, and then Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told a farming conference in January: ‘As British farmers and food producers you know that we grow some of the best food in the world here. It is up to all of us – farmers, food manufacturers and the Government – to take action.’ UK farmers export 100,000 tons of lamb a year – more than a third of the total they produce – mostly to Europe where it is seen as a premium product. Yet retailers import 100,000 tons, mostly from New Zealand. Mr Raymond said he was not against imported lamb but saw no reason to promote foreign lamb at a time when the British product was at its best . In the winter months, New Zealand lamb is generally seen as a better product because the meat comes from younger animals. In spring and summer, however, farmers see no reason to import meat. Mr Raymond said: ‘I am not against imports – consumers need choice and at certain points of the year we can see that personal taste might mean that retailers prefer to stock other products. But when our lamb is at its best, we can see no reason to promote foreign lamb above our own.’ A Tesco spokesman said the supermarket plans a half-price promotion on British lamb soon – but could not give a start date. ‘We sell more British lamb than any other retailer, and we are proud to sell and promote British lamb to our millions of customers right across the UK,’ he said. ‘We know it is a great product and we want to ensure that we sell it in large volumes when it is at the peak of its season. ‘This season we expect to sell more British lamb than ever before and over the next few weeks we are running fantastic half-price promotions on British lamb in our stores. ‘We are delivering on our commitment to strengthen our relationships with British sheep farmers through our Tesco Sustainable Lamb Group, which currently supports around 200 farmers. We are proud of our work together to bring great quality, affordable British lamb to our customers.’","Tesco accused of undermining British farmers by promoting foreign lamb .

"By . Ben Spencer . If you are heading for the coast this summer - keep an eye out for jellyfish. Billions of the billowing creatures are swimming in our seas in what scientists say is an exceptional year for the animals. A new study by the Marine Conservation Society and the University of Exeter found that last year saw record numbers of jellyfish. This year is likely to be just as good, according to data collected by volunteers across the country. Scroll down for video . A study by the Marine Conservation Society and University of Exeter found record numbers of jellyfish in British waters last year and this year is expected to be the same. Pictured: A jellyfish spotted at St Mawes, Cornwall . The new report, published in the Journal of the Marine Biological Association, also maps concentrations of jellyfish by species and location for the first time in 40 years, using data collected over the last decade. It finds that numbers are particularly high off the coasts of Cornwall, Devon and south Wales, especially for species such as the spectacular four-foot long barrel jellyfish. Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for the MCS, said: ‘In parts of the South West it is absolute jellyfish soup right now. ‘We are experiencing a real jellyfish boom.’ The survey found that only three of the five most common jellyfish sting humans, but Dr Richardson said there are other important impacts to consider. In recent years vast influxes of the creatures have been known to wipe out salmon farms, and in 2011 they forced Torness power station in Scotland to close after they clogged up its machinery. Dr Richardson added: ‘We can’t afford to ignore the costs to the environment of an increase in jelly-fish.’ ‘It can affect tourism, it can affect power generation, it can affect fishing. That is why we have started this process of mapping hot spots of jellyfish, when and where they appear.’ Known as the ‘barometer of the seas’, the animals are incredibly sensitive to changes in temperature, pollution and predators. But scientists are divided as to the conditions that cause increase in populations. In some years hot weather can cause a fluctuation of jellyfish, but in others it does not. Some think that tides and winds have an impact, with water funnelled up into the Celtic and Irish Seas, drawing billions of animals into British waters. Prof Brendan Godley of the University of Exeter said: ‘The remarkable number of barrel jellyfish re-ported from South West England this year is quite unusual. ‘We’re not sure why, but the very mild winter probably meant more adults survived at depth, which will have returned to the surface in spring as waters warmed up. ‘This year’s strange barrel jellyfish results highlight the importance of running the survey year in and year out to track these unusual events and discover if they turn into trends.’ Last year proved a record year when 1,133 reports of jellyfish were received around the country. This year already 500 reports already received by mid-July, only halfway through summer months when most records are received. The moon jellyfish, a transparent . umbrella-shaped species, was the most frequently-spotted species around . the UK coast, as well as being the most widely-distributed. This huge barrel jellyfish was found washed up on a beach in Portland, Dorset earlier this year . Other common sightings were for compass, lion’s mane, blue and barrel jellyfish. The other species are the mauve stinger, Portuguese Man of War and the by-the-wind sailor, which are sporadic visitors to British coasts. Dr Richardson added: ‘We still know relatively little about jellyfish, but given the economic impacts that large numbers of jellyfish can have on tourism, fishing, aquaculture and even power generation, we can’t afford to ignore them.’ Prof Godley said: ‘By taking stock of our jellyfish in this way, we provide an important baseline of in-formation which will help us understand how jellyfish species react to environmental changes that influence our coastal seas, including climate change.’","Record number of jellyfish recorded in British waters last year, study found .

"By . Ben Spencer . A new study has found the time of day a person takes their medication could have a dramatic impact on its potency . The time of day that we take a medicine could have a dramatic impact on its potency, new research suggests. A British study has determined for the first time how the chemistry of our blood stream changes throughout the day. Scientists at the University of Surrey and the Institute of Cancer Research in London have shown that the body clock has a profound role in altering the concentration of different molecules in our blood. The finding means that the amount of sleep we have had, the levels of light to which we are exposed and the timing of our meals could all alter on the way drugs work on our body. It also suggests that blood tests for diseases may produce different results depending on the time of day. Nearly all living things have an internal mechanism - known as the circadian rhythm or body clock - which synchronises bodily functions to the 24-hour pattern of the Earth’s rotation. In humans and other mammals, the clock is regulated by the bodily senses, most importantly the way the eye perceives light and dark and the way skin feels temperature changes. The mechanism rules our daily rhythms, including our sleep and waking patterns. The new study, published in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to establish the way the body clock also affects our metabolism. Professor Debra Skene from the University of Surrey, said: ‘Our results show that if we want to develop a diagnostic test for a disease, it is imperative to take the time of day when taking blood samples into account, since this has a significant effect on metabolism. ‘This is also key for administering medicines and determining when they will be at their most effective. ‘Of course, this will have to be considered on a case-by-case basis, since many people such as shift workers will have a different sleep/wake cycle and timings will need to be adapted to their body clocks.’ She said more research is needed on which drugs are particularly effected, but previous work has shown that the efficacy of certain treatments for diabetes, cancer and liver cirrhosis are altered by the time they are administered. Professor Skene added: ‘There is good evidence - for example in chemotherapy - that administering drugs at an optimal time increases its effectiveness and reduces the incidence of side effects.’ Scientists found the amount of sleep a person gets, the level of light they are exposed to and the timing of their meals could all alter the way drugs affect our bodies . The metabolism of a group of healthy male volunteers was tracked for 48 hours as their access to light, sleep and meals was controlled. For the first 24 hours, the volunteers were put through a normal wake-sleep cycle. This was followed by 24 hours when they were deprived of all sleep. The researchers found that 27 different chemicals in the blood were found at higher levels while the men were sleep deprived. Dr Florence Raynaud, who co-authored the paper, said: ‘Our findings are likely to be important in interpreting the results of blood tests, and in understanding why some individuals respond differently to medication. ‘They also set reference points for future studies looking at the connection between metabolic processes and diseases such as cancer.'","Scientists in the UK have highlighted importance of body clock in altering concentration of molecules in the blood .

"By . Ben Spencer . A family of 14 foxes have been killed after they burrowed deep into the walls of a London park reservoir . A family of foxes have been shot dead after nearly caused catastrophic flooding when they burrowed deep into the walls of a reservoir. Council officials ordered the 14 foxes to be killed after the holes were discovered in the structure of a dam wall in London. They said the holes risked creating structural damage to the dam, putting 80 homes at risk of flooding. But wildlife experts said the cull will not solve the problem at Danson Park, Bexleyheath, as more foxes are likely to colonise the empty den and keep burrowing. Urban wildlife consultant John Bryant, who is working with Bexley Council, said: ‘Shooting the foxes is pointless because within three days new ones will move in. ‘The burrowing into the embankment will weaken it and the foxes will keep digging if they can. ‘The bank needs to be dealt with it and that is what I will be looking at with the council.’ Not all residents supported the operation. David Chamberlain, 54, who lives nearby, said: ‘The park is a nature reserve and you expect there to be wildlife. I think it’s inhumane and sickening. ‘The traps were very loud, imagine a gate clanging, that is how loud it was and I heard it twice from my house.’ An officer with Bexley Pest Control said: ‘I have worked in pest control for more than 20 years and never heard of foxes burrowing that deep, they would have to be super foxes to do that. ‘They normally burrow under garden sheds, I have never heard of them causing structural damage.’ A spokesman for Bexley Council added: ‘The pest control operation involved foxes that had burrowed into the structure of the Danson Dam.' Wildlife experts have warned the cull will not stop the problem at Danson Park, Bexleyheath (pictured), as more foxes will move in and colonise the empty den . ‘As the owner of the dam it is our responsibility to ensure that it remains in good condition. Failure of the dam would place more than 80 local properties at risk of serious flooding. ‘Before deciding on the best course of action we thoroughly investigated all the pest control measures available. ‘B & D Pest Control carried out the operation using approved methods. ‘They are licensed to use firearms with considerable experience in this kind of pest control. ‘The company informed Bexleyheath police who raised no objections and the foxes were humanely destroyed on the night of the operation using firearms. ‘Our engineers are now in discussion with a wildlife specialist to find a longer term solution that will discourage future attention from foxes.’","Fourteen foxes shot after burrowing nearly caused catastrophic flooding .

"By . Ben Spencer . Scientists at the University of Sydney found no link between temperature, rain, air pressure and humidity and back pain . Your granny will swear blind that the old tale is true - but it appears a cold night does not make a sore back worse, after all. Scientists, in fact, could find no link between back pain and any kind of weather. They tracked the levels of pain in nearly 1,000 back patients - and compared the results with temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind direction and rain. The only slight hint of heightened pain was on gusty, windy days, but even then the difference was so low that the scientists ruled it out as scientifically insignificant. One in three of us experience back pain at some point in our lives. It is the most common musculoskeletal condition globally, according to the World Health Organisation. The Australian research, published in the journal Arthritis Care and Research, compared the weather when patients first noticed their back pain with conditions one week and one month before the onset of the pain. Dr Daniel Steffens, of the University of Sydney, Australia, said: ‘Many patients believe that weather impacts their pain symptoms. ‘However, there are few robust studies investigating weather and pain, specifically research that does not rely on patient recall of the weather. ‘Our findings refute previously held beliefs that certain common weather conditions increase risk of lower back pain.’ The academic admitted, however, that the temperate climate in Sydney - where all the patients lived - may partially explain the results. ‘Regions with more extreme weather conditions may present a different result but further research is needed,’ he said. The popular belief about weather and its association with back pain seems to be stronger than the data would support. And he said that other musculoskeletal conditions may be affected by weather. The study examined 1,000 patients suffering back pain. Dr Daniel Steffens, of the University of Sydney, Australia, said: 'Many patients believe that weather impacts their pain symptoms. However, there are few robust studies investigating weather and pain, specifically research that does not rely on patient recall of the weather' ‘Further investigation of the influence of weather parameters on symptoms associated with specific diseases such as fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis are needed,’ Dr Steffens said. Cindy Malenica, a 47-year-old Australian who has suffered from a bad back since a teenage surfing injury, refused to accept the results. She claims her pain is so affected by weather that her friends call her the ‘human barometer’. ‘I got smashed by a wave and my back has been a problem ever since,’ she said. ‘Maybe the weather doesn’t affect everyone. But there must be a lot of people who are in the same boat as me, who do find that cold weather and a change of weather really affects their back.’ Other old wives' tales we fall for .","Study at the University of Sydney examined 1,000 back patients .

"By . Ben Spencer . Scientists have discovered the trigger that makes breast cancer spread to other organs, raising hopes that a treatment to isolate the disease could be developed. Most deaths from cancer are caused by secondary tumours, which in the case of breast cancer usually appear in the bones, the liver or the lungs. But researchers have identified a protein molecule called TARBP2 that appears to allow cancerous cells to migrate to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to other parts of the body it becomes much more difficult to treat . Any treatment targeting this protein would dramatically improve the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Breast tumours are relatively easy to treat because they can be removed simply with surgery or targeted with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. But when the cancer spreads to another part of the body – a process known as metastasis – it becomes much harder to tackle. Although the finding by scientists at Rockefeller University in the US – which was published in the journal Nature last night – is in its very early stages, it was hailed as a vital clue in the puzzle of how cancer spreads. Professor Sohail Tavazoie, who led the research, said: ‘If we learn more about how this regulation works, we may in the future be able to generate drugs that prevent this protein from triggering metastatic disease.’ He believes TARBP2 acts as a ‘master regulator’, prompting cancer cells to spread. Much more work needs to be done before hope of a treatment becomes a reality, but it was developed it could save millions of lives a year. Scientists all around the world are desperately looking for ways to prevent secondary cancer . Around 50,000 British women and 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Around 12,000 of them die of the disease annually. That survival rate would be dramatically improved if secondary cancers could be stopped. Dr Matthew Lam, senior research officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘This research is very exciting as it helps to identify the genetic and molecular basis of metastatic breast cancer, which kills around 1,000 UK women each month. ‘With more research like this we hope to be able to develop new treatments which can prevent breast cancer spreading to other organs.’ Nell Barrie, Cancer Research UK’s senior science communications manager, said: ‘Figuring out how molecules can influence a cell’s behaviour by controlling which messages are translated from its DNA is an interesting area of research. ‘But these studies have been carried out in cells in the laboratory and in mice, so it’s too early to see how we might use this information to help tackle cancer in humans.’ Scientists around the world are working to finds ways of stopping secondary cancer. The Mail reported this week how researchers have discovered the mechanism by which cancer cells migrate between organs. That study, led by scientists at University College London, found that cells have to change state to move along the narrow passages in the body. They also found the way to stop the transition, which could lead to primary tumours being ‘frozen’ in place when they are discovered. Bowel cancer patients with high levels of vitamin D in their blood are half as likely to die from the disease as those with the lowest, tests show. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh tested blood from almost 1,600 patients after surgery for bowel cancer. Around 75 per cent of those with the highest vitamin D levels were still alive after five years, compared with less than 66 per cent of those with the lowest levels.","Scientists have discovered what makes breast cancer spread to other organs, raising hopes a treatment could be developed .

"By . Ben Spencer . Badger culling plays only a ‘minor role’ in helping to control the spread of TB in cattle, a study has claimed. Researchers from the University of Warwick analysed cases of the disease, looking at incidents on British farms dating back to the 1990s. The study, published in the journal Nature, found that transmission of TB from badgers to cows plays only a ‘relatively minor role’ in the spread of the problem. Not the answer: Badger cull trials in Somerset and Gloucestershire last year had disappointing results, and ministers have been under serious pressure to drop the project . The research also claimed that killing every cow in a herd once the disease has been detected, as Britain did in the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis, would be an effective method of stemming the rise of bovine tuberculosis. However this would involve slaughtering 640,000 cows in the first year alone – a policy the paper calls ‘extreme’ and ‘draconian’. Cutting environmental transmission – which includes badgers, deer and . pasture where the disease lingers - by 50 per cent, which could . represent the impact of a large scale badger cull, would only reduce . that growth to 6 per cent year, the research found. Bovine TB costs the country £100million a year and ministers have . struggled to come up with an effective method of controlling it. Killing . badgers has been the Government’s main answer. But trials in Somerset . and Gloucestershire last year had disappointing results, and ministers . have been under serious pressure to drop the project. Effective method: A foot-and-mouth disease control zone during the 2001 outbreak. Killing every cow in a herd once the disease has been detected, as Britain did in the crisis, would be a way to stem the rise of bovine TB . Professor Keeling, who conducted the research with Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock, said culling the entire herd if an animal tests . positive would reducing infected cattle, numbers slaughtered and . affected farms by 80 per cent compared to standard measures after six . years. Vaccinating cattle against the disease would also have a marked effect in reducing the disease, he said.Increased testing would also help. Professor . Keeling said: ‘Transmission is complicated, it’s multifaceted. This . means you’ve got cattle-to-cattle transmission, you’ve got movement of . infected animals and you’ve got infection from the environment and all . of these play a role. Other options: Vaccinating cattle against the disease would also have a marked effect in reducing the spread of the disease. Increased testing on the animals would also help . ‘This means there’s no easy strategy that’s . ever going to rapidly eradicate infection, and what we’ve predicted is . without substantial changes in policy we’ re probably going to see this . historical 10 per cent rise in cases year on year to continue.' Last night farming minister George Eustice, whose department has come under fierce criticism for advocating badger culling, said: ‘What this paper proposes would finish off the cattle and dairy industry.’ But Dominic Dyer from the Badger Trust hailed the research, saying: ‘Maybe farmers will now give badgers a break and start focusing on methods that actually work.’","Badger culling plays only a ‘minor role’ in helping control the spread of TB .

"By . Ben Spencer . A breakthrough in cell research may pave the way for treatments which stop cancer spreading through the body. Scientists at British universities have worked out for the first time how cells are able to migrate from organ to organ. The new research, spearheaded by biologists at University College London, could transform the way cancer is treated. Crucially, the discovery has enabled scientists to work out how to block the movement of cells. The new study by British universities has identified how cancer cells migrate from organ to organ for the first time. Pictured is a secondary cancer tumour of the liver, under the  microscope . It means that aggressive cancer, which can quickly advance away from a primary tumour, might in the future be effectively frozen and isolated as soon as it is detected. Most cancer deaths are not caused by initial tumours, but by secondary tumours in vital organs such as the lungs or brain that are created by cancerous cells invading other places in the body. If the research can be used to develop an effective treatment it could save millions of lives each year. Professor Roberto Mayor, whose paper was published today in the Journal of Cell Biology, said: ‘This is an important breakthrough in the understanding of how cells move, which we strongly believe provides an insight into the way cancer spreads. ‘There is a long way to go from here to a cancer treatment, but it provides a theory as to how a tumour may be isolated and the cells stopped from moving and spreading.’ Professor Mayor’s team, along with researchers at Kings College London, Cambridge University and Akika City University in Japan, discovered that cells have to change state in order to move along the narrow passages in the body. The links between each cell is weakened, transforming them into a liquid-like state and allowing them to invade other parts of the body. Scientists hope the findings will help tailor new treatments, stopping cancer cells in their tracks . Vitally, the scientists also discovered the chemical signal which prompts the change. By switching off the signal, they were able to solidify the cells, effectively blocking any further movement. The research has so far only been shown to work in non-cancerous embryonic cells, but Professor Mayor is confident that it could be replicated for the way cells spread from a tumour and invade other parts of the body. He said: ‘It is likely that a similar mechanism operates during cancer invasion. ‘Many of the cellular processes that we now know happen in cancer were first discovered in these same embryonic cells.’ His researchers found that a molecule called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was responsible for weakening the bonds between cells, allowing them to change from a solid-like to a liquid-like state and allowing them to flow between tissues in the body. Blocking the LPA molecules - which could be achieved through a simple injection - stopped the cells’ movement. Professor Mayor said: ‘This suggests a promising alternative in which cancer treatments might work in the future, if therapies can be targeted to limit the tissue fluidity of tumours. ‘Our findings are important for the fields of cell, developmental and cancer biology. Previously, we thought cells only moved around the body either individually or as groups of well-connected cells. What we have discovered is a hybrid state where cells loosen their links to neighbouring cells but still move en masse together, like a liquid. Moreover, we can stop this movement. He added: ‘I emphasise that we are far off a treatment - but it might be that you could inject an inhibitor around a tumour, blocking the LPA. The tumour will become solid and will not move. It means you stop it spreading.’","Study by British universities have discovered for the first time how cancer cells migrate from organ to organ .

"By . Ben Spencer . Today is the first day of July, Wimbledon is still in full flow and the schools have not yet broken up. But while we enjoy the pleasures of mid-summer, nature is already racing ahead towards autumn. Our fields, woodlands and hedgerows are already displaying signs of change they would not usually expect to see until August or September, conservationists say. Scroll down for video . Natural beauty: Purple Emperor butterflies, pictured, have started arriving early after Britain experienced warmer than average temperatures for seven months in a row. Autumn could soon be upon us (file photo) Autumn: Scientists say holly berries are ripening, despite being associated with Christmas (file photo) Falling silent: Blackbirds have already stopped singing earlier than usual, say the experts (file photo) After an early spring and summer, plants and animals are well ahead of the seasons. Hawthorn . berries are already turning red, holly berries are ripening, and beech . and hazel nuts are developing months ahead of schedule. National Trust naturalist Matthew Oates said: 'Looking at this year, where does it want to be? It raged its way through winter, then we went into an incredibly early spring, and then it rushed helter-skelter through spring without stopping for breath.' This year blackbirds have already stopped singing, butterflies such as purple emperors arrived a month early and bees have been thriving on nectar from early flowers. Our remarkably mild weather over the last few months seems to have accelerated the seasons. Each of the last seven months has seen warmer-than-average temperatures, according to the Met Office. Britain had the third hottest spring since records began, three months of warm temperatures which triggered the flourishing of plants and wildlife. The Met Office said each of the last seven months has seen warmer-than-average temperatures, with hawthorn and holly berries already ripening. Pictured: Dog walkers on Elie Beach in Scotland yesterday . Spring 2014 has been a great year for bluebells. This wood in Hertfordshire is especially rich this year . Sandscale Haws in Cumbria, which hosts a quarter of Britain's natterjack toad population, is seeing bumper numbers this year (file picture) And June has been the sixth warmest since records began in 1910, around 1.4C above average. Mr Oates said: 'We're remarkably ahead, birds have largely stopped singing, a lot of butterflies are very early and are still coming out early. 'There are . really strong signs of autumn already here, like the beech nuts, it' s . an amazing beech mast year and the nuts are incredibly well developed.' He . also said sycamore seeds were well developed and hawthorn and holly . berries were already red - changes that usually would not be seen until . September. The . RSPB said people may begin to see more thrushes, blue tits and sparrows . in our hedgerows over the coming weeks as they come to feed on the . early berries. A . spokesman said: 'Most birds will be feeding on insects and worms at the . moment, and when they run out or the ground gets baked too hard for the . birds to get them then they will move on to berries. 'Blackbirds, . thrushes, blue tits and sparrows will all eat hawthorn berries and . other hedgerow berries but we haven't seen big signs of them making the . switch just yet.' Many plants and animals suffered during the winter storms that blasted Britain during December, January and February. But the mild weather since has greatly aided their recovery. Full swing: Crowds arrive at Wimbledon yesterday. It feels like the start of summer, but could it soon be over? Experts say holly berries are ripening, and beech and hazel nuts are developing months ahead of schedule . Dr . Kate Lewthwaite of the Woodland Trust said: 'Our landscape is . incredibly resilient in the face of natural and man-made threats and has . responded fantastically since the battering it took over the winter. Records would suggest summer is in full swing but that autumn is just . around the corner. 'Nature is . always on the march and in July I'd encourage people to keep their eyes . open for the first signs of autumn such as the first ripe blackberries.' Mr . Oates added: 'If we go back to that winter, it was the wettest, . stormiest, wildest winter, and very stressful for every living thing, . including us, but wildlife seems to have come through it incredibly . well. 'There . are always winners and losers. At the moment there seem to be far more . winners than losers, though we must remember a lot of our wildlife is in . a pretty beleaguered state.' Despite . the generally good situation, Mr Oates raised concerns about low . numbers of butterflies such as cabbage whites and the scarcity of bees . and many flying insects. More . positively, some species of insect may be able to fit in an extra brood . because they are so far ahead for the year, he said. And . an early autumn would not spell problems for wildlife, he said, so long . as creatures such as squirrels and dormice have the chance to fatten up . before winter set in.

"By . Ben Spencer . Billions of jellyfish are appearing around our coastlines following weeks of warm weather. Huge billowing blooms, each containing thousands of jellyfish, have suddenly appeared in our waters as the animals respond to high sea temperatures. These pictures, which show an ethereal mass of moon jellyfish, were taken by kayaker John Bentley off the beach at Newquay in Cornwall. These pictures, which show an ethereal mass of moon jellyfish, were taken by kayaker John Bentley off the beach at Newquay in Cornwall . Huge billowing blooms, each containing thousands of jellyfish, have suddenly appeared in our waters as the animals respond to high sea temperatures. Moon jellyfish are not dangerous to humans, only giving a mild sting . Mr Bentley, 43, said: ‘I’ve lived here all my life and I have never seen anything like it. ‘There were just thousands of them, floating there in huge masses. I was in the canoe with my two sons Rhys, who is ten, and Calum, who is eight, and there they were, all these jellyfish. ‘It was quite a sight.’ Jellyfish, which are known by conservationists as a barometer of the seas, are remarkably sensitive to changes in temperature, pollution and numbers of predators and food sources. Statistics released yesterday by the Met Office show that we have had a remarkably warm June, which is on track to be the sixth warmest since records began in 1910. The month so far has seen average temperatures of 14.4C (57.9F) - 1.4C above average. 'There were just thousands of them, floating there in huge masses. I was in the canoe with my two sons Rhys, who is ten, and Calum, who is eight, and there they were, all these jellyfish,' said Mr Bentley . The common blue jellyfish, which has a strong sting, is worth steering clear of . A Met Office spokesman said: ‘This continues a run of seven months where the UK mean temperature was warmer than average, with all the months from December through to April each being at least 1C warmer than the long-term average.’ The warm and dry weather looks set to go out with a very wet weekend, with downpours forecasted for today before a drier day tomorrow. The Met Office last night issued a yellow weather warning for rain, with up to 1.6 inches expected to fall in two or three hours today. Moon jellyfish are not dangerous to humans, only giving a mild sting. Another species which has been seen in large numbers in recent weeks is the massive barrel jellyfish, a spectacular large species which can grow up to 4ft long and weigh three stone (20kg). Above, a blue jellyfish seen off Newquay beach. Richard Harrington, of the Marine Conservation Society, said: 'It has been a good year for jellyfish sightings so far' It also can only cause mild discomfort to humans, but the common blue jellyfish which has a stronger sting, is worth steering clear of. Richard Harrington, of the Marine Conservation Society, said: ‘It has been a good year for jellyfish sightings so far. ‘Moon jellyfish seem to magically appear in large numbers, when daylight lengthens and sea temperature rises, but this is quite normal. ‘We have seen unusually high numbers of another type of jellyfish - the barrel – a large oceanic species that can grow to well over a metre long. Another species which has been seen in large numbers in recent weeks is the massive barrel jellyfish, a spectacular large species which can grow up to four feet long and weigh three stone (20kg). The one above was spotted by the River Fal in Cornwall . ‘Both species are largely harmless, but we always advise bathers to avoid touching them, as some jellyfish do possess a powerful sting.’ Matt Slater, of Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: ‘The warm weather we have had over the last few weeks has definitely led to an increase in the number of jellyfish. ‘We have seen more of these large barrel jellies than at any time since 2002 and there have been thousands of moon jellies - in some places the sea is just thick with them. ‘Jellyfish go through a boom and bust cycle due to the way they reproduce. You either get thousands at a time, or you get none - there isn’t an in-between state.’ Dr Cathy Lucas, of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, said huge blooms of moon jellyfish are usually seen when tides or winds blow thousands of the animals into a bay or cove. She added: ‘Warmer weather tends to cause a boom of plankton in the water, and that is what jellyfish eat. But it is a complex picture, to do with their reproduction cycles as well as the warm weather.’","Mass of moon jellyfish spotted off beach at Newquay, Cornwall .

"By . Ben Spencer . If you insist on having your gin and tonic served in a fine glass tumbler, then you might on the right track. Because drinks really do taste better when they are in a heavier glass, an Oxford University professor has found. Although your choice of container has no effect on the way tastebuds pick up the drink’s flavour, the experience of drinking out of a heavier glass alters the way the brain processes the taste. Enhanced taste: Gin and tonic tastes better when it is in a heavier glass, Professor Charles Spence has found . So when you drink something out of a high quality glass, rather than a plastic beaker, it will taste significantly better. Experimental psychologist Professor Charles Spence said: ‘We like heavy containers. We associate them with better quality, it has greater worth. If you want your guests to enjoy their G&Ts, then make sure they have a heavy glass, not a plastic one.’ Professor Spence, who will speak at the Cheltenham Science Festival today, added: ‘If you drink beer out of a bottle, it tastes better than from a can. ‘That is because it is heavier in the hand and people associate it with higher quality. Although it is a matter of perception, people really do believe it tastes better.’ Prestigious: Professor Spence, who is an experimental psychologist, works at Oxford University (pictured)","Drinks taste better when in heavier glass, says Professor Charles Spence .

"By . Steve Doughty . and Ben Spencer . Families could be forced to recycle yet more of their rubbish under tough new waste directives proposed yesterday by Brussels. Households are already forced to separate rubbish into various coloured bins, boxes and buckets as Britain attempts to hit a European target of recycling half our waste by 2020. But the European Commission now wants us to recycle at least 70 per cent of municipal waste – most of which comes from homes – by 2030. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has called weekly bin collections a 'funadamental right' - because it stops rubbish building up like this in Liverpool . Other targets include recycling 80 per . cent of packaging by the same year, tighter food waste reduction rules – . and a ban by 2025 on sending anything to landfill that can be recycled. The . stricter targets could force councils to adopt more coercive methods to . force households to recycle more, such as pay-as-you-throw bin taxes or . fines for people who fail to sort their rubbish properly. Britain is . currently struggling to hit the 50 per cent target by 2020, let alone . the  proposed stricter ones. In . the 12 months to September last year England’s household recycling rate . actually fell from 44.1 per cent to 43.9 per cent, and councils are . already under pressure to bring in more ambitious compulsory recycling . methods next year to get the figures up. Communities . Secretary Eric Pickles yesterday pledged to fight the new proposals. He . said: ‘Hard-working families pay a lot of money in council tax and they . deserve a proper rubbish and recycling collection in return.’ The . Commission claims a so-called ‘circular economy’ with more recycling . will boost the European economy and create 580,000 new jobs. It . said: ‘Keeping materials in productive use for longer, re-using them, . and with improved efficiency, would also improve EU competitiveness on . the  global stage.’ Rubbish . recycling has been politically sensitive in Britain for the past decade . after it became clear that Labour’s drive to increase recycling was . unpopular. Eric Pickles is considering making it a legal requirement for councils to collect black bin bags every week . Fortnighty rubbish collections, now used across more than half the country, proved vote losers in local elections. The . Coalition abandoned plans for taxes and fines for families who break . strict wheelie bin rules and Mr Pickles pressed councils to bring back . weekly collections. The . Communities Secretary added yesterday: ‘This Government has scrapped . Labour’s bin bully approach – and we will fight attempts to re-impose . bureaucracy via the back door of Europe.’ Environment department Defra . also said Brussels had underestimated the costs, while Lib Dem . Environment Minister Dan  Rogerson said the new target was out of reach. The . plans meant ‘putting more energy into chasing a principle without . getting much back’, he told MPs at the Commons environmental audit . committee. The Local . Government Association, which represents councils, said the Brussels . scheme would be hugely expensive for local authorities – which have . already more than doubled spending on waste and recycling since 2000. Eurosceptic . Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘The European Commission is recycling . the same old policies put forward by the same technocrats.’ The . most recent figures from EU statistics branch Eurostat reveal that . Germany is the continent’s top recycler on 65 per cent. Britain is on . 43.9 per cent, while France recycles just 39 per cent.

"By . Ben Spencer . The constant drone of traffic, music and televisions in modern society is fuelling a rise in demand for anti-depressants and sleeping pills, warns a noise expert. Dr Bernie Krause, who studies the impact of human-generated noise on animals, said the effect of noise on our bodies is far greater than we think. It was driving many to take pills for stress and to help them sleep, he added. The constant drone of traffic, music and other distractions is increasing the demand for anti-depressants and sleeping pills, one expert has claimed . Dr Krause said people wrongly believe . they have adapted to noise but the incessant cacophony of everyday life . is  making them miserable. ‘When you ask people in a noisy environment, they will always say they have adapted to it,’ he told the Cheltenham Science Festival. ‘But I see so many people reliant on so much medication to keep stress levels down and to make them sleep at night. People are in denial. None know that noise is having an effect on them. ‘We think we are well adjusted but studies which have looked at heart rate and blood pressure show something different. We are bothered by it a great deal.’ Dr Krause, a musician who  pioneered the use of the synthesiser in the 1960s, has spent  decades on his research. Dr Krause told the Cheltenham Science Festival people wrongly believe they have adapted to noise but the incessant cacophony of everyday life is  making them miserable (library image) Since 1968, the American has recorded 4,500 hours of ‘soundscapes’ – the noises created by animals in a specific habitat – and found that around half of them no longer exist because of the intrusion of human noise. His claims are supported by research in December which  suggests that repetitive, persistent noise may have particular long-term impact on the brains of the under-twos. Scientists from Yale University warned that even low sound, such as a TV on quietly, may cause harm if left on for long spells. Neurologist Dr Jaime Grutzendler said persistent noise for more than ten hours a day may stop blood vessels forming. He said it was ‘a public health issue which should be taken seriously’.","Side effect of noise of human body greater than we think, experts claim .

"By . Ben Spencer . Bosses should allow staff to take naps at work to boost productivity and creativity, a leading academic has suggested. Vincent Walsh, professor of human brain research at University College London, also proposed they should be allowed to set their own work times, arriving whenever they want. We have become obsessed with sleeping only during the night and fail to appreciate the benefits of an afternoon siesta, he told Cheltenham Science Festival. 'Brain downtime': Researchers say that allowing workers to sleep on the job could boost productivity . ‘It’s best to give your brain downtime. I have a nap every afternoon,’ he said. ‘It’s only since the industrial revolution we have been obsessed with squeezing all our sleep into the night rather than having one or two sleeps through the day.’ The professor said a nap of between 30 and 90 minutes in the afternoon could help companies improve productivity. ‘If we want people to be more creative we need people to be able to do less,’ he said. ‘Companies should allow naps in the afternoon. They should get rid of the habit of clocking in and clocking out. ‘Let people come in when they want. If they want to work through the night, let them.’ Research published today by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy reveals many employers are failing to encourage staff to take proper breaks. One in five work through their lunchbreak every day, the research suggests. Of those who do manage to take a break, half ate at their desk. Only one in five go outside, according to the study of 2,000 people. Professor Hugh Piggins, of Manchester University’s circadian neurobiology lab, also said sleeping was vital for memory and learning. He said millions get too little sleep during the week and try to catch up at weekends. Research suggests the problem – dubbed ‘social jetlag’ – could be responsible for increased rates of cancer, dementia and diabetes.","Brain professor said companies should let employees work when they like .

"By . Ben Spencer . A new blood test could tell women if their lifestyle is putting them at risk of developing breast cancer. Scientists say the test could identify those who are in danger ten years before any symptoms appear. This would give them time to take preventative action – which can be as simple as exercising regularly or losing weight – long before the disease gets a hold. The breakthrough could see women in their 50s and 60s having regular tests to monitor their risk level by the end of the decade. If the scientists’ hopes are realised, the test could lead to dramatic falls in  the number of women who suffer from breast cancer. A new blood test could tell women if their lifestyle is putting them at risk of developing breast cancer. Current tests that gauge your chance of breast cancer rely on identifying those with high-risk DNA, and they only work in 10 per cent of cases. Posed by model . The finding, by scientists at University College London, involves the first breast cancer screening tool that monitors the scale of  damage to genes from environmental factors such as smoking, diet, alcohol  consumption and the chemicals we come across in everyday life. Current tests that gauge your chance of breast cancer rely on identifying those with high-risk DNA, and they only work in 10 per cent of cases. They are useful in flagging up women with a faulty BRCA1  gene such as Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie, who last year had a  preventative mastectomy. But until now scientists had no early screening method for non-inherited breast cancer, which makes up 90 per cent of cases. The new test could be used in regular screening sessions for post-menopausal women. Around 50,000 British women develop breast cancer each year – four out of five of them in the post-menopausal years. Last year, Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie had a preventative mastectomy . The UCL researchers have now identified a ‘signature’ or ‘tag’ on the DNA of blood cells which is a reliable way of predicting those women who may go on to develop the disease. The blood test, which they are developing, works by assessing how far environmental factors have affected the body’s genes. It is not clear what proportion of women at increased risk of breast cancer display the signature, but the scientists hope the test could be used to assess a large proportion of women. Professor Martin Widschwendter, the study’s lead author, said the test could identify those who are at risk of breast cancer ten years before any symptoms appear. ‘The main application would be in post-menopausal women,’ he said. ‘We would do this blood test every five years and then define a specific risk for individual women. ‘Depending on the risk we could tailor the prevention regime. ‘For example, for some women that could mean a change in  lifestyle, for others it could mean intensified screening. For those at highest risk it could be to use chemotherapy or other treatments for prevention.’ More work will be needed to develop the test for clinical use, but Professor Widschwendter is confident the additional research can be completed in five to seven years so the test could be ready for clinical use by 2020. The UCL study, published today in the journal Genome Medicine, was welcomed by breast cancer charities. Dr Matthew Lam, senior research officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘These results are promising and we’re excited to learn how further research could build on these findings.’ He added: ‘This could mean that in the future a woman may be able to have a simple blood test to look for this DNA signature. ‘If she does have this signature, she could work with her doctor to explore the options available to help her take control of her risk.’ Dr Kat Arney, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Looking at changes in the “tags” on DNA in blood cells taken from people before they develop cancer is an exciting area of breast cancer research. ‘It’s an intriguing finding but we need to understand much more about how these changes influence breast cancer risk before this knowledge can be turned into a screening test.’","It would give them time to take .

"By . Ben Spencer . They are the pride and joy of millions of gardeners. But Britain’s carefully kept lawns are under threat this summer – from hidden invaders beneath the soil. Experts say leatherjackets, small larvae which eat the roots of grass, are at their highest levels for 40 years. Leatherjackets, small larvae which eat the roots of grass, are at their highest level for 40 years, experts say . As they attack from below the grass is killed off, turning it brown. The wet and mild winter provided perfect conditions for the grubs to thrive, with an estimated 250 for every square yard of turf in the worst-hit areas. As spring progresses the grubs are growing larger and lawns sheltering the pests will gradually develop yellow patches that turn brown. When fully grown in August, the grubs will pupate and emerge as crane flies – also known as daddy-long-legs. Leatherjackets threaten farmers’ cereal and grass crops and sports clubs have also been hit. A cricket club in Surrey had to spend £6,000 replacing its outfield after it was eaten by the grubs. Professor Davy McCracken, of Scotland’s Rural College, warned there may be a plague of daddy-long-legs in August. ‘Because of the densities we have seen, we would expect to see large numbers of daddy-long-legs on the wing, coming to lights at night, being in people’s homes, being around in the agricultural land.’ He told BBC Radio 4’s Farming Today that the infestation would be a severe challenge to farmers in the wettest parts of the country, particularly along the west coast of England and in Scotland, adding: ‘If you have one million grubs per hectare it is enough to decimate your crop.’ A pesticide previously used to kill the bugs was banned because of its harmful impact on bees. An alternative method is to put a black sheet of plastic on the lawn overnight. The leatherjackets will be clinging to the underside in the morning and can be picked off and disposed of.","Leatherjackets at highest level for 40 years due to wet and mild winter .

"By . Ben Spencer . A new six-minute test could diagnose Parkinson's disease in its early stages. Michael J. Fox (pictured) was diagnosed with the disease in 1991 . Scientists have developed a six-minute test which could give an early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. Currently Parkinson’s patients only discover they have the debilitating neurological problem when the symptoms have already taken hold. But Oxford University academics have come up with a new way of spotting the disease at an early stage. The researchers were able to detect early Parkinson’s disease with a remarkable 85 per cent accuracy. The technique uses an MRI scanner to monitor the neural connections in a concentrated area at the very centre of the brain. Even at a very early stage, Parkinson’s patients had much weaker connections in the basal ganglia region of the brain, which is associated with motor control. The study, which has been published in the journal Neurology, found that by taking 180 pictures in six minutes they could spot the poor connections. They also found that the test had a very low chance of incorrectly diagnosing healthy people with the disease. The said scans could be done on people in their fifties, the age when the condition usually begins to take hold. Study leader Dr Clare Mackay, a psychiatrist at Oxford University, said: ‘At the moment we have no way to predict who is at risk of Parkinson’s disease in the vast majority of cases. Currently it is only possible to diagnose Parkinson's disease when it is more advanced. Billy Connolly (pictured) was diagnosed with the disease in September last year on the same day as he was told he had cancer . ‘We are excited that this MRI technique might prove to be a good marker for the earliest signs of Parkinson’s. The results are very promising.’ Around 127,000 people in the UK are believed to have Parkinson’s, which causes tremors, slow movements and muscle rigidity. The new test uses an MRI scanner to monitor the neural connections at the very centre of the brain. Sir Roger Bannister (pictured) has recently revealed that he has Parkinson's . There is currently no cure and no way . of halting the disease. But the progressive nerve cell damage produced . by Parkinson’s is thought to begin long before any symptoms appear. Dr Mackay said: ‘We are still at least ten years away from that magic breakthrough which allows us to slow down the progression of Parkinson’s. 'But in order to get there, we need a way of spotting the disease early on. The two things go hand in hand.’ And co-author Dr Michele Hu, from Oxford University’s Nuffield department of clinical neurosciences, said: ‘Because it is so sensitive, we hope that it will be able to predict who is at risk of disease before any symptoms have developed.’ Claire Bale, a spokesman for Parkinson’s UK, which funded the research, added: ‘This new research takes us one step closer to diagnosing Parkinson’s at a much earlier stage – one of the biggest challenges facing research into the condition. ‘One person every hour is diagnosed with Parkinson’s in the UK, and we hope that the researchers are able to continue to refine their test so that it can one day be part of clinical practice.’","Currently, Parkinson's can only be diagnosed once it is well-established .

"By . Ben Spencer . Tesco is hoarding enough undeveloped land to build 15,000 new homes. The supermarket chain reportedly owns 310 sites which it has not built on – a total area of 1,100 acres. It bought hundreds of out-of-town sites in the 1990s and 2000s, most of them earmarked for its large Tesco Extra stores. Tesco reportedly owns 310 out-of-town sites which it has not built on, making up a total area of 1,100 acres . But the company has since changed tack, opting instead for smaller convenience-style stores as shoppers give up their big weekly visits. It has, however, hung on to its property portfolio, according to analysis of Land Registry records by the Guardian. Britain needs to build more than 200,000 new homes a year to cope with huge demand and ease the bubble in house prices. The Government is under political pressure to protect rural and green belt land – but there is a shortage of viable brownfield sites. Companies which hoard land without building on it are fuelling the problem, but finding a solution has divided the political parties. Labour advocates a ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ policy but the Government says confiscating land ‘will not help build a single house’. The extent of Tesco’s combined undeveloped land is the equivalent of three Hyde Parks, or enough to build the Government’s planned new garden city at Ebbsfleet, Kent. According to the Guardian, Tesco has accumulated large amounts of unused land in close proximity to existing superstores and turned down offers for at least one site from rivals, despite having no plans to develop the land. The extent of Tesco's combined undeveloped land is the equivalent of three Hyde Parks, pictured, and would be enough to build the entire expanse of the Government's planned new garden city at Ebbsfleet, Kent . The revelations come three weeks after the supermarket announced its worst results for 20 years, with sales falling by 3.8 per cent over the past three months. Philip Clarke, Tesco chief executive, says he is facing the worst trading environment in his 40-year history . Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke has to face shareholders at the firm’s annual meeting today. He says the trading environment is the worst in his 40-year career at the supermarket, but added: ‘I am not going anywhere.’ Supermarkets’ land ownership strategies were investigated by the Competition Commission in 2007, when the major chains faced allegations they were buying up land to prevent rivals from building stores in key spots. Tesco, which has a £20billion property portfolio, was cleared by the commission of impeding its competitors. Tesco, as well as the other big chains Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons . are facing fierce competition from discount firms Aldi and Lidl, which . are aggressively increasing their market share. A Tesco spokesman said last night: ‘We only buy land with the intention of delivering developments. ‘Like other supermarkets, we own a pipeline of sites where we intend to develop new stores for our customers over the coming years. We have plans for 3,200 homes on land we own. Not all land is suitable for housing. ‘In response to changing customer shopping habits, we have decided to reduce the amount of new space we build each year, building fewer large stores. ‘Where we no longer intend to develop sites, we sell them, lease them or develop them for housing.’","Tesco has earmarked 1,100 acres of land which it has not yet built on .

"By . Ben Spencer . A flash of iridescent colour when a  dragonfly darts over a pond is an evocative image of summer. And it is one that is being witnessed more and more often, new data reveals. Dragonflies are enjoying a resurgence thanks to conservation work and warmer weather. A project that tracked different species over five years has led to a comprehensive Atlas of the Dragonflies in Britain and Ireland, published today. Voracious spread: From its landing spot in Essex, the small red-eyed damselfly has colonised huge swathes of the country, spreading to the Isle of Wight in the south, Devon in the west and Yorkshire in the north . It found seven new species have been sighted in England in the past 20 years after migrating from the Continent. Six had not been seen here before and one re-established itself after a six-decade absence. Some, including the small red-eyed damselfly which was first sighted in England in 1999, have since spread voraciously across Britain. From its landing spot in Essex, the small red-eyed damselfly has colonised huge swathes of the country, spreading to the Isle of Wight in the south, Devon in the west and Yorkshire in the north. The dainty damselfly, absent in Britain for 57 years, made a surprising reappearance in Kent in 2010 and has now established a colony on the Isle of Sheppey. The atlas combines pre-existing conservation data with new information collected by 6,600 British Dragonfly Society volunteers between 2008 and 2012. The results established that 14 of the 42 established British breeding species have expanded their ranges. Welcome back: The dainty damselfly, absent in Britain for 57 years, reappeared in Kent in 2010 and has established a colony on the Isle of Sheppey . Conservationists think that dragonflies, which are extremely sensitive to temperature change, have benefited from a warming climate and a general increase in the number and quality of wetlands. Atlas editor Steve Cham, of the British Dragonfly Society, said: ‘Dragonflies are a very good indicator of the quality of environment. ‘They need good, clean water to survive, so typically the more dragonflies, the better the quality of the water. ‘But more significant is the impact of changing climate. We think new species are coming here because it is gradually getting warmer, and dragonflies are very sensitive to that.’ Dr Helen Roy of the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, which helped contributed to the atlas, added: ‘This represents inspiring contributions from many, many volunteers across Britain and Ireland. ‘Dragonflies are charismatic and popular insects but they also provide an important insight into the ways in which our environment is changing. ‘Not only is the atlas another wonderful example of citizen science but it is also providing valuable scientific evidence.’ Dragonflies, which have existed on Earth for 325million years, have been threatened by widespread insecticide use, water pollution and the draining of wetlands for housing. The research found that eight species, including the scarce blue-tailed damselfly and white-faced damselfly, have declined in recent years. But overall the trend seems to have been reversed, with warm summers, conservation efforts and cleaner water providing better conditions for the ancient insects.","Atlas of the Dragonflies in Britain and Ireland is published today .

"By . Ben Spencer . Footballer Eric Cantona was right - scientists have established that seagulls really do follow a trawler, for up to seven miles to be precise. The Manchester United star left most people baffled with his philosophical musings. But it was his most famous utterance, delivered to a press conference in 1995, that any football fan can recite at heart: ‘When seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.’ Eric Cantona, pictured, told bemused journalists at a press conference: 'When seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea'. He was addressing the media after he had kung-fu kicked a Crystal Palace fan in 1995 . The Frenchman was speaking about press interest following his kung fu kick on a Crystal Palace fan. But now scientists have established that his words were literally true. A study has found that sea birds really can sense a fishing boat from miles away and alter their flight patterns to zoom in. The research, by scientists at the University of Exeter and University College Cork in Ireland, found that a boat creates a ‘halo of influence’ for seven miles in every direction. Gannets, Britain’s largest seabird, can even differentiate a fishing boat from any other vessel. They are less likely to be attracted to boats that simply drift along than to boats whose crews are actively fishing. Dr Mark Jessopp of University College Cork said seabirds can recognise different types of boats and whether they are actually fishing . Exeter’s Dr Thomas Bodey, who led the study tracking six colonies of northern gannets, said: ‘While we knew that seabirds, including gannets, regularly followed fishing vessels, we were surprised at the distance at which the birds’ behaviour was affected, expecting it to be a more localized phenomenon.’ The researchers tracked the movements of 74 individual birds around the British Isles using high-resolution GPS trackers. They compared their flight patterns to the GPS logs of fishing boats, establishing that each boat had a remarkably wide impact on the birds. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, said the findings demonstrate that fishing vessels which throw discards into the water have a far bigger ecological footprint than previously thought. Dr Mark Jessopp of University College Cork said: ‘The fact that birds responded differently to boats depending on whether they were fishing or not, and the type of gear they were carrying, indicates just how finely attuned these animals are to the opportunities humans can provide.’","Eric Cantona spoke about seabird feeding habits at a 1995 press conference .

"By . Ben Spencer . A deadly illness spread by rat urine in river water has reached record levels,  latest figures show. Cases of Weil’s disease, a bacterial infection which attacks the kidneys and liver, have doubled in the past two years. It can be contracted after swimming in  rivers and lakes – which may be of concern after the recent hot weather. Cases of Weil's disease, a bacterial infection which attacks the kidneys and liver and is spread by rat urine in rivers, have doubled in the past two years (library image) There were 70 hospital admissions for Weil’s disease last year – more than any other 12-month period in the past ten years and double the figure for two years ago, according to NHS records. The illness – also known as leptospirosis – has claimed four lives in the UK since 2009. Olympic rowing champion Andy Holmes died of Weil’s disease in 2010 aged 51, after it is believed the bacteria entered his body through blisters on his hands. It can also be transmitted through cuts and scratches or the lining of the mouth, throat or eyes, after contact with infected rat urine or contaminated water. The illness - also known as leptospirosis - has claimed four lives in the UK since 2009, NHS figures show . People who work near waterways are most at risk. Last year’s casualties included two fish farmers, a wildlife park worker and two water sports instructors. Also infected were a professional gardener, a builder clearing out a swimming pool and a pub manager cleaning out flood water. Although rats are the main carriers of the disease, it can also be spread by animals such as cattle, mice, foxes and badgers. Last year’s only fatality was a 60-year-old woman from a travelling family, who experts said had been exposed to rats as well as water that could have harboured the bacteria. The sharp rise in Weil’s disease comes as the Government is being urged to sanction the use of stronger poisons to crack down on rat infestations. Pest control experts fear the winter flooding could be partly to blame for the increase in infections, as it forced rats out of their usual habitats. A Public Health England spokesman said Weil’s disease is still rare, adding: ‘The risk can be greatly reduced by not swimming or wading in water that might be contaminated. 'If you develop a flu-like illness seven to 12 days after contact with fresh surface water or with rats, then visit your GP and explain you may have been exposed to leptospirosis. ‘Complete recovery is the usual outcome after leptospirosis, and there are unlikely to be any long-term effects.’","Weil's disease is a bacterial infection which attacks the kidneys and liver .

"By . Mark Prigg . It is the most distant cosmic magnifying glass ever found. Astronomers using Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope have unexpectedly discovered a monster elliptical galaxy so large it has created a lens allowing researcher to see back 9.6 billion years. The monster elliptical galaxy breaks the previous record holder by 200 million years. These Hubble Space Telescope images reveal the most distant cosmic lens yet found. The giant elliptical is the red object in the enlarged view at left. Its red color comes from the light from older stars. In the enlarged view, the lighter-colored blobs at upper right and lower left are the distorted and magnified shapes of a more distant spiral galaxy behind the foreground elliptical. These 'lensing' galaxies are so massive that their gravity bends, magnifies, and distorts light from objects behind them, a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. Team members Kenneth Wong and Sherry Suyu of Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taipei, Taiwan, used the gravitational lensing from the chance alignment to measure the giant galaxy's total mass, including the amount of dark matter, by gauging the intensity of its lensing effects on the background galaxy's light. The giant foreground galaxy weighs 180 billion times more than our Sun and is a massive galaxy for its epoch. These 'lensing' galaxies are so massive that their gravity bends, magnifies, and distorts light from objects behind them, a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. The object behind the cosmic lens is a tiny spiral galaxy undergoing a rapid burst of star formation. Its light has taken 10.7 billion years to arrive here. Seeing this chance alignment at such a great distance from Earth is a rare find. Locating more of these distant lensing galaxies will offer insight into how young galaxies in the early universe built themselves up into the massive dark-matter-dominated galaxies of today. Dark matter cannot be seen, but it accounts for the bulk of the universe's matter. 'When you look more than 9 billion years ago in the early universe, you don't expect to find this type of galaxy-galaxy lensing at all,' explained lead researcher Kim-Vy Tran of Texas A&M University in College Station. 'It's very difficult to see an alignment between two galaxies in the early universe. 'Imagine holding a magnifying glass close to you and then moving it much farther away. 'When you look through a magnifying glass held at arm's length, the chances that you will see an enlarged object are high. 'But if you move the magnifying glass across the room, your chances of seeing the magnifying glass nearly perfectly aligned with another object beyond it diminishes.' 'There are hundreds of lens galaxies that we know about, but almost all of them are relatively nearby, in cosmic terms,' said Kenneth Wong and Sherry Suyu of Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics (ASIAA) in Taipei. 'To find a lens as far away as this one is a very special discovery because we can learn about the dark-matter content of galaxies in the distant past. 'By comparing our analysis of this lens galaxy to the more nearby lenses, we can start to understand how that dark-matter content has evolved over time.' The 'clean' version of the image, showing the surrounding area. Although the elliptical galaxy is hefty, it is not as massive as many of today's galaxies. Our Milky Way galaxy, for example, is three to four times more massive than the elliptical galaxy. Although the elliptical galaxy is hefty, it is not as massive as many of today's galaxies. Our Milky Way galaxy, for example, is three to four times more massive than the elliptical galaxy. Most of the Milky Way's mass is locked up in dark matter. The lensing galaxy, however, is underweight in terms of its dark-matter content. 'The unusually small amount of dark matter in this massive, elliptical, lensing galaxy is very surprising,' Suyu said. 'Other elliptical galaxies that are closer to us have much more dark matter and have inventories of stars that appear to be different from this super-distant lensing galaxy.' The team's results appeared in the July 10 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.","'Lensing' galaxies are so massive that their gravity bends, magnifies, and distorts light from objects behind them .

"By . Mark Prigg . Doctors have been warned to think twice before recommending smokers switch to e-cigarettes. Scientists say more research is needed on the gadgets - and say they could also be harming people's health. This study is believed to be the first to measure attitudes toward e-cigarettes among physicians treating adult smokers. Scientists say more research is needed on the e-cigarettes - and say they could also be harming people's health. The new survey of North Carolina physicians published in PLOS ONE surveyed a random sample of 128 North Carolina physicians about their attitudes towards e-cigarettes. Two thirds (67 percent) of the surveyed physicians indicated e-cigarettes are a helpful aid for smoking cessation, and 35 percent recommended them to their patients. 'Even in the absence of evidence regarding the health impact of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, a third of physicians we surveyed are recommending e-cigarettes to their patients to help quit smoking,' said Leah Ranney, PhD, one of the authors of the survey and associate director of the Tobacco Prevention and Evaluation Program at UNC. 'Yet, e-cigarettes are not approved by the FDA for smoking cessation. 'It is clear that physicians should refrain from recommending e-cigarettes until more is known about their safety.' According to Wells Fargo the estimated total size of the retail market in the US is $2bn. The study found that physicians were more likely to recommend e-cigarettes when their patients asked about them or when the physician believed e-cigarettes were safer than smoking standard cigarettes. e-cigarettes are not approved by the FDA for smoking cessation - but doctors are increasingly recommending them, researchers found . However, physicians often have inconsistent information about the safety of using e-cigarettes and in this survey 13 percent are unaware that e-cigarettes are not approved by the FDA. 'Physicians may choose to use FDA approved medications rather than devices and products not approved by FDA,' says Dr. Adam Goldstein, a UNC Family Medicine physician and study co-author. The researchers concluded that the area needed more research. 'This research provides a first look at how e-cigarettes are being used as cessation devices among physicians who treat adult patients. 'Our results suggest that physicians see potential in these products as a cessation device and that some make recommendations for their use. 'As e-cigarettes become more mainstream, physicians may be called on to engage in conversations with their patients about the safety and efficacy of these products. 'It is essential that the FDA critically review the current evidence on e-cigarettes and provide clear guidance about e-cigarettes and tobacco cessation.'","Scientists say more research is needed on the gadgets - and say they could also be harming people's health .

"By . Ben Spencer . They are only a few inches tall, but these two wild crane chicks come with very high hopes. The pair of hatchlings are the first new generation of wild cranes seen in western Britain in 400 years. It is a huge success for conservationists after sustained efforts to reintroduce UK’s tallest birds to their wetland habitats. Chicks: This pair of hatchlings are the first new generation of wild cranes seen in western Britain in 400 years . The wild crane, which stands four feet tall, was once commonplace in the south-west. But the bird was considered a vital part of the medieval banquet table - and cranes were hunted to extinction by the 1600s. The two chicks hatched at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Slimbridge reserve in Gloucestershire. Parent birds Chris and Monty, which were hand-reared as part of the Great Crane Project reintroduction scheme, tried to breed last year but a chick died in bad weather before leaving the nest. Hello, mum! The chicks hatched at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Slimbridge reserve in Gloucestershire. Above, one of the hatchlings with its mother . This year two healthy chicks have been spotted on their first walk away from the nest, as their parents fed them on grubs. So far they have stayed close to the nest site, which indicates there is plenty of food around for them. That is encouraging for the youngsters as cranes usually hatch two chicks but one will perish if food is scarce. Nigel Jarrett, the trust’s head of conservation breeding, said the chick’s arrival was incredibly exciting. Pleased: TV naturalist Stephen Moss described the chicks' arrival as 'a wonderful story' He hopes it will be part of a new generation of wild cranes. ‘There’s been an overwhelmingly positive response to the return of the cranes from people across the west of Britain,’ he said. ‘They are a fantastic advert for restoring wetland habitats.’ Some cranes have regained a foothold in East Anglia and nearly 80 have been reintroduced to western Britain in the past four years. They have been a strong draw for visitors to Gloucestershire, where volunteers have dressed in crane costumes to hand rear chicks. TV naturalist Stephen Moss said: ‘It is a wonderful story. They started reintroducing cranes to Slimbridge four years ago, bringing them over from Germany. ‘They were hand raised and then released on the Somerset Levels. But quite bizarrely they have flown back to Slimbridge to breed, back to the place they were raised. They must have some kind of homing signal.’ Mr Jarrett first spotted the chick on a webcam trained on the nest. He said: ‘It’s incredibly exciting to be on the cusp of a new generation of totally wild cranes that will hopefully start to recolonise parts of Britain that haven’t seen cranes for four centuries. ‘The chick hatching last year confirmed that the cranes we hand-reared were physically able to breed. ‘This year we’ve got everything crossed that everything goes in their favour and they can rear this chick.’ Damon Bridge of the RSPB added: ‘The young cranes are learning and adapting to their new home in the UK and are still searching for suitable sites to successfully rear their young.’ In 1215, Henry III (pictured) and his guests ate an incredible 115 cranes at his Christmas feast in York . Wild cranes are Britain’s tallest bird, standing four feet tall and with an eight-foot wing span. They . were once common in Britain, but they were driven to extinction by . hunters catching them for their meat and the draining of their wetlands . habitats.

"By . Mark Prigg . Asteroids and comets repeatedly smashed into the early Earth and covered the planet's surface with molten rock during its earliest days, researchers have revealed. However, they say there may have been a positive effect -  oases of water that could have supported the evolution of life. Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago - and it is believed its first billion years were far more dramatic than previously thought. For much of its early life, Earth and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts, the new research shows . The first 500 million years of the Earth's life are known as the Hadean Eon. Although this time amounts to more than 10 percent of Earth's history, little is known about it, since few rocks are known that are older than 3.8 billion years old. For much of the Hadean, Earth and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts. The first 500 million years of the Earth's life are known as the Hadean Eon. Although this time amounts to more than 10 percent of Earth's history, little is known about it, since few rocks are known that are older than 3.8 billion years old. For much of the Hadean, Earth and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts, the new research shows. Our planet was hit thousands of times by 'small' space debris, approximately 9 miles wide, researchers say. But occasionally, asteroids larger than 300 miles wide struck the Earth’s surface, vaporising the Earth’s oceans, and filling the atmosphere with steam. The meteor that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia in 2013 was 65 feet wide, and the asteroid that may have killed the dinosaurs was believed to be six miles wide, for comparison. 'Here we provide a new bombardment model of the Hadean Earth that has been calibrated using existing lunar and terrestrial data,' the team, led by Simone Marchi, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, wrote in Nature. 'We find that the surface of the Hadean Earth was widely reprocessed by impacts through mixing and burial by impact-generated melt.' The new model indicates that the Earth’s surface would have been mixed up by impacts that caused its rocks to melt, and gives clues about the extreme conditions that existed when the Earth was in its infancy. The early Earth, showing a surface pummeled by large impacts, resulting in extrusion of deep seated magma onto the surface. At the same time, distal portion of the surface could have retained liquid water. The history of the Hadean Earth (approximately 4.0 to 4.5 billion years ago) is poorly understood because few known rocks are older than around 3.8 billion years old. It is thought that roughly 4.5 billion years ago the Earth and Moon were being pummelled by asteroids, although the exact timing and magnitude of these impacts, and their effects on Earth’s evolution, are less well known. Simone Marchi and co-authors estimate the early Earth’s impact history, calibrated using the existing data for the Moon, which with its heavily cratered surface provides a clear record of the event that bombarded the Earth–Moon system. The new model suggests that the large impacts caused Earth’s surface to be widely reprocessed, a finding that may help to explain the absence of early terrestrial rocks and the age distribution of ancient zircons, minerals which have survived from the Hadean period. The researchers believe that, with few areas on Earth escaping untouched by impacts, life emerging during the Hadean was probably resistant to the extreme conditions that existed at that time. The researchers created this animation to show the impacts . The researchers discovered that ;the surface of the Earth during the Hadean was heavily affected by very large collisions, by impactors larger than 100 kilometers (60 miles) or so — really, really big impactors,' Marchi said. 'When Earth has a collision with an object that big, that melts a large volume of the Earth's crust and mantle, covering a large fraction of the surface,' The new findings suggest that Earth's surface was buried over and over again by large volumes of molten rock — enough to cover the surface of the Earth several times. Any water vaporized near these impacts 'would rain down again,' Marchi said, and 'there may have been quiet tranquil times between collisions — there could have been liquid water on the surface.' Marchi and his colleagues detailed their findings in the July 31 issue of the journal Nature.","Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago - and it is believed its first billion years were far more dramatic than previously thought .

"By . Mark Prigg . The bodies of ancient Iron Age warriors who fell in a battle around the time of Christ were impaled on wooden stakes in a gruesome religious ritual, say scientists. Four pelvic bones on a stick and bundles of other desecrated remains testify to the ceremonial violence perpetrated on the corpses of the vanquished soldiers - six months after they were slain. It happened about 2,000 years ago in a major clash between Germanic tribes close to the Danish town of Skanderborg at the edge of the Roman Empire. Four pelvic bones on a stick were found at the dutch site, along with bundles of bones, bones bearing marks of cutting and scraping, and crushed skulls. The battle happened about 2,000 years ago in a major clash between Germanic tribes close to the Danish town of Skanderborg at the edge of the Roman Empire. Battles in the area were waged when major changes were taking place because the Roman Empire was expanding northwards - putting pressure on the Germanic tribes. This resulted in wars between the Romans and the Germanic tribes - and between the Germanic peoples themselves. Archaeologists assume the recent finds at the Alken dig stem from such an internal conflict. The 200 dead were thrown into a peat bog near the village of Alken on the Jutland peninsula and only discovered by archaeologists two years ago. Professor Mads Kahler Holst, of Aarhus University, said: 'We have found a wooden stick bearing the pelvic bones of four different men. 'In addition, we have unearthed bundles of bones, bones bearing marks of cutting and scraping, and crushed skulls. 'Our studies reveal that a violent sequel took place after the fallen warriors had lain on the battlefield for around six months.' The remains of the fallen were gathered together and all the flesh was cleaned from the bones - which were then brutally desecrated before being cast into the lake. Cuts and slashes on the skeletons showed they had died violently. The warriors' bones at the bottom of the water-filled pit which kept them well-preserved were mixed with the remains of slaughtered animals and clay pots that probably contained food sacrifices. Professor Holst said: 'We are fairly sure this was a religious act. Bundles of bones, bones bearing marks of cutting and scraping, and crushed skulls were also found at the site . 'It seems this was a holy site for a pagan religion - a sacred grove - where the victorious conclusion of major battles was marked by the ritual presentation and destruction of the bones of the vanquished warriors.' Geological studies have revealed back in the Iron Age bodies were thrown into the water from the end of a tongue of land that stretched out into Mosso lake which was much larger than it is today. Dr Ejvind Hertz, curator of Skanderborg Museum, said: 'Most of the bones we find here are spread out over the lake bed seemingly at random - but the new finds have suddenly given us a clear impression of what actually happened. 'This applies in particular to the four pelvic bones. The warriors' bones at the bottom of the water-filled pit which kept them well-preserved were mixed with the remains of slaughtered animals and clay pots that probably contained food sacrifices. 'They must have been threaded onto the stick after the flesh was cleaned from the skeletons.'

"By . Mark Prigg . Microsoft's hardware chief gave employees a sneak peek at a 'selfie' phone featuring a 5 megapixel forward-facing camera at an internal meeting this week. Stephen Elop, the former Nokia CEO who now runs Microsoft's devices business, showed off the phone in front of thousands at the company's annual employee meeting in Seattle on Monday. The 4.7 inch (11.9 cm) screen 'selfie' phone, plus another high-end Windows Phone, are expected to launch soon, according to tech news site The Verge, which first reported the news. Stephen Elop hopes a 'selfie' version of the Lumia handset with a 5 megapixel front facing camera could boost the popularity of Windows phones. More than 40per cent of people aged 18 to 34 take at least one selfie every week - and a large amount are re-touching them, too. According to Sony, the top things people re-touch before posting an image of themselves is skin blemishes (33per cent), face shape (16per cent), skin tone (15per cent), eye size (5per cent), lips (5per cent) and eye color (4per cent). Just 2per cent of people said they never re-touch their selfies. The 5 megapixel camera on the front of the device is much more powerful than Apple Inc's iPhone 5, with a 1.2 megapixel front camera, and the Microsoft phone's screen is larger, making it better-suited for users who want to take pictures of themselves. Microsoft is jumping on the selfie bandwagon after rival Samsung launched the Galaxy K Zoom earlier this year. The 'selfie' craze, or taking a picture of yourself and friends, hit its peak earlier this year when Ellen DeGeneres posted a shot of Hollywood luminaries at the Academy Awards which became the most popular message ever on Twitter.

"By . Mark Prigg . Scientists  have identified 101 distinct geysers erupting on Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus. Their analysis suggests it is possible for liquid water to reach from the moon’s underground sea all the way to its surface. They used mission data from Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft taken over seven years to map each geyser eruption. This two-image mosaic is one of the highest resolution views acquired by Cassini during its imaging survey of the geyser basin capping the southern hemisphere of Saturn's moon Enceladus. It clearly shows the curvilinear arrangement of geysers, erupting from the fractures. .From left to right, the fractures are Alexandria, Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus. This graphic shows a 3-D model of 98 geysers whose source locations and tilts were found in a Cassini imaging survey of Enceladus' south polar terrain. Over a period of almost seven years, Cassini’s cameras surveyed the south polar terrain of the small moon, a unique geological basin renowned for its four prominent 'tiger stripe' fractures and the geysers of tiny icy particles and water vapor first sighted there nearly 10 years ago. To determine the surface locations of the geysers, researchers employed the same process of triangulation used historically to survey geological features on Earth, such as mountains. When the researchers compared the geysers’ locations with low-resolution maps of thermal emission, it became apparent the greatest geyser activity coincided with the greatest thermal radiation. The result of the survey is a map of 101 geysers, each erupting from one of the tiger stripe fractures, and the discovery that individual geysers are coincident with small hot spots. These findings, and clues to what powers the geyser eruptions, are presented in two articles published in the current online edition of the Astronomical Journal. Over a period of almost seven years, Cassini’s cameras surveyed the south polar terrain of the small moon, a unique geological basin renowned for its four prominent 'tiger stripe' fractures and the geysers of tiny icy particles and water vapor first sighted there nearly 10 years ago. The result of the survey is a map of 101 geysers, each erupting from one of the tiger stripe fractures, and the discovery that individual geysers are coincident with small hot spots. These relationships pointed the way to the geysers’ origin. After the first sighting of the geysers in 2005, scientists suspected repeated flexing of Enceladus by Saturn’s tides as the moon orbits the planet had something to do with their behavior. One suggestion included the back-and-forth rubbing of opposing walls of the fractures generating frictional heat that turned ice into geyser-forming vapor and liquid. Alternate views held that the opening and closing of the fractures allowed water vapor from below to reach the surface. a regional cross-section of the ice shell underlying Enceladus' south polar terrain, illustrating our current knowledge of the physical and thermal structure and processes ongoing below and at the surface. Before this new study, it was not clear which process was the dominating influence. Nor was it certain whether excess heat emitted by Enceladus was everywhere correlated with geyser activity. To determine the surface locations of the geysers, researchers employed the same process of triangulation used historically to survey geological features on Earth, such as mountains. When the researchers compared the geysers’ locations with low-resolution maps of thermal emission, it became apparent the greatest geyser activity coincided with the greatest thermal radiation. This artist's rendering shows a cross-section of the ice shell immediately beneath one of Enceladus' geyser-active fractures, illustrating the physical and thermal structure and the processes ongoing below and at the surface . Comparisons between the geysers and tidal stresses revealed similar connections. However, these correlations alone were insufficient to answer the question, “What produces what?” The answer to this mystery came from comparison of the survey results with high-resolution data collected in 2010 by Cassini’s heat-sensing instruments. Individual geysers were found to coincide with small-scale hot spots, only a few dozen feet (or tens of meters) across, which were too small to be produced by frictional heating, but the right size to be the result of condensation of vapor on the near-surface walls of the fractures. This Cassini narrow-angle camera image -- one of those acquired in the survey conducted by the Cassini imaging science team of the geyser basin at the south pole of Enceladus -- was taken as Cassini was looking across the moon's south pole . This immediately implicated the hot spots as the signature of the geysering process. 'Once we had these results in hand we knew right away heat was not causing the geysers, but vice versa,' said Carolyn Porco, leader of the Cassini imaging team from the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, and lead author of the first paper. 'It also told us the geysers are not a near-surface phenomenon, but have much deeper roots.' Thanks to recent analysis of Cassini gravity data, the researchers concluded the only plausible source of the material forming the geysers is the sea now known to exist beneath the ice shell. They also found that narrow pathways through the ice shell can remain open from the sea all the way to the surface, if filled with liquid water. This dramatic view looks across the region of Enceladus' geyser basin and down on the ends of the Baghdad and Damascus fractures that face Saturn. In the companion paper, the authors report the brightness of the plume formed by all the geysers, as seen with Cassini’s high resolution cameras, changes periodically as Enceladus orbits Saturn. Armed with the conclusion the opening and closing of the fractures modulates the venting, the authors compared the observations with the expected venting schedule due to tides. They found the simplest model of tidal flexing provides a good match for the brightness variations Cassini observes, but it does not predict the time when the plume begins to brighten. On this polar stereographic map of Enceladus' south polar terrain, all 100 geysers have been plotted whose source locations have been determined in Cassini's imaging survey of the moon's geyser basin.","Analysis suggests it is possible for liquid water to reach from the moon’s underground sea all the way to its surface .

"By . Mark Prigg . It could be the biggest photobomb in history. Nasa's solar observing spacecraft had its uninterrupted view of the sun rudely ruined - by the moon. On July 26, the moon crossed between Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory and the sun, a phenomenon called a lunar transit. Scroll down for video . Now THAT'S a photobomb: On July 26, 2014, from 10:57 a.m. to 11:42 a.m. EDT, the moon crossed between NASA¿s Solar Dynamics Observatory and the sun. This animated gif shows the path of the moon across the Solar Dynamics Observatory's field of view for this lunar transit. The high-definition space observatory orbits the Earth in a very special way that our planet rarely slips into shot. This happens approximately twice a year, causing a partial solar eclipse that can only be seen from SDO's point of view. Images of the eclipse show a crisp lunar horizon, because the moon has no atmosphere that would distort light. This is very different to when the Earth blocks the solar view and you can see the hazy upper atmosphere allowing some of the brightest active regions penetrate. The SDO has been continuously watching the sun since 2009. The high-definition space observatory orbits the Earth in a very special way that our planet rarely slips into shot. The moon, however, crosses its path approximately twice a year. By blending different SDO wavelengths, Nasa can get an enhanced image of the sun.

"By . Mark Prigg . It is the ultimate is personalised toys - a dancing 'bobblehead' that looks exactly like you. Amazon today launched a new 3d printing service that allows customers to design toys to look like themselves - and is also giving people the change to design their own jewellry. Most of the more than 200 items available on the company's new 3D printed products store, which launched on Monday, can be customized using a new feature that allows users to rotate and change the item they are viewing. Scroll down for video . But your own mini-me: Amazon has begun selling the $30 3D printed toys as part of a new 3D printed goods store . Each Mixee Bobbler is 3D printed on demand in full color using a proprietary powder specifically formulated for this color 3D printing. Leftover powder is reused so there is less material waste than with traditional manufacturing. The spring is 3D printed with laser sintered nylon plastic. A print head binds the powder together layer by layer with glue. Other print heads follow and add color to the powder layer. After all the layers are done, the solidified model is extracted from the tray and any excess powder is removed. A sealant is then applied to brighten the color and protect the model. Before it is printed by one of Amazon's sellers, users can customize a product like as a bobble head figure by changing its skin and eye color, hair style and outfit, Amazon said. 'The introduction of our 3D Printed Products store suggests the beginnings of a shift in online retail - that manufacturing can be more nimble to provide an immersive customer experience. 'Sellers, in alignment with designers and manufacturers, can offer more dynamic inventory for customers to personalize and truly make their own,' said Petra Schindler-Carter, Director for Amazon Marketplace Sales. 'The 3D Printed Products store allows us to help sellers, designers and manufacturers reach millions of customers while providing a fun and creative customer experience to personalize a potentially infinite number of products at great prices across many product categories.' The bobblehead toys are provided by Mixee. 'At just 2-3 inches tall, these little guys are the perfect addition to your desk decor or mantel,' it says. '2d portraits are so last decade. 'Make cute cartoon figurines of yourself, friends, family, and coworkers.' Even the character's clothing can be customised as part of the process . At just 3 inches tall, the figure's material 'feels like unglazed ceramics'. The surface texture is slightly sandy, like fine dry coral or sandstone. These custom 3d-printed figurines are made with 3d-printed full color sandstone, a matte material that feels like unglazed ceramics. Amazon, which has more than 240 million users, has expanded its marketplaces division to include new areas such as fine art and wine. It is part of Amazon's larger investment into new areas like mobile services and original content that led to its larger-than-expected second-quarter loss last week. The new printing option taps into a broader 'Maker movement' among tech entrepreneurs in northern California, and to some extent Europe, that is focused on customizing 3D objects rather than development software or mobile applications. 3D printers have gained in popularity on Amazon Supply, a wholesale site for businesses. That interest led Amazon to offer customers an 3D print option, Schindler-Carter said.","Toys are customised using new 3D online customisation tool .

"By . Mark Prigg . It could be the biggest crowdfunding hit in history. The Sense sleep monitoring system can look at not only how you sleep, but also everything from noise to light in your bedroom. It was launched last week - and raised $1m in just four days. Scroll down for video . The system is controlled by a smart 'orb' that can monitor your bedroom and listen for loud noises or bright lights. Sense's Sleep Score takes into account all of the sensor data and variables that it monitors to generate a score out of a 100 for your previous night. It looks at both the environment of your bedroom, such as disturbances during the night, or your room was too bright for an ideal nights rest, as well as how you actually slept yourself. A pitch black room might boost your score by +10, but a car alarm going off repeatedly might lower it -20. The Sense app will give owners a breakdown and will also look for patterns, and help you to fix whatever is preventing people from reaching 100 per cent each night. 'In just over four short days, 7,945 of you have pledged $1,000,333 to receive 8,213 Senses,' said James Proud, the inventor of the gadget. 'I speak on behalf of the whole team at Hello when I say that never in our wildest dreams did we expect this and in such a short amount of time.' The Sense system produces a sleep score for each night - and even work out if the neighbour's dog barked at 4AM. 'We spend a third of our lives asleep, and the rest of our time is completely dictated by how we slept - everything from how we eat to how we exercise,' James Proud, the 22-year-old Londoner behind the project told MailOnline. He claims the current rash of sleep monitoring products are flawed. 'It's been a neglected area, but now there are a lot of apps and wearables that track our sleep. 'However, they don't seem to work too well. The Pebble Watch, a smartwatch developed by Pebble Technology. Smartwatch Pebble (right) raised $10.3m from 68,929 backers in May 2012, making it the most popular Kickstarter campaign ever. Fledgling console maker Ouya raised $8.6m from 63,416 backers in August 2012 for its Android-based 'microconsole' Neil Young's Pono music player and downloads store attracted $6.2m of pledges earlier this year. Oculus Rift raised $2.4m from 9,522 backers in September 2012 - before being sold earlier this year for $2bn to Facebook. 'When you look at everything else, people aren't looking at why you sleep badly.' The sense system has two components. A main control 'orb' sits on the bedside table, and is packed with sensors to monitor everything from noise to light. It also has a speaker to play white noise, or play an alarm in the morning. The app shows readings over time - so can work out what temperature you sleep best at, for instance (left). It also gives a sleep score (right) that takes into account all the factors of your night's rest. A second gadget dubbed the 'sleep pill' clips onto the pillow to track movement through the night. Two can be used at the same time, allowing a couple to monitor their sleep independently - and the system can even tell which of them is snoring to keep the other awake. Proud says the key to the system is that it doesn't require users to clip on wearable gadgets of put their phone in a certain place. The orb stays on the bedside cabinet, while a second sensor clips to the inside of a pillow, meaning the user does not have to put on any gadgets before going to sleep at night. 'It can unobtrusively track sleep - you should have to think about it, you should just go to bed. 'Bedroom is key - but room we look at least. 'There are all these environmental factors, but we are in the dark about them.' 'We can see what's happening when you're asleep - are there loud noises, are you sleep talking, for instance.' The main sensor and 'sleep pill' which clips onto a pillow . The main control orb is packed with sensors. Ambient Light Sensor monitors the levels of light in your room. Temperature and Humidity Sensors are able to detect the temperature and humidity throughout the day . A particulate Sensor can pollen and other material that triggers allergies. The second sensor, the sleep pill, has accelerometers to detect the slightest movement, and is left clipped to your pillow. It tells the orb how you are sleeping. The app tells you how well you slept, or didn’t, by giving you a Sleep Score each night, and analysing the historic data to work out what temperatures and humidities you sleep best at. The system is controlled by an app. 'You can see two main views - a breakdown of the revious night's sleep, but also a pre-sleep test that shows a live output from the data telling you historical patterns, so what temperature you sleep best at, for instance,' said Proud. There is also a 'smart alarm' that  wake you in the morning at the right point in your sleep cycle, which experts claim avoids the 'groggy' feeling in the morning. The system also has a smart alarm that can wake users up at the right time so they are most rested .","Sensor sits on bedside table, listens for loud noise and monitors air and light quality .

"By . Mark Prigg . A new flaw in Google's Android mobile operating system leaves the personal and financial details of users open to hackers, a mobile analytics firm has claimed. Called Fake ID and discovered by security firm Bluebox Security, the malicious software, or malware, can impersonate other apps in order to gain access to secure areas of your phone and sensitive data that it holds, without the user becoming aware. Experts say the flaw has been present since 2010. The flaw affects millions of handsets running Google's Android software . Called Fake ID, the malicious software, or malware, can impersonate other apps in order to gain access to secure areas of Android phones and tablets. It can then extract sensitive data that it holds, without the user becoming aware. The vulnerability dates back to the January 2010 release of Android 2.1 . The malware could also gain access to Google Wallet, an app which utilises mobile payments, leaving thousands of user accounts at risk. However, Google has moved to calm any fears by confirming they have been alerted to the problem and issued a fix to protect users. Android is the operating system developed by technology giant Google. In a blog post on the Bluebox website, chief technology officer Jeff Forristal, said: 'The vulnerability allows malicious applications to impersonate specially recognised trusted applications without any user notification. 'This is a widespread vulnerability dating back to the January 2010 release of Android 2.1. Mr Forristal also suggested the malware could gain access to 'financial and payment data by impersonating Google Wallet', an app which utilises mobile payments, leaving thousands of user accounts at risk. However, Google has moved to calm any fears by confirming they have been alerted to the problem and issued a fix to protect users. 'We appreciate Bluebox responsibly reporting this vulnerability to us. Third-party research is one of the ways Android is made stronger for users,' said a Google spokesman. Millions of Android handsets are belied to be at risk as the flaw has been present since 2010 . 'After receiving word of this vulnerability, we quickly issued a patch that was distributed to Android partners, as well as to the Android Open Source Project.' The technology giant also said that they had scanned their app store and found no apps that are currently exploiting the vulnerability. Craig Young, security researcher at online firm Tripwire said that as long as users stick to official apps from the Google Play Store, they are unlikely to be in too much danger. 'All is not lost for owners of unsupported devices as long as they stick to applications obtained from the Google Play store and do not enable apps from untrusted sources,' he said. 'Users without access to Google Play or who want an added layer of protection should install a mobile anti-virus product to detect this and other malicious apps. This was a view echoed by Jonathan French from web security company AppRiver, who suggested that the bug might not have even been known to hackers. 'Probably not many people will already be affected by the flaw. Security flaws do go unnoticed by companies but that usually means they go unnoticed by hackers as well. It’s very possible that this vulnerability was already being used in the wild but my guess would be even if it was, the impact would be pretty low. 'It seems Google is aware of the flaw now and monitoring for any apps that attempt to use this vulnerability. The news of this flaw is the latest in a wave of recent vulnerabilities that have been reported online. The Heartbleed bug that affected the SSL certificate used to encrypt user information on the web was discovered earlier this year. It led to a host of major websites having to issue patches to protect users, and UK parents’ forum Mumsnet announced they were hacked as a result of the flaw. E-commerce giant eBay was another high profile victim of hacking earlier this year, when millions of user passwords and other data was compromised after a flaw was discovered in its security. 'So if you get your apps from the Play Store, you should hopefully be ok. 'If you get apps from elsewhere, it should go without saying that you are potentially putting your device at great risk. Bluebox has confirmed that it will be releasing it’s own app that will scan a device to check whether it is at risk to the vulnerability. According to a 2013 survey, more than 60% of the world’s smartphone users have an Android device.","Malware can impersonate other apps in order to gain access to secure areas of your phone .

Detectives used the footage from Carver Warehouse to trace the two thieves. Staff at the Manchester business found the receipt when they were tidying up after the burglary . The receipt was dated Friday April 18 and showed that a screwdriver and bin bags had been bought from a Clas Ohlson hardware store. CCTV was checked by police and showed both Cummins and Vandersteen forcing open the doors to Carver Warehouse and getting inside. It later showed them leaving with the stolen goods. After speaking with staff at Clas Ohlson, it was found both men had been at the store on the day and time printed on the receipt. Detectives found that Cummins and Vandersteen had tried to break into a company in Barton Arcade in the city centre on the same day as the burglary at Carver Warehouse. A screwdriver was used to try and force the office door but they were unsuccessful. Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw said: 'CCTV was instrumental in identifying Vandersteen and Cummins for these crimes. Once again, this case has highlighted it is essential businesses have quality CCTV covering their property so if they are a victim of crime, it can help police identify who is responsible. 'Forensic testing showed that Cummins fingerprint was on the receipt and that, along with the conclusive evidence caught on camera of the pair, was enough to send both behind bars.'","Matthew Cummins, 25, and Joseph Vandersteen, 24, have been jailed .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Roland Dow, 28, has been sentenced to 67 years in jail for torturing toddler James Nicholson. Pictured during the trial at Rockingham County Superior Court, New Hampshire . A man convicted of inflicting sadistic 'torture sessions' on his girlfriend's three-year-old son before fleeing with her to a Florida theme park, has been jailed for 67 years. Roland Dow, 28, from Plaistow, New Hampshire, was sentenced yesterday for burning, blinding and treating James Nicholson, who is now lame, 'like a caged animal'. He was convicted in June of assaulting the toddler, failing to get him medical help, coaching him to lie to a social worker and secretly recording the social worker's visit. The young boy is the son of Dow's girlfriend, Jessica Linscott, who pleaded guilty to child endangerment and witness tampering. She will be serving between two and seven years in prison. They were arrested at the Universal Orlando Resort in November 2012, two weeks after leaving James at a hospital with a brain injury, head-to-toe bruises and burns on his arm and hand. The brain injury was so severe that holes had to be drilled in his head to relieve pressure on his skull. Prosecutors said Dow treated the boy like a dog, not allowing him to sit on the couch and refusing to have the child's laundry mixed with his. Rockingham County Superior Court, New Hampshire, also heard how the boy was made to sleep in the shower without a blanket or pillow and was verbally and physically abused. Judge Marguerite Wageling called Dow's behaviour deliberate, depraved and sadistic, saying that the young boy had been 'dragged into hell'. She said: 'James was treated like a caged animal, and putting that up against the apparent wonderful behaviour he knew how to provide to a child makes it even more sick. Scroll down for video . James Nicholson, was subjected to a 'reign of terror' by Dow, who was dating his mother Jessica Linscott. The little boy, who is now lame, was three-years-old at the time of the abuse, but he is now five . Dow and Jessica Linscott (right) left the three-year-old in hospital and went to went to Universal Orlando, Florida, where they were arrested . 'He then flew out of the area and engaged in happy-go-lucky entertainment while James lay in a hospital bed having holes drilled in his skull to relieve the pressure of the injuries he sustained.' Assistant County Attorney Patricia Conway said Dow beat the boy, tied him to a bed and subjected him to 'torture sessions' in the bathroom. 'For whatever reason, God only knows, this man hated James. He hated him, and he began his reign of terror against this 3-year-old little toddler,' said Ms Conway. The boy's mother, Jessica Linscott, pleaded guilty to child endangerment and witness tampering. She will be serving between two and seven years in prison . Prosecutors said Dow treated the boy like a dog, not allowing him to sit on the couch and refusing to have the child's laundry mixed with his . While the child was in the hospital, Dow and Linscott went to Florida, where they partied and went to amusement parks, according to prosecutors. In arguing for a sentence of five to 10 years, attorney Thomas Gleason said his client was 'sorry the young boy was injured and hurt'. James, who is now five-years-old, lives with his grandmother and is 'doing great' physically. His  great-grandmother Germaine Mullen said the boy remains terrified of Dow and has asked: 'Why did Roland hurt me all the time?' She said she has assured James that Dow is in prison. 'The look of relief that came over that child's face? It was almost like when someone wins the lottery,' she said. Dow, who didn't testify at his trial, didn't speak at the sentencing either.","Roland Dow, 28, from New Hampshire has been jailed for 67 years .

"By . Freya Noble . and Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia . A young boy from Victoria has written a strong letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott demanding answers on a subject very close to his heart. Jaden, a 10-year-old from the Melbourne suburb of Berwick, penned a letter to Mr Abbott questioning his stance on same-sex marriage and the reason his mums can't get married. The letter, originally posted on samesame.com.au, begun with a polite introduction and an admission that Jaden likes to play basketball and 'I am really good at it'. He then gets to the point. 'Anyway, this is why I am writing to you because I want to ask if my parents can get married?' he wrote. Victorian boy Jaden wrote a passionate letter to the Australian Prime Minister questioning his stance on gay marriage . In the letter, the schoolboy also expressed his misunderstanding over why his mums, Emily and Janaha, can't wed. He said he doesn't believe their marriage would hurt the Prime Minister because 'you wouldn't even see them.' 'And dude you sister is a lesbian!' Jaden proclaimed, referring to the PM's sister Christine Forster. 'And if you can except (accept) that I'm sure you can let gay and lesbians get married!' One of Jaden's mums told Seven News she was 'in shock' when her son chose to pen the letter, but was proud of her son for standing up for what he believes in. He closed with a sensitive sentiment, writing: 'Thank you for listening and if you let my parents get married then my life and there (their) life would be so much easyer (easier)'. The letter points out that his mums' marriage wouldn't hurt the PM and that Tony Abbott's sister is a lesbian . Jaden's mums said they were surprised when he decided to write the letter and he did it of his own accord . Jaden then suggested that a positive response to the letter may help Mr Abbott win future elections, and said 'maybe when I'm older I and all the other people will vote for you!' According to the program Mr Abbott's office has received the letter, but as the Prime Minister is in London he will read and reply to it upon his return. This is not the first time a young boy has reached out to the Prime Minister to express his wishes that his mums could marry. An 11-year-old boy who wrote a letter to Tony Abbott earlier this year, called his stance on gay marriage 'pathetic', and revealed he was disappointed by the 'poor response' he received from the Australian Prime Minister. Jaden finished the letter with an offer for Mr Abbott - if he changed the laws he might just get the schoolboy's vote in the future . He maintained he didn't see how his parents were different to anyone else's, and if they were allowed to wed it would make the family's life easier . Orlando Burcham, from Cessnock north of Sydney, wrote to Tony Abbott in May expressing his passion for gay marriage after his mother Cordelia Troy married her girlfriend last year. He also pointed out that Mr Abbott's own sister, Christine Forster, was in a same-sex relationship and asked why the Prime Minister was stopping gay men and women from getting married in 'this beautiful country'. Mr Abbott responded to Orlando's letter but the 11-year-old was less than impressed. 'When I got it back I was very disappointed because there wasn't any reasons,' Orlando told MailOnline on Thursday. 'It was just a poor response.' Orlando Burcham's letter to Tony Abbott went viral after it was posted on the Australian Marriage Equality Facebook earlier this year . In his passionate letter, Orlando detailed that his mum Cordelia Troy (left) had to travel to New York last year to marry her partner Marissa Burrier (right) Copies of Mr Abbott and Orlando's letters went viral after they were posted on the Australian Marriage Equality Facebook in June. In his passionate letter, Orlando detailed that his mum – a member of the Liberal Party and a local Cessnock councillor – had to travel to New York last year to marry her partner Marissa Burrier. 'You have actually met my mum (Councillor Cordelia Troy) who is a member of the Liberal Party and she was deputy mayor at the time. It is so pathetic that you aren't letting the gay people of Australia and other countries get married here. 'You were elected to represent our country, not yourself. Just because you think it's wrong, does not give you the right to make it illegal. Doesn't our opinions matter to you? Just because you're the Prime Minister, which by the way does not give you all the power.' The Cessnock schoolboy also pointed out that Mr Abbott's own sister was in a same sex relationship and asked why he was stopping gay men and women from getting married in 'this beautiful country' Mr Abbott responded to Orlando's letter last Friday but the 11-year-old was less than impressed . Orlando's mum said she had nothing to do with the letter but she had encouraged him to be heard. 'He came in and asked me how to spell ""beautiful"" and then he came back and asked how to say ""pathetic"". I thought where is this going?' Ms Troy said she was rapt with Orlando's letter and the response it has garnered. 'I was pretty emotionally touched. To have one of your kids express something so well and the way he has expressed it is beautiful,' she said. 'It makes me feel really proud as a mum.' In his response, Mr Abbott said he respected Orlando's views. The Prime Minister has made his strong stance on marriage clear, despite his sister Christine Forster being in a same sex relationship. Ms Forster, a City of Sydney Liberal Party councillor, is engaged to her partner of six years Virginia Edwards.

Now in its 16th year, the four day event is set against the backdrop of a stringybark forest and is designed to preserve cultural traditions and provide a forum for discussion on issues affecting the Aboriginal community. Throughout the festival young and old take part in traditional bunggul, or dance, manikay, or song, and cultural ceremonies known as Wangga. Art, storytelling and other forms of education are all incorporated into Garma. More than 800 tents are dotted around the Gulkula area, overlooking the Gulf of Carpentaria, and attendees are encouraged to stay onsite to appreciate the experience in its entirety. Attendees are encouraged to stay onsite in tents to appreciate the experience in its entirety . Located in the north-eastern corner of the Northern Territory, Arnhem Land has been occupied by Indigenous Australians for tens of thousands of years and is rich in Aboriginal culture. The area is sacred to its original inhabitants and rock paintings and artifacts have been dated back as far as 40,000 years. Taking in Kakadu National Park and bordered by the Gulf Of Carpentaria, Arnhem Land is one of the largest and most remote Aboriginal reserves. The Yothu Yindi Foundation, who present Garma, describe the festival as 'Australia’s most significant Indigenous event, and a model for self-determination, reconciliation, Indigenous knowledge sharing, transfer and exchange'. This year's theme is 'responsibility, reform, recognition', director of Garma Denise Bowden told the ABC, and highlighted the importance of closing the gaps for Indigenous Australians. A new Garma Knowledge Centre was opened as part of this year's festivities, with many members of the Aboriginal community in traditional dress and body paint for the ceremony. Politicians past and present attended the festival this year, with former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke at the event at the weekend and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten giving an address to Garma on Sunday.

"By . Freya Noble . Eliana Deur Davidson is suing the City of Whitehorse for damages after she allegedly injured her back ducking from a swooping bird . A Melbourne woman who slipped and injured her back while trying to avoid a swooping bird is suing her local council for damages. In November 2011 Eliana Deur-Davidson was taking her three-year-old niece to Box Hill South Kindergarten and was walking through the carpark when she realised she was under attack. In an effort to protect her young family member, the 41-year-old told The Herald Sun she twisted her body to shield her niece from the grey bird that swooped the pair. This apparently resulted on her landing heavily on one of her knees. Since the incident Ms Deur-Davidson said she had been in and out of hospital, and less than a week ago she underwent spinal surgery to 'shave' one of the discs in her back. The woman is now suing the City of Whitehorse for damages after she allegedly sustained the back injury during her fall. In court documents presented to the County Court of Victoria last week lawyers for the woman claimed the local government area in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, breached its duty of care. The lawyers also said there had been previous complaints about the birds and the council failed to relocate the feathered animals, install devices to deter them or warn residents of the dangers. The woman was in the carpark of Box Hill South Kindergarten and was protecting her niece when she fell . Ms Deur-Davidson claimed she had to resign from her job as a youth worker due to ongoing complications from the injury, and she now suffers from severe back pain which means she can't sit down for more than 20 minutes at a time. 'This injury could have been prevented. I just think they needed to take a little more care,' the youth worker, who now walks with a limp, said. The statement of claim also said since the incident the woman has experienced a psychological trauma in addition to a limitation of movement in her lower back, a disc prolapse and referred pain in her left leg. In documents lodged at the County Court of Victoria the 41-year-old said the council could have prevented the incident . In a post to her Facebook ahead of her surgery last week, Ms Deur-Davidson thanked her friends, family and husband for their support 'through a hard coupla years (sic)'. The 41-year-old also said she was looking forward to a 'pain-free life' and she can't wait to 'be able to go for long car rides, for day trips and to go camping again!!'. In another update just two days ago Ms Deur-Davidson dubbed the operation a 'great success' and she was 'Incredibly happy.' 'I awoke from surgery to find I had absolutely no pain in my left leg. The root nerve had been completely flattened by scar tissue, but is now plump', she wrote.","Eliana Deur-Davidson was taking her niece to Box Hill South Kindergarten .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . A mother-of-two who cared more about going to a Bon Jovi concert than looking after her injured toddler was spared jail by a judge today. The 22-year-old rock fan mother took her daughter to hospital suffering from a broken wrist - but asked when she could get away because she had tickets to see Jon Bon Jovi's band in Cardiff. Paediatric nurses were shocked when the mum asked how long treatment would take – despite the fact that her toddler had 15 different bruises and a wrist injury that happened 'some time' before. The 22-year-old mother had tickets to see Jon Bon Jovi at Cardiff City Stadium in June last year. She took her daughter to hospital, but kept asking when she could leave and go to the concert . The mother denied causing bruising and neglecting to get medical attention for the fracture but was found guilty today following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court. She was given a 12-month suspended jail term and was ordered to complete 240 hours unpaid work. Judge Daniel Williams said: 'You were preoccupied with wanting to know how long you would be at the hospital because you wanted to go to the Bon Jovi concert. 'The truth is that at the hospital you cared more for your attendance at that concert than you did for your two-year-old daughter.' The mother told the trial she was unaware her little girl had fractured her wrist when she fell from the lavatory at home just before going away for a week's holiday last summer. She gave her daughter Calpol when she became upset and the little girl fell asleep and afterwards seemed well. The Bon Jovi fan was given a 12-month suspended jail term at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) today and ordered to complete 240 hours unpaid work . The injury was found to be healing by the time she took her to their GP and then to hospital on her return. But Judge Williams said: 'The pain would have been extreme for a time, would have been suffered by her for some time afterwards and it would have been obvious to you.' There was also bruising to the side of the child's head and bruises on her thighs which must have been caused using force. 'In all there were 15 bruises and the location makes it clear that you subjected her to serious violence,' said the judge. 'When you came back from your holiday you could not put off seeing your mother and, acting as any caring person would, she told you to go to your GP.' He warned the woman: 'Failure to comply fully with the suspended sentence could result in you being ordered to serve the 12 months.' The mum had suggested the bruising on the toddler's legs must have been caused when she got stuck in a plastic swimming ring on their holiday. Judge Williams said: 'It is left  to speculate what you did to your daughter because you still maintain the lie that injuries were not inflicted by you.' The mother, who cannot be named, had tickets for the Bon Jovi concert at the Cardiff City Stadium last summer. Cardiff Crown Court heard her greatest punishment has been losing custody of the little girl and a second child. They are now being cared for by other relatives.","The 22-year-old mother took daughter to hospital with an old wrist injury .

"By . Freya Noble . Australian mothers, wives and sisters may not have served on the frontline, but they played a crucial role back home - often as they were dealing with the tragedy and grief of loved ones lost on the European battlefields. 'Australia was unusual, close to unique, among combatants in the war in that women had the vote', historian and University of Melbourne researcher Professor Stuart Macintyre told Daily Mail Australia. The politicians at the time paid a great deal of attention to the women's opinion as they had the potential to seriously influence the conscription laws, and many were against conscription all together. Scroll down for video . Australian women played a crucial role back home while their husbands and sons were fighting in WWI . They showed their support and patriotism by volunteering with charities to raise funds for the soldiers . Women knitted socks and balaclavas to send overseas to the men on the front line . 'There was a lot of concern that the women would be reluctant to vote if their sons and husbands were being sent away,' Professor Macintyre said. 'The issue with gender and women featured more prominently in Australia's role in the war that it did in other countries.' 60,000 Australian lives were lost in battle, which meant one in ten men who was sent overseas never returned home. Hundreds of thousands more came back as casualties of war, with serious physical and debilitating mental scars. 'The [initial] rush to enlist was in light of they thought it would be a war that would be over so quickly.' Professor Macintyre said. Little did they know the battle would continue for years. In Australia because women had the vote they played a key role in deciding conscription laws, pictured here at a recruiting march . The female population was divided on conscription, and some in favour took part in processions . Wives, mothers and sisters had a heavy burden taking on the roles of the men and living with the fear, and often horrific reality, of losing loved ones . Women are seen here packing chests full of donated items to send overseas . The local press would report on the proceedings of the war, but their information was often delayed by days. Ministers of religion were the ones burdened with delivering the news of a death of a soldier to his loved ones. Australian historian and widely-published intellect Professor Stuart Macintyre told of the way gender played a key role for Australian women in WWI . Professor Macintyre told of the fear and heartbreak those mothers and wives experienced, always in wait for bad news. 'If the minister or priest turned up in your street, there would be a sort of foreboding', he said. Women would stand at the front of their houses, waiting, and praying that the letter was not coming their direction. Back home, the Australian mothers and wives played a very different roles to their counterparts around the world. While it was common for women to assume different roles in absence of the men, Australian women had less opportunity to actively participate in the war. Professor Macintyre revealed: 'There were many patriotic women who wanted to play a part but found it difficult to do so.' Unlike in WWII where women had the chance to carry rifles, during WWI mothers and wives fell into 'comfort' roles. They worked for charities in volunteer roles - collecting funds for soldier's relief, and knitted socks and balaclavas to send to the troops. ANZAC biscuits and tobacco were also gifted to those fighting. As they didn't have the opportunity to actively participate in the war, women found other ways to throw their support behind the troops . Wives and mothers assumed what were known as comfort roles during WWI while looking after the household and children . More than 60,000 Australian men lost their lives during battle, pictured here are soldiers in Liverpool, NSW before they departed . Women enjoyed a greater sense of autonomy within society while scores of men were on the battlefields . In the home the women stepped up into traditionally male roles, and had a greater sense of autonomy within society. 'In many households women took the dual role of mother and head of the household in the absence of men', Professor Macintyre said. However when, or if, the men returned, there was a strong push towards restoring traditional gender roles. Professor Macintyre, who is one of Australia's most influential public intellectuals, whose most widely known work is the History of Wars, which focuses on various aspects of war history in Australia but also worldwide. However they were expected to move back in to traditional gender roles once, or if, the men returned . One in ten soldiers, seen here cleaning their rifles in the trenches, never made it home . The Red Cross was one of the charities which many women volunteered for . Post-war, despite the expectation for women to assume their gendered roles, some war widows would not have that opportunity and would be raising their children as single parents. Small towns were left with gaping holes in their populations when men didn’t return and people often lost many men from the one family. There were also the husbands and sons who returned from battle so damaged that they simply couldn't cope with the demons from war and were unable to care for themselves, let alone their offspring. Many men who returned suffered deep physical and mental scars from the war . Reunions were held at the end of the war, like this one in Georgetown, South Australia .","One in ten Australian men never returned home from battle .
