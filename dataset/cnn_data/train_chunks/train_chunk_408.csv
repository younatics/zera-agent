"Argentina's bid to host a Formula One race for the first time in more than a decade is under way after work started on a new circuit outside the capital Buenos Aires. The $100 million project is expected to be completed in two stages by the end of 2014. It is being built by global design firm Populous, which helped redevelop Britain's Silverstone circuit. ""We are really proud to contribute with our design to create a new destination for F1, which always means an economic catalyst for the area and produces global exposure,"" said the company's associate principal John Rhodes. ""During the last five years we have developed technology, software, and design techniques through the use of simulation to physically test the design of a circuit. ""These pioneering techniques have enabled the creation of a topographically exciting and challenging medium-speed circuit on what was a relatively square and flat 63-hectare site."" Ground was broken on the Velociudad Speedcity site, situated 80 kilometers from Buenos Aires, on Friday. The first phase of construction, expected to last 14 months, will include a 3.1-kilometer track, pit lane, garages and an off-road track. The second will extend the circuit to 4.7 kilometers in order to qualify for a race licence. Populous, which is also working on a possible F1 project in the Indian city of Mumbai, said the Argentine development would require the movement of one million cubic meters of soil. The Argentine Grand Prix was held from 1953 to 1998 at Buenos Aires' Autodromo Juan y Oscar Galvez circuit. The last race there was won by Ferrari's Michael Schumacher, who at that stage had won two of his record seven world titles -- the next would come in 2000.","Work begins on constructing a new racing circuit in Argentina .

"A Japanese governor has approved a measure to allow for the relocation of a controversial U.S. military base on Okinawa, breaking 17 years of stagnation on the base's transfer plan, the government of Okinawa said Friday. The Okinawa prefecture's Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima on Friday approved a landfill proposal by the Japanese central government that will permit the construction of new military facilities in a sparsely populated area. The Pentagon praised the move. ""This decision comes after many years of sustained effort between the United States and Japan, and it is the most significant milestone achieved in these realignment efforts so far,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a written statement, which the Pentagon initially attributed to Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, before correcting it. ""The realignment effort is absolutely critical to the United States' ongoing rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region and our ability to maintain a geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable force posture in the region."" The Futenma air base, which is in a highly populated area, has been unpopular with the island's residents due to crimes committed by U.S. military personnel and allegations against them in the past. Many residents were incensed by the rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl in 1995 by three U.S. military personnel. It sparked some of the worst anti-U.S. military demonstrations seen in Japan in decades. In 2002, a U.S. staff sergeant in the Air Force was convicted of raping a Japanese woman in a parking lot outside a popular nightclub in Okinawa. Intense media coverage of the case brought pressure on the Japanese government to review its agreement with the United States about handling criminal cases in Japan involving the U.S. military. And allegations that a Marine raped a 14-year-old girl caused a furor in 2008. The girl later decided not to pursue charges. In 2012, three U.S. servicemen were arrested in connection with rapes in Okinawa. About half of all U.S. military personnel in Japan are stationed on the island. The stagnation of the relocation issue has been a thorn in the side of relations between Tokyo and Washington since 1996 when the two governments agreed on the original plan to move the base. Nakaima, the governor, also implied that escalating tension with neighboring countries pushed Okinawa to cooperate with the central government. ""Regardless the will of the Okinawa people, the tension is heightening on (the) international front. Okinawa needs to play a certain role for that,"" he said. Okinawa administers the Senkaku Isands, a flash point in a territorial dispute between Japan and China. China claims them as territory and calls them the Diaoyu Islands.","The Pentagon praises the move as a ""significant milestone""

"Rapid City, South Dakota (CNN) -- Walid Shoebat had a blunt message for the roughly 300 South Dakota police officers and sheriff's deputies who gathered to hear him warn about the dangers of Islamic radicalism. Terrorism and Islam are inseparable, he tells them. All U.S. mosques should be under scrutiny. ""All Islamic organizations in America should be the No. 1 enemy. All of them,"" he says. It's a message Shoebat is selling based on his own background as a Palestinian-American convert to conservative Christianity. Born in the West Bank, the son of an American mother, he says he was a Palestinian Liberation Organization terrorist in his youth who helped firebomb an Israeli bank in Bethlehem and spent time in an Israeli jail. That billing helps him land speaking engagements like a May event in Rapid City -- a forum put on by the state Office of Homeland Security, which paid Shoebat $5,000 for the appearance. He's a darling on the church and university lecture circuit, with his speeches, books and video sales bringing in $500,000-plus in 2009, according to tax records. ""Being an ex-terrorist myself is to understand the mindset of a terrorist,"" Shoebat told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" But CNN reporters in the United States, Israel and the Palestinian territories found no evidence that would support that biography. Neither Shoebat nor his business partner provided any proof of Shoebat's involvement in terrorism, despite repeated requests. Back in his hometown of Beit Sahour, outside Bethlehem, relatives say they can't understand how Shoebat could turn so roundly on his family and his faith. ""I have never heard anything about Walid being a mujahedeen or a terrorist,"" said Daood Shoebat, who says he is Walid Shoebat's fourth cousin. ""He claims this for his own personal reasons."" CNN's Jerusalem bureau went to great lengths trying to verify Shoebat's story. The Tel Aviv headquarters of Bank Leumi had no record of a firebombing at its now-demolished Bethlehem branch. Israeli police had no record of the bombing, and the prison where Shoebat says he was held ""for a few weeks"" for inciting anti-Israel demonstrations says it has no record of him being incarcerated there either. Shoebat says he was never charged because he was a U.S. citizen. ""I was born by an American mother,"" he said. ""The other conspirators in the act ended up in jail. I ended up released."" He said his own family has vouched for his prison time. But relatives CNN spoke to described him as a ""regular kid"" who left home at 18, eventually becoming a computer programmer in the United States. Shoebat, now in his 50s, says he converted to Christianity in 1993 and began spreading the word about the dangers of Islam. He has been interviewed as a terrorism expert on several television programs, including a handful of appearances on CNN and its sister network, HLN, in 2006 and 2007. Since al Qaeda's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, expertise on terrorism has been in high demand. The federal Department of Homeland Security has spent nearly $40 million on counterterrorism training since 2006. The department doesn't keep track of how much goes to speakers, nor does it advise officials on the speakers hired by states and municipalities. Shoebat spoke at a 2010 conference in South Dakota and was so well-received that he was invited back for the May event in Rapid City, according to state officials. He warned the police and first responders gathered in the hotel conference rooms that the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah had operatives working in Mexico and that drug cartels were raising money with Islamic groups. He also asserted that federal agents could have prevented the 9/11 attacks by looking for a chafed spot, called ""zabibah,"" that sometimes forms on the foreheads of devout Muslims. ""You need ex-terrorists who can tell you what life is like and what thinking is like of potential terrorists,"" Shoebat said. ""But had we looked at the zabibah only, we would have deflected a suicide action of killing 3,000 Americans."" But Shoebat also told the group there were 17 hijackers when there were 19. And perhaps more surprising from a man who bills himself as a terror expert, Shoebat said the Transportation Security Administration could have stopped them. The TSA wasn't created until after the 9-11 attacks. Jim Carpenter, South Dakota's homeland security director, said Shoebat brought ""a point of view that certainly is not mainstream."" ""He brings in commentary about living and being raised as a Muslim and converting over to Christianity -- gives them a different aspect of breaking the mold, so to speak,"" Carpenter said. But he said Shoebat's appearance was ""a small portion"" of the two-and-a-half-day conference. ""It's not like we're talking about setting up training and a discipline we would follow, that this is the only way and that's the particular point of view of a Muslim or somebody of the Islamic faith. That's not the case,"" Carpenter said. ""That's his point of view."" Carpenter said there is ""no fear of threat"" from Islamic terrorism in South Dakota, where the last census reports showed the state's Muslim community made up less than one-half of 1 percent of the population. According to Rapid City's local newspaper, about two dozen Muslims live in the city. During Shoebat's presentation, he criticized Muslim organizations and told audience members to be leery of Muslim doctors, engineers, students and mosques. ""Now, we aren't saying every single mosque is potential terrorist headquarters. But if you look at certain reports by the Hudson report, 80 percent of mosques they found pamphlets and education on jihad. So they're in the mosque, the mosque in accordance to the Muslim brotherhood is the command post and center."" The conservative Hudson Institute said it never issued such a report and has no idea why its name was invoked. Shoebat warned that making special accommodations for Muslim beliefs was a step toward establishing Islamic religious law. And he recounted how he wore a T-shirt that read ""Profile me"" on a trip to the airport and approached the screeners at the security checkpoint. ""I got tapped down, I got checked, I got all these different things,"" he said. ""I say it's wonderful."" Shoebat and business partner Keith Davies run several foundations and three websites that are all linked. Shoebat said the major group, the Forum for Middle East Understanding, includes his own Walid Shoebat Foundation. In tax records filed by Davies, the Forum for Middle East Understanding reported 2009 earnings from speaking engagements, videos and book sales of more than $560,000. The documents are thin on specifics, and so is Shoebat. ""Basically, we are in information, and we do speaking and we do also helping Christians that are being persecuted in countries like Pakistan, and we help Christians that are suffering all throughout the Middle East,"" he said. Asked how they do that, he said, ""None of your business"" -- adding that disclosing details could endanger people he was trying to help in Islamic countries that have laws against blasphemy. Shoebat's name doesn't appear on any of the paperwork. As for his own salary, he said he makes ""probably what a gas station makes or a garage makes."" ""Everybody thinks I'm just raking in the dough, which is absolutely incorrect,"" he said. He referred details to Davies, who offered to provide a copy of the group's tax returns -- but didn't. When asked who served on the foundation's board of advisers, Davies gave ""Anderson Cooper 360"" the name of a former pilot, who didn't return phone calls. But he could not name the high-ranking military officers he said were on the board. Federal officials say they don't know exactly how much money has gone to speakers like Shoebat. But in April, the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee raised concerns about ""vitriolic diatribes"" being delivered by ""self-appointed counterterrorism experts"" at similar seminars. Sen. Susan Collins, the committee's Republican chairwoman, and Connecticut Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman asked the department to account for how much federal grant money went to state and local counterterrorism programs and what standards guided those grants. The request followed reports by the liberal Political Research Associates and the Washington Monthly that raised similar questions. The Homeland Security Department told CNN that it has standards -- and if training programs don't meet them, ""corrective action will be taken."" ""We have not and will not tolerate training programs -- or any DHS-supported program -- that rely on racial or ethnic profiling,"" the agency said in a written statement. Kevin Flower and Enas I.

"Using shovels, heavy machinery and their bare hands, rescue workers scrambled through piles of rubble to find survivors Monday after a deadly 7.2-magnitude earthquake devastated parts of eastern Turkey. The death toll has risen to 279, with another 1,300 injured, Turkey's semi-official Anatolian news agency reported, citing the country's disaster management authority. Some 970 buildings are demolished. There have been conflicting reports about the number of dead, however. Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin said Monday that as many as 264 people were dead, while Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay put the death toll at 239. It was difficult to tally the number of injured, Health Minister Recep Akdag said, because many were being treated and released. The military was assisting with search-and-rescue efforts, Atalay said. Numerous aftershocks -- the largest a magnitude 6.0 -- rattled eastern Turkey, one of the nation's poorest areas. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 55 buildings collapsed in Ercis on the north shore of Lake Van. The Turkish Red Crescent said about 25 apartment buildings and a student dormitory collapsed in the town. A health services building also collapsed, along with part of a hospital, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. The injured were being treated in the hospital's garden. ""People are really scared,"" CNN Turk reporter Nevsin Mengu said from Van. ""The survivors are now trying to survive the cold weather."" Rescuers and survivors contended with near-freezing temperatures early Monday. Some people collected wood from collapsed buildings to burn for warmth, Mengu said. She said many residents are not returning to their houses, opting instead to sleep on rooftops or in the streets. It was not clear whether their homes were uninhabitable or they were just too frightened. Electricity and natural gas were off in most of the city, but Atalay said officials hope to restore power in Van and Ercis by Monday night. Trucks carrying medical aid and food were seen driving into Van. But rescue teams had not reached some of the smaller villages in the area, Mengu said. One man, stuck in the fetal position under a large piece of debris, was visible only through a small hole in the rubble. The man appeared weak and exhausted after rescuers pulled him out, his clothes torn. At one point, rescue workers halted operations to try to hear whether anyone was knocking for help. Are you there? Submit your pictures or video . The Red Crescent called for rescue workers, machinery and drinking water. A crisis center was set up by the country's Health Ministry in the Turkish capital of Ankara. By Monday, more than 2,300 emergency personnel were in the region, Atalay said. Tents and rescue teams have come from as far away as Iran and Azerbaijan. The crisis center said Sunday that 29 surrounding towns had sent help and medical helicopters were taking the injured for treatment in other provinces. Thirty-seven patients were taken to Ankara, Atalay said Monday. Two tent hospitals were being set up in Ercis on Sunday, and two cargo planes were dispatched from the capital carrying medical teams and aid. Erdogan and Akdag arrived in the area Sunday, according to the Ministry of Health's crisis center. Israel offered Turkey ""any help it may require"" after the earthquake, Defense Minister Ehud Barak's office said. Israel and Turkey, once close allies, saw a deterioration in relations in a dispute over an Israeli naval commando raid on the Gaza-bound ship Mavi Marmara, in which nine Turkish activists were killed. A spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the country, while grateful for offers of aid, is prepared to handle the disaster on its own. Turkey is ""no stranger to having these seismic events,"" but Sunday's quake is considered major, CNN Meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said. A magnitude-7.6 earthquake in Izmit, Turkey, killed more than 17,000 people in 1999, according to the United States Geological Survey.  A magnitude-7.2 tremor in Duzce the same year killed 894 people, the agency reported. Sunday's major quake struck at 1:41 p.m. local time and was centered about 12 miles from Van, the agency said.","The death toll has risen to 279, Anatolian news agency reports .

"He's broken every record in the book and won a glut of Olympic and world titles, but even at the age of 40, Haile Gebrselassie has no intention of resting on his laurels. ""A day without running is not a good day,"" the Ethiopian athletics legend told CNN's Human to Hero Series. ""Running, you continue until you die."" Which spells bad news for his fellow competitors, although Gebrselassie does acknowledge he will have to call it quits at some stage. ""Competition stops somewhere, but when I don't know,"" he says. ""What I'm thinking now, is that I want to break all the Masters records -- over 40, over 50, over 60. ""I don't know how long I'm going to live after this, but I hope the next 100 years!"" he adds, breaking into his trademark grin. ""The smiling assassin"" -- as he was once famously dubbed -- has been dispatching his opponents with  ruthless efficiency for over two decades and is hugely popular wherever he runs, not least among his  dedicated following of Ethiopian fans bedecked in their country's green, yellow and red. ""Haile, Haile"" will be the chant as their hero winds up the pace before unleashing his trademark blistering finish to leave rivals trailing. His longtime Dutch manager Jos Hermens summed it up perfectly: ""His smile makes athletics smile."" Throughout his glittering career stretching over two decades, Gebrselassie has proved an impeccable ambassador for track and field. Despite increasing business commitments, he is finding time to pass on that experience to pass on to the next generation -- acting as a mentor for 14 young athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds for the G4S 4teen program ahead of the London 2012 Olympics. Those youngsters, who came from around the world, would do well to heed his renowned sportsmanship, because win or lose it was always with that smile on his face. ""Of course there is disappointment when you lose a race,"" he told CNN. ""For me, it's in my character, maybe I can say good character. I am always joyful."" Glittering career . Disappointments have proved few and far between since his first competitive race at the age of 14 and while still in his teens he captured a 5,000/10,000 meters double at the world junior championships in Seoul. The next year in 1993 saw Gebrselassie's senior breakthrough as he claimed the first of four straight 10,000m world championship titles after a battle royal with Kenyan Moses Tanui in Stuttgart. His world-record-breaking spree started in 1994,  covering distances from 2,000m on an indoor track to the full 42 km of the marathon. Watch: The best long distance runner ever? Gebrselassie rates his 5,000m performance at the Weltklasse meeting in Zurich in 1995 as his ""most memorable achievement"" -- he smashed the record of Kenya's Moses Kiptanui by nearly 11 seconds with a time of 12 minutes 44.39 seconds. ""That was amazing,"" he said. Metronomically lapping the 400m track at just over four-minute mile pace for over three miles, he says that as he ran the beat of the 1995 hit song ""Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)"" kept ringing around his head. ""It's nice music, if's fast written, that's why I could break a world record, by that music,"" he recalls. ""I'm a Scatman! Dum dum and then you know the timing and at the same time your style changes immediately."" Olympic gold . Gebrselassie won his first Olympic gold at Atlanta '96 over his favored 10,000m distance, just edging out his arch-rival Paul Tergat. Four years later, in Sydney, he became only the third man in history to retain that title -- the Kenyan again the victim. ""I won that race nine-hundredths of a second from Paul Tergat. That was really the one still I love to watch. It was a very special moment."" By the time the 2004 Olympics came around, the balance of power had shifted to his compatriot Kenenisa Bekele, and Gebreselassie came fifth as he missed out on a hat-trick, but by then he had already turned to road running and marathons. Olympic gold over the classic distance has eluded him; he decided against competing in the marathon in Beijing in 2008 because of the air quality, and was controversially left out of the Ethiopian team for the London Games last year. But over distances from 10 km through half-marathon and the full marathon, the records have tumbled. Successive wins in the Berlin marathon in 2007 and 2008 each came with world bests, the second of two hours three minutes and 59 seconds -- the first man under the two hours four minute mark. Scatman rhythm . For the longer distances, he says the Scatman John tune is replaced by the need to set the perfect pace and to keep a close eye on the opposition, often years younger. ""You are just thinking about your race. Who is next to you, who is behind you, who's in the race, how fast does he run, what is the way breathes,"" he reveals. ""When you run a marathon especially, the first 15k they're perfect, but the things happen after 20k. You can look and see, 'Oh this guy, now he's getting tired,' so it's easy to beat him."" Years of disciplined training, getting up at 5 a.m. each morning, have left Gebrselassie a battle-hardened veteran and have helped him in his life outside of track and field. Watch: Gebrselassie dominates Dubai marathon . Two grueling training sessions are interspersed by a day spent in his office -- he employs over 500 people in range of enterprises based right across Ethiopia. He is usually in bed by 10 p.m. after spending time with his wife and family -- he has a son and three daughters. Gebrselassie certainly knew the value of hard work from his formative years, growing up in humble surroundings in the town of Asella in Arsi Province, living nearly 2,500m above sea level. One of 10 children, he used to run several kilometers each day to school and back to his family's small farm. Early inspiration . Inspired from an early age by the 5,000/10,000 Olympic double of great Ethiopian runner Miruts ""The Shifter"" Yifter in the 1980 Moscow Games -- ""I was dreaming to be like him"" -- Gebrselassie acknowledges that his environment was the perfect platform. ""We live at altitude, we were born in altitude,"" he says. ""Going to school, helping our parents, fetching water from the river. My training started when I was two. It was part of my life."" But Gebrselassie is concerned that the neverending trail of talent from his country, characterized by the likes of Bekele and women's champion Tirunesh Dibaba, could be under threat from increased affluence -- welcome though that is in a country which has suffered so much. ""Life is changing a little bit. That's why it's very difficult to produce more long-distance runners from Ethiopia,"" he says. ""The more good things you have, the less athletes you have. You don't see so much athletes from Addis Ababa (the capital). You don't see so much athletes from the city, most of our athletes they come from the countryside."" With his ambassadorial work, Gebrselassie is doing his best to make sure the conveyor belt of champions continues for a while yet. Role model . ""It's important to inspire people. Without a role model it's not an easy job,"" he says. ""I'm teaching everybody how they become successful. One is to be disciplined. Second, commitment or a goal, and third is hard work."" He has one key message to his youngsters and the wider public: ""Win for yourself."" ""What is that?  Sometimes you know people promise to stop smoking, to stop drinking, to stop taking drugs. But they, after one day or after two days, they cannot, which means they've lost for themselves. ""I ask people win themselves first, which means you can win anything that you dream, that you plan, what you want. This really is my tip for everyone."" Allied to his incredible talent and will to win, Gebrselassie has certainly ""won for himself"" in bundles down the years -- dominating distance running and becoming one of the most recognizable sportsman on the planet. Judging by his recent performances -- winner of April's Vienna half-marathon, third in a world-class Manchester 10 km last month and smashing the best for a 40-year-old at the distance -- Gebrselassie will be delighting his fans for a few more years to come as he sticks to his endearing philosophy for life.","Running superstar Haile Gebrselassie has broken 27 world records .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- There was a smile, a quick wave hello, a brief chat. Yet, despite the exchange of pleasantries, the simmering tensions between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and one of the nation's most powerful clerics became quickly evident at a major ceremony in Tehran on Monday. From left: former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Sadeq Larijani and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ahmadinejad and former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani were attending the inauguration of Sadeq Larijani -- brother of Iran's prominent parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani -- who was tapped by Iran's supreme leader to be the new judiciary chief. It was only the second time Ahmadinejad and his political rival Rafsanjani, a reformist who has been a vocal critic of the hard-line regime in place, sat under the same roof since the disputed June 12 elections drew a rift among Iran's Islamic leadership, Iranian media reported. Photos from the scene show Ahmadinejad exchanging friendly waves with Rafsanjani and Sadeq Larijani, who was wedged between the rivals. The three appeared to be chatting amicably before Larijani made his acceptance speech. Just minutes later, Ahmadinejad alluded to Rafsanjani, one of the richest men in Iran, in a searing address that called for the prosecution of ""the power-holders and the wealthy,"" state-run Press TV reported. But the president, who showed up more than an hour late for the ceremony, hustled out of the ceremony when Rafsanjani, the head of the Assembly of Experts that is in charge of selecting the supreme leader, took the podium, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA), which is aligned with Rafsanjani. The bad blood between the two high-profile figures goes back to the 2005 presidential race, when Ahmadinejad defeated Rafsanjani. This time around, Rafsanjani supported Ahmadinejad's chief rival, opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi, in the race. Iran's election authority declared Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner of the race, sparking hundreds of thousands of Iranians to take to the streets in protest. While hundreds have been released, the Islamic government has been prosecuting opposition figures en masse. Supporters of the trials have focused their rhetoric on Moussavi, fellow reformist Mehdi Karrubi and Rafsanjani, accusing the leaders of instigating post-election unrest and calling for charges against them. During his speech at Sadeq Larijani's inauguration Monday, Rafsanjani warned against the consequences of ""unjust"" verdicts in the trials, saying poor treatment of the detainees will cause society to ""descend into chaos,"" Press TV reported . ""In the case of delivering fair verdicts, society will have a sense of security,"" Rafsanjani said, according to Press TV, ""and no one will feel helpless in asserting his violated rights."" The treatment of detainees at Iran's prisons has increasingly become a divisive issue within Iran's Islamic leadership, as reformists continue to accuse the government of allowing abuse and torture in attempts to coerce false confessions. The newly appointed judiciary chief admitted to deficiencies in the judicial system and pledged to prosecute those who ""violated people's rights,"" Press TV reported.","Two seem cordial at inauguration of Iran's new judiciary chief .

"I am a Russian-speaking Ukrainian. I am ethnically half-Russian, as my father was born in Siberia. I spent much of my life in Donetsk, a Russian-speaking area of Ukraine. Now I live in Kiev. My kids speak Ukrainian in school and with many of their friends, and we speak Russian at home. When my son's fourth-grade teacher talks to me, she speaks Ukrainian. I respond in Russian. We don't even notice that our conversation is in two languages. I understand Ukrainian but don't speak it as easily as I speak English. I just never had any pressure to learn it. In Lviv, in the western part of Ukraine, most speak primarily Ukrainian, but even there, I never had anybody look down on me for my Russian. In the eastern and southern regions, many people speak Russian, and there is absolutely no forced ""Ukraineization."" You might be asking what all this fuss is about in Crimea, the autonomous region of eastern Ukraine with strong ties to Russia. Why are thousands coming to the streets with Russian flags? It's easy to explain. Tracking the crisis in Ukraine as it unfolds . Many people in Crimea and eastern Ukraine don't want the protection of Russian President Vladimir Putin. But there are some who are afraid of forced Ukraineization because they have been fed propaganda by Russian TV channels for years. The purpose is to convince Ukrainians that we are divided, not one country, and that the safest course of action for Russian-speaking areas is to break away and join Russia. These ideas have been cultivated since I was a child. I remember when I lived in Donetsk in the '90s, how scared we were that a candidate from western Ukraine would win an election and force us to speak Ukrainian. But when I moved out of the area of aggressive Russian information, I quickly realized I can speak Russian in Kiev or Lviv and no one will ever be upset with me! Over our 22 years of Ukrainian independence, fears of language or ethnic persecution have never come true. But they were kept alive by Russian propaganda. We understand that Putin is trying to escalate tension and provoke civil war in Ukraine right now. He can't afford for a free Ukraine to succeed: His own people might get an idea that it's possible to overthrow a tyrant and build a prosperous country. U.N. Security Council meets to discuss Ukraine crisis . Putin won't succeed. Ukrainians are wiser than that and won't kill each other over the nonexistent problem of language. To demonstrate that, last week, people in Lviv (traditionally Ukrainian-speaking) spoke only Russian all day, and in response, those in Donetsk (traditionally Russian-speaking) spoke Ukrainian! No civil war in Ukraine, Mr. Putin! It must be getting harder to justify the presence of military force to ""protect"" people when nobody is in danger. I just talked to my friends in Crimea. Yuri in Simferopol told me that it's a handful of pro-Russian extremists in the streets trying to make a scene for Russian video cameras -- they are showing that these are the Russians who request protection! Meanwhile, the rest of the city is terrified by the presence of Russian military forces and are evacuating their families to central or western Ukraine. I got a similar report from Luda in Kharkov. She said that a large group of Russians were brought across the border by buses, and they were the ones inspiring and instigating unrest that resulted in putting a Russian flag on a municipal building. The amount of propaganda Russia has poured onto Ukraine is hard to comprehend. Putting troops on Ukrainian land is going to bring the very opposite result from what Putin expected: I believe it's uniting Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia and Putin are getting into deeper isolation from the world as more and more countries are recalling their ambassadors from Russia and condemning the government's actions. Good job, Mr. Putin! Thank you from all of us Ukrainians (Russian and Ukrainian-speaking) for uniting Ukraine against your military aggression. Are you in Ukraine? Have you witnessed the unrest there? Share your stories with CNN iReport, but please stay safe.","Ukrainian Maia Mikhaluk has been documenting the unrest in her country .

"A new report suggests adult women are nearly half of all video game players. That's a number that can be read in the changing tone of some of today's top games. But it's also one that some female gamers say isn't really as close to even as it should be. According to the ""2013 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry"" report, produced by the  Entertainment Software Association, 45% of all game players, and 46% of the most frequent  purchasers of games, are female. Adult women make up 31% of the game-playing population. ""This new data underscores the remarkable upward trajectory for video games. It is an entertainment  form enjoyed by hundreds of millions of consumers worldwide,"" said Michael D. Gallagher, president and CEO of ESA, the trade association that represents the U.S. video game industry. ""A diverse and energized consumer base, remarkable new hardware, and outstanding software all combine to foster growth for our industry."" Female gamers are obviously a diverse group. Millions enjoy the shooters, strategy games and other titles favored by ""hardcore"" enthusiasts. Millions more have eased into the gaming world via social and smartphone games, or through family interactions. One of the top reasons why people buy video games is an interesting storyline, according to the report. And some women have pointed to a rise in the number of games with complex themes and more scenarios that call for decision-making, not brute force, as a selling point. And it doesn't hurt that many of those same titles have begun to include female protagonists, or at least the ability to create your own. 'Lady game creators' meet up on Twitter . ""Today's game characters are much more customizable than years ago,"" said Lauren Eleazer, 26, from State College, Pennsylvania.  ""This is part of overall game development, but every female gamer I've met appreciates being able to style her character and make it more unique."" Jessica Chobot, a television and Web show host whose work has appeared on gaming site IGN, the G4 network and elsewhere, said the industry has been taking notice of the rise of female gamers, and that the inclusion of female characters in meaningful roles is no accident. ""In a lot of ways, it was the perfect storm for change,"" said Chobot, who is also a writer for the Zombie Studios game, ""Daylight."" ""The gaming industry's awareness of having to appeal to a wider audience -- one that included women -- has been reflected with the addition of stronger female characters. ""The 2013 re-vamped 'Lara Croft,' 'Mass Effect's female version of Commander Shepard and 'Uncharted''s Elena Fisher and Chloe Frazer are just a few examples that come to mind."" Other strong female characters, like Elizabeth in ""BioShock Infinite"" or Ellie in ""The Last of Us,"" show the range developers are willing to put in their games to attract a wider audience and provide a different experience from games in the past. Upcoming games like ""Beyond: Two Souls"" and a new ""Mirror's Edge"" appear that they'll continue to put women in the forefront of gaming action and narrative. But, sometimes, it's the little things that can help draw more women into the gaming fold. ""Control schemes need to do more to take into account people who didn't grow up with a controller in their hands,"" said Colleen Hannon, a senior editor for the website Gamers With Jobs. ""I'm not saying make the game easier; I'm saying give people who need to learn those basic skills a path to learn that doesn't belittle or sideline them."" The sustained and growing pop-culture presence of video games also has been a boon for developers looking to add women to their player bases. ""I think this issue is cultural,"" said Shannon Gagnon, 28, from Scranton, Pennsylvania. ""Since being a geek has become something to be proud of, instead of something to hide, more of my female friends are becoming gamers. But they don't see a lot of games they are interested in, because mostly when you see games advertised it is 'Call of Duty' or 'World of Warcraft.' "" A majority of gamers play games with their family -- 16% play with parents, 32% play with other family members and 16% play with their spouse or significant other. That widening acceptance of gaming is also helping women feel like they belong. ""I've noticed the biggest difference in attitude coming from non-gamers, especially other women, who once found my pastime silly,"" said Audrey Epple, from Macon, Georgia. ""Now, they seem more accepting. It has become the norm."" But despite those cultural shifts, talk to many female gamers and you'll hear stories about a darker side of the hobby -- a persistent ""boy's club"" mentality that sometimes manifests itself in ugly ways. Story after story recounts female gamers who, once they ventured into gaming circles beyond family and friends, faced mockery, dismissive attitudes and even abuse from their peers. In one recent story making the rounds in online gaming circles, a girl went into a certain game's online community, asking about its mechanics. The first response she got was from a male player, telling her he'd answer if she performed a sex act on him. Harassment of women in online gaming forums is prevalent enough that there's even a derogatory term -- ""white knight"" -- for male members who step up to defend them -- the suggestion being that they're only doing so to gain favor with the woman involved. ""Age of the other gamer makes quite a difference,"" said Eleazer. ""Older gamers tend to be respectful of female gamers ... . Anyone 15 or younger doesn't get it, but I blame that on maturity."" Chobot says that kind of attitude is beginning to fade, but that it ""hasn't quite changed just yet."" ""More and more women can be found in high profile and strong roles within the industry,"" she said. ""Yet, just recently, the comment was made to me, 'You're just a host, right? You don't really play games.' "" Hannon, of Gamers With Jobs, said she thinks the way games are marketed plays a role. ""There are more women over 18 playing games now than boys under 17,"" she said. ""But you wouldn't be able to tell by the contents and comment sections of most game publications, the language/behavior of their fellow players online, or the game design, marketing materials and tactics of most game publishers and developers."" Gagnon said trolls will be trolls, especially during competitive, multi-player games. However, she does think game companies could do more to crack down on the abuse. ""I realize these trolls set out to mock any and all gamers and it's not solely focused on female gamers,"" she said. ""But it certainly feels as if I am being singled out."" There's no reason to think the gaming industry won't have more and more of those female gamers to think about in the years to come. The ESA shows that 35% of parents are playing computer and video games with their children every week and 58% are playing with them at least once a month. The computer and video game industry as a whole had $14.8 billion in sales in 2012, according to the ESA report. Given that women are 46% of that purchasing audience, there is a great incentive for game developers to keep women in mind. They say they aren't looking for special treatment, aren't asking for female-only games and, in many cases, don't even like to be differentiated as ""girl gamers."" Instead, they say, they want to be entertained, to be challenged, to have fun -- just like the guys. ""More women are getting involved, both behind the scenes and as educated consumers,"" Chobot said. ""The boys' club attitude in gaming needed to stop yesterday.""","Report: Almost half of video game players in U.S. are female .

In gaming circles, though, some say ""boys' club"" mentality persists .

"He's the war-ending President who, as of Tuesday, has ordered airstrikes in seven different countries (that we know of). President Barack Obama has always acknowledged there are times when military force is necessary. Even when he accepted his Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, he said there could be instances when war is ""morally justified."" But though he campaigned for the presidency on ending U.S.-led wars, Obama's administration has certainly been willing to use force when it sees fit. Here are seven places where the Obama administration is known to have ordered airstrikes: . Afghanistan . America's longest war became Obama's responsibility when he took office in 2009, and like his predecessor he has ordered airstrikes against suspected militant targets in the country. The air campaign -- which has utilized both manned aircraft and unmanned drones -- has been a major sticking point between the U.S. and the local government, which has decried the high civilian death toll. In May Obama announced a plan to withdraw most American forces from Afghanistan by the end of this year, leaving behind a force of about 10,000 to maintain security and train Afghan forces. With a new Afghan president finally confirmed, U.S. officials expect the long-awaited Bilateral Security Agreement to be signed soon, permitting the residual U.S. force. Pakistan . Like in Afghanistan, militants have been targeted by U.S. drones flying over Pakistan, causing similar uproar when they strike civilians rather than suspected Taliban outposts. Obama acknowledged that concern during a major speech at the National Defense University in 2013, saying that U.S. strikes that kill civilians could have the effect of spurring radicalization. Libya . In March 2011, Obama announced the U.S. would join allied nations to launch air strikes on Libya. The move came after a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing use of force to protect Libyan civilians, and though regime change wasn't Obama's stated goal at the beginning of the campaign, the airstrikes ended with the death of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Since then the security situation in Libya has deteriorated. In 2012, four Americans were killed during an attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, and in July of this year, the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli was evacuated. Yemen . Facing threats from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Obama administration significantly ramped-up the use of armed drones. Nearly 100 attacks have occurred since 2009, according to estimates from the New American Foundation, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of militants, but also many civilians. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen has been a nexus of threats against the U.S., including the so called ""underwear bomber"" who tried to ignite explosives on a U.S.-bound airliner in 2009. Somalia . U.S. drones have targeted militants associated with al Shabaab, a terrorist network that perpetrated a high-profile attack last year at a mall in Kenya. Earlier this month, the U.S. targeted the group's leader Ahmed Godane using commandos aided by drones, killing him in an area south of Mogadishu. Iraq . Citing a humanitarian crisis and potential threats to American interests, Obama ordered airstrikes to begin in Iraq in August, becoming the fourth president in a row to order airstrikes there. The Iraqi government, outmatched by ISIS fighters taking over broad swaths of land, welcomed the strikes. The campaign broadened in September, when Obama announced he would begin targeting ISIS specifically. Instead of seeking specific authorization from lawmakers, Obama said he would rely on a Congressional authorization from 2011 that allowed the President to go after al Qaeda. Syria . Obama's latest front for airstrikes has been gripped by civil war for more than three years. Obama came to the brink of ordering airstrikes there in 2013, after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on civilians. But after Congress balked, Obama backed away, brokering instead a deal to rid al-Assad of his chemical stockpiles. How Obama came to launch strikes in Syria . A year later, facing a different threat in Syria in the form of ISIS and the al Qaeda offshoot Khorasan, Obama authorized airstrikes on terrorist targets alongside a coalition of other Arab states. Officials say the mission to defeat those groups won't be won in day. Instead they're predicting a sustained effort that will surely be left for the next commander in chief to carry forward.

"(CNN)An Israeli border police officer has been detained in connection with the shooting death of a Palestinian teenager, an arrest that a human rights advocate described as ""incredibly rare."" The police officer was arrested Tuesday, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. And on Wednesday, a judge extended the officer's detention six more days, according to a court order. Siam Nowarah, the father of the late 16-year-old Nadeem Nowarah, called the arrest ""a step in the right direction."" At the same time, he noted the police officer still has not been formally charged, much less convicted and sentenced. ""When this gets in the court of law, then Israel has the chance to prove to the world that it is not above the law,"" the father said. ""There can't be two laws for two people, meaning if an Israeli killed a Palestinian, would he get the same amount of prison time (as a Palestinian who killed an Israeli)?"" His son was one of two teenagers killed in the West Bank community of Beitunya on May 15, the anniversary of the ""Nakba,"" the exodus of more than 700,000 Palestinians after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. Father blames Israeli military in Palestinian teens' deaths . Cameras that Fakher Zayed set up around his four-story Beitunya house showed Nowarah suddenly falling forward, landing briefly on his hands, then rolling over to lie on his back. Within seconds, a crowd of Palestinians gathered to lift Nowarah and rush him to a waiting ambulance. According to a medical report, Nowarah was pronounced dead in a hospital less than two hours later, having suffered a single bullet wound that entered his chest and passed out his back. CNN producer Kareem Khadder filmed the same clashes -- including video showing two Israeli security troops firing their rifles at Palestinian protesters at the same exact moment that Nowarah was shot. In that video, it is not clear what kind of rounds the Israelis were shooting or whether their gunfire hit Nowarah. However, Khadder's camera shows that less than 15 seconds after one of these gunshots, Palestinians were already racing to put the fatally wounded Nowarah in the ambulance. After a CNN report on the incident, the Israeli military suspended a soldier shown firing that day at demonstrators, according to an Israeli military source who asked not to be identified because of the continuing investigation. The source said the suspended soldier worked for the military's communications department and was not supposed to be shooting at all. It was not immediately clear what connection, if any, this soldier had to the arrested border police officer. Source: Israel suspends soldier after Palestinian deaths . Security cameras captured the second fatal shooting that day of a Palestinian teen -- 17-year-old Mohammad Odeh Salameh -- just before 3 p.m., showing him suddenly fall to the ground just steps from where Nowarah was wounded. Doctors pronounced Salameh dead on arrival at the hospital, with a bullet wound that had pierced his back and exited his chest. No arrests have been made in connection with Salameh's death. ""The investigation is continuing,"" Rosenfeld said. The Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem arranged for the exhumation of Nadeem Nowarah's body 15 days after his burial so that an autopsy could be performed. Sarit Michaeli, from B'Tselem, told CNN that the autopsy revealed the ""three fragments of a bullet and an entry and exit wound"" were consistent with a live round, rather than rubber-coated bullets that Israeli forces periodically fire at protesters. The bullet, found at the time of death in the teen's backpack, and the three bullet fragments, found in his body, were handed to Israeli investigators, Michaeli said. Investigators should be able to tell if the fragments came from that bullet and what weapon fired it, she added. And experts were able to ""calculate the firing angle from which the shot was taken"" based on where the bullets entered and left the teenager's body, according to the human rights advocate. Talking about the border police officer's arrest, Michaeli said, ""(It is) very, very rare."" CNN's Michael Schwartz contributed to this report.","Two Palestinian teenagers were killed in clashes with Israeli authorities in May .

"If anyone calls current events in Ukraine a civil war, don't believe them. This has been a war between the Ukrainian people and elements of their government, a battle for their freedom and against tyranny and dictatorship. Much more like a revolution. It started like a carnival, a peaceful demonstration, an expression of people's will to join European Union and shift away from Russia. But the Ukrainian Woodstock was over very soon. Then the troops moved in and death took over. This was no longer a carnival. This was war. On February 18, the war reached it bloodiest peak, and I was there, at the Maydan of Independence -- the main square in Kiev -- bearing witness to the drama and bravery of my own people. Earlier that day, protesters supporting a free Ukraine had met the requirement set down by government officials -- that they release their hold on Kiev City Hall. And they expected the Parliament, in turn, to meet their requirements -- deliver the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych, release political prisoners, restore of the constitution of 2004, and investigate the repression of peaceful protesters. But, so far, they hadn't. Instead, the deputies were not making any decisions. We watched as many of them instead chose to flee the Parliament building, which was protected by four rows of governmental special forces. Across from them was just one row of self-defense guards -- protecting the civilians -- armed with just shields and wooden sticks. People in civilian clothing were beyond them. And then there were the protesters. Waiting. Vadym, our coordinator from our self-defense group, was with us when we returned to the Parliament building. Vadym told us to beware, that this most likely was a trap. It looked as if the deputies -- representing the President's party -- had no intention of meeting protester demands. Instead, they were just luring protesters from the Maydan -- where they were protected by the barricades -- out into the open, where they could be captured and arrested. More and more special forces surrounded Maruinska Square, moving in from all sides. We went closer to the right flank of the special forces on the corner of Instytutska Street and Kriposnyj alley. I saw them approaching about 100 meters (110 yards) away. Suddenly we heard people screaming and ambulance sirens. Some of the injured protesters were dragged to safety. I could not find my colleague in the crowd. Some people began running away from the front line shouting, ""They are killing us, they are using Kalashnikovs and real bullets!"" Special forces started attacking. Running forward with their shields, beating people by their batons. There were not enough guys from our self-defense group there; most of them were near the Parliament. Here we saw mostly civilians -- men and women, old and young -- being beaten and chased and shot. None of them were prepared for what was happening to them. Then, people started panicking, screaming and running away. The narrow street was jammed. I kept filming, but Vadym was begging me to leave. Suddenly, I saw special forces less than 5 meters away. The crowd was pushing. Vadym was leading me through. He kept saying ""When the crowed pushes, walk slowly, make baby steps, pay attention to all details, don't let agonizing crowd push you down."" When the crowd bumped me and my the camera against the car, Vadym yelled at me --""RUN!"" We ran toward the square. It was safer there, but just for a moment. We saw that the four rows of special forces that were protecting the Parliament were now breaking though the line of self-defense guards and starting to attack, beating people without mercy. And then they started shooting. Shooting for real. From behind our backs.  They were also attacking us from the left and from the right. We were trapped. Our only chance to escape was through the narrow street. Opinion: What the West owes Ukraine . The panic was increasing, people shouting and kicking, many faces were covered by blood. I saw Berkut -- the riot police, the elite and most cruel unit of special forces -- approaching a few meters away. Vadym told me to run as fast as I could. The crowed pushed people to the wall of the building and I almost smashed my head over the corner of a balcony. I dived under it and the Berkut passed me by. In that moment, Vadym, a guard from our self-defense group, had just saved my life. Meanwhile, people ran to the Maydan. A state official proclaimed that anyone who stayed in the square would be considered a terrorist and the special forces would clean up the square over the next hour. Pretty soon they started to attack the heart of the revolution -- the main square, the Maydan of Independence. In the evening the whole square was burning. Protester tents, flags, and key buildings were destroyed by fire. I'll never forget the voices of the girls ringing from the stage, still singing heroic Ukrainian combat songs while the square was being eaten by fire. That day, February 18, many people were killed, many injured. But the Maydan remained free, for the people. We were exhausted, but we were victorious. Two days later, the government's special forces chose a different tactic to try to stop the protestors. They planted snipers on the roofs of the buildings. The snipers would fire down into the crowds. On that day, about 80 more people were killed. But even that didn't stop the people. They stood their ground. They would not retreat. On February 22, the brutal dictator, President Yanukovych, fled Kiev in the middle of the night. But he didn't get far. The people won. But this victory was bitter. So many people died and many more disappeared. Flowers and candles now cover the center of the city that burned. Protesters who were once beaten now roam freely along the Maydan. A dictator has fallen, and the Ukrainian people have risen. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Yana, a filmmaker from Ukraine, was in the main square in Kiev when violence erupted .

"(CNN)The political party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas posted a drawn image online showing a large pile of skulls and skeletons with Jewish stars on them. An Israeli government spokesman called it ""despicable."" Along with the image, posted Wednesday to the Facebook page of the Fatah party, are the words ""lingering on your skulls."" When contacted by CNN on Friday, a member of the Fatah Central Committee disavowed the image. ""Fatah did not design this image,"" Mahmoud al-Aloul said. The person who posted it to Fatah's page ""is currently being asked to remove it. The image and the text do not reflect the opinions of Fatah."" The image was then pulled from the page. The image, which also includes a rifle and the Fatah flag, quickly drew the ire of some people who saw it on social media. Some, including Ofir Gendelman, spokesman for Israel's Prime Minister, pointed to it as a sign that Fatah is not as ""moderate"" as it's often described. Fatah is considered the more moderate of the two major Palestinian political parties. Hamas, which controls Gaza, has engaged in repeated battles with Israel in recent years. Fatah controls the West Bank. (""Fatah may not be moderate, but relative to Hamas, it is restrained,"" Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute said in congressional testimony in 2013.) The image was posted as part of an online celebration of Fatah's 50th anniversary. The group was founded on January 1, 1965, carrying out its first major attack against Israel. Ehud Yaari of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy called the latest image ""typical of their ongoing propaganda."" It's not the first time Fatah Facebook images have sparked anger. After three Israeli teens were kidnapped and killed last year, ""The Facebook page for Fatah, the Palestinian Authority's main party, had a number of cartoons, including one showing the three teenagers as Jewish rats, wearing yarmulkes, caught on a fishing line,"" world affairs columnist Frida Ghitis wrote on CNN.com.

"The Indian diplomat whose arrest sparked a diplomatic row with India has again been indicted by the federal government and faces arrest if she returns to the United States, federal prosecutors said Friday. Devyani Khobragade faces one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements for allegedly lying on a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper, according to the indictment filed in a Manhattan federal court Friday. An arrest warrant also was issued, said Jerika Richardson, spokeswoman for the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. The fresh indictment comes just days after the original indictment against Khobragade was dismissed by a federal judge who agreed with her lawyers' assertion that she was protected under diplomatic immunity at the time of the first indictment. Federal prosecutors signaled Monday that a new indictment was likely. Khobragade, who left the United States in January, now works for the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi. Her attorney, Daniel Arshack, declined comment Friday. ""The government of India will respond in due course,"" he said in a statement. She was originally arrested and strip-searched by federal agents in New York City in December 2013. On January 9, a federal grand jury indicted her on one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements, the same charges she now faces. Khobragade filed a motion to dismiss the charges, claiming she was ""cloaked in diplomatic immunity at the time of her arrest,"" according to court documents. A federal judge agreed on Monday, ruling that Khobragade was ""appointed a Counselor to the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, a position that cloaked her with full diplomatic immunity,"" according to court documents. She was appointed to that position on January 8, one day before her first indictment. ""Even if Khobragade had no immunity at the time of her arrest and has none now, her acquisition of immunity during the pendency of proceedings mandates dismissal,"" U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin wrote. ""The government may not proceed on an indictment obtained when Khobragade was immune from the jurisdiction of the court,"" Scheindlin ruled. Arshack on Monday said Khobragade was pleased ""the rule of law has prevailed."" India's external affairs spokesman, Syed Akbaruddin, issued a statement then welcoming the ruling. Khobragade's case drew international attention, with Indian officials demanding apologies from Washington, and the United States announcing it would withdraw one official from its embassy in New Delhi.","Devyani Khobragade is indicted on visa fraud and false statement charges .

"(CNN) -- Laura Bush is suggesting she, her husband and several aides were poisoned during a 2007 visit to Germany for the G8 summit, one of several new details in the former first lady's forthcoming memoir, ""Spoken From the Heart."" Due to hit bookshelves May 4 but purchased by CNN at a Washington-area bookstore, Mrs. Bush says she and former President George W. Bush became mysteriously sick on the Germany trip to such a degree that the president became bedridden. According to Mrs. Bush, doctors and the Secret Service investigated the possibility a poisoning had occurred but were unable to make a definitive conclusion. News reports filed during the event show the White House did disclose Bush missed a series of morning sessions at the summit because he had contracted an apparent virus, but White House officials did not provide further details at that time. Townsend: Bush illness investigated, poisoning unlikely . ""Nearly a dozen members of our delegation were stricken, even George, who started to feel sick during an early morning staff briefing,"" Mrs. Bush writes. ""[O]ne of our military aides had difficulty walking and a White House staffer lost all hearing in one ear. Exceedingly alarmed, the Secret Service went on full alert, combing the resort for potential poisons."" ""George felt so ill that he met with [French President Nicolas] Sarkozy and did not even stand up to greet him,"" she continues, adding later, ""We never learned if any other delegations became ill, or if ours, mysteriously, was the only one."" Excerpts of the book were first published by The New York Times on Tuesday. The 432-page memoir is both a recount of the rare experience of being a first lady and a reflection of the eight years she spent in the White House as her husband's popularity gradually declined. Among the book's most poignant passages are those that delve into Mrs. Bush's involvement in a 1963 car collision in Midland, Texas, that killed her good friend who happened to be driving the other car. The spotty details surrounding the accident became fodder for Bush's opponents during his first run for the White House, and Mrs. Bush rarely addressed the matter in public. Mrs. Bush covers the accident extensively in the memoir, revealing it occurred after she ran a stop sign in a rush to a drive-in theater. Then 17, Mrs. Bush was driving a car that collided with that of Mike Douglas, a fellow student at Mrs. Bush's school. Douglas was pronounced dead when he arrived at the hospital. ""In the aftermath, all I felt was guilty, very guilty. In fact, I still do. It is a guilt I will carry for the rest of my life, far more visible to me than the scar etched in the bump of my knee,"" Mrs. Bush writes. ""The whole time I was praying that the person in the other car was alive. In my mind, I was calling 'Please, God. Please, God. Please, God,' over and over and over again."" Mrs. Bush writes she and a friend were talking when she ran the stop sign but also says the intersection was highly dangerous, the road was dark, and she could barely see the stop sign. Guilt-ridden, Mrs. Bush says she lost her faith for ""many, many years."" ""It was the first time that I had prayed to God for something, begged him for something, not the simple childhood wishing on a star but humbly begging for another human life. And it was as if no one heard. My begging, to my seventeen-year-old mind, had made no difference. The only answer was the sound of Mrs. Douglas's sobs on the other side of that thin emergency room curtain."" Much of the book's early chapters are devoted to a recounting of family history, with a special emphasis on the tragedies faced by her family as they weathered the Great Depression and her own personal beginnings as a young woman coming of age in Midland, Texas. Mrs. Bush writes passionately about the time she spent after college teaching minority students in the large cities of Texas, before she met her future husband. Mrs. Bush also reveals that she initially received a cold reception from Barbara Bush after marrying her son. ""[F]rom the start, she was ferociously tart-tongued. She's never shied away from saying what she thinks,"" Bush writes. ""She's managed to insult nearly all of my friends with one or another perfectly-timed acerbic comment."" The relationship improved, however, when Laura and George moved to Washington to be closer to his parents, she writes. The memoir covers in detail many of the policy initiatives that the first lady undertook while in office, including her efforts to promote women's rights in Afghanistan and childhood literacy in the United States. The first lady also acknowledges a misstep made by her twin daughters, who were caught trying to order alcoholic drinks in Austin, Texas, before their 21st birthday. ""That night in Austin was just dumb, in the way that so many nineteen-year-olds are dumb,"" Mrs. Bush writes. ""But what bothered me long after the incident was over was the image left behind in the public mind, that Barbara and Jenna were party girls."" Much as she did during her time as first lady, Mrs. Bush for the most part avoids commenting on politics. But she does point to the 1992 presidential campaign of Bush senior as being particularly nasty. Mrs. Bush writes that during the campaign, critics created ""the most hideous caricatures of George H.W. Bush until I barely recognized my own father-in-law."" Bush also criticizes former presidential candidate John Kerry for mentioning the sexual orientation of Vice President Dick Cheney's daughter during a 2004 debate, calling the move ""cheap and tawdry"" and suggests the campaign opened the door to a more hostile atmosphere for political candidates and their families. ""The strategy of making Mary Cheney's private life an issue failed with the voters in November of 2004,"" Bush writes. ""But in the years since, it has become acceptable to mock candidates and their families, and other elected officeholders, in highly personal ways; David Letterman feels free to ridicule Sarah Palin's teenage daughters, and the audience laughs. That is the legacy of the 2004 campaign."" Mrs. Bush also uses the memoir to air a few gripes against her husband's most vocal congressional critics, specifically Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Reid once called Bush a ""loser,"" while Pelosi said he was an ""incompetent leader."" ""The comments were uncalled for and graceless,"" Bush writes. ""While a president's political opponents, as well as his supporters, are entitled to make what they see as legitimate criticisms, and while our national debates should be spirited, these particular worlds revealed the petty and parochial nature of some who serve in Congress."" ""George, as president, would never have used such language about them,"" she adds. President George W.

"In an election-year policy change, the Obama administration said Friday it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they meet certain requirements. The shift on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy prompted immediate praise from Latino leaders who have criticized Congress and the White House for inaction, while Republicans reacted with outrage, saying the move amounts to amnesty -- a negative buzz word among conservatives -- and usurps congressional authority. What to know on immigration in the U.S. Those who might benefit from the change expressed joy and relief, with celebratory demonstrations forming outside the White House and elsewhere. Pedro Ramirez, a student who has campaigned for such a move, said he was ""definitely speechless,"" then added: ""It's great news."" In a Rose Garden address Friday afternoon, President Barack Obama said the changes caused by his executive order will make immigration policy ""more fair, more efficient and more just."" ""This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix,"" Obama said to take on conservative criticism of the step. ""This is a temporary stopgap measure."" Noting children of illegal immigrants ""study in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, befriend our kids, pledge allegiance to our flag,"" Obama said, ""it makes no sense to expel talented young people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans."" When a reporter interrupted Obama with a hostile question, the president admonished him and declared that the policy change is ""the right thing to do."" Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military can get a two-year deferral from deportation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said. Read the Napolitano memo (PDF) It also will allow those meeting the requirements to apply for work permits, Napolitano said, adding that participants must be in the United States now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years. The change is part of a department effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, Napolitano said, adding it was ""well within the framework of existing laws."" 2009 study: 4 million 'illegal' immigrant children are native-born citizens . The move addresses a major concern of the Hispanic community and mimics some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that has failed to win enough Republican support to gain congressional approval. Obama has been criticized by Hispanic-American leaders for an overall increase in deportations of illegal aliens in recent years. Last year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency's history. Immigration lessons for the U.S. from around the world . Friday's policy change is expected to potentially affect 800,000 people, an administration official told CNN on background. Both Obama and Napolitano called for Congress to pass the DREAM Act, which would put into law similar steps for children of illegal immigrants to continue living and working in the country. ""I've been dealing with immigration enforcement for 20 years and the plain fact of the matter is that the law that we're working under doesn't match the economic needs of the country today and the law enforcement needs of the country today,"" Napolitano told CNN. ""But as someone who is charged with enforcing the immigration system, we're setting good, strong, sensible priorities, and again these young people really are not the individuals that the immigration removal process was designed to focus upon."" Republicans who have blocked Democratic efforts on immigration reform immediately condemned the move, with some calling it an improper maneuver to skirt congressional opposition. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a leading GOP foe of Democratic proposals for immigration reform, threatened to file a lawsuit asking the courts to stop Obama ""from implementing his unconstitutional and unlawful policy."" In a Twitter post, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the decision ""a classic Barack Obama move of choosing politics over leadership,"" while House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas, called the change a ""decision to grant amnesty to potentially millions of illegal immigrants."" ""Many illegal immigrants will falsely claim they came here as children and the federal government has no way to check whether their claims are true,"" Smith said in a statement. ""And once these illegal immigrants are granted deferred action, they can then apply for a work permit, which the administration routinely grants 90% of the time."" Others complained the move will flood an already poor job market for young Americans with illegal immigrants. However, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who sponsored the DREAM Act, welcomed the announcement that he said ""will give these young immigrants their chance to come out of the shadows and be part of the only country they've ever called home."" Immigration shift sparks reaction from both sides . He rejected the GOP argument that Obama's move was all about politics, noting ""there will be those who vote against him because of this decision, too. That's what leadership is about."" Durbin also noted that Obama repeatedly called for Congress to pass immigration reform legislation, including the DREAM  Act. Now that it is clear no progress would occur this Congress, the president acted, Durbin said. Obama has used executive orders more frequently in recent months to launch initiatives he advocates that have been stymied by the deep partisan divide in Congress. A White House campaign of such steps involving economic programs was labeled ""We Can't Wait."" Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been working on an alternative version of the DREAM Act, criticized Obama for taking a piecemeal approach Friday. He said in a statement that ""by once again ignoring the Constitution and going around Congress, this short-term policy will make it harder to find a balanced and responsible long-term one."" Overheard on CNN.com: Decision to defer some deportations symbolic . Rubio is considered a possible running mate for certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who rejected the DREAM Act in the heat of the Republican primary campaign but has since expressed willingness to consider whatever Rubio proposes. Later Friday, Romney told reporters that the issue needs more substantive action than an executive order, which can be replaced by a subsequent president. He said he agrees with Rubio's statement that Obama's move makes finding a long-term solution more difficult. As president, Romney said, he would seek to provide ""certainty and clarity for people who come into this country through no fault of their own by virtue of the actions of their parents."" Hispanics make up the fastest-growing immigrant population in the country, and the Latino vote is considered a crucial bloc for the November presidential election. A spokeswoman for a major Latino group, the National Council of La Raza, hailed the administration's move. Joy, skepticism at immigration policy shift . ""In light of the congressional inaction on immigration reform, this is the right step for the administration to take at this time,"" said NCLR spokeswoman Laura Vazquez. Immigration lawyers also called the change a major step in the right direction. However, one immigration expert warned that the new policy does not guarantee the result sought by participants. ""I worry that the announcement will be implemented more stingily than the administration would like,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School. Meanwhile, some evangelical Christian leaders who recently met at the White House to discuss immigration issues also endorsed Friday's move, along with the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops and some Jewish groups. Photos: Putting a face on the immigration debate . For Jose Luis Zelaya, who came to the United States illegally from Honduras at age 14 to find his mother, also an illegal immigrant, the new policy means that ""maybe I will be able to work without being afraid that someone may deport me.""

"The thousands of immigrant children pouring across the nation's southern border from Central America braved predators and harsh elements only to arrive in the United States and walk right into one of the most toxic issues in Washington. On the right are those who criticize the White House approach to immigration. They say that by relaxing deportation policies toward immigrant children and their families, the Obama administration unwittingly created conditions for some 60,000 Central American kids to flock to the United States. On the left are those, including President Barack Obama, who fault Congress, especially House Republicans, for rejecting a Senate-passed comprehensive immigration reform package last year and continue bickering over incremental measures. And in the middle are children, many of them fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They are the latest pawns in the political fight over immigration reform. ""The thing I learned from the border patrol this weekend from the men and women and their supervisors is that we cannot enforce ourselves out of this crisis. They are being overwhelmed by the large numbers,"" Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who hails from the district where most of the border crossings occur, told CNN in an interview on Monday. Influx of immigrant children expected to last through summer . The debate over what the White House calls ""a humanitarian crisis"" is pouring fuel on a raging fire, judging by the rhetoric. Finger pointing . Republicans, such as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, place the blame squarely with Obama and his administration dealing with yet another crisis that has left it with a black eye. ""The recent surge of children and teenagers from Central America showing up at our southern border is an administration-made disaster and now President Obama is calling in (the Federal Emergency Management Agency) to mitigate the damage,"" Goodlatte said statement on the decision to create a group comprised of government agencies to address the issue. ""Word has gotten out around the world about President Obama's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the United States illegally, many of whom are children from Central America,"" Goodlatte said. Most of the children crossing the border would not qualify for ""amnesty"" under the federal program that defers deportation for children brought to the United States previously by their parents or guardians illegally. Still, there is some evidence to suggest the policy allowing thousands of immigrant children to remain in the country prompted others to strike out for the United States, hoping they, too, could stay, immigration law and policy experts said. Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform? ""I think it would fall in the category of unintended consequences,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University Law School. ""I think the president was clear in 2012 of what his executive action did and did not do. He did not intend to signal that other children should come to the U.S. But many times immigration law gets distorted and (the kids may have made the journey) based on those false of rumors that children will be allowed to stay here."" The White House may have helped create this crisis, but the administration is not the first to find itself facing a humanitarian conundrum partly of its own making. When Bill Clinton was campaigning for president in the early 1990s, he criticized then-President George H.W. Bush's decision to turn back waves of Haitian immigrants in boats trying to escape political chaos in their country. This, in turn, prompted thousands of Haitians to try and come to the United States after Clinton took office, prompting him to make clear that those trying to skirt the legal channels to citizenship would be turned back. A problem with many roots . However, it isn't exactly fair to solely blame Obama and his administration for the flood of children now entering the country, many of them on their own, immigration law and policy experts say. According to analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, the ""deep root causes for this child migration, and for the recent surge in arrivals"" are myriad and complicated. ""In reality, there is no single cause. Instead, a confluence of different pull and push factors has contributed to the upsurge,"" the report found. ""Recent U.S. policies toward unaccompanied children, faltering economies and rising crime and gang activity in Central American countries, the desire for family reunification, and changing operations of smuggling networks have all converged."" Vice President Joe Biden will travel to Guatemala later this week to discuss the matter with leaders from the three Central American countries at the center of the controversy. Cuellar and immigration law and policy experts all point to the need to improve assistance to those nations through stronger borders and less violence. There's work to do on the home front as well. A Senate-approved immigration reform package, which included at least seven measures designed to address unaccompanied minors crossing the border, failed to make it out of the Republican -controlled House last year. Those measures included ensuring high standards of mental and physical health care at the facilities where illegal immigrant children are detained, child welfare training for those who detain minors crossing the border illegally and legal representation for those children among other provisions. Reports from communities where children are held indicate that kids as young as toddlers are kept in hot and crowded conditions. There have also been reports of abuse and a lack of access to adequate legal representation as federal and community assistance is stretched. Daniel's journey: How thousands of children are creating a crisis in America . The sweeping Senate immigration reform package also included a path to citizenship for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented workers in the country. This path to legalization would have helped ensure economic stability for those who left their children behind in their home countries which, in turn, might make the kids less likely to flee poverty in their homelands, immigration law and policy experts said. ""It would not be as big a deal if we had a working immigration system. There are a lot of provisions in the Senate bill that would have addressed this issue of unaccompanied minors,"" Yale-Loehr said adding that for years the problem was like a ""tidal wave"" in the distance which neither the White House nor Congress anticipated hitting with such force. ""It's another thing to see it crashing on your shore,"" he said.","Waves of immigrant children fleeing poverty, violence are at center of heated debate .
While the right and left lay blame, both sides are at fault for the flood of immigrant kids, experts say .
Relaxing deportation policies, failing to pass immigration reform part of U.S. role in problem .

"Washington is all about the fiscal cliff these days. In Doha, Qatar, world leaders are negotiating over climate change. Federal debt and carbon emissions are indeed two big problems on the nation's front burner. But they are just the beginning. As the fog of the election season lifts, America has a lot to worry about -- everything from competing economically with China to housing rapidly retiring baby boomers. But there is another way to look at it. Decisively addressing the nation's primary global challenges -- backed by the market potential of powerful demographic shifts at home and abroad -- could yield opportunity unlike any other in America's history. First, our four major challenges: . • In the last 20 years, households, businesses and the federal government accumulated exceptional levels of debt, which they are now trying, painfully, to pay down. The 2008 financial crisis triggered a spiral of unemployment and reduced demand that is nowhere near complete. As household income contracts, families consume less and try to erase debt, reducing demand for goods and services, forcing companies to reduce expenses, meaning more layoffs, deepening unemployment, and so on. Monetary policy and fiscal stimulus may have contained the worst of the pain, but they cannot cure the disease. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is right when he says the economy needs a broad-based and durable source of demand. • Over the last 20 years, roughly 1 billion people entered the global middle class. In the next 20 years, there will be 3 billion more. Good news? Yes, except that these new consumers use huge amounts of resources and emit more carbon, a roughly 300% increase. Expect price increases for basic commodities like energy, food, and minerals, and deepening conflicts among the great powers over resources in familiar places: the Persian Gulf, the South China Sea, and Central Asia. • Climate change is already with us. Superstorm Sandy, the Derecho, Arctic melting, and droughts in the Midwest, India, China, and Russia this past year confirm the scientifically proven trend. Beyond this, humanity consumes about 150% of the ""goods"" provided by the earth's natural systems -- including fresh water, soils, and fisheries. We are consuming our limited endowment of natural capital, reducing future returns while our global population expands to 9 billion. This is massively destabilizing, whether you're in New York City or Pakistan. • Our infrastructure, systems, and supply chains are not designed for the scale or the risks of the 21st century. Transportation, financial, food, and industrial systems have choke points, are inefficient, and lack oversight and sufficient investment. They are magnifying threat and risk when they should be compartmentalizing them. Quiet disruptions in such things as rare-earth minerals (critical to high-tech manufacturing), auto parts,  and computer hard drives have all hit industry in the last two years, for example. Opinion: We're living the dream, we just don't realize it . America's economy must do some heavy lifting. Just as the country transitioned from war production to civilian production 60 years ago, it must now transition to sustainable production, while building a new American dream. If it can, the United States will be ideally positioned to rebuild our middle class, compete globally and pre-empt growing confrontation over resources. We must adapt and once again define the future. First, America has a homegrown demographic opportunity unlike any other. Driven by baby boomers and millennials, 56% percent of homebuyers say that they want the trappings of their American dream to be walkable and convenient, not car-dependent and isolated, and home prices already reflect this.  From 2014 to 2029, these two largest American demographics, each 25% of the total population, will meet in the housing market as boomers empty their nests and as more millennials marry and have children -- creating the largest concentration of demand for housing since the period after World War II.  To seize this opportunity, however, Washington needs to let cities and towns decide how to grow,  and discourage the car-based population dispersal known as sprawl. Not only will this put Americans back to work in construction, it could reduce the environmental footprint by roughly a third. Second, global demand for food and resources is skyrocketing. By 2050 global food production must increase by 60%, while soil and fresh water must be regenerated, not depleted. American farmers are held back by expensive, distorting, and antiquated Cold War era subsidies that essentially pay farmers to overwork the land and waste scarce water resources. We've already lost up to 50% of Iowa's topsoil, drained the Ogallala Aquifer, and created a fertilizer-based ""death bloom"" at the mouth of the Mississippi. While conventional agribusiness is enjoying high global prices, climate-related drought and floods have reduced the harvest to the lowest since the early 1970s. Shifting the worst of these subsidies from big commodity crops (like corn, wheat, and soybeans) to pay farmers to convert their operations to modern regenerative systems will help our farming families earn a more secure living and be better stewards of the land. Finally, the world needs innovation. To accommodate 3 billion new middle-class aspirants in 20 years, we will need to make our resources more productive while reducing the amount of carbon emitted. By focusing on advanced materials, energy and manufacturing, we can rebuild our middle class, supplying the jobs, wages, and returns Americans deserve. To lead this revolution in resource productivity, we must stop taxing work and start taxing waste. Washington universalized the income tax to pay for World War II, when we had full employment and needed to subsidize resource extraction to get materiel to the Allies. Now we get 80% of federal revenues from taxing individuals, are suffering from long-term unemployment, and consume far more resources than Europe for an inferior standard of living. We're conserving labor and expending resources when we need to do the opposite. We have the demand. Do we have the capital? Plenty. There are trillions of dollars in pent-up investment capital looking for reasonable, reliable returns, as the chairman of Goldman Sachs recently wrote. Instead of Washington footing the bill, the federal government must reorient the Cold War subsidies for housing, agriculture, and resource waste and create a new generation of regional financing mechanisms. These new regional tools must connect Wall Street's capital to the infrastructure and innovation opportunities that will arise as regions plan for and build the future. If it's done right, we'll channel excess liquidity back into the productive economy and stop it from sloshing around as underperforming corporate cash, money market funds, and high-risk derivatives. Yes, Washington must address the issue of the fiscal cliff and make progress on climate change. But isolated solutions will only waste precious time. Tapping into the new demand pools of the 21st century, unleashing pent-up capital, and shifting American markets to lead a revolution in resource productivity will position the United States to lead the world once again.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama's newly revamped Office of Faith Based Initiatives is reigniting a contentious debate across the ideological spectrum over whether religious organizations that accept funds from the government should be allowed to discriminate when hiring. On the campaign trail, President Obama's views on federal money and discrimination seemed clear. In one corner is a string of religion-backed organizations that have accepted federal funds from the 8-year-old program to advance their secular charity work. President Bush issued an executive order in 2002 that allowed these groups to continue their practice of discrimination with respect to hiring. Specifically, many of the organizations carry policies against hiring outside their religion or hiring homosexuals whose lifestyles conflict with church doctrines. In the other corner are separation-of-church-and-state advocates and human-rights organizations that say the government must constitutionally compel these organizations to follow nondiscrimination laws if they accept federal funding. Anything less, they say, would at best be a violation of church-state separation and at worst an implicit endorsement of discrimination. ""[President Obama] is under heavy pressure from those who support faith-based hiring in these enterprises to not just eliminate it,"" said Ira C. Lupu, a professor at The George Washington University Law School. ""Others say that hiring on the basis of religion is discriminatory and that the government should never subsidize that. As a political matter, there is a lot of pressure from both sides."" Obama himself waded into the debate during the presidential campaign, delivering a widely viewed speech in Zanesville, Ohio, during which he endorsed faith-based programs, but said the beneficiaries of such government aid should be forced to cease discriminatory practices. ""If you get a federal grant, you can't use that grant money to proselytize to the people you help and you can't discriminate against them -- or against the people you hire -- on the basis of their religion,"" Obama said in the July 1 speech at the East Side Community Ministry. But since Election Day, the president and his aides have been far less clear on whether the new faith-based initiatives office will significantly depart from the Bush administration's policy. In an executive order to be announced on Thursday, Obama does not rescind Bush's provision to allow faith-based groups to discriminate in their hiring practices, but does provide a legal process for organizations to go through in order to that ensure hiring is legal and non-discriminatory. Administration sources say the new legal safeguard is a ""key step forward"" in addressing the thorny issue of faith-based hiring. But Dr. Joel Hunter, a senior pastor at Northland Church in Longwood, Florida, who will be part of a 25-member council of religious leaders in the faith-based office, said the issue is a particularly tricky one for religious leaders. ""We're going to have to work that out, because on the one hand, you don't want to use federal funds to discriminate. But on the other hand, we can't have religious organizations taking money on the condition that they will hire people who live a lifestyle contrary to what they teach,"" he said. If the Obama administration moves slowly on resolving the issue, the new president risks alienating a large bloc of his supporters, many of whom are already wary of faith-based funding from the federal government. ""In an ideal world, there would be no faith-based office,"" said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ""But if we must have this office, certain steps must be taken to bring it into line with the commands of the Constitution."" For the faith-based groups, the issue is not so clear-cut. Under the Civil Rights act of 1964, faith-based organizations have a right to discriminate in hiring with respect to religion. Many of these organizations argue they risk losing their fundamental identity if the government forces them to hire individuals outside their faith. ""To us, it's not a matter of discrimination, it's a matter of our faith ethos,"" said Samuel Rodriguez, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. ""What they are telling us is to negate who we are in order to acquire federal grants. ... That's just unacceptable."" Rodriguez, whose organization represents more than 19,000 churches, said he and other religious leaders have directly communicated their concerns to the Obama administration and are confident the president will not seek to rescind the policy. ""President Obama understands he's at risk of alienating the vast majority of the evangelical community,"" Rodriguez said. But opponents argue organizations use the right to hire within their religion as an excuse to implicitly discriminate against gays and lesbians -- many of whom may share the same faith as the organization but are deemed not good practitioners of it. ""The Bush administration's policies and initiatives that have allowed religious institutions to discriminate against [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual] Americans with public money are not consistent with the values espoused by President Obama and his Administration,"" Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign said. ""We are hopeful that the new administration will take the necessary steps to address this critical issue of fairness expeditiously."" At Pastor Rick Warren's presidential forum in August, then-presidential candidate Obama said a distinction should be made between how federally funded groups hire within their own mission and how they hire when it comes to secular charitable work. ""The devil's in the details,"" he said then. ""What we do want to make sure of is that as a general principle we're not using federal funding to discriminate, but that is only when it comes to the narrow program that is being funded by the federal government. That does not affect any of the other ministries that are being taken, that are taking place.""","Bush faith office allowed religious groups to discriminate in hiring .

"A man slips behind someone else into a packed elementary school with an AK-47-type weapon. He goes into the office and shoots at the ground, then darts between there and outside to fire at approaching police. So what do you do? If you're Antoinette Tuff, who works in the front office at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy just outside Atlanta, you don't run. You talk. You divulge your personal struggles to the gunman, you tell him you love him, you even proactively offer to walk outside with him to surrender so police won't shoot. And then the nightmare ends with the suspect, later identified as Michael Brandon Hill, taken into custody and no one inside or outside the Decatur school even hurt, despite the gunfire. ""Let me tell you something, babe,"" Tuff tells the dispatcher, Kendra McCray, at the end of the dramatic 911 call that recounts her minutes of valor and terror. ""I've never been so scared in all the days of my life. Oh, Jesus."" This brief outburst of emotion, moments after police entered the school Tuesday, was in stark contrast to her cool, calm demeanor as heard earlier on that 911 call. As a go-between, she relayed his demands that police refrain from using their radios and ""stop all movement,"" or else the suspect would shoot. ""He doesn't want the kids, he wants the police, so back off,"" she said in the call.  ""What else, sir?  He said he don't care if he die, he don't have nothing to live for, and he said he's not mentally stable."" By the end -- with police themselves having never directly talked to him -- Tuff and the gunman were talking about where he would put his weapon, how he'd empty his pockets and where he'd lie down before authorities could get him. ""It's going to be all right, sweetie,"" she tells Hill at one point in the call.  ""I just want you to know I love you, though, OK? And I'm proud of you. That's a good thing that you're just giving up and don't worry about it. We all go through something in life."" Tuff then let the gunman know that she'd been down before herself, but she'd picked herself up. He could, too. ""I thought the same thing, you know, I tried to commit suicide last year after my husband left me,"" she said. ""But look at me now. I'm still working and everything is OK."" That day, for everyone at that school, everything did turn out OK. Shots were fired, but no one got hurt. The gunman never made it to the classroom area, deciding instead to give up and lay down. This ending is thanks largely to Tuff, said McCray, the woman who fielded her 911 call. Echoing President Barack Obama -- who called Tuff on Thursday to thank her -- and many others, McCray described Tuff as a ""true hero"" for being courageous, calm and personable. ""You did a great job,"" McCray said, shortly after the two met in person for the first time Thursday for an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""You made my job a lot easier."" Tuff, others 'thought it was a drill' Tuff had training in how to deal with such a scenario. School staff regularly train for dangerous situations involving trespassers and emergency protocol, school district spokesman Quinn Hudson said. Tuff and two other staff members -- a cafeteria manager and a media specialist -- were specifically trained in hostile situations. ""The training is so often and extensive, they thought it was a drill"" at first, said Hudson. While Tuff worked to keep the gunman calm and spoke with him, she signaled a code to her two counterparts, who immediately triggered a phone tree to tell teachers to lock doors and send children to safety, Hudson said. ""Her name, Antoinette Tuff, says everything about her,"" said Brian Bolden, the school principal. ""Tough. She has always been that way, from the first time I met her."" He describes her as a strong leader whose authority everyone respects. The past eight years, Tuff has been with the Georgia school -- the past three at McNair. And she almost wasn't there Tuesday. Tuff was scheduled to be off that day, but because of a shift change, she ended up right where the school needed her to be. The school's existing safety procedures will remain the same while the investigation takes place, Bolden said. But he promised any needed changes will happen.  ""We will do everything humanly possible in our power to keep this next generation of learners safe."" Counseling was made available to the kids, and the school understands that some children might not be ready to come back right away, he said. Inside the suspect's mind . On Wednesday night, Hill, 20, was in a Georgia jail awaiting a still undetermined initial court appearance. Authorities are still hammering out exactly what charges he will face. Police spokeswoman Mekka Parish has said they would include aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Ray Davis, the lead detective on the case, added that false imprisonment and ""several weapons charges"" probably will be included as well. Whenever the charges come down, Hill will waive his initial court appearance, said Claudia Saari, public defender for the Stone Mountain Judicial Circuit. She said members of her office's mental health division are handling his case and  declined to make any further comment. This week's incident is not Hill's first run-in with the law. He has a criminal history in DeKalb and neighboring Henry County that, while not ""lengthy,"" does include violence, Davis said. Specifically, Hill pleaded guilty in July to making ""terroristic threats and acts"" against his brother. Georgia school shooting suspect was arrested in March . Henry County court records show that, in addition to three years of probation, he was ordered to attend anger management classes. But that county's district attorney, James Wright, said Wednesday that there's no indication that Hill completed them. As to any connection to McNair Discovery Learning Academy, why he might have gone into it armed, and what he planned to do once there, authorities have not outlined a motive or a detailed plan. Being from DeKalb County, Hill ""possibly had been there (at the school) before speaking with some people in the administration,"" Davis said. But ""there's no indication he had a grievance with the school."" Before he entered the school, the suspect took a picture of himself with the assault rifle -- which he'd taken ""from the house of an acquaintance,"" said Davis, who did not say whether the weapon was stolen. So did Hill go in intent on killing people? Davis responded: ""I believe there was something else, but I don't want to go into detail."" Some clues about his mindset are evident in the dramatic 911 call. With Tuff acting as the intermediary on the call, the suspect said that ""he should have just went to the mental hospital instead of doing this, because he's not on his medication."" Chief: It 'absolutely' could have been 'another Sandy Hook' While Tuff seemingly kept her cool inside the school, a swarm of law enforcement was springing into action outside. Police reacted ""very, very quickly"" -- including some officers who took up positions with long rifles -- ""to engage the threat"" and prepare for the worst, said Alexander, the DeKalb County police chief. ""We can all make a reasonable assumption that he came there to do some harm,"" he said, recalling last year's school massacre in Connecticut that ended with 20 students, six adults and gunman Adam Lanza dead. ""He entered a school, an elementary school with children in it ... to do one of two things: Either to do harm to those children and/or any first responders."" Thankfully, that didn't happen. In fact, the suspect never went beyond the school's offices and never near its classrooms. While he fired some rounds at police -- and one officer shot back at him -- no one was hit outside either. And while there initially were fears that the suspect also had explosives, further tests indicated that was not the case: He came in with the rifle and a bag of ammunition, but no explosives. Community members and leaders are offering praise for Tuff and police, as well as gratitude that the story did not turn tragic. ""Was the potential there to have another Sandy Hook? Absolutely,"" admits Alexander, the police chief.","The woman who fielded Tuff's 911 call describes her as a ""true hero""

"Exploring China can rattle even veteran travelers. And understandably so. It's a huge country with enough languages and dialects to leave even many native Chinese flummoxed at the thought of communicating away from home. But traveling away from the big cities isn't scary, and it's not unmanageable. Traveling for the past few years from my home base in Shanghai, I've picked up a lot of tips -- both from my own experiences and from others -- that make life on the road in China a little bit easier and a lot more rewarding. Here are 20 of them to get you started. 1. Score extra beds the easy way . Chinese hotels aren't too fussy when it comes to matching the number of beds to the number of people, particularly when the extra bodies are children. For families, this can save a lot of cash. Rather than needing two rooms, a family of four can get cozy in a twin room, where both beds are the same size as a regular double bed. 2. Follow proper currency protocol . Don't insult a Shanghai taxi driver by burdening him with small bills, such as 1 yuan or 5 jiao notes. He likes the jingle of coins. Conversely, in northern and western China, expect market vendors to reject coins outright. They only like paper money no matter how small the denomination. 3. Use the best language app for travelers . Pleco is the best Chinese language app for travelers. The basic dictionary app is free. It costs US$14.95 to buy the optical character recognition function (compatible with the iPhone 4 or 5 camera). Point the iPhone at a Chinese menu and get an instant translation. 4. Customize your gifts . Have fine items made by hand and to order -- a neon sign of your name, pair of riding boots, set of sheets, oak cabinet, silk quilt or cashmere coat. China is the land of possibilities. If you can dream it, someone can make it. The Shandong Juancheng Neon-Plasma Tech company make customized neon signs in one week and will ship anywhere. www.chinaneonsign.en.alibaba.com . 5. Use the best guides to offbeat China . China Little T(r)ips is a series of guides for those who want to get off the well-worn tourist path in China, but don't have the inside knowledge or the language skills to do so. These guides to Inner Mongolia, Gansu and soon Sichuan and Qinghai contain detailed itineraries, maps and language cards specific for each stage of the trip. Inner Mongolia Guide RMB 78 (US$12.50), ebook RMB 45 (US$7), www.chinalittletrips.com . 6. Order rice the right way . Rice is rarely served during a meal in Chinese restaurants, being seen as a cheap way to fill up at the end if needed. Anyone wanting rice with his or her meal should make it clear to the waiter by saying: mifan (rice) mashang (straight away). 7. Toilet paper reminder . Toilet tissue is rarely found in public restrooms in China. Carry your own supplies. 8. Sidestep difficult breakfasts . Outside of large cities and internationally branded hotels, Chinese hotel breakfasts cater exclusively to the local market. This is no issue for anyone fond of congee and pickles, but can be an unimaginable hurdle for children or picky eaters. Bring a box of their favorite cereal and a few small cartons of milk and everyone starts the day happy. Most hotels don't mind. 9. Don't worry -- it's safe . China is nowhere near as terrifying as many guidebooks would have you believe. Yes, the traffic is chaotic and the air could be better -- much better -- but China is one of the safest countries in the world for female travelers, solo travelers and families. 10. Give -- and get -- instant gratification . Those traveling in rural China often wish to give a small gift to locals they meet, but are unsure of what might be considered appropriate. A portrait delivered instantly on a Polaroid camera is a much-appreciated, on-the-spot gift. Fujifilm Instax Mini 7 Polaroid camera retails for around RMB 400 (US$62) from large electronics retailers. 11. Trespass with confidence . Accustomed to the idea of private property, international travelers are often reluctant to stray from worn footpaths into lanes and hutongs for fear of intruding. But that's not how the Chinese see things. All of these outdoor areas are public spaces, and lanes and alleys hold some of the most captivating scenes in China's big cities. 12. Don't be fooled by loud voices . Chinese people like to converse very loudly and passionately at times, and it can be easy to mistake this for an argument. Listening in to a heated discussion in Shanghai between a taxi driver and a Chinese friend I thought they were about to come to blows. ""No,"" they told me. ""We were just talking together about how devastating the Sichuan earthquake was."" 13. Need help? Find a high school student . The array of Mandarin dialects and variations across China can make communication difficult even for native Mandarin speakers. But help is always at hand: those under 25 years old are most likely to speak both standard Mandarin and English. Students who have studied English in books for years, but have had little contact with native English speakers, may more readily understand written questions. 14. Make a hometown connection . Learn the name of your country's most famous landmark for beaming instant recognition from taxi drivers, waiters and the man on the street. Tip: Eiffel Tower is ""ai fei'er tie ta,"" Statue of Liberty is ""zi you nu shen xiang"" and Great Barrier Reef is ""da bao jiao."" 15. Get a backstreet breakfast . In order to get some local color on business trips that will otherwise be spent inside taxis and boardrooms, ""take to the backstreets behind your hotel for an early breakfast of dumplings or noodles and watch the area wake up while you eat,"" suggests Australian business traveler Matthew Tobin. 16. Enhance wellness . Want to unblock your qi? Hit up a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinic. Illness isn't an essential requirement -- TCM doctors believe preventing disease is just as important as treating it. ""TCM is ingrained in Chinese culture,"" says Canadian Leslie Bottrell, who is trained in both Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine. ""It permeates everyday life and so empowers individuals to be responsible for their wellness by promoting disease prevention."" Consultations are available at Longhua Hospital in Shanghai, one of the country's top TCM Hospitals. LongHua Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 725 Wanping Nan Lu, Xuhui District, Shanghai; +86 21 6438 5700; open daily 8-11:30 a.m., 1-5 p.m. 17. Find art in unusual places . Some boutique hotels provide interesting art experiences, like the Opposite House Hotel in the Sanlitun area of Beijing. ""Their permanent art collection is second to none,"" says Hong Kong-based art consultant Alison Pickett. ""And they have a fantastic rotating exhibition venue in the lobby which showcases really challenging and interesting installations, many of which you wouldn't get to see in any of the galleries."" The Red Gate Gallery in Beijing holds open studio exhibitions. Visitors can see how resident international artists work, live and create in Beijing. The Opposite House, The Village Building 1, 11 Sanlitun Lu, near Dongzhimenwai Da Jie, Village 1; nightly rate from about RMB 2,500 (US$400); +86 10 6417 6688; www.theoppositehouse.com . Red Gate Gallery, 1/F and 4/F, Dongbianmen Watchtower, Dongcheng District, Beijing 4; +86 10 6525 1005; open daily 9 a.m.-5 p.m. 18. Take the kids along ... without regret . Taking small but manageable risks when traveling in China with children can reap big rewards. Three Mountain (San Shan) Island northwest of Shanghai is an ideal spot to venture away from the big city for the weekend with the family. ""Our family took a weekend trip by train and boat to San Shan Dao, where we had an extraordinary China experience staying in small local guest houses and exploring the island,"" says Lynette MacDonald, editor in chief of Shanghai Family magazine and frequent traveler with children. San Shan Dao, near Suzhou, Jiangsu Province . 19. Get a tea education . Shanghai's Laoximen Tea Plaza houses a variety of specialty tea shops. ""On the second floor, at Qing Quan Tea (shop 218), I can sit for hours testing white or red teas and listening to owner David Li talking about health benefits, differences in soil or climate conditions or quality differences,"" says China-based food writer and tea lover Anna-Lena Bjarneberg. Laoximen Tea Plaza, 1121 Fuxing Dong Lu, Huangpu District, Shanghai;+86 21 5386 5555; open daily 9 a.m.-9 p.m. 20. Take better pictures . The best gear investments to make before coming to China are an excellent camera bag and polarizing filter, according to professional photographer and frequent China traveler Roger D'Souza. ""China is very dusty and hard on photo gear, so a good bag that's well sealed but also accessible is essential."" The Australian photographer also suggests using a polarizing filter to cut through China's frequent smog. ""If there is any blue in the sky this will make it appear more vibrant,"" he says.

"Bestselling author Michael Connelly might be best known for his character Detective Harry Bosch. But his second-most-popular character is no slouch either. Connelly's books have sold more than 50 million copies around the world, most of them featuring the fictional Bosch of the Los Angeles Police Department. But in 2005, Connelly moved away from his popular police procedurals to try his hand at a legal thriller. The result was ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" with Mickey Haller, a criminal defense attorney who works out of the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car. The book was a hit and later became a critically acclaimed movie starring Matthew McConaughey. Now Haller returns in ""The Gods of Guilt,"" Connelly's fifth novel featuring the fast-talking defender. In the book, Haller takes on a murder case where the victim happens to be one of his former clients. While Haller is often a shark in court, his personal life is a shambles. He's nearly broke and alone, estranged from his ex-wife and teenage daughter and desperate to reestablish ties. Meantime, Connelly has not forgotten fan favorite Bosch, who makes a brief cameo in ""The Gods of Guilt."" Bosch is also featured in a new eBook short called ""Switchblade,"" and coming in January, to TV. Connelly has co-written a pilot for Amazon Studios for an hourlong show, ""Bosch,"" which will air exclusively on Prime Instant Video in 2014. It stars Titus Welliver, who has appeared in ""Argo,"" ""The Good Wife"" and ""Lost."" Fast facts . Age: 57 . Hometown: Born in Philadelphia, now lives in Florida. Former profession: Crime reporter for the Los Angeles Times . For fans of: Crime novels, legal thrillers, Scott Turow, John Grisham . Fun facts: Connelly has appeared on several episodes of the ABC show ""Castle"" as himself. He is also a longtime fan of the New York Yankees and threw the first pitch at one of their games in August. Five questions for Michael Connelly . CNN: Tell me about the title of your new book. Who are ""The Gods of Guilt?"" Connelly: The easy explanation is the ""Gods of Guilt"" are the jury in the trial. I overheard the reference hanging around with some lawyers who help me with my Mickey Haller books. It was kind of an offhanded reference and, as often happens when you're hanging around with cops and lawyers, they'll tell you the greatest stuff and they don't know how good it is. I knew it would be my title immediately, not only because it's a cool phrase but also because it had other meanings, because this book has a lot to do with Mickey Haller's character, his dealing with guilt over things he's done, professionally and personally. Obviously I want this book to be a legal thriller and courtroom drama, but also it's a meditation on personal guilt and how you deal with it. This idea that everybody has a jury inside, their conscience that dictates the verdict on the things that they do. CNN: How has Mickey Haller changed over the course of your series? Connelly: I don't know if this is the lowest we've ever seen Mickey, but in this book his professional and personal choices have left him pretty much alone and away from the people he longs for the most, most notably his teenage daughter. In this book, we never actually see her up close and in person. Mickey has to watch her from afar. That relationship, which has certainly anchored him in other books, has been torn asunder by something he did. He actually did his job correctly, and yet it had an effect where people later got hurt and that alienated his ex-wife and his daughter from him. So this story is about him trying to redeem himself in their eyes. As a criminal defense attorney, Mickey does something for a living that his daughter has decided is abhorrent, so it's a hard situation to be in. That's where the ""Gods of Guilt"" come in. It's about Mickey trying to convince a jury of his innocence, that's the underpinnings of the story and that's before we even get to the legal case that he's handling throughout this book. CNN: You're headed to Europe for a promotional tour. Do you see any difference between your fans overseas and your American fans? Connelly: I would say Harry Bosch translates around the world pretty easily. A homicide detective is a homicide detective is a homicide detective. Obviously procedures might be different from place to place, but the bottom line is that kind of character is the same in every country. When you write legal thrillers or you write about a lawyer, the procedure... is different in every country. So Mickey Haller doesn't translate as well in other countries, I'm not just talking about language translation. I like the idea of going over and being able to help translate him or explain him to readers because I really feel that readers in other countries are risking more to read a Mickey Haller book than a Harry Bosch book. I'll be in England and Ireland and their legal systems are quite different so reading this trial that takes place in ""Gods of Guilt,"" it's really kind of an alien world. I appreciate every reader I have of a Mickey Haller book in these countries, and if there's a way I can go over there and help explain, I want to do it. CNN: Tell me how you finally brought ""Bosch"" to TV. Connelly: Harry was on the shelf for a long time, legally. I couldn't do anything with him for almost 15 years because of deals I made in the 1990s. When I finally got the rights back, I didn't need the money. I didn't need anything from Hollywood, so I just had this resolve that I'm either going to be able to control this or I'm not going to do it, because Harry is too precious to me. On one hand, I'm just as much influenced by great movies and great TV as I am by great novels, so it's just instinctive that I want to try and do this and do it right. Slowly over the last couple of years, I put together the show runner, the chief writer, our producer, and while I was doing that, Amazon came to me because they heard about the project and saw the synergy between selling my books and wanting to get into the business of creating television and film. It was one of those common sense things, kind of a no-brainer. If it's great or bad it's going to be my doing and I'm happy to make that gamble. I think it's going to be on the good side, it's going to be very representative of the books and my kind of creativity and I think it's going to be something I'm really proud of. CNN: What's next? Connelly: Before we started filming ""Bosch,"" I was working on a new Harry Bosch book. I don't have a title yet, but in it, Harry's got a new partner. He's in his final couple of years of being a detective and I think he's trying to be a mentor more than he has in the past. Usually he kept his partners distant and dispensable. Now Harry's paired with a partner who he thinks may be the real deal and could be a person on a mission like he has been all his professional life. So he wants to pass something on. Geographically, this case takes him into a new part of Los Angeles; the investigation is primarily centered in East L.A., so there will be a lot of new stuff, but at the same time, very familiar. It should be coming out this time next year and hopefully will coincide with the TV show.","Michael Connelly's new novel features lawyer Mickey Haller of ""Lincoln Lawyer"" fame .

"After the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, people everywhere are demanding common sense reforms to our gun laws. According to a January poll, for example, an overwhelming 92% of Americans back  background checks for every gun sale. We all need to take action to see real change. President Obama has unveiled a bold package of legislation, and our leaders in Washington are finally listening. We are encouraged by this, but concerned Americans must stand united against gun violence and put pressure on elected leaders to vote accordingly for real solutions. Like the president said during the State of the Union, this issue deserves a vote -- our elected officials are accountable to the survivors of gun violence and the families of victims, and they deserve a vote. Now more than ever, we need to provide support for the advocacy organizations that are working to establish a formidable counterweight to the gun lobby, which is well financed, well organized and will stop at nothing to protect the interests of the firearms industry and obstruct sensible legislation that will help save lives. Groups like the Fund for a Safer Future and Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- spearheaded by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- have been leading the charge in Washington for meaningful reform. It is incumbent upon all of us in the philanthropic community and the people served by these programs to stand firmly behind them during this critical time. We have been proud to join other foundations and grant makers in backing these organizations. With the help of our resources, they have conducted essential policy research, raised public awareness and launched national campaigns that have brought us closer than ever to stopping the bloodshed. But there's still so much more that philanthropists can do to further this cause. Philanthropy, after all, is activism. It is not merely writing checks and throwing money at problems; it is investing in solutions that can lead to momentous change.  We have an obligation to help save lives. This isn't about politics. This is about reclaiming our fundamental right to safety. What better investment could there be?  Over the years, we have each financed major public institutions in Los Angeles and across the United States -- from opera houses to charter schools, scientific research centers to art museums. They have all contributed to positive change in our community and our country. But what good are they if our children aren't safe in their classrooms? What good are they if a 15-year-old girl can perform at the president's inaugural festivities one week and be gunned down in a Chicago park the next? We need to take a comprehensive approach to reducing gun violence, and the time is now to do it. Supporting nonprofit advocacy groups will help maintain the energy behind reform and keep pressure on our elected officials. Political leaders can no longer duck this issue or the growing grass-roots movement that it has inspired. The philanthropic community can help ensure our elected representatives make the right decisions. Private citizens can help make a difference in whatever way they are able -- writing a check, donating in-kind contributions, calling or writing their elected representatives, volunteering time to a nonprofit.","Writers: Americans want gun reform: 92% back background checks for each sale .

"Armed men stormed a boat off Nigeria's coast and took hostage two mariners believed to be U.S. citizens, a U.S. official said Thursday. Pirates kidnapped the captain and chief engineer from a U.S.-flagged oil platform supply vessel in the Gulf of Guinea on Wednesday, the official said. Details about the crew members' conditions and the condition of their ship, the C-Retriever, were not immediately available. Louisiana-based Edison Chouest Offshore, which owns the vessel, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea accounted for 30% of the 1,434 reported piracy attacks in African waters between 2003 and 2011 and the pace of attacks has risen since then, London-based think tank Chatham House reported in March. Chatham House reported 62 pirate attacks in the gulf in 2012, up from 39 in 2010. The think tank says it's partially because Western navies have cracked down on piracy off the coast of Somalia, on the other side of the continent. But it's unclear whether any troops will intervene after this week's attack in the Gulf of Guinea. Somali pirates cost global economy $18 billion a year . The Nigerian Navy has directed its operational commands and bases to search and rescue the crew members and the vessel, spokesman Commodore Kabir Aliy said.

"GAZA CITY (CNN)  -- Gaza's main hospital, already overloaded with Palestinians wounded in the week-long Israeli air assault, has reached critical mass, according to a Norwegian doctor volunteering at Shifa Hospital. A Palestinian father carries his wounded baby daughter into a hospital in Gaza City Sunday. ""The injured patients are mainly civilians, a lot of children with dreadful injuries,"" Dr. Erik Fosse told CNN on Monday, estimating that 20 percent of the more than 500 people dead were children. ""This figure is rising, and I think it has to do with the development of the war as it moves into the city,"" he added. After a weeklong series of air strikes, Israel launched a ground assault Saturday night. Palestinian medical officials said Israeli forces have killed 37 Palestinians -- both civilians and militants -- since moving into the territory. With those deaths, at least 507 Palestinians have been killed in the military operation, including about 100 women and children, officials said. In addition, 2,600 Palestinians have been injured, most of them civilians, officials said. ""We've had a steady stream (of patients) every day, but the last 24 hours has (been) about triple the number of cases,"" Fosse said late Sunday. Fosse said he estimated that about 30 percent of the casualties at Shifa -- Gaza City's main hospital -- on Sunday were children, both among the dead and wounded. The increase in casualties at Shifa followed Israel's ground incursion into Gaza. Fosse said 50 patients were ""severely wounded"" when an Israeli air strike hit a food market in Gaza City.  Watch Palestinians describe fearful life in Gaza » . ""We were operating in the corridors, patients were lying everywhere, and people were dying before they got treatment,"" he said. Most of the casualties were due to the air strikes that preceded the ground incursion. Other hospitals in Gaza could not treat the wounded because of a shortage of supplies and staff. Israel has said the military operation is a necessary self-defense measure after repeated rocket attacks from Gaza into southern Israel by Hamas militants. Israeli leaders say they are trying to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza. Last week, Dr. Eyad El-Sarraj, a psychiatrist who runs Gaza's mental health program, said Gaza was headed for ""a major humanitarian disaster"" unless the fighting ended soon. Meanwhile, at the Gaza-Egypt border, nearly 25 trucks carrying aid and medical supplies were unable to pass through the Rafah border crossing on Sunday, CNN's Karl Penhaul reported. Egyptian authorities said the guards who were manning the Palestinian side of the border had abandoned their posts. Aid workers and drivers banged on the gate to protest the closure.

An official with the humanitarian group World Vision also confirmed that report, saying: ""Unfortunately today, they closed the border, so no aid entered Gaza today."" ""There are food shortages ...

On Saturday -- before Israel launched its ground incursion -- old Palestinian ambulances had carried the wounded across the border, where patients were loaded into modern ambulances. Most of those taken into Egypt were civilians, including a teenage boy with his arm blown off, as well as a 4-day-old baby, who was not injured but needed to be kept on a ventilator and in an incubator. iReport.com: Share reactions to the crisis in the Middle East .

"L.T. Wright and Dan Coppins were craftsmen by trade when they decided to turn their hobby making custom knives into a sharp business idea. The Ohio-based buddies, who worked in the construction industry and shared a love for hunting and crafting, attended their first knife show together in 2007. The duo was so intrigued that they bought knife blades and products from the grocery store to craft their own knives -- all for $20 or less -- as a hobby. ""We went from a hobby standpoint and we were inspired by the knife makers,"" Coppins says. Proud of their creations, the friends met one afternoon to discuss going into the knife-making business together to fulfill their shared dream of becoming entrepreneurs. Over coffee, Wright told Coppins the story of his great-great-uncle, who built a shack behind his home in West Virginia with the help of a blind horse and few tools. Thus was born Blind Horse Knives. ""The name of the company and a business model were created before a knife for distribution was even made,"" Coppins said. The legacy of a blind horse, a vision and hard work have led Coppins and Wright to craft their own version of the American dream. Devoted to turning their hobby into a small business, the pair quit their jobs and set up shop in the basement of their homes. Financially, both men agree that it was a struggle in the beginning. The duo financed their small business using their own savings. ""We never borrowed money,"" Coppins says. ""We were making a fair living before,"" Wright says. But after quitting their jobs and creating a business, ""we couldn't afford a paycheck."" There were many nights when he second-guessed his decision to start his own business, Wright says. The will came from wanting to provide jobs for local craftsmen and family, and his passion for people and knives. The two crafted knives by hand through sleepless nights in their basements and drive an hour and a half every day to meet and exchange products to distribute. With several knives and nowhere to sell them, the pair attended a gun show where they met arrowhead maker R.W. Wilson, who began to mentor the men, teaching them about handcrafting and inviting them to shows to sell their products at his station. Finally feeling comfortable with the knives they produced, the two committed Blind Horse Knives to the cutlery show BLADE, where they received positive feedback and began taking orders. As the business began to grow, their wives got onboard with Blind Horse Knives with part-time jobs. Wright's daughter and son-in-law joined the team shortly after. They branded themselves through social media, gun and knife shows, and word of mouth. Instead of focusing on hard times and financial difficulty, the men saw the bigger picture. Asked if they were happy with the results, Coppins says the business is a blessing. ""If you have faith and believe, anything can happen."" Much has happened for Blind Horse Knives. As of 2013, the collaborators have their own publication, Self-Reliance Illustrated, host BHK Outdoors Radio (a weekend show) and own the first knife show they ever attended. Since it began, Blind Horse Knives has grossed more than $1 million and put 23 local craftsmen to work making 250 knives a week that have been delivered around the world, say Coppins and Wright. Their success is measured by customer satisfaction and the personal relationship fostered through every purchase. ""It's the drive,"" Wright says, ""We develop a customer and a friend for life by always pushing to be the best."" ""The American dream is having a house, car and family, but life has its ups and downs. The journey is what got us here. Believe in yourself and learn from the mistakes. Bad situations lead to good opportunities,"" Wright says.","Blind Horse Knives was created in 2007 by L.T Wright and Dan Coppins .

"Rep. Paul Ryan concludes that 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty, a pathway out of poverty has become a patchwork of bureaucratic challenges. The Wisconsin Republican has zeroed in on the subject in a comprehensive analysis that points to repetition and inefficiencies in federal poverty programs. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and a possible 2016 presidential candidate, released the 204-page report one day before President Barack Obama was due to unveil his budget blueprint for the next fiscal year. Read the report . Obama aims to ignite a conversation about federal safety net spending. Fifteen percent of Americans, nearly 50 million people, live in poverty. Ryan's report questions the size and scope of the government's effort to tackle poverty.  It says 92 federal programs geared for low-income people cost $799 billion per year. ""For too long, we have measured compassion by how much we spend instead of how many people get out of poverty,"" Ryan wrote said in a statement. ""We need to take a hard look at what the federal government is doing and ask, 'Is this working?'"" Considered a Republican policy visionary, the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee released the report amid a listening and learning tour of low-income neighborhoods that began 18 months ago after President Barack Obama was reelected. Ryan toured struggling neighborhoods with Bob Woodson, the head of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, an organization that works with disenfranchised people. In an interview with CNN in December, Woodson applauded Ryan's efforts because before he could write policy, he ""needs to understand what the needs are."" The political war on poverty . Ryan's report is highly critical of many of the programs, saying they contribute to the ""poverty trap."" Because ""benefits decline as recipients make more money - poor families face very high implicit marginal tax rates. The federal government effectively discourages them from making more money,"" the report says. It does not detail any solutions or alternatives; it identifies the programs, their cost and cites reports and studies on each program, with many concluding that the programs due more harm than good. For instance, in his analysis of the Social Security Insurance program for disabled, Ryan points to a report that says: ""At age 18, approximately two-thirds of beneficiaries remain on adult SSI benefits."" But not all of the reports he cites give negative reviews. For instance, Ryan cited numerous reports analyzing assistance for low-income families for child care found the program was effective in helping women enter the work force or enroll in education or job training programs. Paul Ryan welcomes Pope's welfare debate . ""This report will help start the conversation. It shows that some programs work; others don't. And for many of them, we just don't know,"" Ryan said. The report comes as Obama has amplified the issue of the growing wage gap between the rich and the poor, making income inequality a signature theme for this year that includes lifting the minimum wage. Ryan, who is a vocal advocate of a smaller government, has already met intense skepticism. The Democratic National Committee quickly pounced. This report is just a rehash of a failed economic agenda that Americans keep rejecting,"" DNC spokesman Michael Czin said in a statement. ""Republicans just don't get it.  Their plan is to block a minimum wage increase, cut access to higher education, slash early childhood programs, voucherize Medicare and shred the social safety net â€” a safety net that lifted 45 million Americans out of poverty in 2012 alone."" When he proposed reforms to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in 2010, he took immediate flak from Obama and Democrats who said he wanted to dismantle the big-ticket entitlements. The report was laced with partisan political ideas. For instance, it identified ""the breakdown of family"" as a main cause of poverty - a common Republican talking point that rankles Democrats. Dr. Mariana Chilton, director of the Center of Hunger Free Communities and associate professor at Drexel University, said she is pleased Ryan ""ignites a new conversation"" about poverty. But she said that some of the evidence he cites in his report, especially regarding food stamps and other nutrition assistance programs, is selective and incomplete. ""It would get an 'F' in my master's classes,"" she said. Since the presidential election when Mitt Romney came under fire for his ""47%"" comments, saying nearly half of all Americans think the government should provide for them, some high profile Republicans have tried to take up the mantle of poverty reduction. Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise conservative think tank who has worked with Paul on the issue of poverty, said the congressman's involvement in the issue ""really signals that this is a priority for conservative politicians today."" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has proposed ""economic freedom zones"" and traveled to struggling cities to talk about them. Even Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, unveiled an anti-poverty agenda in early January. Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights . ""The truth is, that by any estimation, things have gotten worse for poor people. It's appropriate for the (Republican) opposition to say, 'what do we have that's better?'"" Brooks said. Ryan is expected to continue the conversation and will likely have ""more to say in this area"" later this year, an aide said.","Rep.

"Monica Lewinsky writes that she's concerned a second Hillary Clinton bid for the White House would thrust her back into the spotlight. ""When I hear of Hillary's prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the next wave of paparazzi,"" she said in the upcoming issue of Vanity Fair. ""Like many Americans, I've been thinking about Hillary Clinton. What might happen, I've wondered, if she does run in 2016. And what if she wins -- and then wins a second term?"" she said. ""But when I think about these matters, there's a dimension at play for me other than just the fact that we might finally have a women in the White House,"" said Lewinsky. 'Burn the beret...' Her comments were taken from the full article that's due out on Thursday. It's the first time she's written about her affair with Bill Clinton, who was impeached over the resulting scandal. The Senate acquitted him of all charges. In excerpts released on Tuesday, Lewinsky, now 40, said the sexual relationship with Clinton while working as an intern in the mid-1990s was consensual and it was time to move on. ""It's time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress,"" she wrote, noting that she ""deeply"" regretted what occurred. ""Sure, my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship. Any 'abuse' came in the aftermath, when I was made a scapegoat in order to protect his powerful position,"" Lewinsky wrote. Wary of the next wave of stories . While Lewinsky remained in the public eye for a number of years after the controversy, she said little about the scandal over the past decade. As the former first lady considers running for president, Lewinsky worries about how the potential campaign could affect her. In addition to ""paparazzi,"" Lewinsky also is wary of ""the next wave of 'where is she now?' stories, the next reference to me in Fox News coverage of the primaries. I've begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life based, to some degree, on the political calendar. For me, it's a scenario in which the personal and political are impossible to separate,"" Lewinsky wrote. When Hillary Clinton ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, Lewinsky said that she ""remained virtually reclusive, despite being inundated with press requests."" 'Gun-shy yet again' She writes that she also put off announcing several media projects in 2012 until after that year's presidential election. ""And recently I've found myself gun-shy yet again, fearful of 'becoming an issue' should she decide to ramp up her campaign. But should I put my life on hold for another 8 to 10 years?"" Lewinsky asked. But she added that it was time to stop ""tiptoeing around my past -- and other people's futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. (What this will cost me, I will soon find out.)"" Lewinsky was constantly in the media during and shortly after the controversy. Handbags and grad school . She sold a line of handbags in 1999 and the next year she appeared in commercials for diet company Jenny Craig. In 2002, she appeared in an HBO special on the affair, and the next year she hosted a reality dating program. Lewinsky changed course in 2005, moving to Britain to obtain a master's degree in social psychology at the London School of Economics. She's stayed out of the spotlight since. In the Vanity Fair article, Lewinsky responds to reports made public in February that Hillary Clinton, in correspondence with close friend Diane Blair during the 1990s, had characterized Lewinsky as a ""narcissistic loony toon."" Lewinsky writes that her first thought was: ""If that's the worst thing she said, I should be so lucky."" She continued, ""Mrs. Clinton, I read, had supposedly confided to Blair that, in part, she blamed herself for her husband's affair (by being emotionally neglectful) and seemed to forgive him. Although she regarded Bill as having engaged in 'gross inappropriate behavior,' the affair was, nonetheless, 'consensual (was not a power relationship).'"" Blair's personal writings gave insight into the former first lady's views on the Lewinsky scandal, as well as a host of other issues. The papers were donated by Blair's family to the University of Arkansas. Asked about those conversations between Hillary Clinton and Blair, Lewinsky writes: ""Yes, I get it. Hillary Clinton wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband's mistress. She may have faulted her husband for being inappropriate, but I find her impulse to blame the Woman -- not only me, but herself -- troubling."" And she rejects the ""narcissistic loony toon"" label, saying that she refused to cooperate with interrogators offering the then-24-year-old immunity from the threat of jail time in return for wearing a wire to monitor staged conversations with two of Clinton's confidantes. ""Courageous or foolish, maybe,"" Lewinsky writes, ""but narcissistic and loony?"" The full article will appear in the June issue of Vanity Fair, which will be available in New York and Los Angeles and on the iPhone, iPad, Nook, and Kindle -- on Thursday. The magazine will hit national newsstands on May 13. Clintons' relationship with media still testy after all these years .

"Lionel Messi missed a penalty as Brazil defeated Argentina 2-0 in the Superclasico de Las Americas friendly fixture in Beijing Saturday. Goals either side of half-time from Diego Tardelli were enough to ensure Brazil trumped its great South American rival for the first time since 2012. A mix up in the Argentina defense enabled Atletico Miniero midfielder Tardelli to carefully place a volley beyond Argentina keeper Sergio Romero after 28 minutes. Messi then had the chance to draw la Albiceleste level after Angel Di Maria was brought down in the box just before half time. But the Barcelona star's tame penalty was easily saved by Jefferson in the Brazil goal. An unmarked Tardelli put Brazil out of sight when he took advantage of yet more poor Argentina defending to nod in an Oscar corner after 64 minutes. While not a competitive fixture, the result marks Brazil's third consecutive win since its disastrous exit at the hands of Germany at the 2014 World Cup. A Selecao has made wholesale changes to its football operation since that 7-1 semi-final humiliation in July. Former midfield star and manager at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Dunga, has replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari in the dugout while players such as Kaka and Robinho have been recalled to the squad after missing out on the World Cup. Suarez makes international return . Luis Suarez returned to international football for the first time since biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in Brazil earlier this year and set up Uruguay's only goal in a 1-1 friendly draw against Saudi Arabia Friday. The Barcelona striker was initially banned from all football activity for four months and nine international matches. But an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport saw the initial punishment altered to nine competitive internationals and allowed the 27-year-old to train with his teammates and take part in friendlies. Suarez's 47th minute strike rebounded off the post before being turned in to his own goal by Saudi defender Hassan Muath Fallatah. Substitute Naif Hazazi equalized for Saudi Arabia in the closing minutes to deny Uruguay victory.","Brazil defeat Argentina 2-0 in Beijing friendly .

"The pilot turned his airliner upside down. On purpose. And it saved nearly a hundred lives. That's the idea behind one of the most intense movie moments of the holiday season: the core scene of ""Flight,"" starring Denzel Washington as pilot Whip Whitaker. Hollywood sure likes Washington's performance. The role earned him an Oscar nomination Thursday on the heels of a Golden Globe nod in December. The film also received a nod for best original screenplay. Spinning movie sets combine with CGI to make the scene ""more than gut-wrenching,"" wrote CNN's Tom Charity. Hitflix ranks it among the ""most harrowing plane crashes ever seen."" (By the way, no spoilers here.) Thanks to masterful editing, we see a series of jerky, split-second glimpses of an ""engine failure"" panel light and then an uncontrolled dive and a plunging altimeter.  In a stunning command decision, Washington's character rolls the plane over on its back. We see tumbling passengers and tossed luggage and finally a smoky crash landing in an empty field. The scene stands as a breathtaking masterpiece of Hollywood's dream machine, but it pales in comparison with United Flight 232, a deadly real-life airline disaster that -- like the movie --- could have been much worse if not for remarkable efforts by heroic crew members. But first, is it possible to fly a commercial airliner upside down? Would excessive G-forces destroy it? That debate is raging right now on aviation Twitter feeds and websites. In the film, the pilot rolls the plane over to keep it flying longer. He avoids crashing into a neighborhood, saving countless lives. ""Flight"" director Robert Zemeckis, creator of the ""Back to the Future"" series, enjoyed a bit of artistic license here, said Larry Goodrich, the film's pilot consultant. Goodrich, a 32-year pilot -- first with the Air Force, then with Delta Air Lines -- trained pilots to fly MD-88s, which the movie's plane most resembles. During production, Goodrich said he reminded Zemeckis and Washington that ""you can turn an airplane like this over, but it's not going to fly like this very long. It's gonna go down."" ""He looked at me and he said, 'Can it fly upside down for a little bit?' I said, 'Yeah a little bit, but eventually you're gonna lose lift in the wings and you won't have the power to keep the airplane up.'"" ""It's hard to do and the planes aren't built for it,"" said another veteran commercial airline pilot. ""But when you're in that situation you'll do anything you can to save the airplane,"" said the pilot, who asked not to be named because he's not authorized by his airline to speak with the news media. When asked about flying upside down, Boeing, which inherited the MD-80 series after its 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, issued a no-nonsense statement. ""The MD-80 cannot sustain inverted flight,"" the statement said. ""The MD-80, as with all commercial airliners, was designed to fly upright. Commercial airliners are only tested and certified for upright flight."" Another thing that didn't ring true with Goodrich was the pilot leaving the cockpit during an emergency, as Washington's character did. Goodrich said he advised Zemeckis this scenario wasn't likely. The interaction between Washington's character and the co-pilot rubbed commercial airline pilot and blogger Patrick Smith the wrong way. ""Washington's character is arrogant and flip and condescending and his co-pilot's character is meek and weak and at times even scared and clueless,"" said Smith. ""This isn't how pilots behave. It reinforces the myth that the co-pilot is some sort of apprentice pilot."" The real deal . But as we all know, there's Hollywood -- and then there's the real deal. As one commenter on airspacemag.com put it, ""Hollywood could learn a lot from true life, i.e., United 232."" That's because when it comes to a real life loss of airliner flight control, situations don't get much worse than Flight 232. Al Haynes commanded the DC-10 that hot July day in 1989. The plane was about 75 miles north of Sioux City, Iowa, en route from Denver to Chicago with 11 crew and 285 passengers, when one of the plane's three engines failed. ""There was a loud BANG,"" Haynes said. The bang, he said, ""was followed by a large vibration lasting a few seconds."" The noise was the sound of a cracked engine fan disk shooting out of the tail engine and freakishly hitting in the worst possible spot. The disk severed all the plane's hydraulic lines, virtually cutting off all steering and speed control. Read federal investigators' report on the crash (PDF) For the next 45 minutes, Haynes, First Officer Bill Records, engineer Dudley Dvorak and instructor Dennis Fitch would need all their strength and good ideas to re-invent how to fly the DC-10. But unlike the movie, flying upside down was not the solution to escaping this emergency. ""When the engine failed, the airplane started to turn to the right and started to roll,"" said Haynes. ""If we had not stopped that and it had rolled over on its back, I'm sure the nose falling down would have increased the airspeed so fast that there's no way we could have controlled it."" ""If we had gotten upside down, the party was over."" They learned how to steer the plane by adjusting the power in the aircraft's two remaining engines. It was like trying to drive a car without power steering, said Haynes, only harder. The captain and Records struggled with the control wheel circling it steadily in right turn circles toward Sioux City airport. ""It was very tiring,"" Haynes said. At the same time, Fitch struggled on his knees as he was forced to use both hands to muscle the plane's throttle levers, which also had become hard to move. ""I'll tell you what, we'll have a beer when this is all done,"" Fitch told Haynes, according to the flight recorder transcript. ""Well, I don't drink,"" the captain replied, ""but I'll sure as hell have one."" In the cabin, flight attendants worked to calm passengers and prepare them for a crash landing. ""One passenger thought she was having a heart attack and the flight attendants calmed her down, and it turned out she wasn't having a heart attack, she was just very nervous,"" Haynes said. As the plane neared the ground at a much-too-fast speed, passengers were warned to brace for impact. Video of the DC-10's fiery cartwheel landing was plastered across TV news channels for months after the disaster. ""The minute we hit the ground, I was knocked out,"" Haynes recalls. ""I woke up in the cockpit talking to Dudley, I only remember bits and pieces of the conversation. I remember when the rescuers found us, someone asked, 'Are there really four of you in there?'"" One-hundred-ten passengers and one crew member -- flight attendant Rene Le Beau -- died in the crash. One-hundred-eighty-five passengers and crew survived. In the months after the disaster, authorities recreated the emergency in flight simulators. But the simulator pilots were unable to maintain control of the plane all the way through to landing. Sometimes life produces real events that rival Hollywood's wildest imaginations. That's what happened in 1989, when the crew of United Airlines Flight 232 achieved the nearly impossible.","Aviation buffs question authenticity of Denzel Washington movie ""Flight""

"What did the Nigerian government know about the mass abduction of schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants, and when did it know it? Those are the tough questions being asked after an explosive report made public Friday accused Nigerian military commanders of knowing the terror group was on its way to raid a boarding school in the town of Chibok at least four hours before 276 girls were abducted. The findings by human rights group Amnesty International echo accounts of a number of the parents and villagers, who have described to CNN an ineffective military response in the days and weeks after the girls were abducted. President Goodluck Jonathan's government vowed to investigate the allegations even as it defended its military response and questioned the motive behind the accounts. ""This is really outrageous, unbelievable,"" Minister of Information Labaran Maku told CNN. The moment the Nigerian government heard of the abduction, ""we went in to action,"" Maku said. ""...We shouldn't turn this into a trial of the Nigerian government."" Even as he vowed an investigation into the claims, Maku said it was ""inconceivable"" that soldiers on duty would not respond to a potential attack on a school. Hours after Nigeria's defense ministry dismissed the report's findings as ""unfortunate and untrue,"" the country's minister of state for defense vowed to get to the bottom of the allegation. ""We must investigate and ensure we get to the root of it,"" Musiliu Olatunde Obanikoro told CNN. ""And any necessary actions will be taken to ensure such a thing doesn't reoccur."" 'No reinforcements' Scrutiny of the government's response has escalated amid international outrage over the mass abduction, with many asking why Nigeria did not mount a larger response or ask for international help. The Amnesty International report alleges that after Nigerian commanders were informed of the pending attack, they were unable to raise enough troops to respond. The commanders left a contingent of between 15 and 17 soldiers and a handful of police officers in Chibok to fend off the militants, the group reported. ""When it was clear these girls had been abducted, no reinforcements were sent to the town,"" Makmid Kamara, a researcher with Amnesty International, told CNN. The report was based on the reports of more than a dozen people, including two senior Nigerian military officials, who gave varying, but consistent accounts, Kamara said. But Nigeria's defense ministry disputed the findings, saying the first word received was of an ongoing attack at Chibok. The troops ""did not receive four hours forewarning about the attacks,"" according to a statement released by Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade, a ministry spokesman. ""Rather, they received information of an ongoing attack on Chibok from troops on patrol"" who saw the attack and took on the militants. Borno state Sen. Ahmed Zannah said Friday that the military sent reinforcements, but not until the militants were already in Chibok. 'The soldiers were not there' As many as 200 Boko Haram fighters carried out the Chibok school raid, Amnesty reported, herding the girls out of bed under the cover of darkness after a firefight with the handful of security forces in the town. The Nigerian government has claimed it responded, with troops, helicopters and airplanes in the immediate aftermath of the mass abduction. But the father of two of the girls taken told CNN there has been little sign of military help. He said first learned of the attack in a telephone call from a friend in Chibok, who told him the town was under attack by Boko Haram. ""Pray for us,"" the friend told the father, whose identity is being withheld out of a fear of possible reprisal by Boko Haram and the government. The next day, the father learned his daughters and three nieces had been snatched. He and his family sought out the help of the military in the area. But, he says, ""the soldiers were not there."" Days later, a meeting was called by the elders of Chibok. ""They said the army will be there and a civilian detail will be there -- to accompany us into the bush"" to search for the girls, he said. But no military or government officials showed up, he said. ""Nothing. Nothing. Up to 21 days, nothing has been done,"" he said. 'Unfair' criticism . Nigerian officials have frequently been criticized for failing to prevent Boko Haram's deadly attacks, particularly in the terror group's stronghold of northeastern Nigeria. Obanikoro, the minister of state for defense, called the criticism ""grossly unfair."" At least 2,000 people have died in violence in northern Nigeria this year alone, Amnesty said. The most recent Boko Haram attack killed at least 310 people in a town that had been used as a staging ground for troops searching for the missing girls. U.S. and British officials have arrived in Abuja to supplement a U.S. team already on the ground there, according to officials. They will help Nigeria's government look for the missing girls, plan rescue missions and advise on ways to subdue Boko Haram. ""This isn't time for a blame game. We are happy help is coming,"" Obanikoro said. U.S. officials, at least, say they are unlikely to commit troops to combat operations. And it's unclear if Nigeria would allow U.S. or U.K. troops on the ground. ""We know the experiences the two nations are bringing to the table, and we intend to ensure that that wealth of experience is"" used to bring about an end to the situation, Obanikoro said. 'Many soldiers are afraid' According to Amnesty, civilian officials in a nearby town and leaders of an armed vigilante group organized by the military informed nearby military posts that armed militants had passed through on their way to Chibok hours before the April 14 assault on the boarding school. The human rights group said an official in the village of Gagilam told its investigators that residents had spoken of strangers who passed through on motorcycles, saying they were on their way to Chibok. The group cited another official as saying the men had asked herders for directions to the school. The group also cited unnamed senior Nigerian commanders as saying they were aware of the attack even before the calls from the civilian leaders and vigilante groups. But they weren't able to muster enough troops to respond, Amnesty cited the commanders as saying. ""There's a lot of frustration, exhaustion and fatigue among officers and (troops) based in the hotspots,"" Amnesty quoted one of the unnamed commanders as saying. ""Many soldiers are afraid to go to the battle fronts."" Where are the girls? Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, took credit for the mass kidnappings in a video that surfaced this week. He said he planned to sell the girls into slavery. A few escapees shared harrowing tales of escaping into a nearby forest. U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, who serves as Pentagon press secretary, said officials believe the girls ""have been broken up into smaller groups"" but declined to detail how they came to the conclusion. His sentiment has been echoed by others. ""The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad, to see if we can find information,"" said Gordon Brown, a former UK prime minister and the U.N.'s special envoy for global education. But Jonathan believes the girls are still in Nigeria, somewhere in the Sambisa forest. ""If they move that number of girls into Cameroon, people will see. So I believe they are still in Nigeria,"" he said. International outrage has escalated over the nation's largely ineffective effort to subdue Boko Haram. Amnesty is not the first to accuse Nigeria of failing to take enough action to stop the Chibok raid or other attacks, or to stage a forceful enough response in the aftermath. Jonathan waited three weeks before speaking to the nation on the matter.  He said that rescue efforts were under way at the time but that they could not be disclosed publicly. ""In a hostage situation, time is of the essence,"" Kirby said. ""We lost some time."" International response . The international effort to buttress that fight ratcheted up Friday with the arrival of U.S. and British advisers. Six U.S. military advisers arrived Friday, a U.S. official told CNN. They will join a team of U.S. and British officials already in Nigeria, helping find the girls, planning rescue efforts and devising strategies to help subdue Boko Haram. A British team drawn from the country's Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence also arrived in Abuja on Friday, the British foreign office said. France also said it is sending a team but didn't provide specifics on what expertise it will bring. British satellites and advanced tracking capabilities also will be used, and China has promised to provide any intelligence gathered by its satellite network, Nigeria said. There are no plans to send U.S. combat troops, Kirby said.","""We must investigate"" the claims, Nigeria's minister of state for defense says .

"(CNN) -- Inspirational Joanna Rowsell added another gold to her rapidly growing collection with a classy victory in the individual pursuit at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow Friday. Rowsell is already the world champion in the discipline and was part of the British trio which won the Olympic team pursuit title at London 2012. That performance put Rowsell into the global spotlight -- not least because she suffers from alopecia -- a condition that sees sufferers lose their hair. Further success has followed in the team event, which now involves four-strong lineups, but Rowsell has backed that up with her solo efforts over three kilometer distance -- 12 laps of the indoor velodrome. The 25-year-old qualified fastest with a Commonwealth Games record of three minutes 29.038 seconds and beat Australia's Annette Edmondson by nearly four seconds in the final in the evening session. After her latest triumph, Rowsell said she hoped her success would help raise awareness of her condition. Special triumph . ""I didn't realize before the London Olympics that it (alopecia) affected so many people. I was able to bring it to the public eye. I'd like to do more in the future for people who suffered with it,"" she said. ""I won the world title back in February this year but since then I've had a bit of a up and down season with illness and injury so I just so glad it has all come together, because you only get this opportunity once every four years. ""It's very special,"" she added. Edmondson's brother Alex also had to settle for silver in the final of the men's 4,000 individual pursuit, beaten by fellow Australian and world record holder Jack Bobridge. England's Jason Kenny, the reigning Olympic champion, lost out in the final of the men's sprint to 23-year-old New Zealander Sam Webster, beaten by half a wheel in the deciding race of three. Doping shock . The Games was hit by its first major doping story Friday, with news that Welsh 400m hurdler Rhys Williams had failed a test at the international meeting in Glasgow earlier this month. Williams, a former European champion in the 400m hurdles, denied knowingly taking a banned substance. ""I am utterly devastated about the news of this anti-doping rule violation, which has come as a great shock to me,"" he said in a statement. Williams, 30, was the co-captain of the Wales track and field team at the Games, but was immediately withdrawn. His teammate, 800m runner Gareth Warburton, pulled out last week after a failed test. ""Welsh Athletics is obviously concerned that this is the second anti-doping violation by a senior Welsh international athlete and will be conducting its own internal review,"" it said in a statement Friday. Proud moment . England's Benjamin Proud won their first gold in the swimming in the men's 50m butterfly, beating South African duo Roland Schoeman and 200m Olympic butterfly champion Chad le Clos. The 19-year-old set a new British record of 22.93 in taking gold from the illustrious duo. ""Proud is a talented athlete,"" said the 34-year-old Schoeman. There was an upset in the women's 100m butterfly as Australia's Alicia Coutts finished out of the medals in fourth behind Canada's Katerine Savard, who won gold in 57.40 seconds, a Games record.","Joanna Rowsell wins Commonwealth Games gold in individual pursuit .

"(CNN) -- [Breaking news update at 11:50 p.m. Thursday] . The United States respects the vote by the British parliament not to participate in a potential military action against Syria, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Friday. ""Every nation has a responsibility to make their own decisions, and we respect that of any nation,"" he told journalists in Manila, the Philippines. In spite of the British decision, it remains the goal of the Obama administration that any decision be ""an international collaboration,"" he said. [Original story, posted at 10:36 p.m. Thursday] . (CNN) The United States may have to take action against Syria without the support of one of its staunchest allies, U.S. officials said Thursday after British lawmakers voted down a proposal for military action. Washington will continue to consult with Britain, but ""President Obama's decision-making will be guided by what is in the best interests of the United States,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement issued Thursday evening. The reaction followed news the House of Commons rebuffed Prime Minister David Cameron's call for a strong response to claims Syria used chemical weapons against its own people, raising questions about what, if any, timeline the United States may follow for a possible strike. Obama has not spelled out what steps the United States will take in response to last week's reported attack against civilians in a Damascus suburb, allegedly leaving hundreds dead. ""He believes that there are core interests at stake for the United States and that countries who violate international norms regarding chemical weapons need to be held accountable,"" Hayden said. Unilateral action was ""a possibility"" following the results of the late-night Parliament vote in London, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. ""We care what they think. We value the process. But we're going to make the decision we need to make,"" the official said. The vote among UK lawmakers came after a long day of debate, and it appeared to catch Cameron and his supporters by surprise. For days, the prime minister has been sounding a call for action, lending support to talk of a U.S.- or Western-led strike against Syria. ""I strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons, but I also believe in respecting the will of this House of Commons,"" the prime minister said. ""I get that and the government will act accordingly,"" he said. The head of the opposition Labour Party, Ed Miliband, called Cameron's call for action ""cavalier and reckless."" ""I think today the House of Commons spoke for the British people who said they didn't want a rush to war, and I was determined we learned the lessons of Iraq and I'm glad we've made the prime minister see sense this evening,"" he told Press Association. Iran: U.S. military action in Syria would spark 'disaster' At the United Nations, a closed-door Security Council meeting ended with no agreement on a resolution to address the growing crisis in Syria, a Western diplomat told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh on condition of anonymity. ""It was clear there was no meeting of minds, and no agreement on the text. It is clear that our approaches are very different and we are taking stock (of the next steps),"" the diplomat said of the session, which was called by Syria's longtime ally, Russia. The members of the Security Council expect U.N. weapons inspectors to brief Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon shortly after they depart Syria on Saturday. Ban, in turn, will swiftly brief the Security Council on the findings, the diplomat said. China, which along with Russia has staunchly opposed any military intervention in Syria, called for U.N. weapons inspectors to be allowed to complete their investigation. ""China calls on parties concerned to exercise restraints and calmness, adhering to the right track of political solution,"" Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a statement. Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee has concluded it was ""highly likely"" that Syrian government forces used poison gas outside Damascus last week in an attack that killed at least 350 people, according to a summary of the committee's findings released Thursday. Speaking in the House of Commons before the vote, Cameron said failure to respond would undo ""decades of painstaking work"" to prevent such weapons from being unleashed. ""The global consensus against the use of chemical weapons will be fatally unraveled,"" he said. ""A 100-year taboo will have been breached."" In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was still weighing a potential response, but said his administration was working on a ""compressed timeline."" Why Russia, Iran and China are standing by Assad . U.N. weapons inspectors are now in Syria trying to confirm the use of chemical weapons. The inspectors are expected to leave the country by Saturday morning, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government denies using the weapons against opposition forces and says its troops were the victims, not perpetrators, of recent gas attacks; but both British and U.S. officials say the rebels have no capability to use poison gas on the scale of the August 21 attack near Damascus, which opposition sources said killed more than 1,300. ""There is no credible intelligence or other evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of CW by the opposition,"" Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee concluded in a document released Thursday. ""The JIC has therefore concluded that there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility."" Chemical weapons in Syria: How did we get here? Cameron said the debate was not about regime change or invasion. And he said his government would not act without first hearing from the U.N. inspectors, giving the world body a chance to weigh in and giving Parliament another chance to vote. But the prime minister said failing to act would give al-Assad the unmistakable signal that he could use poison gas ""with impunity."" The British dossier on Syria also concluded the government had used chemical weapons on 14 previous occasions, and Cameron said al-Assad stepped up their use last week as a sort of test for the world. The government said it could justify the use of force against Syria on humanitarian grounds, to stop the suffering, even if the United Nations declined to authorize a strike. ""The aim is to relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring or disrupting the further use of chemical weapons,"" the government said. UK Government's legal position on Syrian regime's chemical weapon use . Syria's government offered its own arguments against such an intervention. In an open letter to British lawmakers, the speaker of Syria's parliament riffed on British literary hero William Shakespeare, saying: ""If you bomb us, shall we not bleed?"" But in a veiled warning to the United Kingdom, the letter also invoked Iraq, a conflict justified on the grounds that Iraq had amassed stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was working toward a nuclear bomb -- claims that were discovered to have been false after the 2003 invasion. ""Those who want to send others to fight will talk in the Commons of the casualties in the Syrian conflict. But before you rush over the cliffs of war, would it not be wise to pause? Remember the thousands of British soldiers killed and maimed in Afghanistan and Iraq, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead, both in the war and in the continuing chaos."" British Commons Speaker John Bercow published the letter. And al-Assad has vowed to defend his country against any outside attack. ""The threats of launching an aggression against Syria will increase its commitments to its rooted principles and its independent decision that originated from the will of its people, and Syria will defend itself against any aggression,"" the Syrian president said Thursday in a speech to Yemeni politicians. Syria: Who wants what after chemical weapons horror . Obama faces calls for American vote on force . Across the Atlantic, Obama said in a televised interview Wednesday that he has no doubt Syria used chemical weapons on its own people. He said government claims that the opposition used them were impossible. ""We do not believe that, given the delivery systems, using rockets, that the opposition could have carried out these attacks. We have concluded that the Syrian government in fact carried these out. And if that's so, then there need to be international consequences,"" he said on ""PBS NewsHour"" Wednesday. Obama said that he has not made a decision about whether to conduct a military strike in Syria. A senior administration official said the United States would continue to consult with British officials, but declined to say if the slowdown in London would affect U.S. decision-making on Syria. The president is facing doubts at home as well: More than 160 members of Congress, including 63 Democrats, have now signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a ""full debate"" before any U.S. action. Ghitis: 5 reasons U.S. must intervene in Syria . The author of one of those letters, Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California, said Obama should seek ""an affirmative decision of Congress"" before committing American forces. More than 90 members of Congress, most of them Republican, signed another letter by GOP Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia. That letter urged Obama ""to consult and receive authorization"" before authorizing any such military action. Congress is currently in recess until September 9.

"John Meyers remembers standing at ground zero, feeling like a small speck amid mountains of debris. ""Everything was pulverized,"" said Meyers, a former New York police officer and first-responder who provided security after the September 11 terror attacks. ""It was nothing but dust."" For 20 days, during 14-hour shifts, Meyers breathed in countless chemicals; he even ate meals on site as the dust hovered. Most of that time, he did not wear a mask.  In retrospect, he said, ""We were ingesting whole buildings."" Less than four years later, at age 46, Meyers was diagnosed with stage IV oropharyngeal cancer.  One tumor had formed in Meyers' throat and two on his lymph nodes.  An ultrasound later revealed another tumor near his collarbone. ""All four were malignant,"" said Meyers, who choked up as he recalled being diagnosed. ""I asked, 'What's my chances?' No one could give me an answer."" According to the most recent data from the World Trade Center Health Program, there are nearly 3,000 cases of cancer among firefighters, police officers, contractors and civilians who worked or lived near the site of the attacks. A growing number are being diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer, but some -- including Meyers -- are being denied insurance coverage because their cancers were diagnosed too soon after 9/11. The minimum latency period for oropharyngeal cancers -- in other words, the minimum time period required to prove a link between exposure to toxins at ground zero and a diagnosis of that type of cancer -- is four years. (Absent this type of dramatic environmental exposure, oropharyngeal cancers in most cases take one or two decades to develop, although recent studies suggest that cases are being diagnosed at younger ages and more frequently.) Meyers was diagnosed three years and 10 months after his work at ground zero, about eight weeks shy of eligibility for cancer coverage or compensation. ""We got screwed,"" he said. ""They don't know what the latency period should be; four years may be right, or it may be wrong."" The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined the latency periods for 58 cancers, including oropharyngeal, now covered under its WTC Health Program. In a statement, the institute said it ""selected minimum latencies informed by the available science"" and that it ""erred on the member-favorable side to avoid false negatives for coverage."" In documents outlining its process, the agency acknowledged that, for the most part, data in this area are scant. ""At the time they came up with the latency period, there was nothing unreasonable about it,"" said Noah Kushlefsky, a partner at the Kreindler & Kreindler law firm in New York, which is representing thousands of 9/11 responders, including Meyers. That is because it was not known what effects cancer would have on this population. But in the two years since latency for cancers was spelled out -- and many cases later -- Kushlefsky says, it has become ""an inescapable fact that the latency period has to be wrong."" Wrong, he says, because of the sheer number of oropharyngeal cancer cases he is seeing cross his desk. Kushlefsky, along with colleagues at another New York law firm, represents about 7,500 people exposed to toxins while working at ground zero. He says 39 have been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer.  About one-quarter of that group was denied coverage because of the four-year latency rule. To have so many cases of a rare cancer -- diagnosed in an unusually young population, according to data provided by Kushlefsky -- should, he says, spur a re-examination of the data by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, says that oropharyngeal cancer in this population, absent risk factors like drinking, smoking or a human papillomavirus infection, is unusual. Still, determining an accurate latency window is an exceedingly complex process. ""Four years is a group of people's best guess; it's literally that,"" said Brawley, a practicing oncologist. ""I don't know of any animal models for cancers developed after sucking in that much soot and smoke (from collapsed buildings), so people have to make a guess."" Brawley added that four years is probably a fair -- perhaps even generous -- timeline for developing oropharyngeal cancer, even considering the unique circumstances surrounding 9/11. Not everyone agrees. ""I think (the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) made a terrible mistake,"" said Michael Banahan, a first-responder diagnosed with stage III oropharyngeal cancer at age 44, three years and five months after 9/11. Like Meyers, he was denied coverage because he was diagnosed too soon. ""I'm going to die knowing I got my cancer from 9/11. I don't care what NIOSH says."" Advocates for responders, including medical experts, say that they will petition the institute to amend its rules concerning coverage for oropharyngeal cancer. In a statement, the institute indicated that as new scientific information becomes available, it could modify minimum latencies for certain cancers. ""This has to be a dynamic process where they look at what's going on this community and say, 'Maybe we need to change this,' "" Kushlefsky said. Banahan and Meyers have been in remission for several years, yet both remain hypervigilant about cancer, as it could one day reappear. Compensation, they say, would provide some comfort that their families would be supported if they die. But it is less about money, Meyers says, than about not being forgotten. ""There is an abnormal amount of cancers amongst us that aren't in the general population,"" he said.  ""This is something that has to be looked at.""

"Vincent Harris, Ted Cruz's top digital operative, is leaving the Texas senator's team to work for Sen. Rand Paul's political operation, as the jostling for staff ramps up ahead of the 2016 GOP presidential primary contest. Harris will join Rand Paul's political action committee and his 2016 team as a chief digital strategist, according to Doug Stafford, executive director of RAND PAC. Rand Paul talks climate change with Bill Maher . Stafford said Harris will sit at the ""top of the leadership team,"" as Paul and his inner circle carry out what's expected to be a dizzying political schedule. Paul will likely announce his Senate re-election bid in the coming days, and he's said he'll make a decision on a White House run in the spring. Cruz has also kept the door open to a 2016 presidential campaign. Paul's team was attracted to Harris' push for Republicans to make digital operations a more robust part of campaigns, Stafford said. ""We want to be leaders on that,"" he continued, saying Harris will focus on strategies involving data, websites, and social media among other things. Harris, 26, runs Harris Media, a digital strategy firm based out of Austin that has more than 20 employees. The firm helped reinvent Sen. Mitch McConnell's digital presence ahead of the Kentucky senator's successful re-election win this fall. Rand Paul to oppose Senate NSA reform bill . While Harris has had a number of widely-known clients â€” Rick Perry, Rick Scott, Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich â€” he gained a higher profile of his own after helping Cruz defeat Lt.

Harris said he sent his resignation letter to Cruz's team Monday, and he's ""very excited"" to work for Paul's team, saying it will be his his firm's ""marquee client"" in the next election cycle.

"The fallout over U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin's controversial comments on rape jolted Republicans nationally on Monday and threatened longer-term consequences for them, potentially reviving the ""war on women"" debate and possibly hurting their campaign to win control of the Senate. Republican leaders let out a collective groan when Akin claimed in a television interview on Sunday that ""legitimate rape"" rarely resulted in pregnancy, saying that ""the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."" A social conservative congressman, Akin apologized repeatedly as the political uproar intensified and sought to clarify his remarks, saying he misspoke. Democrats skewered him nevertheless and many top Republicans called for Akin to reconsider his decision to stay in the Missouri race a week before they nominate Mitt Romney for president at their Tampa convention. Abortion moves front and center . In an interview with the National Review Online, Romney said that Akin's comments on rape were ""insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong."" But Democrats sensed a political opening to shift the conversation away from the sluggish economy, saying that Republicans led by Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, were pushing policies that were anti-women. Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at the Cook Political Report, said Akin potentially reignited the ""war on women"" rhetoric that factored prominently in the political debate earlier this year and for a time put Republicans on the defensive. ""It plays into this Democratic messaging that it is not a party friendly to women,"" Duffy said. ""As the top political story of the day it is going to be something that plays into the larger narrative that Democrats want in order to appeal to women voters."" A Republican National Committee member who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity said the issue is ""is not where (Governor) Romney and his ticket want to spend their time"" between now and Election Day. President Barack Obama handily won over women voters in the 2008 election and holds an edge with that key bloc in his race with Romney, polls show. A recent Gallup survey showed Obama with an 8% lead over his Republican rival among women. The ""war on women"" label stemmed in part from a fierce political fight in Washington this year over contraception coverage for employees of religiously affiliated institutions. Congress, in addition, waged a partisan fight over updates to the Violence Against Women Act. The Romney campaign has adopted a message that Democrats are the ones waging a ""war on women."" For instance, Romney has accused the Obama's administration of failing working women. The potential longer-term implications of the Akin controversy also were evident in Republican calls for him to withdraw from his Senate race where incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill has been trailing in the polls. Republicans were concerned the flare-up would permanently harm their chances of upending McCaskill in November and push them closer to taking control of the Senate. Ron Bonjean, a veteran GOP strategist for several congressional leaders and partner at the political communications firm Singer Bonjean Strategies, said Akin's comments were ""politically indefensible"" and ""virtually guarantees"" McCaskill would be re-elected. Outside of Missouri,  Republican Sen. Scott Brown, locked in a tough fight in Massachusetts, also called for Akin to step aside. Stuart Rothenberg editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, said he has been told by Republican strategists that Akin is now ""too radioactive."" ""There is a lot of national pressure being put on Akin that he's not going to be able to raise Republican money and get the party behind him,"" Rothenberg said. Akin said he plans to remain in the race. Video of the Akin interview with Missouri television station KTVI was posted online by the liberal super PAC American Bridge.","Rep.

"Four months after his birth in Hamilton, Ontario, Devin Scullion was diagnosed with one of the rarest diseases known to humans. He was born two months premature, and his mother, Jamie Madley, said she knew right away something was wrong. ""He was big for a preemie,"" Madley said.  ""His joints were tight, his movements were robotic, his skin was thin -- you could see his veins everywhere.  I just didn't know what it was."" Devin's doctors were also baffled, she said, surmising he might have a dermatological problem or a lack of calcium. But Devin had a genetic condition called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, also known as progeria, which causes premature, accelerated aging.  Children with the disease have a genetic mutation that causes them to produce the protein progerin, which blocks normal cell function. Progeria affects approximately one in every 4 million to 8 million infants. There are only about 200 children living with the disease worldwide. There is only one other child in Canada with the disease, according to Madley. As they age rapidly, these children suffer from a loss of body fat and hair and an inability to gain weight. They are prone to developing osteoporosis, a disease where bones become weak and are more likely to break. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, most girls develop about 90% of their bone mass by age 18 and boys by age 20. Building strong bones during childhood helps prevent osteoporosis in adulthood.  This is why children with progeria have such issues with bone density and rigidity. Heart disease due to atherosclerosis, also known as hardening of the arteries, is a critical problem for children with progeria. These children can have heart attacks or strokes as early as age 5. Most die of heart disease by  age  13. However, encouraging results from the first clinical drug trial for children with progeria has researchers hopeful that the first treatment for the disease could be on the horizon. When Devin was diagnosed, the cause of progeria was unknown and the prognosis was bleak. ""There wasn't much information. It was pretty much, 'There's nothing we can do for your son, take him home and enjoy him while he's there,'"" Madley said. ""There was pretty much no hope. There really wasn't any kind of medication. I did what I could -- I put him on a diabetic diet, had him on vitamins."" Doctors told her the life span for a child with progeria was about 13 years, but Devin would likely live about 7 years. That was 16 years ago. There have been ups and downs. When Devin was 6, he suffered two strokes just three weeks apart. He fought through paralysis and hip dysplasia, and had to learn how to walk again. But much has happened in the past 16 years. In 2003, Dr. Francis Collins and his team of researchers at the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health discovered the gene that causes this fatal disease. Now, results from the first clinical drug trial are offering hope for researchers, children with progeria and their parents. The drug, called Lonafarnib, was originally developed by Merck & Co. to treat numerous adult cancers and pediatric brain cancer.  For the past 2½ years, 26 children with progeria from 16 countries took Lonafarnib orally twice a day. Devin Scullion is one of those children. Researchers say every child in the study either gained weight or showed improvements in bone structure or arterial stiffness. Side effects from the drug were manageable: upset stomach, weight loss and diarrhea. No one dropped out of the study as a result. The results, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, are called exciting by researchers. ""It's huge,"" said Dr. Leslie Gordon, lead author of the study and medical director of the Progeria Research Foundation. ""Progeria has always been a 100% fatal pediatric disease for which there was not treatment. ""Now, we not only have our first treatment, but we know for the first time that some aspects of the disease can be improved, and this inspires us to work harder and faster toward additional treatments for progeria that could hopefully work in conjunction with Lonafarnib to make a difference in the health of children with progeria."" Gordon is also a scientist on staff at Boston Children's Hospital where the trial was conducted.  Her 15-year-old son, Sam Berns, has Progeria. Gordon said the results give her hope that a cure is possible. ""I think that we have just sort of just broken open the first of many possibilities here for the children,"" Gordon said. ""It is possible that some systems affected in Progeria may be resistant to treatment. But if a cure means getting rid of progerin and really affecting the cardiovascular system in a big way so that these children live longer lives, then trials gives us a lot of hope. I think we can do this for the children and I think it's what the children deserve."" Dr. Mark Kieran, director of pediatric medical neuro-oncology at Boston Children's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Insititute, is the principal investigator of the study. iReport: The girl who looks old . In general, the weight gain seen among patients was small, but still measurable, he said. The real surprise was the reduction in stiffness and thickness of major arteries, which decreased 35%, according to the study. ""The fundamental question is whether this treatment is actually going to extend the life span of these kids,"" Kieran said.  ""This is a hard question to answer, because you will have to treat them for years and years before you would know that. ""The fact that you can see a number of things getting better, particularly some of the cardiovascular parameters, is pretty exciting and gives both us and the families hope that we're on the right track."" So far, that track has led to another trial.  Researchers are two years into a second study involving 45 children from around the globe, including 20 of the original participants, Kieran said. Scientists have added two more drugs that attack the abnormal protein in a different way.   Researchers have also identified another 35 children with progeria, making a total of 80, and there are plans for a third trial that will include these children and a fourth drug. ""It's incredibly fast when you think that the mutation causing this disease was discovered less than 10 years ago,"" Kieran said. iReport: Girl with progeria graduates from elementary school . But even that optimism is tempered. More research is needed, Gordon said. ""We will not know whether heart attacks, strokes or longevity are influenced by this very short study,"" she said. ""We may need another 10 years to determine if heart attacks, strokes and length of life are influenced by Lonafarnib. ""The key thing is that, for the first time, we've shown that some aspect of the cardiovascular disease can be improved in Progeria, and we never knew that before.  Whether this will translate into fewer heart attacks, strokes or greater longevity we won't know for a very long time."" Dr. Francis Collins, whose discovery of the gene led to the current advances, agreed. ""It's an encouraging development,"" he said. ""Ten years ago, we had no idea what caused this disease ... in a rather dramatically accelerated period of time, we have evidence of a treatment that seems to provide benefit. ""But let me be clear, this is not a cure,"" he said. ""These children are not suddenly going to have a life like any other kids. We still have a lot to do before we will know if we are really prolonging life and reducing serious medical problems."" Still, Collins said, what has happened so far is pretty remarkable. ""Oftentimes this kind of progress takes two decades or more. It's almost unprecedented that researchers went from discovery of the cause to starting a clinical trial just four years later. One of the lessons is the value of looking for new uses of drugs that have already been developed for some other disease and are already known to be safe in humans. To inspire similar success stories, he said, the National Institutes of Health and the drug industry have recently partnered to ""crowd source"" the potential to repurpose drugs, ""effectively teaching old drugs new tricks."" According to Collins, the need is great. There are 4,700 diseases where molecular causes have been discovered, mostly within the past 10 years, he said. But only about 250 of them are treatable. Clue to kids' early aging disease found . ""This encouraging example from progeria, one of the rarest of all human diseases, should give a shot in the arm to make this therapeutic story happen again and again,"" he said. Madley feels the clinical trial gave Devin a ""shot in the arm.""  He's participating in the second study and while she doesn't have his individual trial results yet, she knows the drug has helped him. ""He's doing great, much better than before the trial,"" she said. ""His energy level is higher, it's easier to get him up, his eating habits changed, he eats a lot more. They don't need to tell me that his cardiovascular has improved, I know it.  He's more active, moving better -- he still uses his walker, but not as often."" He also has gained weight.  The 4-foot-tall high school junior weighed 23 pounds when he started the trial. Now, he's up to 31 pounds. ""It's huge. It's a miracle,"" Madley said. ""I feel I'm going to have him longer, I really, really do.  I feel I may see him become a man.  That would be more than words could describe.  I never thought I would live to see this. ... He's already talking about going to college, getting out in the world and getting a job."" Devin has new hope, she said. ""He's got dreams.  He wants to be a pilot.  He wants to fly planes.  His saying is, 'Dream big or go home.'""","Devin Scullion has outlived doctors' expectations .

"The Obama administration plans to seek more than $6 billion from Congress to fight Ebola, an official told CNN Wednesday, hours after the World Health Organization said an outbreak of the deadly virus had claimed more than 4,800 lives. Here's a look at those developments, and other steps in worldwide efforts to combat Ebola, based on CNN""s reporting: . New funding to fight deadly virus? U.S. President Barack Obama's administration wants Congress to provide more than $6 billion in ""emergency funding"" to fight Ebola, an Office of Management and Budget official said. That includes $4.5 billion for immediate response and $1.5 billion for a contingency fund, the official said. The goal? ""To strengthen our domestic public health systems, contain and mitigate the outbreak in West Africa, speed efforts to obtain and test vaccines and therapeutics, and further reduce risks to Americans by helping vulnerable countries enhance their capacity to prevent disease outbreaks, detect them early, and swiftly respond before they become epidemics that threaten our national security,"" the official said. ""These activities are critical to combat the spread of Ebola and reduce the potential for future outbreaks of infectious diseases that could follow a similarly devastating, costly, and destabilizing trajectory,"" the official said. Global Ebola case numbers grow . The World Health Organization's latest report on the worldwide Ebola response says there have been 13,042 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola and 4,818 reported deaths. The number of weekly probable and suspected cases appears to be on the decline nationwide in Liberia, though the death toll there increased by 248, the WHO said in the report, released Wednesday. In Sierra Leone, the weekly incidence continues to rise, the WHO said. As of November 2, 546 health care workers are known to be infected with Ebola and 310 have died, according to WHO. Spanish nurse's assistant leaves hospital . A Spanish nurse's assistant who left the hospital Wednesday after beating Ebola said she was still weak but gave thanks to God and the health workers who cared for her that she was still alive. Looking frail but happy, Teresa Romero Ramos was greeted by cheers as she spoke to journalists, with her husband, Javier Limon. Romero, who described her recovery as a miracle from God, said she was ready to do whatever she could to help others infected with Ebola. New York doctor's condition improving . Dr. Craig Spencer, the doctor who returned to the United States from Guinea and tested positive for Ebola, ""continues to show improvement and is stable,"" New York City health officials said Wednesday. A person who had been under quarantine due to contact with Spencer will now be subject to direct active monitoring, according to a joint release from the NYC Department of Health and the NYC Health and Hospitals Corporation. ""This person's daily movements in New York City will no longer be restricted, and the individual will be assessed twice each day by Health Department staff,"" officials said. Dallas nurse's contacts cleared . The contacts of nurse Amber Vinson, one of the Dallas nurses infected with Ebola, are clear of the deadly virus, health officials said. ""All 163 contacts that we were monitoring have been cleared,"" the Ohio Department of Health said on Twitter. Vinson was discharged last week from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital after she was declared free of the disease. Obama speaks with staff of U.S. military-built hospital in Monrovia .

"London (CNN) -- The German Bundesliga has set the standard on the football pitch in recent months, now the league's bank accounts are the envy of Europe after a report declared the competition to be the continent's most profitable. The English Premier League continues to lead the way in terms of revenue, raking in $3.8 billion for the 2011-12 season, according to sports business group Deloitte. But the German league bests its rivals with combined profits of $242 million, compared to $154 million for the Premier League. The profit of clubs in the Bundesliga remained the same despite a drop in overall revenue to $2.36 billion for 2011-12 season, compared to $2.56 billion a year earlier. The Bundesliga's booming balance sheets reflect the division's recent on-field dominance. Runners-up in 2012, Bayern Munich were crowned kings of Europe in May after beating Borussia Dortmund in the first all-German Champions League final. ""The reason the Bundesliga is more profitable than the Premier League really comes down to the regulations that German football authorities have in place,"" Paul Rawnsley, a director at Deloitte, told CNN. ""They have a much stronger central control over the ownership and financial models of clubs."" Rawnsley says there are two main aspects to rulings which enable German clubs to maximize their profits. ""Firstly, the regulations constrain the club's costs, and hence wage costs, as the clubs are limited in terms of how much they can spend in terms of wages-to-revenue ratio. ""Secondly, the regulations on club ownerships and the restrictions on external owners mean German clubs do not have the levels of extra contributions that we have seen in England. ""Over the last 5-6 years in England, there has been an extra $3 billion of money injected into clubs, which can be used to fund a higher level of wage costs."" So without the influence of incredibly wealthy figures such as Sheikh Mansour (Manchester City) and Roman Abramovich (Chelsea), Bundesliga clubs spend 51% of their total revenue on wages. This is significantly lower than the 70% figure splashed out by English sides. The Premier League's continued growth is also tempered by debt. The combined debt of the 20 teams in England's top flight is $3.8 billion, a figure that is identical to the league's total revenue. However, Rawnsley believes the servicing of clubs' debts is not the issue it once was. ""A few years ago, debt was much more of a story but this year it has nudged downwards again,"" he explained. ""Debt levels are going down and the costs of servicing the debt are going down as well. ""In round numbers, the cost to Premier League clubs servicing their debts is $125 million."" The reason for the relatively meager figure on debts of $3.8 billion is because $2.2 billion of that total has been provided by the financial backers of various clubs in the form of non-interest bearing ""soft loans."" With new financial regulations from UEFA coming into play next season as well as an increased television deal that brings an extra $925 million to the Premier League, English clubs have the opportunity to increase profits next season. While that may please their accountants, fans will -- as ever -- be far more concerned about boosting the footballing fortunes of their favorites in the year to come.","Business group Deloitte says Bundesliga was most profitable European league in 2011-12 .

"A train crash in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, that killed at least 80 people and injured 178 more Wednesday poses many questions for investigators, who are homing in on what role the train's speed may have played in the crash. The issue of high-speed rail may raise more questions for the public at large, specifically in the United States, where high-speed trains are rare. Here are some basics on this speedy mode of transportation: . What is high-speed rail? It depends where you are, but the International Union of Railways says the term is reserved for systems (not just trains) designed for speeds of more than 250 kph (155 mph) if the lines are new and speeds up to 220 kph (137 mph) if the lines are upgraded. Certain trains in China and the European Union can exceed 300 kph (186 mph), while a handful around the world can top 400 kph (249 mph). The term can also be used for trains that move at speeds between 110 kph and 180 kph (68 mph to 112 mph) in certain circumstances, such as the need to avoid ""noise and nuisance,"" or the need to traverse long tunnels or bridges. How is high-speed rail different from nation to nation? As stated above, China and the EU have trains that can exceed 300 kph (186 mph), which means, in China, trains can zip between Beijing and Wuhan in about five hours. The regular train route takes twice as long, and you'd be lucky to finish the journey in a car in 13 hours. In Japan, the Shinkansen bullet trains typically travel at between 270 kph (169 mph) and 320 kph (199 mph), while Korea Train Express cars can travel up to 305 kph (190 mph). In March, Korea's HEMU-430X hit a speed of 421.4 kph (261.8 mph) in a test run, making Korea the fourth country -- behind France, China and Japan -- to develop a train capable of topping 420 kph (261 mph). Spain has high-speed trains, known as AVEs, that move at speeds up to 310 kph (193 mph), according to Railway Gazette, but the train involved in this week's wreck was not an AVE. It had a max speed of 250 kph (155 mph). Is high-speed rail available in the United States? Amtrak operates a service in the northeastern United States called Acela Express that is capable of speeds up to 241 kph (150 mph) and can travel between New York City and Washington in about 96 minutes. Other stops on the route include Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and New Haven, Connecticut. Responding to critics who say Acela is too slow and too infrequently reaches its top speed, Amtrak announced in September that it plans to run test trains at  266 kph (165 mph) in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. What does the future hold for high-speed rail in the U.S.? Early in the Obama administration, federal transportation officials called on states to spend money to develop faster rail systems using existing lines. The plan identified 10 potential high-speed corridors for federal funding, and the White House proposed spending $53 billion over 25 years to create the national network. Among the corridors: California, the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, the Southeast, the Gulf Coast, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and New England. The blueprint envisioned some trains traveling at top speeds of more than 150 mph. But there have been many snafus. In 2010, Transportation Secretary Roy LaHood redirected $810 million from Wisconsin and $400 million from Ohio after those states' governors cited opposition to the projects. The tussle over budget cuts further hampered funding in 2011. That same year, Florida Gov. Rick Scott rejected a plan to run high-speed rail between Tampa and Orlando (and eventually spread to Miami and Jacksonville). Florida subsequently lost $2.4 billion in federal funding, and 24 states submitted requests for portions of Florida's allotted money. In California, billions of federal dollars were pledged for high-speed rail, and voters OK'd $9 billion in bonds for a bullet train between San Diego and San Francisco, but the project has been set back by myriad issues. Are there safeguards in place in the U.S. that would help prevent a disaster like the one in Spain? Yes. In fact, those safety regulations may be at the core of why it's difficult for high-speed rail to proliferate in the United States. According to a June report from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, the Federal Railroad Administration ""has strict crash safety regulation for passenger railcars which trains in Europe -- where passenger rail is well established and remarkably safe -- do not have to meet."" While the U.S. requires the undercarriage of a train to withstand 800,000 pounds of force without ""permanent deformation,"" Europe designs ""trains to gracefully deform in a controlled manner"" so that crumple zones absorb the energy of the crash, an approach known as crash-energy management. The ""buff-strength"" for European trains is 337,200 pounds of force, according to the think tank. The FRA has other requirements not present in European safety regulations, including requiring that the end of the train have the resistive strength of a half-inch plate of steel and an ""anti-climbing mechanism"" that prevents train cars from telescoping and mounting each other. ""The requirements force Amtrak and transit authorities across the country to purchase custom-made trains that are unnecessarily expensive, underperform and do not meet the best safety practices of the rest of the world,"" the CEI report said.","High-speed rail can range in speed from 110 kph to more than 300 kph .
Some countries have trains that can exceed speeds of 420 kph (261 mph)
Train involved in Spain crash was not the country's fastest class of train .
White House has pushed for high-speed rail, but plans beset with problems ."
"While President Barack Obama has relaunched a massive public relations effort for the Affordable Care Act, Republican opponents to the law have also implemented a relaunch of sorts. Absent from their public outcry is any talk of repeal. It is a deliberate and significant shift in strategy for Republicans in the House after years of beating the drum of repeal. For the first time since they regained control of the House in 2011, Republicans have no plans at the moment to bring up a bill to repeal the law -- something they have done nearly 50 times. Instead, ""We'll continue to do everything we can to protect the American people from the effects of this awful law,"" said Michael Steel, House Speaker John Boehner's spokesman, without saying that repeal was still part of the plan. A confluence of events hampered the Republican repeal effort and put it on pause. Stand back . The problems with the Affordable Care Act exist beyond its balky website. The troubled roll out of Obamacare has also forced the President to delay multiple important components of the law, including the insurance marketplace for small businesses and the requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees provide their workers with health insurance or face fines. Republicans realized they should have let the launch play out, instead their shutdown distracted from the Obamacare debacle. ""Never interfere when your opponent is committing suicide,"" Michael Tanner, senior fellow working on health care at the libertarian Cato Institute, said. Instead, Republicans have gone to great lengths to promote the negative aspects of the law by launching their own public relations campaign. The strategy is outlined in a 17-page Republican playbook that CNN reported last month. During a news conference on Tuesday, Republican leaders didn't utter the word ""repeal"" once. Instead, they promoted reports that people have been canceled from their low-coverage insurance plans and that insurance plans in the exchanges have dropped doctors and hospitals from plan options. ""The American people want to be able to pick their own type of health insurance, they want to be able to pick their own doctor and they want to be able to pick their own hospital,"" Boehner told reporters Tuesday. ""It's all negative,"" Tanner said of the Republican strategy. ""It's to form this general feeling out there that it's failed."" The law's the law . Additionally, Republican opposition had been based on hypotheticals, now the rhetoric has become reality. ""We're not going back,"" Obama said earlier this week. ""I mean, that seems to be the only alternative that Obamacare's critics have is, well, let's just go back to the status quo."" Obama urges young supporters to talk up Obamacare . With that strategy, Republicans could deprive the President of that argument. Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said the change happened because circumstances changed. ""The effort to defund Obamacare is that people weren't experiencing it yet."" Now, ""voters are starting to experience bad news,"" he said. ""As the law is being implemented, millions are either losing health care or having premiums go up, and Republicans want to make sure that everyone recognizes that."" That has caused Republicans to move away from their blanket calls for repeal to highlighting problems with the law. Additionally, they could be proactively looking down the road. While some are being negatively impacted by the law, millions are expected to benefit. Salon's Brian Beutler wrote, ""I think Republican leaders will be extremely reluctant to hold votes to nakedly destroy the law."" Reality . ""To get rid of it completely would be very difficult,"" said Ilya Somin, law professor at George Mason University, who was involved in Republicans' Supreme Court challenge. Democrats control the Senate and the White House. Efforts to repeal the law have gone nowhere. The Cato Institute's Tanner said repealing the law ""hasn't been a realistic option for quite some time."" Regardless, Republicans pushed by their conservative wing shut down the government for 16 days in October in an effort to defund the health care law. ""They don't have to go down the legislative road to defund Obamacare at this point because it didn't work,"" Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said. Lawmakers pass more blame than bills in do-nothing Congress . The move, pushed by the most hard-right members of the party, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and multiple members of the House, did not sit well with the public and distracted the country from the horrible roll out of the federal health care exchanges. The race for public opinion . While the Republicans have been taking to news conferences, committee hearing rooms and cable television to espouse the negative aspects of Obamacare, Obama has launched his own public relations campaign to highlight the bright parts of the law. He is working to reverse negative perceptions of the law that have increased since the law's implementation at the beginning of October. And the President still has time. The latest CNN/ORC poll found that while only 40% favor the law, 14% of opponents say the law doesn't go far enough. Meanwhile, 53% say it's too soon to tell if the law will be successful. But Tanner says the Democrats don't have a lot of time because ""opinions harden"" over time. The uncertain voter is what the Republicans are hoping to tap into. Republican risk? Republicans might have realized that the defund or repeal argument is not politically advantageous as it is associated with the right-wing elements of the party. But that aspect of the party might not be pleased with their decision to stop trying to repeal the law. The conservative group FreedomWorks is still pushing the repeal agenda. Dean Clancy, vice president of public policy for the group, wrote in a recent news release that ""FreedomWorks plans to redouble our efforts for full repeal."" ""ObamaCare can't be fixed; it needs to be uprooted,"" he added. Bonjean said Republican incumbents shouldn't be worried about primary challengers if they drop the repeal argument in the halls of Congress because they can still espouse it on the campaign trail. ""Republicans can still say defunding or replacing Obamacare,"" he said, adding that they can point to the dozens of votes taken to repeal it in the past. ""It's hard to get (to) the right"" of Republican incumbents on this issue, he said. Washington could still screw up your holidays . Repeal isn't going to be possible until ""after the 2014 elections,"" Bonjean said, hoping that Republicans maintain their majority in the House and gain a majority in the Senate. Regardless if Republicans continue to shelve the repeal argument, Tanner said repeal will never happen. ""There will be something on the books called the Affordable Care Act,"" he said. He just doesn't know what it will look like in five or 10 years. If the law proves unworkable and not beneficial for Americans, expect Democrats to join with Republicans to alter the law. On the other hand, if the law is successful and voters are pleased, the law is unlikely to be rolled back. ""If the positive stories begin to sell, then you won't get wholesale changes,"" Tanner said.","Republican Party has shifted its strategy on Obamacare away from repealing the law .
GOP launched its own public relations campaign to highlight negative aspects of the law .
The defund strategy has proven counterproductive .
Some on the right still pushing for Republicans to keep repeal efforts moving ."
"(CNN) -- The Taliban, one of Osama bin Laden's closest allies, confirmed late Friday that the al Qaeda founder had been killed by U.S. commandos during a raid in Pakistan. The admission by the Taliban comes on the heels of one earlier in the day by al Qaeda, removing any question about whether bin Laden's closest allies and his terror network believed he was dead. Al Qaeda statement on bin Laden's death . Bin Laden ""embraced martyrdom as per the Will of the Almighty Allah during an abrupt attack by the American invading soldiers,"" according to a statement released by the Afghan Taliban, which had for years allowed bin Laden's terror network to operate in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda statement in Arabic (PDF) President Barack Obama announced Sunday that bin Laden had been killed by U.S. commandos during a raid on a compound in Abbottabad, about 35 miles north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. Trove of data at bin Laden hideout provides first specific alert . On Friday, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met privately with members of the Navy SEAL Team 6, the unit that conducted the raid. Among the SEALs that Obama met at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, was the one who fired the fatal shots at bin Laden, but he was not singled out to the president, a senior administration official said. Obama and Biden thanked the commandos and were briefed on the operation by the unit members who conducted it, according to a White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to release the details of the meeting. Officials have said bin Laden was shot twice -- once in the head, once in the chest. He was buried at sea in what U.S. officials have described as a proper Islamic burial. Obama decided earlier this week not to release any photos of bin Laden's body, saying he did not want to inflame Arab passions or appear to gloat. The decision drew sharp criticism from many, who wanted proof of the terrorist leader's death. Others, including many in the town where bin Laden was killed, said they did not believe he was dead. But Friday's acknowledgement by al Qaeda and the Taliban put to rest questions about whether bin Laden's closest allies believed he had been killed by Navy SEALs. Al Qaeda confirmed its leader's death in a Web statement and used that opportunity to taunt and threaten the United States. ""Sheikh Osama didn't build an organization that will vanish with his death or fades away with his departure,"" according to the statement, which CNN could not independently authenticate. U.S. races to dissect possible terror plots . The statement, which congratulates the ""Islamic Nation on the martyrdom of their devoted son Osama,"" repeated themes and threats made over the years in prior statements by the terror group. Al Qaeda's statement surfaced as protesters packed the streets of Abbottabad in a rally organized by Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's largest Islamist party. The demonstrators denounced the U.S. and Pakistani governments. First suspected drone strike in Pakistan since bin Laden raid . The statement also expressed disdain for the efforts and motives of the United States, saying that the Americans managed to kill bin Laden ""by disgrace and betrayal."" ""Men and heroes only should be confronted in the battlefields but at the end, that's God's fate. Still we ask, will the Americans be able -- through their media outlets, their agents, their instruments, soldiers, intelligence services and their might -- be able to kill what Sheikh Osama lived for and was killed for? How far! How impossible!"" According to the statement, bin Laden recorded an audio message a week prior to his death regarding the revolutions sweeping the Muslim world and offering advice and guidance. Al Qaeda indicated that the release of this message is forthcoming. Meanwhile, the Taliban statement said bin Laden's death will reinvigorate the ""jihad,"" or holy war, against the United States and its allies. Bin Laden and the Taliban's leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, were said to have a close friendship. The Taliban said bin Laden has achieved martyrdom, something he had long worked toward. ""He reached his ambition with bravery, dedication and commitment in the last moments of his life,"" the Taliban statement said. Meanwhile, investigators poring over material seized by the SEAL team found details about a possible attack on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, and the intelligence led Thursday to a nationwide alert regarding rail security.","NEW: Taliban confirms that Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes the hardest thing is to say ""no"" to a friend. All the more reason to applaud the bravery of Lee Saunders and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. A few months ago, the United Negro College Fund accepted a $25 million grant from Charles and David Koch to support scholarships for minority students. It raised more than a few eyebrows. After all, everyone -- including me -- reveres the college fund. Its contribution to the cause of equal opportunity is legendary. But few people still alive have done more to promote policies that hurt African-Americans than the Koch brothers. The Koch brothers are one of the most prominent funders of organizations that work to restrict early voting and registration and effectively disenfranchise African-Americans. They oppose the minimum wage, which would disproportionately help black workers. They are spending millions to lie to the public about climate disruption, which hurts the most vulnerable communities first. In other words, the Koch brothers' agenda is great for African-Americans -- so long as we do not want to vote, make a living or avoid our homes being swept away in a flood. It is one thing to accept money from dubious sources. One could argue -- convincingly -- that the college fund was taking money from a bad source and doing something good with it. But the breaking point came a few weeks ago when United Negro College Fund President Michael Lomax appeared at a Koch brothers' retreat in California. The public stated purpose of this event was to build support for the Koch brothers' various political causes. The moment he stepped through the door, Lomax lent the his organization's good name to a radical agenda that causes untold damage to African-Americans. All this was too much for AFSCME, a predominantly African-American union with a long civil rights track record that had partnered with the United Negro College Fund for years in giving out scholarships. Last month, Saunders sent Lomax a letter ending their partnership. It was a tough decision, no doubt -- but it was the right one. (Full disclosure: AFSCME once made a donation to Rebuild the Dream, an organization that I lead.) I am all for education. That is one of the reasons I helped start #YesWeCode, an initiative to teach computer science to black, brown and low-income young people. I am the first to point out how much brilliance and creativity our nation is losing by failing to uplift youth from low-opportunity backgrounds. That's why I am usually such a huge fan of the United Negro College Fund. But the Koch money seems to have come with strings attached. The funds are earmarked only for young people with ""an interest in the study of how entrepreneurship, economics, and innovation contribute to well-being for individuals, communities, and society."" To many, that sounds like the Koch brothers are restricting the funds only to students who adopt the Koch's economic and political views. Koch representatives will even help choose which students qualify for scholarships. It is also worth noting that AFSCME did not end its support for minority scholarships. The union will still give just as much money to young scholars as it always has -- just through other channels. It is simply choosing not to partner with a group that is lending a helping hand to those whose political views most African-Americans detest. After all, according to documents reported by The Progressive and the Center for Media and Discovery, Charles Koch was once a member of the John Birch Society, the far-right group that so opposed the civil rights movement that it declared the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. a communist. And that one of the speakers at the Koch retreat was Charles Murray of the notorious ""The Bell Curve,"" a book he co-authored that argued blacks and Latinos were innately less intelligent than whites and Asians, and to blame for every social injustice they face. Endorsing these views in exchange for scholarship funding is not worth it. It is not two steps forward, one step back. It is half a step forward, then go sit in the back of the bus. Lomax and the United Negro College Fund may not agree. Conservatives definitely do not -- Rush Limbaugh tactfully likened the college fund to slaves and AFSCME to slaveholders. But AFSCME has an obligation to its members not to align itself with this kind of behavior. It is harder to say ""no"" to a friend than an enemy. But in this case, the hard path was also the right one.","The United Negro College Fund accepted $25 million from Koch brothers to use for scholarships .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the Obama administration unveils its National Security Strategy Thursday, it will be the first time a president explicitly recognizes the threat posed to the country by radicalized individuals at home. ""For the first time since 9/11, the NSS integrates homeland security and national security,"" according to highlights of the plan given to CNN by a senior administration official said. The security strategy acts as a blueprint for how the White House intends to protect Americans. In the past, it has focused mostly on international threats. But National Security Adviser John Brennan explained Wednesday that a spate of terror-related plots in the United States recently prompted the Obama administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document. ""Such a strategy must begin with the recognition that a clear-eyed understanding of our strategic environment -- the world as it is today -- is necessary to shape the world that we seek,"" according to a summary of the plan. ""Currently, the United States is focused on completing a responsible transition in Iraq, succeeding in Afghanistan, and defeating al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates, while moving our economy from deep recession to enduring recovery. Even as we confront these crises, our national strategy must take a longer view. We must adapt and lead in a rapidly changing, interconnected world in which interests of nations and peoples are increasingly shared."" Homegrown terrorism represents a new phase of the terrorist threat, officials said. Earlier this month, Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad was charged with trying to detonate a car bomb in New York's bustling district of Times Square. U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan is suspected of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood in November. Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan national, pleaded guilty in February for conspiring to detonate explosives in the New York subway system. David Headley, an American citizen from Chicago, Illinois, is accused of providing surveillance in the Mumbai, India, terrorist attacks that killed 160 people. ""We've seen an increasing number of individuals here in the United States become captivated by extremist ideology or causes,"" Brennan said. ""We have seen individuals, including U.S. citizens armed with their U.S. passports, travel easily to extremist safe havens, return to America, their deadly plans disrupted by coordinated intelligence and law enforcement."" Brennan, who made his comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that as the United States has strengthened its defenses against massive attacks like 9/11, al Qaeda has shown itself to be a ""resilient, resourceful and determined enemy."" Brennan said al Qaeda is recruiting individuals with little training, attempting relatively unsophisticated attacks and seeking people living in the United States to launch such attacks. ""They are seeking foot soldiers who might slip through our defense,"" Brennan said. ""As our enemy adapts and evolves their tactics, so must we constantly adapt and evolve ours."" Brennan did not provide any specific details about the president's strategy for combating al Qaeda and its affiliates, but said it ""will require a broad, sustained and integrated campaign that harnesses every tool of American power, military and civilian, kinetic and diplomatic."" The strategy is built  around protecting ""four enduring U.S. national interests -- security, prosperity, values, and international order."" In order to achieve this, it must strengthen U.S. institutions, values, and infrastructure -- such as education, energy, science and technology, and health care. It calls for strong diplomatic efforts internationally and galvanizing ""collective action to address the share global challenges of our time."" ""Engagement begins with our friends and allies -- active partners in advancing common interests. We will continue to deepen our partnerships with increasingly active centers of influence -- cooperating when we can, and differing when we must. ""With adversarial regimes, engagement provides us a means of testing intentions, giving governments the opportunity to change course, and mobilizing international coalitions."" The strategy calls for updating ""all of the tools of American power, and work with our allies and partners to do the same."" ""These tools include those in the fields of defense, diplomatic, development, homeland security, the rule of law, intelligence, and strategic communications, as well as support the participation of the American people and private sector. We are working to strengthen each of these tools, but also to integrate them through coordinated planning and capacity building in key areas,"" the strategy said.","Homegrown terrorism included after spate of terror-related plots .

"Phoebe Connolly, a possible victim of game where teenagers appear to sucker-punch strangers, is encouraging people to think critically about how such attacks can be stopped. Connolly was biking in the Columbia Heights area of Washington this month when she was struck. She had passed through a group of teenagers, she said, when one of them ""reached out and punched me in the face."" ""The whole group of kids laughed,"" Connolly told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Tuesday night. She was not seriously injured. Though Connolly had never heard of the ""knockout game"" before the November 15 attack, she may be a victim of it. And she's not the only one. Another woman was attacked in the same area one day earlier. She, too, sustained minor injuries and was not knocked out, according to Washington police. A police spokeswoman said authorities are investigating the two attacks as simple assaults. ""The reason that I called the police was because my understanding of teenagers is they just don't always think about the ramifications of their actions, how they can hurt people, how they can cause problems for the rest of their lives,"" said Connolly, who works on youth programs. She found fault with the popularity of so-called ""knockout"" videos. ""Instead of constantly replaying them on media, or on YouTube, or whatever it is, you know I really feel like that's just creating more of a culture of fear and polarization -- instead of actually spending time thinking about why it is that people are choosing to do this and how can it be stopped and prevented,"" she said. Authorities have reported similar incidents in New Jersey, New York, Illinois and Missouri. One of the latest attacks happened in New York, according to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly. A woman in her 70s was punched in the face by a man with whom she had no known previous contact or connection. She was treated and released from the hospital. Authorities are working to determine whether she is a ""knockout"" victim, Kelly said. Despite the recent assaults, police in New York say they haven't yet seen evidence of a trend, though they are not ruling out the idea. ""The press has named it the so-called knockout game. We don't discount that that exists. It's a possibility. We've investigated and will continue to investigate,"" Kelly told reporters Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- The Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament is universally acclaimed as the premier event of its kind and if you've been lucky enough to attend, you'll know why. Arguably the biggest event on the Hong Kong sports and social calendar, the tournament is renowned for the standard of rugby and also for the vibrant, carefree ambiance in the stands. Hong Kong Stadium hosts the event every spring and the 40,000 seats are always sold out. It was founded by the Hong Kong Football Club in 1976 and for the first six years the event was played at a more modest venue, tucked inside the racehorse track at Happy Valley. The tournament's pioneers were way ahead of their time. Back in the '70s, rugby was an amateur sport but this was one of the first tournaments to attract major sponsorship. It was an international, cosmopolitan, rugby competition, played more than a decade before the sport's first World Cup. These days, the football club's main involvement with the sevens weekend is to provide hundreds of fans who'll drink up the action . But on the eve of the tournament, their home ground at Happy Valley plays host to a more sombre occasion, one borne from the tragedy of Hong Kong rugby's darkest hour. PT McGee used to be a prop forward for the club and he now proudly serves as a committee member. ""Usually the worst thing that happens on a tour is an arrest or maybe a broken bone,"" he told CNN, ""but something happened to this club that hasn't happened to any other rugby club in the history of the sport."" In 2002, HKFC's touring side ""The Vandals"" was playing in a social tournament in Indonesia, the Bali 10s. Having competed in the opening day of the tournament, the team -- and many other players -- headed to the popular nightspot of Kuta for refreshment. It was October 12, exactly one year, one month and one day after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. Unbeknown to the rugby players, a violent Islamic group -- Jemaah Islamiyah -- had targeted the tourist district for another major atrocity. Anson Bailey had also traveled from Hong Kong for the 10s. He was playing for ""The Pot Bellied Pigs,"" an invitational touring team made up of players from various sides including Kowloon rugby club. He was walking towards the Sari Club when he heard a bang. ""Within a minute there was another explosion, a really painful blast that stopped you in your tracks,"" he said. Bailey will never forget what he then experienced. ""The sound wave came up the street, smashing the shop windows and buckling shutters. Up ahead was a huge orange mushroom cloud, hysterical people were running towards us."" Anson ran away too, but he soon realized that he needed to help, not least because he knew that many of his friends would have already been at the scene of the blast. When he returned, he found the blackened figure of Andy Douglas, a player that Bailey knew from the Singapore Cricket Club. ""He was black from head-to-toe, his clothes were burnt, his skin was peeling, his ears were bleeding."" Douglas thinks he was knocked unconscious by the first blast in Paddy's Bar and was wondering why all his friends had left him when the second fireball erupted outside. He later learned that eight teammates had died. ""My first thought was that I had to get out of here, everything's on fire. I have to get to the beach because I know that can't burn down."" Carnage . Douglas was fortunate to run into Bailey, who vowed to care for him on that fateful night. Together, they toured the island's medical facilities in a taxi, trying to find help. Bailey vividly recalls the driver apologizing profusely for the carnage. They waded through pools of blood on white tiled floors, they found friends with horrific shrapnel wounds, everywhere they witnessed death. Douglas has made a remarkable recovery since then and is eternally grateful. ""I will forever be indebted to Anson for saving my life, he gave me the courage to pull through in the first 24 hours. We'll always have a special bond. He's a great man."" They were the lucky ones. In all, 202 people were killed by the bombs and in some cases their remains were unidentifiable. Four different rugby teams were in the path of the carnage, clubs from Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong were devastated, losing 27 players and supporters between them. The HKFC spent the next few weeks mourning 11 of their own. Twelve years later, those clubs are very different. Many of the players involved at the time of Bali have finished playing or moved on to other cities. But the tragedy will never be forgotten. McGee estimates that only 20% of the players remain from 2002, but the tragedy is embedded in the club's DNA. ""For every new member, it is instilled upon them that Bali is a part of our legacy. We deal with it and honor it every year, at the time of the anniversary and throughout the season as well."" It wasn't just the HKFC that was scarred by Bali. Two other teams from Hong Kong, who narrowly avoided the carnage, spent the days afterward assisting with the search for survivors and ultimately the grim task of identifying the dead; players from rival teams but friends from the tight-knit rugby community. On the eve of the sevens in Hong Kong, these sides commemorate the tragedy with a memorial game. Last Friday, Bailey and Douglas lined up alongside each other in the bright colors of Bailey's team, ""The Pot Bellied Pigs."" It has become an annual occasion. Bali proved to be a life-changing experience for Bailey. ""I'd like to think that I'm a better person because I had a second chance and I was damn sure that I was going to make the most of it."" Since the attack, he's spent some of his time organizing the annual ""Fatboy 10s"" tournament in the Philippines, a benevolent event which has been well supported by some of the biggest names in the rugby community. The HKFC also tours annually with an altruistic purpose, previously visiting Nepal and Kolkata and this month, Laos. Sean Purdie -- a teammate of those lost in Bali -- is the driving force behind it. ""We certainly wanted to keep the name of 'The Vandals' going,"" he said. ""It was the name of the team which represented the football club in Bali. We continued touring, but we thought about doing a bit more."" Purdie is credited by others at his club for lifting some of the gloom in the wake of the disaster and the annual tours have become one of the most popular events in the calendar. It may only be for a brief amount of time, but the tours have a big impact on everyone involved. Senseless act . Fundraising activities benefit the under-privileged communities being visited, fatherless children are exposed to positive male role models and for some of the players, it is an enlightening experience. Purdie said some of the players return home as changed men, vowing to do more to improve the world around them. Rugby players have always believed their game can make a difference, but for those touched by the tragedy of Bali, it has now become very clear. ""If they [the terrorists] had embraced the spirit of the game, they would never have committed such a senseless act,"" said Douglas. ""It's a game of togetherness in which you embrace your opponent as much as your teammate at the end of the game."" As Bailey put it: ""There's a lot of compassion, there's a lot of heart. We all try to do the right thing.""","The Bali bombings of October 12, 2002 claimed the lives of 202 people .

"Recovery of the bodies of the four U.S. Air Force personnel who died Tuesday evening when their military helicopter crashed near Cley, on the North Sea coast of England, could take more than a day, an official said. ""You would be very much mistaken if you thought that this would be a quick process,"" Norfolk Constabulary Chief Superintendent Bob Scully told reporters. ""A lot hinges on our ability to understand what happened to the aircraft that crashed, and that includes the detailed investigation that needs to be done."" The U.S. Air Force Pave Hawk HH-60G helicopter, from a British base in Lakenheath, crashed in a nature preserve. The Royal Air Force base said the crash occurred during an evening training mission while the helicopter was flying low. Cley is 180 kilometers (about 110 miles) northeast of London. Removal of the dead from the aircraft ""can disrupt the evidence and so it has to be done methodically, step by step ... possibly until tomorrow,"" Scully said. Specialists from the Royal Air Force, the U.S. Air Force and investigators from the Norfolk Constabulary were working together to find out what happened, he said. Scully said he did not know whether families of the dead had been notified. Though ammunition scattered across the site during the crash, ""the community do not need to be concerned"" as long as they respect the cordon erected around the site, he said. Roads near the site have been closed and will probably remain that way until Monday, he said. According to the Air Force website, a Pave Hawk is a ""highly modified"" version of a Black Hawk helicopter that often carries a crew of two pilots, one flight engineer and one gunner.

"(CNN) -- He was the so-called ""Fastest Man on No Legs,"" and his inspiring story captured the imagination of the world at the London Olympics. Now, Pistorius is playing the lead role in a more tragic tale that began in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013. The Olympic and Paralympic sprinter is facing a maximum five-year prison sentence after he was found guilty of the negligent killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on February 14, 2013. He claimed he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder and was cleared of murder. Despite a seven-month trial, much remains in question about what happened at his upmarket home in Pretoria, South Africa around 4 a.m. that Thursday morning, leaving stunned fans at a loss to explain how their hero could have fallen so far and so fast. Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow in the last few weeks before his sentencing, Pistorius told her that he would respect and accept the decision of the court and that he was not afraid of imprisonment. He said he hoped to contribute while in prison by teaching people how to read or start a gym or running club. But it may prove to be the greatest challenge yet for a man who's already overcome many difficulties. Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius, 27, had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday, but through sheer determination carved out a career in world-class athletics. In 2012, he became the first double amputee to compete against able-bodied runners at the London 2012 Olympics, adding to his fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" a reference to his carbon fiber prosthetic legs. While he failed to win a medal, Pistorius' presence on the track was hailed as a triumph over adversity and a victory over critics who claimed his blades gave him an unfair advantage over the able-bodied. He did take home medals from the Paralympic Games. For many, he was an example of what could be achieved through a potent mix of determination, positivity and skill. Who is Oscar Pistorius, really? Soon after his arrest, the athlete's image was pulled from billboards across South Africa. Sponsors suspended their deals as admirers questioned whether Pistorius' sporting successes had perhaps obscured a more complex character off the track. Was Pistorius violent? On the edge? In a story titled ""The Fast Life of Oscar Pistorius"" published in the New York Times, writer Michael Sokolove wrote: ""Pistorius is, as well, blessed with an uncommon temperament -- a fierce, even frenzied need to take on the world at maximum speed and with minimum caution."" After the shooting, a police spokeswoman said there had been ""previous incidents"" at Pistorius' home, including ""allegations of a domestic nature,"" but did not say what they had been. Besides the five-year prison term for culpable homicide, the athlete was also given a three-year sentence, suspended for five years, on a weapons charge stemming from an incident in which he discharged a loaded firearm in a restaurant. The sprinter moved into his uncle Arnold's house in Pretoria after the shooting. Video surfaced last June of Pistorius training, but he has not returned to the track in an official capacity. In an exclusive interview last summer, Arnold Pistorius said his nephew was heartbroken. ""What can you say if the person you love the most dies, and you were the instrument?"" he told CNN. ""How would you feel? It's unthinkable."" It was known that Pistorius owned guns. He was a keen shooter and despite his disability he was not afraid to take risks. During a visit to Pistorius' house a few years ago, he showed CNN images of himself water-skiing, scuba diving and quad bike riding. ""I grew up in a family where disability was never an issue. We didn't really speak about my disability, not because it was a topic that was taboo... it was just never an issue. And that's the mentality that I've had,"" Pistorius told CNN in late 2012. From a young age, Pistorius dedicated himself to being the best he could be at sport. ""I was never much of an academic at school so I had to find something which I enjoyed. I started sports and from a very young age, my mother said to us 'sports is not about being the best, but it's about giving your best.' Divided reaction . Support from Pistorius' family has been firm and unwavering since Steenkamp's death. ""We have no doubt there is no substance to the allegation and that the State's own case, including its own forensic evidence, strongly refutes any possibility of a premeditated murder or indeed any murder at all,"" said Arnold Pistorius before the athlete's conviction. Addressing reporters after the sentencing, Arnold Pistorius again criticized the state prosecution for pursuing the murder charge, saying that as a result ""the truth became totally irrelevant to the state's attempt to to make the premeditated murder stick."" He said the 20 months since Steenkamp's death had been harrowing for both families and Pistorius -- and had left everyone emotionally drained and exhausted. ""As an uncle,"" he said, ""I hope Oscar will start his own healing process as he walks down the path of restoration. ""As a family we are ready to support and guide Oscar as he serves his sentence."" Pistorius' agent, Peet Van Zyl, referred to the sprinter as his ""friend and a great professional athlete."" He said thousands of people had sent messages of support from all over the world in the wake of the shooting. Steenkamp's family is skeptical about the man who killed their daughter. Her father Barry Steenkamp told the Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld: ""It doesn't matter how rich [Pistorius] is ... and how good his legal team is. He needs to live with himself if he lets his legal team lie for him."" READ MORE: Oscar Pistorius' affidavit to court in full . ""But if he's telling the truth, I may forgive him one day,"" he said. But ''if it didn't happen as he described it, he should suffer. And he will suffer ... only he knows."" At the supermarket down the road from his house, parking attendant Andre Tsekedi told CNN last February that he saw Pistorius and Steenkamp a few days before the shooting: ""They were holding hands and looked so happy."" Another, Samuel Motau, described Pistorius as ""a very generous man."" ""He tipped us $10 every time. The only reason I never went to bed hungry was because of Oscar Pistorius."" Growing up . As a child, Pistorius competed in water polo, cricket, tennis, triathlons and Olympic wrestling and boxing, before he smashed his knee while playing rugby at the age of 16. He took up track running as part of his rehabilitation, and within one year he was covering 100 meters faster than the existing Paralympic world record. In 2004, Pistorius took his first gold at the Athens Paralympics and one year later competed against able-bodied Olympics for the first time, at the South African Championships. Pistorius' career on the track suffered a setback in 2009 when he suffered serious head injuries in a boating accident. It took him almost eight weeks to recover, a period of time the athlete has described as ""fairly difficult"" as it marked the first season in four or five years in which he didn't record a personal best. Soon after the London Olympics, Pistorius led his national team onto the track as South African flag-bearer in the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games. He went on to set a new world record in the 200-meter event but later suffered a shock defeat in the final, his first competitive loss over the distance in nine years. During the very last track event of the Paralympics, Pistorius again picked himself up and smashed the 400-meter T44 Paralympic record in a time of 46.68 to take gold. It ended a summer he later described as ""a dream come true,"" according to his website. Beyond the track . Pistorius' determination to succeed made him one of the world's most recognizable athletes. He appeared on the cover of men's magazine, GQ Style, under the headline ""Man of the Future,"" and was named on People magazine's 2012 list of ""Sexiest Man Alive."" According to his website, Pistorius is an ambassador for the Mineseeker Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to clear landmines worldwide. When asked about his thoughts on being a role model, Pistorius told CNN before the shooting: ""I think it's a massive blessing. ""Obviously, being an international sportsman, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that. So having to remember that there are kids out there, especially, that look up to you is definitely something that you need to keep at the back of your mind."" Pistorius has more than 300,000 followers on Twitter, tens of thousands of whom added in the days since his arrest last year. His account laid dormant for a year until the anniversary of Steenkamp's death in February, when he tweeted a link to ""a few words from my heart"" on his website. The message said: ""No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved -- and continues to love Reeva. The pain and sadness -- especially for Reeva's parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow. The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.""

"The bodies of the victims are being buried. The court case will continue, without cameras.  The horror in Aurora has faded from the front page in favor of Olympic coverage. So it is worth asking, 10 days after the largest mass shooting in American history, whether it is still too soon to start a conversation about reasonable gun restrictions.  What actions could we take to make such slaughters more difficult to perpetrate? Because if it is true, as the National Rifle Association says, that ""guns don't kill people; people kill people,"" then it's equally irrefutable that people with guns kill people. Here is the toll, beyond the 12 dead and 59 wounded in Aurora.  More than 180 people killed in mass shootings in the past five years, including the 32 people who died in the April, 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech.  And dwarfing that total are the 10,000 Americans murdered by gunshots every year. Fareed Zakaria: Time to face facts on gun control . No one is suggesting that insane actions such as the Colorado shootings can ever be legislated out of existence. And there is no doubt that the Second Amendment is enshrined in our Constitution.  But part of life in a civil society is about having civic conversations about problems -- not aiming for the illusion of perfectibility but for improvement. Circa 2012, however, it has become politically incorrect to talk about restricting the ability of unstable individuals to get AR-15 rifles, or 6,000 rounds of ammunition.  When people say ""it's too soon"" to talk about the role of guns in mass shootings, what too many of them really mean is that we should never have the conversation. Gun violence is not inevitable. It does not reflect the human condition. Navarrette: Guns endanger cops' safety . America leads the world in gun violence by many multiples.  It reflects our culture -- and guns are a core part of American culture, for better or worse.  It is a fact rooted in the conquest of the West, where guns were used primarily for hunting and self-defense. And Americans' divergent views about guns are reflected in something more fundamental than politics.  In a larger sense, America's political divides are not rooted in questions of left versus right as much as urban versus rural. These basic cultural differences have been the drivers of political debates since Alexander Hamilton squared off against Thomas Jefferson in George Washington's Cabinet.  They were reflected in debates over the Civil War and Prohibition and today's red state versus blue state divides.  And they underscore the different opinions that exist about guns. We use guns differently in rural and urban areas of the United States. And because Democrats need to expand their base beyond urban areas to win statewide or national elections, they have ceded this ground to Republicans. This new status quo is enforced on Capitol Hill by the fact that the NRA outspends anti-gun advocacy groups such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence by a factor of 10-to-1, making it all too easy for members of Congress to calculate that taking on -- or even talking about -- this issue isn't worth the cost. And it is even more true at the presidential level.  President Barack Obama was eloquent and empathetic after meeting with victims and their families, but he backed off making any proposals for new gun control laws. Mitt Romney also was quick to cite scripture and communicate his sorrow in the hours after the attacks, but he was firm in his insistence that no new guns laws were needed.  Gun violence and gun laws seem oddly and unrealistically disconnected when it comes to political discussion. Frum: Fear drives opposition to gun control . What's particularly hypocritical about these stands is that both men backed assault weapons bans in the past. As governor of Massachusetts, Romney signed an assault weapons ban into law. As a candidate for president, Obama said he would push for a restoration of the assault weapons ban achieved by President Bill Clinton but which expired in 2004. Now?  Crickets. Presumably, what's changed is not their personal beliefs but the politics.  Mitt Romney did a signature flip-flop on this social issue because no Republican believes they can win their party's nomination without full genuflection at the altar of the NRA. Obama's position can also be ascribed to presidential politics -- the Obama campaign can't afford to lose a single persuadable vote in swing states such as Colorado, Nevada and Ohio. Moreover, Obama's stance on guns is complicated by the typical competition between fear-mongering and facts. Despite the fact that Obama has in some cases loosened gun laws -- such as signing legislation allowing people to carry firearms into national parks -- the far right has been pushing the fright-wing fantasy that he is hell-bent on banning all guns via a U.N. small-arms treaty or some other nefarious plot. But the conventional wisdom in Washington -- that this is a settled debate -- is a fiction. A new poll by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz for Mayors Against Illegal Guns found that: . -- 74% of NRA members and 87% of non-NRA gun owners support criminal background checks for anyone purchasing a gun. -- 74% of NRA members think that concealed carry permits should be granted only to applicants who have completed gun safety training and 75% believe that such permits should be granted to people who have not committed violent misdemeanors, including assault. -- In addition, 71% of NRA members back the idea that people on terror watch lists should be barred from buying guns (duh), and 65% believe that gun owners should be required to alert police in the event of lost and stolen guns. Opinion: Gun control or carry permits won't stop mass murder . The point is that there is plenty of room for discussion on gun policy post-Aurora and plenty of room for defining the common ground around  reasonable restrictions that gun-owners and advocates can agree on. This is not settled policy and not the third-rail politicians pretend it is.  That narrative is unrelated to the facts. There is no reason we can't increase background checks, ban people on a terrorist watch list from buying guns and make it more difficult for people to buy 100-drum magazines that have no function except to kill as many people as possible as fast as possible. This all falls under common sense and the kind of reasonable restrictions set out by the Supreme Court in their Heller decision.  Having this civic conversation is a rational response to a mass killing -- it can be done respectfully and thoughtfully and well within the realm of ""reasonable restrictions"" that do not impede on the Second Amendment. All that is required is political courage -- and that can be encouraged by speaking up.

"With all of the fake sharks flying around TV lately, some viewers wish the Discovery Channel would stick just to the facts. On Sunday, the network kicked off its popular predator-infested extravaganza, Shark Week, with the premiere of a dramatized special that explores the existence of prehistoric sharks called megalodons. Discovery billed the special, ""Megalodon: The Monster Shark That Lives,"" as taking viewers ""on a search for a massive killer great white shark responsible for a rash of fatalities off the coast of South Africa."" Viewers were expecting to watch shark experts and scientists examine evidence that the massive creatures could still be swimming around somewhere. The only problem is that, as National Geographic notes, the megalodon has been extinct for millions of years, and viewers have complained they weren't presented with any evidence to the contrary. ""Dear discovery channel, your fake documentary that you are trying to pass off as reality is upsetting,"" tweeted one viewer. ""The director of blair witch just tweeted that the #megalodon show is the worst thing he has seen since the blair witch project,"" said another. David Shiffman, a doctoral student studying shark ecology and conservation at the University of Miami's Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy, told Nat Geo that he wouldn't expect this kind of programming from Discovery. ""If this megalodon special had aired on the Syfy Channel, I probably would have loved it,"" he said. ""But Discovery bills itself as the premier science education television station in the world, and they're perpetuating this utter nonsense."" The executive producer of Shark Week, Michael Sorensen, points out that Discovery aired three disclaimers for ""Megalodon,"" including that ""none of the institutions or agencies that appear in the film are affiliated with it in any way, nor have approved its contents."" Additionally, the network warned that ""certain events and characters in this film have been dramatized,"" and that ""legends of giant sharks persist all over the world; there is still debate about what they may be."" It seems the point of ""Megalodon"" was to raise questions more than present answers. ""With a whole week of Shark Week programming ahead of us, we wanted to explore the possibilities of Megalodon,"" Sorensen said. ""It's one of the most debated shark discussions of all time, 'can Megalodon exist today?' It's (the) ultimate Shark Week fantasy. The stories have been out there for years and with 95 percent of the ocean unexplored, who really knows?"" It's clear that TV audiences are interested in finding out. The ""Megalodon"" show brought in record ratings for Discovery, with 4.8 million viewers tuning in. In the 26-year history of Shark Week, ""Megalodon"" is the highest-rated and most-watched Shark Week episode to date.","The Discovery Channel is facing criticism for a shark week special .

"Seven years ago, Steve Way was a 20 per day smoker and weighed a hefty 230 pounds (104 kilograms). On Sunday, he led the marathon competition against the best in the Commonwealth before finishing a creditable 10th place. Undaunted by the presence of defending champion John Ekiru Kelai of Kenya and a host of other athletes with faster personal bests, Way took the opportunity afforded by a tentative start by the race favorites to lead the bunch. Despite the effort, just a glimmer of a smile can be seen on the face of the 40-year-old, who was representing England after a strong showing in the London Marathon in April. Way admitted that as the Kenyans and eventual winner Michael Shelley of Australia surged he could not keep pace but his story continues to be an inspiration to all couch potatoes approaching a mid life crisis. He crossed the line after 42 kilometers in a personal best of two hours 15 minutes 16 seconds and still with a smile on his face despite toiling on a tough course around Glasgow in rainy conditions. ""Best day ever,"" Way said. ""I normally say it's second best to my wedding day but this one matches it. Sarah (his wife) won't mind I think. ""All my top goals -- top 10, PB, British vet record (for athletes over 40 years of age) -- and I've managed all three. I couldn't have wished for a better day."" Way finished a minute faster than his performance in London, where he was third British finisher behind Mo Farah and Chris Thompson and 15th overall. Regular training runs, sometimes up to 80km (50 miles), have seen him trim down to a lean 150 pounds as the fast food takeaways and a heavy alcohol intake have become a thing of the past. The marathon is not even Way's specialist distance. He will challenge for the world 100km (62 miles) championships in Doha, Qatar in November and with a personal best of six hours 19 minutes 19 seconds, that's six minute six second miles for the entire distance, has a realistic chance of gold. Shelley was winning the first athletics gold of the Commonwealth Games, improving on his silver from four years ago and with a personal best of two hours 11 minutes 15 seconds. Behind him, Kelai faded and his compatriot Stephen Chemlany took second with Abraham Kiplimo of Uganda in the bronze medal position. ""It is starting to sink in now,"" Shelley said. ""I dug deep and I was hoping I wouldn't blow-up like I have done in the past."" Later Sunday, the competition on the track began at Hampden Park, with the final of the men's 5,000m, despite the absence of the ill Olympic champion Farah, one of the highlights. It went to Kenyan Caleb Ndiku, the world indoor 3000m champion, in a time of 13 minutes 12.07 seconds to beat teammate Isiah Koech , with New Zealander Zane Robertson claiming bronze. The crowds at the Games will have to wait for the appearance of Usain Bolt, who has arrived in the Scottish city, but is not slated to run until next Friday's heats of the 4x100m relay for Jamaica. Home crowds at the swimming pool were able to celebrate their seventh medal of the meeting and it was another fairytale story. Erraid Davies, a diminutive 13-year-old competitor in the women's para-sport 100m breaststroke, took a superb bronze behind Sophie Pascoe of New Zealand. Davies, who was born with a chronic hip condition, is the youngest member of the Scottish team, but showed maturity beyond her years to move into the medals after turning sixth.","Michael Shelley wins first athletics gold of Commonwealth Games .

"(CNN) -- The deadly heat wave that has kept much of the eastern and central United States in its grip is expected to hold on longer in some central states this week. Parts of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma are under excessive heat warnings until the end of the week, the National Weather Service said Monday. Those areas -- including Wichita, Topeka and Goodland, Kansas; St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield and Pleasant Hill, Missouri; and Tulsa, Oklahoma -- should experience heat indices between 105 and 110 degrees on most days, the weather service said.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- At least four people were killed and 32 wounded as six Baghdad-area churches were bombed within 24 hours, officials told CNN. Family members of Rizko Aziz Nissan grieve before his funeral in Kirkuk, Iraq, on Sunday. The first bombing took place Saturday night at St. Joseph's church in western Baghdad, according to an Interior Ministry official. Two bombs placed inside the church exploded at about 10 p.m. No one was in the church at the time of the attack. Sunday afternoon, three bombs exploded outside churches, wounding eight civilians, the official said. The bombs detonated within a 15-minute span, between 4:30 and 4:45 p.m. Two of the churches are in central Baghdad's al-Karrada district, and the third is in al-Ghadeer in eastern Baghdad. Sunday evening, a car bomb exploded outside a church on Palestine Street in eastern Baghdad just after 7 p.m., the official said. Four people died, and 21 were wounded.  Watch how the bombings unfolded » . And in southern Baghdad's Dora district, a bomb outside a church wounded three other civilians. Most of the churches were damaged in the bombings, according to video footage. One Christian Iraqi, interviewed outside Sacred Heart Church -- one of the two in al-Karrada -- said the bomb went off shortly before 5 p.m., as members were arriving for Sunday evening mass. No one was hurt, Sabhan George told CNN, but the bomb damaged the church building and some cars outside. George said he is concerned about the church bombings. If this continues, he said, ""there will be no Christians left in Iraq."" St. Joseph's was one of six churches hit by coordinated bombings of Christian houses of worship in Baghdad and Mosul in 2004. The church is in the al-Jamiaa neighborhood of Baghdad, a former stronghold of al Qaeda in Iraq. There have been recent reports of an increase in targeted attacks in the area. Many of Iraq's estimated 1 million Christians have fled the country after targeted attacks by extremists. In October, more than a thousand Iraqi families fled the northern city of Mosul after they were reportedly frightened by a series of killings and threats by Muslim extremists, who apparently ordered them to convert to Islam or face possible death. At least 14 Christians were killed in Mosul in the first two weeks of October. Separately, gunmen shot and killed an official in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Sunday morning, a local police official told CNN. Using guns with silencers, the assailants opened fire on Rizko Aziz Nissan outside his home in central Kirkuk at 8:15 a.m. Nissan was an Iraqi Christian, but the motives behind his killing were not immediately clear. Kirkuk is 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Baghdad. CNN's Youssif Bassil contributed to this report.","NEW: Four dead, 21 wounded in Baghdad church bombing Sunday evening .

"Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old who said she had terminal brain cancer, took medication to end her life under Oregon's ""Death with Dignity Act,"" advocacy group Compassion & Choices said Sunday. ""Brittany chose to make a well thought out and informed choice to Die With Dignity in the face of such a terrible, painful, and incurable illness,"" a post on her website said. ""She moved to Oregon to pass away in a little yellow house she picked out in the beautiful city of Portland."" In a statement, Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life choice advocacy group that has been working closely with Maynard, said she ""died as she intended -- peacefully in her bedroom, in the arms of her loved ones."" Mourners grieve on social media . Maynard passed away Saturday, said the group, which released an official obituary. The epitaph contained a final message from Maynard, who expressed a note of deep thanks to all of her supporters, whom she ""sought out like water"" during her life and illness. ""It is people who pause to appreciate life and give thanks who are happiest. If we change our thoughts, we change our world! Love and peace to you all,"" she said. Maynard graduated from University of California, Berkeley, and earned a Masters in Education from University of California, Irvine, according to the obituary. She was a world traveler who volunteered at a local animal rescue organization before her diagnosis and lived 29 years of ""generosity, compassion, education, travel, and humor,"" it said. Maynard is survived by her husband and his family, her mother and stepfather. ""While she had longed for children of her own, she left this world with zero regrets on time spent, places been, or people she loved in her 29 years,"" the obituary said. Maynard ticks off last item on bucket list . Maynard's story spread rapidly on social media as a video explaining her choice garnered more than 9 million views on YouTube. She became a prominent spokeswoman for the ""death with dignity"" movement, which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms. She also became a lightning rod for criticism from people who oppose that approach. ""I quickly decided that death with dignity was the best option for me and my family,"" Maynard wrote in an opinion column for CNN explaining her choice. ""We had to uproot from California to Oregon, because Oregon is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized."" In a video released last week, Maynard said she hadn't yet decided when she would end her life. ""I still feel good enough, and I still have enough joy, and I still laugh and smile with my family and friends enough that it doesn't seem like the right time right now. But it will come, because I feel myself getting sicker. It's happening each week,"" Maynard said in the video, which was produced by Compassion & Choices and released to CNN last Wednesday. My mother deserved to 'die with dignity' Maynard said she had stage IV glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer. When she first started speaking out about her decision, Maynard said that in early November she planned to take the medication she'd been prescribed. In her latest video, she said she was waiting to see how her symptoms progress before deciding on a date. But taking too long to make that choice was one of her greatest fears, Maynard said. ""The worst thing that could happen to me is that I wait too long because I'm trying to seize each day,"" she says, ""but I somehow have my autonomy taken away from me by my disease, because of the nature of my cancer.""

"A second Ebola patient to be treated at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha will arrive there early Monday morning, the center said in a statement. The patient is believed to be an American freelance cameraman who worked for NBC. Ashoka Mukpo was diagnosed with Ebola on Thursday. He left Liberia on a specially-equipped plane Sunday and was headed to Nebraska, the network reported. Upon arrival, the patient will be immediately taken to a remote part of the airport away from passenger areas, where an ambulance will wait for transport to the hospital. Increased screening . Screening could soon be increased at U.S. airports because of the Ebola outbreak, officials said Sunday. ""All options are on the table for further strengthening the screening process here in the U.S., and that includes trying to screen people coming in from Ebola-affected countries with temperature checks,"" a federal official said. The source added: ""It's not as easy as it sounds. There aren't that many direct flights from Ebola-affected countries to the U.S. anymore. Many passengers are arriving on connecting flights from other parts of the world, and then they come here, so that makes it more of a challenge."" An official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention similarly said that enhanced CDC screening at major U.S. airports was under consideration. Any change must be useful enough to warrant the disruption to travelers, that official said. A separate, senior administration official stressed that enhanced screening is consistent with what Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, said last week. However, officials then had argued that such screening could be counterproductive. Stopping in its tracks . The director of the CDC underscored that authorities are looking into all possibilities, including suggestions from Congress, the public and the media. ""We'll look at those and see what works to protect Americans and to make sure that whatever we do doesn't unintentionally actually increase our risk,"" Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters. Earlier, the director told CNN that he is confident there is little risk of an Ebola outbreak in Dallas, where one infected patient is fighting for his life. Frieden is expected to brief Obama on Monday. He said on ""State of the Union"" that the CDC is concerned about family members who had ""very close contact"" with the victim but that they were being monitored constantly. ""That's how you stop it in its tracks. That's why we're confident we won't see a large number of cases from this,"" he told CNN's Candy Crowley. Monitoring high and low-risk contacts . Relatives will be monitored for 21 days from their last contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the only patient to develop Ebola in the United States. If any of them gets a fever, he or she will be isolated, Frieden said. ""That's how we break the chain of transmission, and that's what is going to make sure that we don't have a large outbreak in Dallas or elsewhere in the U.S.,"" he added. About 10 people are at ""higher risk"" of catching Ebola after coming into contact with Duncan but have showed no symptoms, health officials said. That group includes health care workers, who are now on paid leave. The group is among 50 people being monitored daily, but the other 40 are considered ""low risk,"" Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Saturday. A homeless man who was on the low-risk list was found Sunday after a nearly day-long search. After being checked by medical workers and being told to stay where he was, the man left, and authorities began to look for him. He was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas on Sunday, according to the official Twitter account of Sana Syed, a spokeswoman for the city of Dallas. His temperature was normal, and he was not showing symptoms of Ebola before he disappeared, officials said. Authorities also found Sunday two other contacts of Duncan's they had previously been unable to locate, a federal official said. The two people, in addition to the homeless man, were in the same ambulance as Duncan on the same day. All three are considered low risk, but authorities want to monitor them for 21 days, said the official. Who's in charge of stopping Ebola in the U.S.? Critical condition patient . Duncan is in critical condition, a Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital spokeswoman said Saturday. The Liberian national had previously been listed as being in serious condition. Hospital spokeswoman Candace White offered no new details other than his condition. Duncan arrived in Dallas on September 20 and started feeling sick days later. He made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25. He was released with antibiotics but went back three days later and was quickly isolated. A blood test Tuesday confirmed that he had Ebola. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Relocated to undisclosed location . ""We've been very busy the last 24 hours trying to make sure that everyone who has had potential exposure is identified and they have been evaluated,"" Lakey said. The high-risk list probably includes Duncan's partner, Louise, her 13-year-old son and her two 20-something nephews. The four had been holed up in the apartment where Duncan had stayed before he was hospitalized. They were relocated to an undisclosed place Friday and will be required to stay there until October 19. The incubation period -- the time between Ebola infection and the onset of symptoms -- ranges from two to 21 days. Louise spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Sunday, telling him that she hasn't felt any symptoms. ""She's very thankful for all the doctors' efforts, but she clearly believes that somehow more could be done,"" Cooper said Louise said about her partner. Their interview will air Monday night. The Dallas hospital where Duncan is being treated has come under fire for its handling of his first visit there eight days ago. Louise, who does not want her last name used, said Duncan told hospital staff that he had a fever and abdominal pain and had recently arrived from Liberia, key information that could have been a tipoff for Ebola. Health care workers across the nation ""have to learn from the experience,"" Lakey said Saturday. ""The travel history is very important to take, and it has to be communicated,"" he said. The hospital defended its handling of the case. ""As a standard part of the nursing process, the patient's travel history was documented and available to the full care team in the electronic health record, including within the physician's workflow,"" it said in a statement. Your Ebola questions answered . The church Louise attends said Duncan came to the United States so the two could get married. Louise told the church's senior pastor, George Mason, about their marriage plan, according to Mark Wingfield, a spokesman at Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas. How the Ebola virus spreads . American doctor tests negative for Ebola . An American patient treated for Ebola in Nebraska, then released, then put in isolation in a hospital in Massachusetts, was removed from isolation on Sunday. Laboratory tests showed Dr. Richard Sacra does not have Ebola, said Peggy Thrappas, spokeswoman for UMass Memorial Medical Center  in Worcester. Physicians are continuing care for his upper respiratory tract infection, she said. Sacra went to an emergency room early Saturday in Boston with a cough and fever, according to the missionary organization Serving in Mission. He was afraid he might have pneumonia. Because of his previous infection, he was transferred and kept in isolation until his test results came back. ""Dr. Sacra came to the hospital with a fever and slight cough. Today, he is in stable condition, his symptoms seem to be improving, and he is eating,"" lead physician Dr. Robert Finberg said earlier. Sacra had worked as a medical missionary in Liberia but not directly with Ebola patients. Nevertheless, he contracted the disease. He was treated in isolation at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and then released after testing negative for the virus. CDC responds to sick passenger on flight . Other Ebola scares . As nervous Dallas residents watch Duncan's case unfold, more Ebola scares have popped up in other parts of the nation. Howard University Hospital in Washington said Friday that it had admitted a low-risk patient with symptoms that could be associated with Ebola, but health officials said Saturday that Ebola had been ruled out in that case. The unnamed patient had recently traveled to Nigeria. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone are the three main countries battling the deadly virus. The CDC remains very concerned about the Ebola outbreak in western Africa, where more than 3,000 people have died. The longer it remains a problem there, the greater the risk for other areas of the world, Frieden said. But battling the disease will be a ""long, hard fight,"" he continued. ""The virus is spreading so fast that it's hard to keep up,"" the CDC director said.","An ambulance will pick up the patient from a remote part of the airport .

"South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is getting encouragement from a close colleague and friend, Sen. John McCain, to run for President. ""I think he is looking at it, and I am strongly encouraging him to take a look at it,"" McCain, an Arizona Republican, told ABC News in a story published Monday. ""I know of no one who is better versed and more important on national security policy and defense than Lindsey Graham, and I don't think these challenges to our security are going away."" Graham floated the possibility of a run in an interview with the Weekly Standard last month, telling the magazine he'd be interested in running to guide the conversation on national security.

As the libertarian wing of the GOP has gained prominence, led by expected 2016 presidential contender Sen. Rand Paul, members of the party's more hawkish old guard have floated presidential runs to offer a contrasting voice in key national security debates. This Sunday, however, speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Graham sounded far from an affirmative decision. He said running for president is ""the hardest thing one could ever do.

"The search continued Thursday for a gay porn actor suspected of dismembering his acquaintance, posting the video of the incident online and mailing the severed limbs to different locations in Ottawa, including to a political party's headquarters, according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. Authorities are searching for Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, who they allege is responsible for a human torso discovered in Montreal, thought to be linked to a human hand and foot that were separately mailed from Montreal to Ottawa. Magnotta, also known as Eric Clinton Newman, is a Montreal resident who allegedly knew the victim, identified only as a white male, Montreal police spokesman Ian Lafreniere told reporters Wednesday. The suspect has no criminal background, and his image and information related to him were later recovered from a ""very graphic"" website, Lafreniere said. The source later confirmed that at least one of the websites examined by authorities was a pornographic site. It's possible the body parts all came from the same dismembered victim, Lafreniere said, but police are still awaiting the results of forensic testing for confirmation. ""The two parts of the body that were found in Ottawa ... we've got all the reasons to believe that it's linked to our homicide,"" he added, referring to the human torso found in Montreal. Authorities said they are asking the public for help in locating Magnotta, after a ""coast-to-coast"" warrant was issued for his arrest. Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he's apprehended. Lafreniere said authorities have also found other body parts, potentially from the same attack, which is believed to have been committed in Montreal. It would be the 11th homicide there this year. ""It wasn't a random attack,"" Lafreniere said. ""They knew each other."" Lafreniere added that Magnotta had been ""involved in some stuff on the Web, that's for sure,"" though he would not elaborate. The human foot was sent to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa, prompting a hazardous materials team to investigate. The officers who responded noticed what appeared to be bloodstains on the box, police said. Ottawa police Sgt. Steve Hodgson told reporters outside the office that the package had been addressed to the Conservative Party. Staffers had begun to open the package before calling police, he said. The hand was intercepted by workers at a Montreal postal terminal. Ottawa's major-crimes unit is checking with other police departments for similar cases and looking back through missing-persons files for any clues, according to Constable Marc Soucy, an Ottawa police spokesman. ""We're going to look at every avenue,"" he said. In Montreal, the human torso was found behind an apartment building, authorities said.","A torso found in Montreal is thought to be linked to a hand and foot mailed to Ottawa .

"U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in South Africa on Friday for the second leg of a trip overshadowed by the deteriorating health of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela. Obama did not appear to rule out a visit to see the ailing former president, but said he will leave it up to the family. ""We'll see what the situation is when we land,"" he said en route to Johannesburg. ""I don't need a photo op, and the last thing I want to do is to be in any way obtrusive at a time when the family is concerned with Nelson Mandela's condition."" The president left the United States on Wednesday for Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania -- his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office. The trip aims to bolster African investment opportunities for U.S. businesses, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy. It comes as China aggressively engages the continent, pouring billions of dollars into it and replacing the United States as Africa's largest trading partner. Obama heads to Africa to promote investment, democracy . During his last day in Dakar, Senegal, Obama attended a food security session, where he met with farmers and innovators whose technologies are bolstering the lives of regional farmers. ""I know that millet and maize and fertilizer doesn't always make for sexy copy, but ...  I think if the American people knew the kind of work that is being done as a consequence of their generosity and their efforts, I think they would be very proud,"" he said. The event in the Senegalese capital Friday was his last before he jetted off to South Africa. Mandela's condition . Mandela is clinging to life at a hospital in Pretoria, an issue weighing heavily in the continent, where he retains massive popularity despite his retirement from public life. His condition has improved, but his health remains delicate, said his ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. ""I can say that from what he was a few days ago, there is great improvement, but clinically he is still unwell,"" she told reporters. Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting apartheid, South Africa's system of racial segregation. He was elected the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed. Even as he has faded from the spotlight, he remains popular worldwide. Mandela, the U.S. president said, is a hero to him and many others. ""If and when he passes from this place, one thing I think we'll all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages,"" Obama said. He said he had read Mandela's writings and speeches, and understood ""that this was somebody who believed in that basic principle I just talked about -- treating people equally -- and was willing to sacrifice his life for that belief."" Obama's visit to South Africa will include a stop at Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his decades in prison. The White House schedule does not include a visit with the anti-apartheid icon. Senegal visit . During a news conference Thursday in Dakar, Obama called on countries worldwide to decriminalize homosexuality, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court handed a major victory to proponents of same-sex marriage by striking down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act. Every group of people has a right to its own views, Obama said. ""But when it comes to how the state treats people -- how the law treats people -- I believe that everybody has to be treated equal,"" he said. The remarks came in response to a question from CNN's Jessica Yellin on whether Obama was pressing his Senegalese counterpart on the issue. Homosexuality is illegal in Senegal. ""Senegal is a very tolerant country which does not discriminate in terms of inalienable rights of human beings,"" Senegalese President Macky Sall said. ""People are not refused jobs for being gay,"" he said. ""But we are still not ready to decriminalize homosexuality."" In Senegal, Obama also visited Goree Island, which once served as a strategic post in the transatlantic slave trade. Obama will spend the weekend in South Africa and then head to Tanzania, his last stop before returning to Washington next week.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- During the 1960 presidential election, Theodore Sorensen helped then-Sen. John F. Kennedy draft a speech addressing Kennedy's Catholicism and the separation between church and state. At the time, many questioned whether Kennedy, who would go on to become the nation's first Roman Catholic president, would be influenced by the Catholic church. Theodore Sorensen helped write John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on Catholicism. Speaking to CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider, Sorensen discussed Kennedy's famous 1960 speech and compared it to the speech on faith in politics delivered Thursday by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who would be the first Mormon in the White House if he is elected. Question: Did Kennedy's 1960 speech win him the presidency? Sorensen: Well, he obviously didn't lose it, nor did he free the country from the curse of anti-Catholicism. The hate mail still poured into his office. The vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail, and, indeed, on Election Day. According to a University of Michigan survey, more people voted against Kennedy because of his religion than any other reason. Nevertheless, that speech, which was nationally broadcast and frequently rebroadcast, certainly took a lot of the poison out of the anti-Catholic issue and reassured all reasonable people.  Watch Sorensen discuss why Kennedy gave his speech » . Q. Could President Kennedy have delivered the speech Romney gave on Thursday? Sorensen: No. Mr. Romney's position on many of the issues are very different than JFK's. JFK wanted to particularly stress that he believed in the separation between church and state. He believed that no one needed to worry about a Catholic bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president, and that freedom of religion included freedom for those to go to any church or not to go to any church at all. So, Romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than JFK did or would have. Q. Romney seemed to differ quite strongly with Kennedy on the privacy of religion, didn't he? Sorensen: Yes, he did. In fact, Romney felt compelled for some reason to define his personal views of Jesus Christ. Kennedy said, as you noted, his personal views of religion were totally his business and not the business of the American people. Q. Romney made the statement ""freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom."" Do you think Kennedy would have agreed with that? Sorensen: I don't think anyone would disagree strongly with that. There were some lines in the Romney speech that echoed the Kennedy speech. As an old speechwriter, I would congratulate Mr. Romney. It was a pretty good speech. I think he touched all the bases he wanted to touch. Q. Romney discussed his views of Jesus Christ, something that Kennedy avoided. Why did Kennedy avoid discussing his religious views? Sorensen: Because [Kennedy] began the speech by saying his private religious beliefs -- his relationship with God or Jesus Christ or anything else -- was not a matter of public discussion. He did not think the election should be based on -- as he said, it's not what kind of church I believe in, the question is what kind of country do I believe in. Q. Kennedy's speech in 1960 is widely viewed as being successful. Do you think Romney's speech is likely to be viewed as a success? Sorensen: I assume so. I don't think Mr. Romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion. Just as I don't think Senator [Barack] Obama should be denied because of his race. Or that Mrs. [Hillary] Clinton should be denied the presidency because of her gender. This country is in deep, serious trouble, and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the country and the major qualities of the candidates and not on such superficial tests as religion, race, or gender.

"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is floating an unexpected option to take over for outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel: Former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a former Democrat turned Independent from Connecticut. In a statement issued hours after President Obama appeared at the White House alongside Hagel to announce the end of his tenure, Cruz slammed the president over the resignation and suggested Lieberman as a potential replacement. ""Today's resignation reflects the ongoing damage caused by President Obama's misguided foreign policy of leading from behind,"" Cruz said. ""One strong option would be former Sen. Joe Lieberman, a member of the President's own party with deep experience and unshakable commitment to the security of the United States. I urge the President to give him full and fair consideration for this critical position."" As a close friend of Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, the incoming Armed Services Committee Chairman, Lieberman would likely win easy approval from the committee if considered. Opinion: Pushing out Hagel not shake-up Obama needs . But his name hasn't been included on any shortlists in part because his hawkish foreign policy views have often put him at odds with Democrats. He also was a rare Democrat to endorse McCain over Obama for president in 2008, and was believed to be one of McCain's preferred VP options. White House officials have named former top Pentagon officials MichÃ¨le Flournoy and Ash Carter, as well as Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed as possible nominees, though Reed's spokesman has indicated he's not interested in the post. Cruz has urged his party to block most of Obama's executive and judicial nominees when they take control of the Senate next year as a response to the president's executive action on deportations. But in his statement, he set that conflict aside and called for the Senate to ""promptly confirm a strong and qualified nominee"" to replace Hagel because secretary of Defense is, ""by any measure...a vital national security position.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said it was ""heartbreaking"" that the deaths of women killed by a convicted rapist who was released from prison after Huckabee supported his parole had become politicized. Mike Huckabee denies pressuring the Arkansas Parole Board to release Wayne DuMond. On Wednesday, the mother of the woman the convict later murdered pledged to campaign against the former Arkansas governor. ""There are families who are truly, understandably and reasonably, grief stricken,"" Huckabee told CNN. ""And for people to now politicize these deaths and to try to make a political case out of it rather than to simply understand that a system failed and that we ought to extend our grief and heartfelt sorrow to these families, I just regret politics is reduced to that."" The case of the rapist, Wayne DuMond, began in 1985, when he was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl. He was later convicted and sentenced to a life term. Before trial, DuMond was attacked in his home and castrated, and the local sheriff kept the severed testicles in a jar. No charges were brought in the attack. In 1996, Huckabee, during his first term as Arkansas governor, expressed support for the parole of DuMond in a letter to him. The Arkansas parole board, which has the final say on such matter, later approved DuMond's parole.  Watch Huckabee deny he pressured the board to approve DuMond's parole » . Less than a year after his release from prison in 1999, DuMond was accused of raping and murdering Carol Shields, a woman in Kansas City, Missouri. DuMond was convicted of the crime in 2003. He died in prison in 2005. Huckabee on Sunday confirmed to CNN he had sent the letter to DuMond. The murdered woman's mother, Lois Davidson, said she will ""absolutely campaign against"" Huckabee, and said she decided to come forward when he started doing well in the polls. ""It's because he is a serious contender,"" Davidson said. ""I didn't think he had a chance, but now he's right up there in Iowa."" Huckabee said he had considered granting DuMond clemency in 1996, but he dropped the idea in response to public outcry and because he wanted to ensure DuMond was supervised when he was released from prison. ""Had I granted his commutation, then there would have been no supervision at all,"" Huckabee said, ""I wasn't comfortable with that."" When he spoke about the case, Huckabee suggested his role in the decision to parole DuMond was limited. Huckabee said it was the decision by former Arkansas Govs. Bill Clinton and Jim Guy Tucker that made DuMond eligible for parole, and Huckabee declined to reduce DuMond's sentence further. ""I've never made a decision about the DuMond case other than the decision to write the letter"" to DuMond, Huckabee said. ""That was my decision, but I didn't parole him, because governors don't parole people in Arkansas."" However, Charles Chastain, a parole board member at the time, told ABC News he felt pressure from Huckabee when the board considered DuMond's parole in 1996, and the Arkansas Times reported in 2002 that two other board members said they were influenced by Huckabee to parole DuMond. Huckabee denied he asked the board to approve DuMond's parole. ""No, I did not,"" Huckabee said Sunday. ""Let me categorically say I did not."" Huckabee noted that the three board members who said they were pressured were appointed to the board by Democrats Clinton and Tucker. Huckabee said Wednesday his discussion with the parole board in 1996 was a general discussion about clemency, not about the DuMond case. But a former Huckabee aide, Butch Reeves, tells CNN that the DuMond case was discussed during the meeting with the parole board, but that it was the board members who asked Huckabee about the case. Reeves said Huckabee did not pressure the board to approve DuMond's parole. Documents posted on the Web site The Huffington Post indicate Huckabee received letters from several victims of DuMond before his release. The letters detailed his past actions and pleaded that he remain incarcerated. ""I feel that if he is released it is only a matter of time before he commits another crime and fear that he will not leave a witness to testify against him the next time,"" one victim wrote. She described how DuMond had raped her at knifepoint. A former top Huckabee aide confirmed to CNN that the then-governor received that letter and a follow-up phone call from the victim.

"(CNN) -- Six Russian soldiers were killed and another 12 injured by an explosion during the disposal of ammunition at a firing range, the Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday. A commission, led by Southern Military District Commander General Alexander Galkin, has been ordered to the scene at the Ashuluk firing range by Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, a press statement said. Criminal and military investigators were dispatched to the explosion site, which is located in the southern region of Astrakhan, according to the Russian Investigative Committee. The explosion is the third this summer at a Russian munitions depot. In early June, a series of explosions and a subsequent fire at an artillery depot in the region of Bashkortostan injured twelve people and burned down 40 buildings. One hundred people were left homeless. A day later, fifty-seven people were treated for injuries related to a fire at an army munitions depot in Russia's western Ural Mountains region, authorities said. It started after munitions stored in wooden containers exploded, said Grigory Rapota, the plenipotentiary representative in the region for Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The fire forced the evacuations of 28,000 people within a 10-kilometer (6.2 mile) radius of the depot at the military base in Pugachevo, located east of Moscow.","The explosion occurred during the disposal of ammunition .

"The President's healthcare sign-up web page was supposed to handle tens of thousands of people at once. But in a trial run days before its launch, just a few hundred users flatlined the site. Despite the problems, federal health officials pushed aside the crash cart and rolled out HealthCare.gov on October 1 as planned, The Washington Post reported. The result?  The website crashed shortly after midnight as a couple thousand people tried to start the process, two people familiar with the project told the Post. The report is the latest criticism of the problem-plagued site -- criticism so acute that even President Barack Obama said there was "" no sugarcoating"" the difficulties Americans have faced trying to sign up for insurance coverage. Webmaster in Chief . ""Nobody's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should, which means it's going to get fixed,"" Obama said during an appearance Monday at the White House Rose Garden. But he didn't specify exactly what went wrong or who was to blame for the problems, which include long waits to log onto the federally administered website and maddeningly long wait times once online. There's ""no excuse for the problems,"" Obama said. But he said tech industry experts were being brought in to help workers trying to fix the site. Call it more fuel for the fire as the GOP continues its quest to defund the new health care system, popularly known as Obamacare. The Energy and Commerce Committee in the Republican-controlled House wants some answers.  Website and administrative contractors CGI, Serco and Equifax are set to testify Thursday on their roles in the technical fiasco. Website's $300 million price tag . The GOP has Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in its crosshairs, calling for her resignation.  She has a date with the committee on October 30. Sebelius announced Tuesday that Jeff Zients, a former private sector CEO who also has headed the White House Office Management and Budget, is part of the ""tech surge"" coming to help her department deal with the enrollment problems. Other experts include ""veterans of top Silicon Valley companies,"" Sebelius wrote in a blog post on the department website. The goal was a ""cross-functional team ... working aggressively to diagnose parts of HealthCare.gov that are experiencing problems, learn from successful states, prioritize issues, and fix them,"" the blog post said. Sebelius also said the contractors hired to create Healthcare.gov, including lead company CGI, were providing additional people and unspecified ""commitments"" for the project ""within the provisions of their existing contract."" White House spokesman Jay Carney defended the program on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live,"" saying that while HealthCare.gov is struggling, the administration's health care reform ""is not failing."" People who are able to submit applications through whatever means are happy with the results, he said. ""Health insurance provides security that a lot of these families haven't had in the past,"" Carney said. Looking at the bottom line . Democratic strategist and pollster Cornell Belcher agrees, telling CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that people need to look at the bottom line. ""Millions upon millions of American families who work every day who can't afford healthcare and who are one sickness away from bankruptcy will now have an opportunity to get healthcare,"" he said.  ""That is the value."" GOP strategist Kevin Madden sees if differently, blaming it on ""Big Government."" ""All Americans believed that we need healthcare reform.  Where Republicans and Democrats differed on was the way we went about it,"" he said on ""AC360.""  ""I think that the way Democrats went about it, which is one big federal government-centric plan is obviously not working.  It's hurting many folks."" A Washington Post/ABC News poll released Monday showed that 56% of respondents consider the website difficulties a harbinger of broader problems with the Affordable Care Act, a constant target of conservative critics who consider it the epitome of big government overreach. Have you had trouble signing up? Let us know . The law 'working just fine' In the Rose Garden Monday, Obama said ""the essence of the law"" -- aimed at providing access to health insurance for the roughly 48 million Americans without it -- ""is working just fine."" ""In some cases, actually, it's exceeding expectations. The prices are lower than expected, and the choice is greater than we expected,"" he said. ""But the problem has been that the website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody,"" he continued. ""There's no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People are getting stuck during the application process."" HealthCare.gov: What works, what doesn't . Other Republicans kept up their attacks on the health care reforms on Monday, with the office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeting that when a visit to the Obamacare website made a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles seem pleasant, ""it's time for the President to consider delaying this rushed effort."" Through the pipeline . Obama administration officials have highlighted the fact that nearly 500,000 people have filled out applications for Obamacare, though the number who purchased coverage remains unknown. Initial difficulties have started to ease for logging on to the website for the new exchanges, some of which are run by states and others by the federal government. Logging in tough for some early registrants . The administration is still not releasing the numbers on how many people have taken the next step of enrolling: choosing a specific health care plan. The administration has said it will do that monthly, so the first tally of enrollment numbers will come in November. The Congressional Budget Office has said it expects 7 million people to enroll by April 1. Although March 31 is the deadline for people to get health insurance or face a fine, officials warn that failure to sign up by February 15 could be a problem because of the time needed for the coverage to take effect. Carney told reporters on Monday afternoon that lingering problems in signing people up could result in relief, noting that the law makes clear that ""if you do not have access to affordable health insurance, you will not have to pay a penalty for not having affordable health insurance."" Hope for a smoother ride on HealthCare.gov . A ConsumerReports.org article last week offered tips for people trying to sign up, but had the following advice for those overwhelmed by the difficulties: . ""If all this is too much for you to absorb, follow our previous advice: Stay away from HealthCare.gov for at least another month if you can. Hopefully that will be long enough for its software vendors to clean up the mess they've made."" But in a statement issued Monday night, the group said its criticism of the website doesn't mean it now opposes the Affordable Care Act.

"As the 74 people on a climate change research ship stuck in the ice in Antarctica readied for New Year's Eve festivities, authorities revealed plans to send in a rescue helicopter. The Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy has not moved in a week since getting stuck in unusually thick ice on Christmas. The people on board say they are holding up fairly well. ""The group on this ship is incredibly collegiate,"" said Alok Jha, a science correspondent for The Guardian newspaper, told Anderson Cooper 360. ""There are a lot of skills and things people are sharing with each other."" Chris Turney, an Australian professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales, said there are regular briefings on the status of rescue attempts, and in the meantime, people are doing what they can to keep busy. That includes yoga and Spanish classes, Jha and Turney said. Turney said it was raining hard Monday, and visibility was deteriorating. The forecast for the next 24 hours called for more of the same. Officials said a helicopter from a nearby Chinese ship will be used in the airlift, but rescuers must wait for conditions to improve. In preparation, crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy have marked a spot on the ice where the helicopter can land, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. The helicopter, which can transport 12 people each trip, will take the ship's 52 passengers -- who include the research team and journalists -- to the Chinese icebreaker Xue Long. An Australian icebreaker, which tried unsuccessfully to reach the research vessel, will send a barge to pick them up. The 22 crew members of the Akademik Shokalskiy will stay aboard, the maritime agency said. ""People are sort of seeing the end in sight and just keeping morale up,"" Turney told CNN. ""It's New Year's Eve tonight, so there are all sorts of plans."" That includes the singing of an original song written by one of the passengers and dancing, Jha said. And there may be good spirits -- both emotional and alcoholic, Jha and Turney said. The Akademik Shokalskiy passengers said it wasn't a bad place to be stuck. The scenery is beautiful. Penguins have been walking up to the ship and sniffing around, checking out their new neighbors. Close, but no rescue . The expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27. The second and current leg of the trip started on December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on January 4. The vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg. Turney said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick. It was about 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, which is about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. On Christmas morning, the ship sent a satellite distress signal after conditions failed to clear. The Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis suspended efforts early Monday to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The ship got within 10 nautical miles but then turned back. The attempt by the Australian icebreaker followed one by the Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, which was six nautical miles from the trapped vessel when it couldn't get any closer  because of the ice. It returned to open water and remained in the area to provide support, said Andrea Hayward-Maher, a spokeswoman for the maritime authority.","Passengers preparing for New Year's Eve festivities .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have charged a man with being a stowaway after he allegedly took a flight from New York to Los Angeles, even though he didn't have a proper boarding pass and was not on the flight manifest. It wasn't until after Virgin America Flight 415 took off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday that the airline discovered the man, identified as Olajide Oluwaseun Noibi, wasn't supposed to be on the flight, according to an FBI affidavit. The flight crew became aware of him when two passengers complained about his odor, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. He was seated toward the front of the plane, in seat 3E, according to the affidavit. But authorities did not arrest Noibi on Friday. They arrested him this week, on Wednesday, when he returned to Los Angeles International Airport and tried to fraudulently board a Delta flight bound for Atlanta, according to the FBI.  Officials found he was carrying numerous boarding passes, none in his name, the FBI said. Eimiller said the FBI did detain Noibi when the flight from New York landed in Los Angeles. Agents investigated to see if he or his luggage posed any immediate threat. They then released him, Eimiller said. The FBI is not saying what investigative steps it may have taken in the following days, nor whether it knew Noibi would appear for the Delta flight. The FBI affidavit says an agent was at the Delta departure gate when Noibi arrived. ""We are investigating his motivation, and whether it was anything beyond not wanting to pay for a ticket,"" Eimiller said. Authorities are also looking to see whether Noibi has used aliases or multiple addresses, she said. Noibi appeared in court Wednesday, where his case was continued.  He is expected back in U.S. District Court on Friday, Eimiller said. A law enforcement official told CNN there is nothing at this point to indicate terrorism in the case. However, the incident has raised questions about airline security and how someone could get through security and board a plane without a valid ticket and proper documentation. Transportation Security Administration spokesman Greg Soule issued a statement saying, ""Every passenger that passes through security checkpoints is subject to many layers of security including thorough physical screening at the checkpoint. TSA's review of this matter indicates that the passenger went through screening. It is important to note that this passenger was subject to the same physical screening at the checkpoint as other passengers."" Disciplinary action for the TSA officers involved is under review and at a minimum, the officers will receive remedial training, a TSA official speaking on the condition of anonymity told CNN. In an updated statement Thursday, the agency said its ""initial review of this matter indicates the officer reviewing the passenger's travel documents did not identify that the passenger was traveling with improper travel documents."" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, sent a letter Thursday to TSA Director John Pistole asking for a briefing by July 8 ""on the immediate measures TSA is taking to address these recent failures and any disciplinary action being taken against the travel document checker"" at Kennedy airport. King also called for an audit of the performance by all personnel who check travel documents, adding that almost a decade after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, ""failures of this kind should be a thing of the distant past."" A Virgin America spokeswoman said the airline ""maintains security and other screening systems in place to prevent such an occurrence; however, in this case it appears staff may have missed an alert when the passenger presented a boarding pass from a prior flight."" After discovering that Noibi should not have been on the flight, the crew kept him ""under surveillance, but at no time felt there was any threat to the security of the flight,"" the statement said, adding that the man slept for most of the flight. ""We take security matters very seriously and are reviewing our training to ensure that this anomaly does not occur again,"" spokeswoman Patricia Condon said. Noibi is from Nigeria and is a U.S. citizen, Eimiller said. Public records show he is 24 years old. When flying to Los Angeles last week, Noibi was questioned by a flight attendant.  He produced a boarding pass from a different date that was not in his name, FBI Special Agent Kevin Hogg said in the affidavit. The man whose name was on the boarding pass told Hogg that his boarding pass had disappeared from his back pocket after he took the subway to the airport last Thursday, the day before the flight Noibi was on, according to the affidavit. It was not clear how Noibi got to the gate for the flight at JFK. Noibi said he has a U.S. passport that had been stolen and that he had his Nigerian passport at home, Hogg wrote in the affidavit. Federal law states that being a stowaway on board a flight is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. A flight attendant noticed that Noibi was ""occupying a seat that the other attendants said was supposed to be empty,"" the affidavit says.  When the attendant, Satoshi Saito, asked to see his boarding pass, Noibi responded that it was in his bag in an overhead bin, the affidavit said. After the bag was retrieved, Noibi reached in and handed Saito a boarding pass, which had a different date.  Noibi said he had missed the flight the day before. Saito then brought the boarding pass to the captain, who instructed Saito to request further ID. ""At that point, Noibi did not want to talk with Saito and was hesitant.  Eventually Noibi produced a University of Michigan identification card with his photo and his full name.  Saito took the identification card to the captain, who observed that the names did not match and the date was wrong on the boarding pass.  The flight crew noted that Noibi was not on the flight manifest."" It is not clear what Noibi did for several days in Los Angeles, but he later told authorities he was recruiting people for his software business. The University of Michigan website lists someone by that name as affiliated with an electrical engineering program.  University spokeswoman Kelly Cunningham said Noibi was enrolled at the College of Engineering from 2004 through the fall of 2006, but is not a current student, and there is no record of his graduation. Cunningham said she could not comment on the circumstances of his leaving the university, nor whether he had ever had problems while at the university. The university lists an e-mail address for Noibi.  A message from CNN to that address Thursday morning was not immediately returned. A page on the website LinkedIn for someone with Noibi's name lists him as ""president, CEO and co-founder"" of a company and links to its website.  The site says the company is in Lagos, Nigeria. A man who answered the phone listed for the company and gave his name only as ""Timi"" said Noibi does some consulting for the company. The LinkedIn page also links to his Facebook account.  A message sent to that account was not immediately returned. On Wednesday, Hogg wrote in his affidavit, he was with an officer from Customs and Border Protection when Noibi approached the Delta departure gate counter at LAX for a flight to Atlanta.  Noibi showed a Delta agent ""a portion of a green boarding pass,"" but the agent told him the ticket was for the previous day and was not a valid boarding pass for the flight. Noibi insisted that he had been told he could go to the gate for the flight, the affidavit said. When Hogg approached Noibi and read him his Miranda rights, Noibi acknowledged that he had not paid for his flight to Los Angeles. He also said he spent the night at LAX in the secure portion of the airport, the affidavit said.  ""Noibi claimed he was able to go through passenger screening by obtaining a seat pass and displaying his University of Michigan identification and a police report that his passport had been stolen."" Authorities found he had two boarding passes in his pocket and more than 10 in his two bags.  ""Noibi did not have any boarding passes in his own name,"" the affidavit said. FBI spokeswoman Eimiller said the FBI has not determined how he came into possession of the boarding passes. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Josh Levs, Susan Candiotti, Carol Cratty, and Diane Ruggiero contributed to this report.","NEW: Rep. King seeks TSA report to Congress on the security breach .

"The Supreme Court on narrow grounds struck down a Massachusetts law Thursday creating no-protest ""buffer zones"" on public property surrounding health clinics that perform abortions. In what is a free speech dispute that touched on the larger political and social controversy over abortion, the court ruled unanimously. It did not strike down all such laws, but the ruling gives room for the state to go back and craft new, less restrictive protest zones. ""Here the commonwealth has pursued those interests by the extreme step of closing a substantial portion of a traditional public forum to all speakers,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""It has done so without seriously addressing the problem through alternatives that leave the forum open for its time-honored purposes."" Massachusetts officials said the issue was more about public safety and pedestrian access on local sidewalks. Anti-abortion supporters countered that their First Amendment rights were violated. The decision could affect a broader range of free speech areas -- over issues such as war, taxes, corporate bailouts and elections -- where the location of the message is often key to its effectiveness. Eleven women's health clinics across Massachusetts are covered by the fixed buffer zones. The current state law strengthened earlier restrictions that had created a floating 6-foot protective bubble around clinic patrons approaching the facility. Abortion rights supporters said it was ineffective, since they claimed it led to blocked entrances and a gauntlet of protesters surrounding patients and staff. Some past anti-abortion protests have turned violent in the United States. The state's 2007 revised ""selective exclusion law"" makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic ""employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment"" to ""enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk"" within 35 feet of ""a reproductive health care facility."" Anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from effectively talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances. Demonstrators have appeared regularly at clinics in Boston, Springfield, and Worcester and say they are unfairly singled out for exclusion on public property. Four more conservative justices would have taken the ruling further, saying the law was discriminatory, and that state should not be given the opportunity to go back and adopt new rules at selected facilities. ""The obvious purpose of the challenged portion of the Massachusetts Reproductive Health Care Facilities Act is to 'protect' prospective clients of abortion clinics from having to hear abortion-opposing speech on public streets and sidewalks,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""The provision is thus unconstitutional root and branch and cannot be saved, as the majority suggests, by limiting its application to the single facility that has experienced the safety and access problems to which it is quite obviously not addressed."" The last time the high court took a close look at the issue was in 2000, upholding Colorado's broad ""no approach zone"" regulations. Municipalities in Montana, Florida, California and elsewhere have since enacted similar ""fixed"" and ""floating"" buffer zone laws for clinics. Those laws will now have to be revisited in light of Thursday's opinion. The sidewalk outside the Supreme Court itself is the scene of daily anti-abortion protests sponsored by Bound4Life, where mostly young Christian adults stand silent wearing red tape across their mouths with the handwritten word ""LIFE.""","Law created no-protest zones on public property surrounding clinics that perform abortions .

"In one of the most anticipated Supreme Court hearings in years, the justices on Tuesday offered sharply divided views on the controversial individual mandate provision at the heart of the 2010 federal health care reform law. The fate of the individual mandate -- requiring most Americans to purchase health insurance by 2014 or face a financial penalty -- may be in jeopardy, and perhaps with it the entire law's other 450 or so sections, based on tough questions of the government by the court's conservative majority. Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst, said questions asked at oral arguments often show how justices are thinking, and based on what he heard Tuesday, the health care reform law could be in ""grave danger."" Neither the justices nor the lawyers arguing before them mentioned ""Obamacare""-- as opponents have labeled the law pushed through Congress by Democrats and President Barack Obama -- or the president by name. But the court seemed fully aware of the landmark consequences of their eventual rulings. ""Those who don't participate in health care make it more expensive for everyone else,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in support of the law. ""It is not your free choice"" to stay out of the market for life, she said. Hear Tuesday's oral arguments . Younger, mostly healthy people who would be the ""subsidizers will become the subsidized"" when they grow older, added Justice Elena Kagan. However, Justice Anthony Kennedy said that the federal government ""is telling an individual he has the obligation he must act"" and purchase insurance. ""That threatens to change the relationship between the government and the individual in a profound way,"" Kennedy said. If Congress could regulate health care in the name of commerce, added Chief Justice John Roberts, ""all bets are off"" on a range of areas subject to federal oversight. Monday roundup: 90 minutes of lively debate . Tuesday's argument was the biggest of the high court's three-day marathon this week examining the limits of congressional authority. It was part legal seminar, part history lesson, with politics sprinkled throughout. At least 17 members of Congress attended, along with several members of the Obama administration, including Attorney General Eric Holder. Administration officials, speaking on condition of not being identified, said they expect the high court to uphold the individual mandate despite the tough questioning Tuesday. Read a transcript from the courtroom . They noted conservative judges who asked similarly challenging questions as the issue made its way to the Supreme Court ended up upholding the mandate, and that Roberts targeted both sides with his queries. Outside the court, dueling news conferences and protests Tuesday reflected the partisan nature of the health care debate. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who failed in her bid for the Republican presidential nomination to take on Obama in November, told tea party supporters near the Supreme Court building that the issue is freedom for individuals to decide their health care needs. ""If the federal government can tell you, when you are not doing anything, that you must do something, then the federal government can tell you anything,"" Bachmann said, later adding a call for the Supreme Court to declare the mandate unconstitutional. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said he was ""optimistic"" the court would strike down the mandate because he saw Justice Kennedy was ""highly skeptical."" ""Can the federal government force Americans, free Americans to buy a product?"" Johnson said.  ""That's really what this boils down to. This is a very basic issue of freedom. I would say four conservative justices, three of them spoke and they were highly critical of this claim."" Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, called it the ""most important decision probably in two or three generations."" The Supreme Court and election-year blockbusters . Earlier, a cancer patient said at a news conference held by supporters of the law that it saved her life. ""Because President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, I get to keep my house, I won't go bankrupt, my kids are going to get to go to college, and I am going to live,"" Spike Dolomite Ward said to cheers. The nine-member bench kept Tuesday's two hours of arguments focused on the constitutional and policy implications. CNN Poll: Most want health law modified, not scrapped . At issue: May the federal government, under the Constitution's commerce clause, regulate economic ""inactivity""? Three federal appeals courts have found the Affordable Care Act to be constitutional, while another has said it is not, labeling it ""breathtaking in its expansive scope."" That ""circuit split"" all but assured that the Supreme Court would step in and decide the matter. A coalition of 26 states, led by Florida, argues individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a ""product"" they may neither want nor need. The Justice Department has countered that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not ""choose"" to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services -- costs that are shifted first to insurance companies and then passed on to consumers. In court, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. struggled to articulate the government's position that the mandate regulates commerce that already exists because everyone -- whether or not they currently have health insurance -- participates in the health care market. Justice Antonin Scalia jumped in, asking Verrilli: ""Why do you define the (health care) market that broadly?"" ""It may well be that everybody needs health care sooner or later, but not everybody needs a heart transplant, not everybody needs a liver transplant,"" Scalia continued. ""Could you define the market so that everybody has to buy food sooner or later, so you define the market as food, therefore, everybody is in the market; therefore, you can make people buy broccoli?"" Roberts said the law covers pediatric care and drug treatment, but not all Americans would need them and would indirectly subsidize them. But Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the federal government's economic oversight is broad, ""true of almost every product, directly or indirectly by government regulation."" ""There is government compulsion in almost every economic decision because the government regulates so much,"" Sotomayor added, calling it ""a condition of life that some may rail against,"" but the reality nonetheless. Ginsburg, meanwhile, made the correlation between health care reform and Social Security, passed in the 1930s to give a financial boost to older citizens, that is subsidized by young and old. ""If Congress could see this as a problem when we need to have a group that will subsidize the ones who are going to get the benefits, it seems to me you are saying the only way that could be done is if the government does it itself; it can't involve the private market, it can't involve the private insurers,"" Ginsburg said. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated that the health care law is growing in popularity, especially among independent voters, but half of those questioned still oppose it. However, while most opponents of the measure believe it goes too far, some who disapprove think it's not liberal enough. The poll found an almost even split on the individual mandate, with 47% in favor and 51% opposed, a gap within the survey's margin of error. According to the survey, a gender gap exists on the issue, with 58% of men opposing the mandate while 53% of women support it. In addition, a stark partisan divide exists on the issue, with 71% of Democrats favoring the mandate while 78% of Republicans oppose it. Among independents, 56% oppose the provision. CNN Money: What if the new health law is killed? The opposing sides do not even agree on what the mandate -- known as the ""buy in"" or ""minimum coverage"" provision -- was designed to accomplish. Supporters see it as a way to spread health care costs among a larger pool of individuals, ensuring affordable, quality medical care. They say regulating commerce and the economy has long been a federal prerogative. Opponents see fundamental constitutional violations, such as an intrusion into a citizen's personal life and an intrusion in long-held state power. Most individuals would be covered under the mandate, except for those whose religious beliefs would conflict, as well as illegal aliens and inmates. It would fall on insurance companies to inform the government of those covered under their health policies. 10 things you might not know about health care law . It is the individual mandate that has sparked the most controversy. It requires nearly every American to purchase some level of insurance or face a tax penalty of up to about $700 a year.

"The All Blacks and their fans are clear on one thing, says Dan Carter: the goal is to make history and become the first rugby nation to win back-to-back World Cups. For many players, such lofty expectations could threaten to derail the whole mission. Not so Carter, who is one of the game's true superstars. ""I absolutely love the pressure that not only the media and the public put on us, but also the pressure that we put on ourselves as a team,"" the world's all-time leading point-scorer told CNN. On an ambassadorial visit to London, the New Zealander is taking a six-month break from the game as he seeks to revive his battered body for next year's title defense in England and Wales. Next October's final will be at Twickenham, the headquarters of English rugby -- a place where the 32-year-old has endured both highs and lows in his career. Winning in London . Heading abroad to another World Cup where the All Black are certain favorites -- following their steamrollering 14-game perfect year in 2013 -- Carter has every reason to be optimistic. But any All Blacks fan knows better, having watched mystified as similarly all-conquering teams have failed to capture the trophy except for the two occasions the tournament has taken place on home turf -- and they had an agonizing 24-year gap between those successes. Carter knows there are a host of teams now hoping to seize on any sign of All Black weakness: he lists his old Tri-Nations rivals Australia and South Africa, plus England, Ireland, Wales, and even Fiji as teams that could cause an upset. But, he says, the year ahead is about being ready for the challenge. ""We had a great couple of years and the hype is starting to build in New Zealand -- especially as a player -- about the World Cup so it's going to be a challenging year in 2014."" Lifting the cup . Carter had the bittersweet pleasure of watching the All Blacks' triumph in Auckland in 2011 while sitting in the stand, having missed the majority of the tournament with a groin injury. Stephen Donald, who kicked what was ultimately the winning penalty against France, was called up to the squad for the final due to injuries suffered by Carter's replacements. ""I've been part of the squad that's won the World Cup before so, you know, that's a huge achievement,"" Carter says, diplomatically. This time he's hoping to get the jump on the injury problems, taking a sabbatical from the game after his most recent Achilles strain ahead of the international program, with the All Blacks' southern-hemisphere Rugby Championship title defense starting in August. ""Physically and mentally, I'm in a great space,"" he says. Fighting ghosts . That Achilles injury came on the occasion of his 100th international cap -- a tense showdown with England at Twickenham in November 2013, where the All Blacks came out on top 30-22. What should have been a milestone celebration for the No. 10 ended as he hobbled off the pitch with just 25 minutes played. A year prior, at the same venue, England shocked New Zealand 38-21 to end the Kiwis' 20-match unbeaten run. It was England's first win over the All Blacks at the ""Cabbage Patch"" since 2002 -- and Carter has plenty of previous better memories of the hallowed venue. ""I love playing at Twickenham. It's one of my favorite stadiums,"" he said. ""It's a real rugby environment, rugby culture is everything to do with Twickenham. ""You know -- I've had some great success there. Lost one game there a couple of years ago but apart from that I've had a lot of success at Twickenham."" Playing on . Carter is delighted that when he finally vacates the No. 10 shirt for good, there will be a stream of worthy successors. ""The beauty is, there's a lot of depth in my position and with the injuries that I've had in the last couple of years it's given the opportunity for a lot of young guys coming through,"" he said. ""There's Aaron Cruden, Beauden Barrett, Tom Taylor that have all had roles in the last year or two and every time they've had the opportunity, they've played extremely well."" But don't start looking for replacements just yet: Carter, who has scored 1,440 points for the All Blacks, says he'd love to keep playing for another four or five years ""at least."" After the World Cup, he'll consider his future. It could mean a return to Europe, where he spent an injury-shortened spell with French club Perpignan in 2008-09 -- or even a move to Japan. Until 2015 he'll be staying in New Zealand, and preparing for the challenge to come. ""The pinnacle of any rugby player is to reach those heights but to do it away from home, two tournaments in a row would be something pretty special,"" Carter said. ""I'll be working as hard as I can to try and be there if the All Blacks can reach that milestone.""","All Blacks seeking to make history at 2015 World Cup in England .

"The core of Trayvon Martin's story has been told again and again in recent days -- about how the 17-year-old went out to a Sanford, Florida, convenience store, only to be killed on his way back to his father's fiance's home. Yet one month later, questions persist as to exactly how and why that happened. The man who admitted shooting the teen has not been charged in connection to the case, much to the dismay of Martin's parents and thousands of strangers nationwide who've rallied behind them. On Monday, the story continued to gain both complexity, and clarity, thanks to details of the account that Martin's shooter gave to police after the shooting. George Zimmerman's description is outlined in an Orlando Sentinel article that cited ""authorities"" as the source of its information. The Sanford Police Department subsequently released a statement that, while condemning what it called""unauthorized leaks,"" confirmed the newspaper account ""is consistent with the information provided to the State Attorney's office by the police department."" Events held around country in response to case . Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, told police he was on his way to the grocery store when he saw Martin, a black male, walking through his gated community, according to the Sentinel report. ""Something's wrong with him,"" he told a 911 dispatcher, according to the contents of a call released last week. ""Yep. He's coming to check me out. He's got something in his hands."" The teen started to run, Zimmerman said. When he said he was following the boy, the dispatcher told him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Shortly afterward, neighbors began calling 911 to report an apparent altercation, then a gunshot. The Orlando Sentinel report fills in some blanks, purportedly from Zimmerman's perspective, of what transpired in the meantime. Zimmerman, according to the Sentinel report, later told police that he lost sight of Martin and was returning to his SUV when the teen approached him. The two exchanged words, according to Zimmerman, who said Martin then punched him in the nose. On the ground, Zimmerman said he was repeatedly punched and had his head slammed into the sidewalk, according to the Sentinel report. He began yelling, he told police. Previously released tapes of 911 calls included neighbors saying they had heard hearing screams -- though it wasn't clear whether they came from Zimmerman or Martin. Mary Cutcher told CNN on Monday that she and Selma Mora Lamilla were in a kitchen nearby when they ""heard a whining, someone in distress, and then the gunshot."" They ran outside and, ""within seconds,"" were about 10 feet away from Martin's body, Lamilla said. ""(Zimmerman) was standing over the body, basically straddling the body with his hand on Trayvon's back,"" said Cutcher, adding that they called three times to him before he finally asked them to call police. ""It didn't seem to me that he was trying to help him in any way."" And Martin's girlfriend was on the phone with him prior to the shooting, according to a lawyer for the shooting victim's family. Benjamin Crump said last week that the girl ""completely blows Zimmerman's absurd self-defense claim out of the water."" What is evident is that, minutes after that Zimmerman's first 911 call, police arrived at the scene. They found Martin ""laying face down in the grass,"" according to a police report. A short time later, Martin was pronounced dead. As to Zimmerman, ""his back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass (and he) was also bleeding, from the nose and back of his head,"" according to the same report. Zimmerman was questioned, but has not been charged in the case. This fact has triggered widespread uproar, with nearly three-fourths of Americans -- including 67 percent of whites and 86 percent of non-whites -- believing he should be arrested, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released Monday. Majority in poll call for shooter's arrest . Those attitudes were on display in more than dozen cities Monday. Many demonstrators wore hooded sweatshirts and carried Skittles candy -- just like Martin had, on the night he was killed -- from Atlanta to San Francisco in many communities, big and small, in between to show support for the victim's family and denounce racism, profiling and laws that permit use of force in self-defense. In the central Florida city of Sanford, a regularly scheduled city commission meeting turned into a forum focused on the Martin case. Near its start, Rev. Al Sharpton presented a petition that he said had been signed by 2 million people calling for Zimmerman's arrest. He was one of several speakers who called for answers and accountability for police officers who they felt bungled the case by not testing Zimmerman for alcohol and drug levels and not doing a background check on him -- even though they did both for the victim. ""The Sanford police department needs to be held accountable,"" said an emotional Tracy Martin, Trayvon's father. Martin's family and supporters have said that they believe race played a role in the shooting. Zimmerman is a white Hispanic. His family says he has been mistakenly portrayed as racist. On Monday, Martin's supporters continued to insist that Zimmerman should be held responsible for Martin's death -- saying the teen would be alive today if Zimmerman had simply followed the 911 dispatcher's instructions, to stay away. ""We're dealing with a self-appointed watchdog who disobeyed the dispatcher's instructions that he agreed to,"" said Sharpton, during a press conference earlier Monday with Martin's parents in Sanford. ""All else is irrelevant."" That includes, he added, reports that first surfaced Monday in media accounts and later confirmed by a family spokesman that Martin had been suspended after a search of his book bag turned up an empty plastic bag with marijuana residue. Martin, who lived in Miami, was visiting Sanford after receiving a 10-day suspension from school, according to a family spokesman. An empty plastic bag found in his book bag had marijuana residue, spokesman Ryan Julison confirmed. ""The only comment that I have right now is that they've killed my son and now they're trying to kill his reputation,"" Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said at a news conference. Crump, the family attorney, said authorities were trying to ""demonize"" the teen. ""Whatever Trayvon Martin was suspended for had absolutely no bearing on what happened on the night of February 26,"" he said. Both of Trayvon's parents will be in Washington on Tuesday, attending a House Judiciary Committee meeting with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, according to a news release from the congresswoman's office. A special prosecutor is investigating the case. A grand jury scheduled to begin deliberations on April 10, but it is uncertain if the group will ever work on the case. The prosecutor, Angela Corey, said Monday on HLN that she has never used a grand jury to decide on charges in a justifiable homicide case. ""We do a thorough investigation. We make that decision ourselves,"" she said. The two prosecutors assigned on the case worked through the weekend and will do their best to provide answers quickly, Corey said. They have not yet interviewed Zimmerman, nor does her office know where he is, she said. An attorney for the Martin family said Monday that any jury that sees the evidence in the case -- much of which she said was collected by investigators working on the Martin family's behalf -- would convict Zimmerman.""Clearly, the investigation in this case was either bungled, or ignored completely,"" Natalie Jackson said of the initial police inquiry. Sanford authorities say they could not arrest Zimmerman under Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves anywhere they feel a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. The evidence police had at the time didn't allow for an arrest, police have said. In addition to the investigation led by Corey, the state's governor has formed a task force to review the state's ""stand your ground"" law. The Justice Department is also investigating. Did you attend a rally for Trayvon Martin? Share your images . Sanford's city manager, Norton Bonaparte, also has said he is seeking an outside review of the police department's handling of the case. The neighborhood where Zimmerman was volunteering in the neighborhood watch program could also face a lawsuit, the National Association of Black Journalists said, citing Martin family attorney Daryl Parks. Parks spoke to the group's board of directors over the weekend. There is evidence that the Twin Lakes homeowners' association told residents who saw suspicious activity to call Zimmerman if they could not contact the police, according to the association's statement. Meanwhile, a handful of members from the New Black Panther Party have offered a $10,000 reward for Zimmerman's ""capture."" The group is distinct from the better-known Black Panther Party and is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as a ""virulently racist and anti-Semitic organization."" The Rev. Jesse Jackson cautioned people not to try to capture Zimmerman, saying it would not only put them at risk of being arrested, but also because it would a distraction. ""The focus must be on Zimmerman himself and what he did,"" Jackson said. Joe Oliver, a friend of Zimmerman's told CNN on Monday that Zimmerman is in hiding and all his family members are worried for their safety. Even with the shooter's account clear, authorities still are working to piece together the details from February 26.

"He plays the only sport approved by the Taliban, and Mohammad Nabi Eisakhil hopes the game he learned as a war refugee will play a big part in uniting his country. ""Now it's very popular. The young generation really like cricket, supporting the Afghanistan team,"" he  told CNN's Human to Hero series at the team's training base in Sharjah. ""When we were children it was nothing. Now in Afghanistan we have big support. Everyone likes our cricketers."" It's a country ravaged by war since the Soviet invasion of 1979. Following the Taliban's subsequent harsh period of rule, which ended in a U.S.-led intervention after the 9/11 terror attacks, Afghanistan's government is now battling to forge its own path of democracy between the opposing forces of Western expectation and fundamentalist Islamic tradition. Cricket, however, is being supported by Afghanistan's opposing factions, says Noor Muhammad, chief executive of the sport's national association. ""This is a game that can bring Afghanistan together and be a very good tool for peace and stability,"" he told CNN in a phone interview. ""Despite all these difficulties, the anti-government groups and armed groups hanging around, cricket has been progressing very well. ""We have been receiving very good support, even from anti-government people as well, because we have been going frequently to the remote areas. ""Cricket has a very bright future here. The mountains cover 75% of land in the country -- despite the fact land is very expensive, we have been offered a huge amount of land to build cricket grounds, in the north, the east and the west."" Nabi has come a long way since his family had to flee Afghanistan in the 1980s during the war with Russia. ""I was taught cricket in Pakistan, where there's a lot of cricket in the street, in schools. We were a lot of guys, we played together, with a tennis ball,"" he said of his upbringing in the border region of Peshawar -- once the gateway to some of Asia's richest trade routes, now a breeding ground for extremist elements. Since then, not only has he had the chance to play for Afghanistan in one-day and Twenty20 internationals, he has also been appointed team captain. And the 28-year-old is doing everything he can to achieve the country's dream of being accepted at the top levels of cricket. ""It's a big pressure to take this challenge, as a captain,"" Nabi said. ""It's a big challenge to me to lead in the front, and perform well. That gives me more motivation."" Muhammad says that, in a country where 70% of the population is under the age of 30, it is important to not only target but also to educate young people in order to develop the sport. ""That's why we are going to be working with the Ministry of Education so that this game will be part of the sports period and will officially be taught in schools,"" he said. ""We don't need only cricketers, we need educated cricketers. We are appointing coaches to go to the schools and train their teachers. So instead of taking boys to academies outside of schools, we are in fact taking cricket into their venues."" Nabi's big break came when he was invited to spend three months at the home of English cricket, Lord's, in 2007 as part of the young player program run by the Marylebone Cricket Club -- which governed the sport until the advent of the International Cricket Council in 1993. ""It's a beautiful ground, a beautiful academy, beautiful facilities. It's a very interesting and moving experience for me,"" he recalls. By that stage the Afghan national team had been in existence for only six years, despite cricket having been played in the country as early as the 19th century by British soldiers. It rose quickly through the ranks of the minor nations -- those not accorded full status by the ICC. In 2009, the team finally won through to the final qualifying round for the ICC's 50-over World Cup tournament, scraping through after winning a rain-affected match against Uganda. ""It was a very important match at that time. If we lose that match we didn't qualify,"" Nabi said. That was just a small step in Afghanistan's journey to join cricket's elite. The team has twice played at the World Twenty20 finals, but despite earning one-day international status, has yet to win a place at the World Cup -- and hopes of becoming a full member Test-playing nation are yet far away. ""There is a lot of thirst for this game but it is difficult to persuade the international community to come and play some matches -- that will further develop and promote the game,"" Muhammad said. Outside of official tournaments, Afghanistan does not play many matches -- which hinders its chances of moving up the rankings. It is 13th of the 50-over nations, and 12th in Twenty20. Two victories over Scotland last month kept alive Afghanistan's hopes of qualifying for the 2015 World Cup, but it will likely need to beat Namibia and Kenya in its remaining games to have a chance of claiming one of two places on offer for the tournament from the eight-nation WCL Championship. The other  six teams will have another chance to qualify, with two more places up for grabs at a final eliminator in New Zealand next year. The full member nations automatically qualify. ""It is disappointing that we are not receiving  expected support from full member countries, apart from Pakistan, who is comparatively supporting us,"" Muhammad said. ""But we are not hopeless, we together with media can motivate these countries, especially Asian counties, who can provide ODI and T20 opportunities. ""It is difficult to convey our message at ICC level because we are an affiliate member. Hopefully this will change in the future, and we're hoping the ICC will come and see how crazy people are for cricket."" For Nabi, it would be a dream to lead out his national team on home soil at the highest level of cricket. At present, the Afghans play their ""home"" internationals in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. ""We are not playing in Afghanistan, one-day internationals or Twenty20,"" said Nabi, who this year signed a contract to play in the Bangladesh Premier League. ""We want to. We have good supporters in Afghanistan. We want the ICC to allow some teams  to Afghanistan. ""That's what we want, to become a Test nation.""","Afghan cricket team is battling to become a fully-fledged international member .

"Washington (CNN) -- Don't like the way airport screeners are doing their job? You might not want to complain too much while standing in line. Arrogant complaining about airport security is one indicator Transportation Security Administration officers consider when looking for possible criminals and terrorists, CNN has learned exclusively. And, when combined with other behavioral indicators, it could result in a traveler facing additional scrutiny. CNN has obtained a list of roughly 70 ""behavioral indicators"" that TSA behavior detection officers use to identify potentially ""high risk"" passengers at the nation's airports. Many of the indicators, as characterized in open government reports, are behaviors and appearances that may be indicative of stress, fear or deception. None of them, as the TSA has long said, refer to or suggest race, religion or ethnicity. But one addresses passengers' attitudes towards security, and how they express those attitudes. It reads: ""Very arrogant and expresses contempt against airport passenger procedures."" TSA officials declined to comment on the list of indicators, but said that no single indicator, taken by itself, is ever used to identify travelers as potentially high-risk passengers. Travelers must exhibit several indicators before behavior detection officers steer them to more thorough screening. But a civil liberties organization said the list should not include behavior relating to the expression of opinions, even arrogant expressions of opinion. ""Expressing your contempt about airport procedures -- that's a First Amendment-protected right,"" said Michael German, a former FBI agent who now works as legal counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. ""We all have the right to express our views, and particularly in a situation where the government is demanding the ability to search you."" ""It's circular reasoning where, you know, I'm going to ask someone to surrender their rights; if they refuse, that's evidence that I need to take their rights away from them. And it's simply inappropriate,"" he said. The TSA says its security programs are informed by real-world situations and intelligence. Indeed, the immigration agent who refused to let the alleged ""20th hijacker"" into the United States in 2001 later testified that the man's arrogant behavior contributed to his suspicions. Agent Jose Melendez-Perez told the 9/11 commission that Mohammed al-Qahtani ""became visibly upset"" and arrogantly pointed his finger in the agent's face when asked why he did not have an airline ticket for a return flight. But some experts say terrorists are much more likely to avoid confrontations with authorities, saying an al Qaeda training manual instructs members to blend in. ""I think the idea that they would try to draw attention to themselves by being arrogant at airport security, it fails the common sense test,"" said CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. ""And it also fails what we know about their behaviors in the past."" The 9/11 commission's report says that ""none of the checkpoint supervisors (on September 11th) recalled the (successful) hijackers or reported anything suspicious regarding their screening."" But, it says, an airline ticket agent that checked in hijacker Mohammed Atta says Atta ""reacted negatively when informed in Portland (Maine) that he would have to check in again in Boston."" Atta ""clenched his jaw and said ... with some irritation, 'They told me one step check-in,'"" he recalled. The ticket agent recommended the United States hire ""behavior profilers ... the way they do overseas,"" the report says. Rafi Ron, former director of security at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport, said an arrogant complaint about security is a legitimate factor to consider. But officials also should be suspicious of effusive praise, he said. ""The other end of the spectrum is almost as bad, although it is maybe less offensive,"" he said. The TSA is expanding the behavior detection program, formally known as SPOT, for Screening Passengers by Observation Technique. Currently, some 3,000 uniformed behavior detection officers are deployed at about 175 airports. President Obama is calling for an additional 175 such officers in his 2012 budget proposal, and the TSA is expected to spend a total of $1.2 billion on the program over the next five years. In recent years, the TSA has also expanded the scope of the program. Originally intended to look only for suspected terrorists, the program now also seeks to ferret out possible criminals in airports. Many details of the program are publicly available. According to a Government Accountability Office report, uniformed behavior detection officers typically work in two-person teams at airport checkpoint lines, looking for behaviors that are on the SPOT checklist, each of which is assigned a numerical value. The officers sometimes initiate casual conversations with passengers, particularly if a passenger is exhibiting behaviors on the SPOT checklist. In most instances, the Accountability Office said, the conversation resolves the suspicion. But if both behavior detection officers agree that observed indicators exceed a predetermined numerical threshold, the person is referred to additional screening, which can involve more questioning and physical searches of a person or property. If the person's behavior escalates, accumulating more points based on the SPOT checklist, the officers can refer the person to local law enforcement for investigation. After the law enforcement investigation, the TSA officials determine whether to allow the passenger to board the flight. The Department of Homeland Security says the program is successful, telling Congress last week that, in a recent test comparing behavior detection officers to random screening procedures, the officers were 50 times more likely to refer people they checked to local law enforcement, and about 4.5 times as likely to identify people with prohibited items or fraudulent documents. Taken together, such officers are nine times more likely to identify ""high risk"" passengers than random screening, the department said. ""SPOT identifies high-risk travelers at a significantly higher rate then random screening,"" Larry Willis of the department's Science and Technology Directorate testified. But one member of the study's Technical Advisory Committee said the study did not establish the program's scientific validity. ""The advisory committee has not been asked to evaluate the overall SPOT program, nor has it been asked to evaluate the validity of indicators used in the program,"" Philip Rubin testified to Congress last week. Advisory committee members were not shown the list of behavioral indicators, he said. ""My concern is that if I'm a member of the public and I hear (Willis') testimony, it sounds like the SPOT program has been validated,"" Rubin told CNN. He said that while large numbers of people were screened, very little criminal activity was detected, and the numbers may not be statistically significant. ""The hit rate is so low on this, it could turn out to be a random glitch,"" he said. The Government Accountability Office also criticized the study, saying TSA's records are incomplete and the study is not designed to answer the big question people have about the program: Does it work? The study ""is not designed to fully validate whether behavior detection can be used to reliably identify individuals in an airport environment who pose a security risk,"" the agency said. Members of Congress also expressed concern about the number of ""false positives"" -- people flagged for additional screening that resulted in nothing being found. For every person correctly identified as a ""high risk"" traveler by (the behavior detection officers), 86 were misidentified, Willis said. At random screening, for every person correctly identified, 794 were misidentified. The TSA does not track the number of arrests, convictions or exonerations of people that are referred to law enforcement, he said. The ACLU's German, who has not seen the behavioral indicators list, said he fears the indicators ""are being used simply as a proxy for racial profiling or other inappropriate police activities."" The number of people arrested at airport checkpoints for immigration violations suggests the behavior detection officers are profiling, he said. Thirty-nine percent of the 1,083 people arrested during the first four and a half years of the program were arrested because they were illegal aliens, according to the Government Accountability Office. Experts agree that the fact that there is an extremely small number of terrorists makes it hard to evaluate the effectiveness of behavioral observation programs. The Accountability Office said it looked at 23 occasions in which 16 individuals -- people later charged with terrorism-related activities -- passed through high-threat airports. None is known to have been identified. But it is not known if the behavior detection officers were working at the time, the agency said. Stephen Lord of the Accountability Office is recommending the TSA study airport videos of those instances. ""We believe such recordings could help identify behaviors that may be common among terrorists, or could demonstrate that terrorists do not generally display any identifying behaviors,"" Lord said.","TSA officers look at people who ""express contempt""
The ACLU says that indicator is inappropriate .
The TSA says no single factor results in added screening .
Experts differ on the effectiveness of behavior observation ."
"A highly anticipated test of an experimental Ebola vaccine will begin this week at the National Institutes of Health, amid mounting anxiety about the spread of the deadly virus in West Africa. After an expedited review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, researchers were given the green light to begin what's called a human safety trial, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). It will be the first test of this type of Ebola vaccine in humans. The experimental vaccine, developed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and the NIAID, will first be given to three healthy human volunteers to see if they suffer any adverse effects. If deemed safe, it will then be given to another small group of volunteers, aged 18 to 50, to see if it produces a strong immune response to the virus. All will be monitored closely for side effects. The vaccine will be administered to volunteers by an injection in the deltoid muscle of their arm, first in a lower dose, then later in a higher dose after the safety of the vaccine has been determined. Some of the preclinical studies that are normally done on these types of vaccines were waived by the FDA during the expedited review, Fauci said, so ""we want to take extra special care that we go slowly with the dosing."" The vaccine did extremely well in earlier trials with chimpanzees, Fauci said. He noted that the method being used to prompt an immune response to Ebola cannot cause a healthy individual to become infected with the virus. Still, he said, ""I have been fooled enough in my many years of experience... you really can't predict what you will see (in humans)."" According to the NIH, the vaccine will also be tested on healthy volunteers in the United Kingdom, Gambia and Mali, once details are finalized with health officials in those countries. CDC director raises Ebola alarm . Trials cannot currently be done in the four countries affected by the recent outbreak -- Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria -- because the existing health care infrastructure wouldn't support them, Fauci said. Gambia and Mali were selected because the NIH has ""long-standing collaborative relationships"" with researchers in those countries. According to the NIH, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are also in talks with health officials from Nigeria about conducting part of the safety trial there. Funding from an international consortium formed to fight Ebola will enable GlaxoSmithKline to begin manufacturing up to 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine while clinical trials are ongoing, the pharmaceutical company said in a statement. These doses would be made available if the World Health Organization decides to allow emergency immunizations in high-risk communities. The GSK/NIAID vaccine is one of two leading candidate vaccines. The other was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed this month to NewLink Genetics, a company based in Iowa. According to the NIH, safety trials of that vaccine will start this fall. Ebola victim: 'I felt like I was about to die' Earlier this month, the Canadian government shipped what it said was ""800 to 1,000"" doses of that vaccine to Liberia, at the government's request. It's not clear whether it has been given to health workers or anyone else there. Worth noting: In 2009, an earlier version of the vaccine was given to a lab worker in Germany after he thought he had pricked himself with a needle tainted with Ebola. He did not develop the disease. While there currently is no proven treatment for Ebola beyond supportive care, government agencies and small biotech firms have been scrambling to speed up development of several potential therapies and vaccines. A third vaccine, also developed by the NIH, was recently tested in primates and found to protect them from infection; it was given in combination with Depovax, an adjuvant that has been used with other vaccines and cancer therapies to boost the body's immune response. While vaccines might be given to prevent infection among health workers or other people thought to be at high risk,  development has also been sped up on drugs that might potentially be given to patients who already have the disease. The drug that's received the most attention is ZMapp, which has been given to at least seven individuals in the current outbreak, including two American missionary medical workers, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly. The drug has never been formally tested in humans, and while the results in human patients are encouraging -- five of the seven known to have received it are still alive -- experts say there is too little data to say whether it played a role in their recoveries. Are myths making the Ebola outbreak worse? Earlier versions of ZMapp, which received backing from the U.S. and Canadian governments as well as from biotech firms, have shown some ability to protect rhesus macaque monkeys more than two days after they were infected with the virus. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced on Tuesday a $24.9 million, 18-month contract with ZMapp's manufacturer, Mapp Biopharmaceutical, to accelerate the development of the medication. Mapp will make ""a small amount of the drug for early stage clinical safety studies and nonclinical studies"" to gauge how the drug works on people, the HHS department said in a news release. The various new steps ""will contribute to increasing the amount of product potentially available to treat patients with Ebola."" Another drug, TKM-Ebola, has been tested for safety in a small number of humans. That trial was put on hold in January, after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication. Last month, the FDA modified the hold to a ""partial clinical hold."" In effect, this means that Tekmira could potentially be allowed to give the drug to doctors or hospitals who request it, on an emergency basis. There's no indication that the company has received any such requests. The vaccine going into trials this week is based on an adenovirus -- a type of cold virus -- that's found in chimpanzees. The virus delivers genetic material derived from two species of Ebola virus, including the Zaire strain that's responsible for the current outbreak. Those genes are meant to trigger the development of antibodies in the person who receives the vaccine, antibodies that can specifically defend against Ebola. Another trial, using a version of the GSK/NIAID vaccine that uses only the Zaire strain of Ebola, will be launched in October, according to the NIH. All participants in the trial will be evaluated nine times over a 48-week period. NIH expects to reveal the results of the trial by the end of the year. If it's approved for widespread use, the first priority will be to give the vaccine to health care workers or lab workers who are fighting the spread of the virus, Fauci said. It will then be considered for people in the communities where outbreaks occur. Nine things to know about the killer disease .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A suburban Atlanta high school teacher has been accused of pursuing a ""hit"" on a 16-year-old student last month, and the case is under investigation by local authorities. Randolph Forde -- who teaches at Mundy's Mill High School in Clayton County -- has been charged with making terroristic threats and was released on bond. He is currently on administrative leave from his job with pay and faces an employment hearing in early December, Charles White, a school district spokesman, said Tuesday. A Clayton County Police report says the incident occurred October 9. The suspect took a student off a school bus and told him he ""would pay him to kill the victim,"" the report says. When the student asked who the target would be, the suspect said he'd write the name on a note, it says. ""The teacher held a piece of paper up with the victim's name on it,"" said Officer Otis Willis III of the Clayton police. Attorney Terance Madden, who represents alleged target and his family, issued a statement saying that problems between the boy and the teacher go back to ""on or about September 29,"" when ""Forde allegedly called my client outside the class and asked him if he is gay."" Then ""on or about September 30,"" the two had an argument in class and Forde threatened ""to hit him in his 'effin mouth,"" Madden's statement said. ""Not only did my client report the verbal altercation and verbal threat to the vice principal of Mundy's Mill HS, he also reported that Mr. Forde asked him outside the classroom for the inappropriate question of whether he was gay,"" the statement said. ""Apparently nothing was done by the school administration to either Mr. Forde or my client, because Mr. Forde was back in the classroom on October 1, as was my client."" Madden said the school didn't take any action until after a police report was filed on October 12 about the incident. ""This forced my client's mother to have to remove my client from the high school, depriving him of his education because of fear for my client's safety at Mundy's Mill HS,"" Madden said in the statement. ""Finally Mr. Forde was allegedly removed from the school after the police report was filed and my client was able to return to school. An arrest was made on or about Oct. 14. Mr. Forde bonded out on $10,000 bond and waived his preliminary hearing,"" Madden said. Charles White, the school district's spokesman, said the district had no comment on the allegations because the issue is a personnel matter and is under review. He said it would be ""inappropriate"" for the district to release any information about the case. ""Attorneys can say anything they want,"" he said, but he added that ""there are definitely multiple sides to any story."" Forde's attorney initially could not be reached by CNN. The attorney was quoted by CNN affiliate WSB-TV as saying that Forde had been joking and didn't supply a name to anybody. White says there was to be an employment hearing Tuesday, but it had to be postponed because there had to be proper prior notice of a scheduled session under the state's open meetings law. District officials are aiming for a hearing in early December, he said. Madden calls the school district's reason for the postponement ""bunk"" and said it ""doesn't even pass the smell test."" He said the hearing was postponed because media coverage about the case had begun.","Police accuse Atlanta-area high school teacher of offering to pay one student to kill another .

"(CNN)An unmanned NASA-contracted rocket exploded in midair early Tuesday evening, producing huge flames and loud booms along the eastern Virginia coast but no injuries or deaths. Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Antares rocket and Cygnus cargo spacecraft had been set to launch at 6:22 p.m. ET from the Wallops Flight Facility along the Atlantic Ocean, carrying roughly 5,000 pounds of supplies and experiments to the International Space Station. It exploded about six seconds after launch. What was left of the spacecraft and rocket plummeted back to Earth, causing even more flames upon impact. The rocket and spacecraft -- which together cost more than $200 million, according to Frank Culbertson, the general manager of Orbital's Advanced Programs Group -- are gone. And there's obvious damage beyond that, including to the launchpad, though the night skies made it hard to immediately gauge how much. One thing officials do know is that rocket science is, in the words of NASA  Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier, ""a really tough business."" ""Tonight's events really show the difficulty that it takes for us to do this task of delivering cargo to the space station,"" he said. What happened? The Orbital rocket had been set to go up Monday, only to be scrubbed ""because of a boat down range in the trajectory Antares would have flown had it lifted off,"" according to NASA. Coast Guard spokesman David Weydert said the boat that triggered the postponement was 40 miles offshore. Tuesday, by contrast, seemed perfect. Just before liftoff, NASA reported ""100% favorable"" weather and ""no technical concerns with the rocket or spacecraft being worked."" It seemed to be going perfectly when Ed Encina saw the launch brighten up the sky from his vantage point about 3 miles away. ""And then, all of a sudden, you see a big fireball,"" said Encina, a Baltimore Sun reporter. Encina recalled a loud boom that caused ""your feet (to) shake a little bit,"" as well as flames enveloping a roughly 100-yard area around the launchpad in a marshy area with brush. CNN iReporter Dymetria Sellers, who watched from a drawbridge because the NASA visitors station was ful, recalled a ""breathtakingly beautiful"" sight when the rocket ascended, followed by mass confusion as flames lit up the early nighttime sky moments later. ""About 30 seconds later, we could hear and feel two booms reach us, and it was apparent the rocket had exploded,"" she said. Did you witness the rocket explosion? Please share your images . Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, said such a colossal fire was to be expected. ""It takes a lot of propellant to take a spacecraft of that size moving 25 times the speed of sound,"" Kelly told CNN, explaining how fast the rocket should have gone on its way to the space station. ""So when it fails, it's usually pretty catastrophic."" Authorities said the safety parameters appear to have worked, and noted the lack of casualties. ""All we lost was hardware,"" Culbertson said. ""That hardware, however, is very important."" Will rocket's 'catastrophic failure' set back the private space industry? So what happened? That's exactly what officials -- both from public agencies like NASA and private companies like Orbital -- hope to find out in the coming days and weeks. ""What we know so far is pretty much what everybody saw on the video,"" Culbertson said. ""The ascent stopped, there was some, let's say disassembly, of the first stage, and then it fell to Earth. ... We don't really have any early indications of exactly what might have failed, and we need some time to look at that."" Orbital will lead the investigation, along with the Federal Aviation Administration, with NASA assisting. Among other things, they'll try to collect and examine any debris that can be recovered, review data from the spacecraft before its destruction and look at videos around the launch time. The main focus Tuesday night was safety.  Bill Wrobel, the Wallops Flight Facility director, said fire crews had set up a perimeter around the affected area. ""We're just basically letting the fire burn out, but they are contained,"" he added. Authorities expressed confidence that no people were directly affected by the explosion, but they could come across scattered remnants that are possibly floating in the water. As to when Orbital will fly again from Wallops, the only site it's now permitted to launch from, Culbertson didn't specify a timetable beyond saying, ""We will fly again as soon as we can safely."" Gerstenmaier offered a similar take: ""We'll figure out what the failure is, we'll fix it, and we'll learn from it."" In the meantime, they'll have to rebound from the loss. A third of the spacecraft's cargo was material for scientific investigations such as a Houston school's experiment on pea growth and a study on blood flow in space. There also were basic supplies meant for the crew of the space station -- now orbiting more than 200 miles above Earth -- including more than 1,300 pounds of food. But in the short term, no one is saying the space station's six-person crew will go hungry. NASA won't directly restock them, having relied on private companies to do so since the end of its space shuttle program. That includes Virginia-based Orbital, which had its first of eight planned ISS launches in January out of the Wallops facility as part of its $1.9 billion contract with NASA. Orbital becomes second private firm to send cargo to ISS . If Orbital can't resupply the space station, others can. On Wednesday, for instance, a Russian Soyuz resupply spacecraft  stocked with cargo and crew supplies is set to launch from Kazakhstan. SpaceX, another private company, plans its fifth mission in December, including more supplies and a laser instrument to measure pollution, dust and other aspects of the atmosphere, according to NASA. Even if those missions somehow fail, the space station crew has enough on hand to last well into next year. ""The station is in great shape; the crew is in good shape,"" said Mike Suffredini, NASA's ISS manager. iReport: Explosion as seen from Maryland's eastern shore . CNN's Chandler Friedman, Kevin Conlon, Jareen Imam and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Explosion shows space travel ""a really tough business,"" NASA official says .

"Matt Souveny was feeling overwhelmed by the unworn clothes languishing in his closet when he began poking around Reddit's menswear forums, where style-conscious men debate different shoe leather and denim brands, or bravely seek constructive feedback on how a suit fits. Souveny, a Canadian Air Force pilot, got into discussions about what to wear if you could only choose one outfit for the rest of your life, a popular topic on such forums. It was hypothetical at first, but as the list grew, Souveny decided he had enough intel to turn into a real-life experiment. ""I'd been trimming it down over the past year, but after that conversation on the Internet, it really struck me that I don't need all this stuff,"" he said. As of June 1, Souveny has pledged to pare down his wardrobe to 10 articles of clothing for the next year, excluding socks, underwear and outerwear. The list includes: one pair of pants, one pair of shorts, two T-shirts, one button-down, one sweatshirt, one pair of sneakers, one pair of boots, a blazer and a belt. He declared his intention in May to wear one outfit for one year in a blog post titled ""minimalism."" The timing couldn't be better, he said. He and his wife were moving to a smaller home, and he would be on parental leave from the Air Force for six months, freeing him from the daily obligation to wear a flight suit. It was also a way for him to start experimenting with how to live with less overall, he said. ""We've found over the past year that having less stuff can actually allow you more freedom. Instead of spending free time sorting stuff, or organizing stuff, or searching through stuff for other stuff, you can hopefully spend more time doing things that you want to be doing,"" he wrote. Most of us aspire to de-clutter our lives at some point. Shunning all material possessions is a big leap for most, but slimming down one's closet is an easier first step. Popular minimalist fashion movements include the 10-piece capsule, the five-piece French wardrobe and Project 333, which invites participants to dress with 33 items or less for three months. When people recognize the benefits of fewer choices in their closets, they start thinking about how to apply the philosophy to other areas of their lives, said Courtney Carver, creator of Project 333. ""It's sort of the gateway drug for further simplicity, because that's where we start each day,"" Carver said. Carver began Project 333 in 2010 to simplify her life while dealing with the onset of multiple sclerosis, and ended up inspiring a movement that continues to gain momentum. Project 333's Facebook page, which has more than 12,000 likes, features stories from people around the world participating in the challenge. Inspired by Project 333, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Alison Sherwood started her own version earlier this month, the Tiny Closet Challenge, and invited readers to join her. So far, 30 have signed up from around the world . ""The simplicity of a minimalist wardrobe really appealed to me. I wanted to give it a try and see how it would affect my perspective on things like style, spending habits, materialism and contentment. I have two little kids -- ages 2.5 and 9 months -- so I don't really have time in the morning for trying on outfits and staring into my closet,"" Sherwood said. ""I tend to have a hard time getting rid of clothes even if I never wear them, because of guilt that I spent money on them or because I'm afraid I might want or need them at some point. I want to prove that I can let go of those clothes and be perfectly fine."" So far, it's working out, she said. She saves time in the morning and laundry is easier. When temperature fluctuations struck, she layered tops to stay warm. ""It's nice only wearing my favorite clothes and jewelry, and not feeling guilty for neglecting other clothes I may not like as much,"" she said. ""I feel a sense of calm when I look in my closet. It's stressful when there are clothes jammed into every available space, especially when you have a toddler who might come in and start tearing clothes off the hangers when you're trying to get ready. Now there is breathing room in my closet and it makes me feel like I'm starting the day with some semblance of organization and control."" Cutting back completely changed Carver's life. After being separated from her clothing those first three months, she realized most of it didn't matter to her. Today, she continues to use only 33 clothing items (not including underwear, sleepwear or workout clothing) at a time, reassessing her wardrobe every three months to cycle in seasonal necessities from a single container into her closet. She still makes purchases to replace items in her closet, but she's more thoughtful about them, she said. The minimalist philosophy has extended to other areas of her life. After deciding that she could do with much less in the kitchen, the living room and elsewhere in her home, she moved from her 2,000 square-foot home into an apartment. She also left her job in advertising to focus full-time on consulting with others to streamline their lives and businesses. Parting with clothing, even clothing you hate, is hard, said Jillian Quint, managing editor of PureWow.com, an online publication geared toward women's interests. Start by asking: Does it fit? Does it look good on me? When was the last time I wore it? If you can't answer ""yes,"" ""yes,"" and ""within the last year,"" the item has to go, she said. If you really want to rock a minimalist closet, it helps to invest in quality pieces that do double, triple or quadruple duty, Quint said. Think a crisp white blouse, a black blazer and a perfectly fitting pair of jeans accompanied by shoes and accessories to bring in more color and current trends. But the first step is overcoming the fear that ""it could never work for me"" and starting small. Don't get rid of anything at first, Project 333's Carver recommends. Hold onto everything and gradually shed the items you didn't realize you were missing during the experiment. Everyone has different reasons for paring down their wardrobe. For some, like Carver, the goal was to reduce stress and clutter. For others, it's part of an effort to focus on quality over quantity. Consumers are demanding a return to high-quality items that can stand the test of time, Quint said . ""We're in an era of examining our carbon footprint. Nobody wants a closet that looks like a landfill,"" she said. Souveny's motivation falls into this camp. ""I tried to find brands that embody this whole idea of making high quality products out of the best materials available,"" he said. And, it shows in the bill: $2,703, as one Redditor estimated the total cost of Souveny's 10 pieces, most of which are made in North America. Each piece of clothing was selected for its versatility and durability in different weather conditions and social environments, Souveny said. He avoided denim because it was too ""casual"" but he didn't want to wear a suit all year, leading to a wardrobe consisting of mostly synthetic fabrics that keep you cool in the summer and warm in the winter. It helps that some clothing brands heard about his plans and donated clothing to his experiment. Still, he says, he chose clothing by brands that he already owned or was likely to own, making the experiment not too far removed from reality. ""The way I justify buying higher quality items is in buying less and buying the best I can afford,"" he said. ""My closet is full of cheap clothes that will never wear out because I never wear them. The items that I saved for and sought after, however, get plenty of loving wear."" His exercise isn't meant to be prescriptive for everyone, he said. ""This was just a fun experiment for me to see how long things last,"" he said. ""Who knows, maybe it'll inspire others to think about how minimalism could work in their closet.""","Matt Souveny has pledged to wear only 10 articles of clothing for a year .

"A girl who overheard part of an incident involving Florida teenager Trayvon Martin can help prove he was killed ""in cold blood"" by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer,  an attorney for Martin's family said Tuesday. The girl, who was dating the 17-year-old, ""completely blows Zimmerman's absurd self-defense claim out of the water,"" lawyer Benjamin Crump told reporters. The girl -- who he said does not wish to be identified -- ""connects the dots"" about what happened that day when she lays out what she overheard while on the phone with him, he said. 911 calls paint picture of chaos . Martin was fatally shot on February 26 while walking to the house of his father's fiancee in Sanford after a trip to a nearby convenience store.  Zimmerman has acknowledged shooting Martin. Speaking on the phone shortly before he was shot, Martin told the girl that someone was following him and that he was trying to get away, Crump said. The girl said that, during the phone call, she heard someone ask Martin what he was doing and heard Martin ask why the person was following him, Crump said. The girl then got the impression that there was an altercation in which the earpiece fell out of Martin's ear and the connection went dead, Crump said. Based on what she heard, the girl believes that Martin was pushed, said Crump, who added that the girl did not hear any gunfire. Phone records show Martin was on the phone with her much of the day, including around the time of the killing, Crump said.  He argued that if Martin were really ""up to no good,"" he wouldn't have been chatting with his friend on the phone. The girl said Martin was ""his regular self,"" Crump said, arguing that any suggestions that the boy was ""high"" are ""preposterous."" ""It's what Zimmerman wants you to believe so he can justify killing this kid in cold blood,"" Crump said. Natalie Jackson, another attorney for the Martin family, said police had not interviewed the girl. Sanford Police Sgt. David Morgenstern said ""at the onset, we asked any and all witnesses with information to come forward."" He would not say say whether the department has contacted the girl. Morgenstern said Martin's cell phone was collected from the crime scene and investigators were working to acquire records associated with the phone's use. The girl provided her account to Crump in a recording, which he said he will share with the Department of Justice, which is investigating. Justice Department, FBI to investigate Florida teen's death . Crump said the Martin family does not trust Sanford police to investigate. Federal prosecutors and the FBI will investigate the incident, which has sparked claims of racial profiling and widespread calls for charges to be filed against Zimmerman. Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Florida, Sanford Mayor Jeff Triplett and Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte met Tuesday with Justice Department officials: Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division Thomas E. Perez and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roy L. Austin Jr. ""The gentlemen we spoke with -- they said they will not only look at what we've done, but they will also ... I think his exact comment was there will be no stone that won't be overturned,"" Triplett said. A grand jury will also help investigate the death of the unarmed African-American teenager. A police report describes Zimmerman as a white male; his family said he's a Spanish-speaking minority. The Seminole County Grand Jury will convene April 10, State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said in a statement. Gov. Rick Scott, who is asking the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to provide ""any assistance necessary"" to local investigators, insisted Tuesday he would work to ensure ""justice prevails."" The governor met Tuesday in Tallahassee with criminal defense lawyers and protesters who said his office should be more involved and form a task force on racial profiling. But Scott said any such task force shouldn't be formed until after a formal investigation. ""There should not be racial profiling anywhere,"" he told the group. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said she was ""devastated and deeply troubled"" over the killing. ""When someone loses his life at the hands of another, there cannot be any questions surrounding the circumstances of the death,"" she said in a statement. She said she had spoken with FDLE Commissioner Gerald M. Bailey, ""and I know that a complete and thorough review of the facts will be conducted."" She added that while it is up to the Seminole County State Attorney's Office to decide whether to file charges, ""I will remain vigilant in ensuring that questions are answered."" Police say they have not charged Zimmerman, 28, because they have no evidence to contradict his story that he shot in self-defense. In a police report, Officer Timothy Smith says that, when he arrived at the scene of the shooting, a black male was laying face down on the ground, his hands underneath his body.  ""I attempted to get a response from the black male, but was met with negative results,"" the report says. After speaking with Zimmerman, who had called 911, Smith observed that Zimmerman's ""back appeared to be wet and was covered in grass, as if he had been laying on his back on the ground.  Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and back of his head."" Smith wrote that Zimmerman stated, ""I was yelling for someone to help me, but no one would help me.""  Martin's family insists it was Trayvon Martin who was heard yelling for help. Three witnesses who were nearby have said it was Martin who was heard screaming for help in the 911 call placed by Zimmerman, Crump said. Martin's father said the family believes race was a factor in their son's death, fueling public outcry over the incident in the racially mixed community 16 miles northeast of Orlando. ""I think that's an issue that Mr. Zimmerman himself considers -- as someone suspicious -- a black kid with a hoodie on, jeans, tennis shoes,"" Tracy Martin, the teenager's father, told CNN. ""Thousands of people wear that outfit every day, so what was so suspicious about Trayvon that Zimmerman felt as though he had to confront him?"" Zimmerman's family has denied race played any role. Zimmerman has ""many black family members and friends. He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever,"" his father, Robert Zimmerman, said in a statement to the Orlando Sentinel. The case was one of the most-discussed topics Tuesday morning on Twitter, much of it dedicated to an online petition posted by Trayvon's parents calling on Florida authorities to charge Zimmerman. As of Tuesday evening, more than 638,000 people had signed the petition at Change.org, making it one of the site's largest petition campaigns ever, spokeswoman Megan Lubin said. More than 10,000 people an hour were signing the petition early Tuesday. Demonstrators who have turned out in recent days to protest police handling of the case have mocked Zimmerman's claim, carrying bags of Skittles like the one Trayvon had bought shortly before his death. CNN has made numerous attempts to contact Zimmerman but has been unsuccessful. Zimmerman has moved out of his home after receiving death threats, his father said. Shooting renews debate over 'stand your ground' laws . Florida's deadly force law, also called ""stand your ground,"" allows people to meet ""force with force"" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant, but exactly what happened in the moments leading up to Trayvon's death remains unclear. In his statement last week, Zimmerman's father said his son never followed or confronted Trayvon. But on Monday, police released 911 recordings in which Zimmerman says he is, in fact, following the boy. ""Something's wrong with him. Yep. He's coming to check me out,"" Zimmerman tells a police dispatcher. ""He's got something in his hands. I don't know what his deal is. Send officers over here."" The teen started to run, Zimmerman reported. When he said he was following, the dispatcher told him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Minutes later, someone who lives near the scene of the shooting called 911 to report an altercation. In the background, someone can be heard screaming for help, but the caller said she was too afraid to go outside and see what was going on. ""It's heart-wrenching, because those actually were my son's last words,"" said Trayvon's father. ""And to hear his last words being cries of help, is devastating. It tears me apart as a father."" The state attorney's office also said a voice analysis would be conducted on 911 calls from the night of the shooting to determine who was yelling for help. Opinion: My son could be Trayvon . Florida Rep. Dennis Baxley, who was the prime House sponsor of the deadly force legislation, told CNN Tuesday that ""nothing in 'stand your ground' authorizes (you) to pursue and confront."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the FBI was monitoring the case but that the White House was not going to ""wade into a local law enforcement matter."" The Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus have also called for a federal investigation, with the Black Caucus saying Sanford police showed ""blatant disregard for justice.""","Sanford police say they asked all witnesses to come forward .

"The United States and the European Union ""stand with the people of Ukraine"" in their fight for the right to choose alliances with countries other than Russia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday. His comments come after a week of political tumult in which Ukraine's Prime Minister and Cabinet have resigned, a controversial anti-protest law has been repealed and the President has signed off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters. ""Nowhere is the fight for a democratic, European future more important today than in Ukraine,"" said Kerry, speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. ""While there are unsavory elements in any chaotic situation, the vast majority of Ukrainians want to live freely in a safe, prosperous country. They are fighting for the right to associate with partners who will help them realize their aspirations -- and they have decided that means their futures do not have to lie with one country alone. ""The United States and EU stand with the people of Ukraine in that fight."" The protesters have been in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, since November, when President Viktor Yanukovych reversed a decision to sign a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union and turned instead toward Russia. The government's attempts to crack down on protests appear only to have strengthened the opposition's resolve. Violent confrontations flared after the anti-protest law was signed two weeks ago, followed by an uneasy standoff on the streets as the battle in the political arena has heated up. Kerry also had a word of advice for Moscow, which has accused Europe of meddling in Ukraine's affairs while denying itself exerting undue influence on Kiev. ""Russia and other countries should not view the European integration of their neighbors as a zero-sum game,"" Kerry said. ""In fact, the lesson of the last half-century is that we can accomplish much more when the United States, Russia and Europe work together. But make no mistake: We will continue to speak out when our interests or values are undercut by any country in the region."" Kerry added that while U.S. democracy was ""a work in progress,"" he was not going to shy away from calling out ""a disturbing trend in too many parts of Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkans"" where people's aspirations ""are once again being trampled beneath corrupt, oligarchic interests."" After his address, Kerry met with three Ukrainian opposition leaders -- Arseniy Yatsenyuk of the Fatherland party, Vitali Klitschko of the UDAR party and Petro Poroschenko of the ""Euromaidan"" street protest movement -- the State Department said. 'Time is on our side' European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also highlighted events in Ukraine as he opened the second day of the conference Saturday. ""Today Ukraine is on all our minds,"" he said. "" As people across the country are taking to the streets, Ukraine's political destiny is still in the balance."" Van Rompuy said he and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso had had ""a frank exchange"" with Putin this week at an EU-Russia summit in Brussels, Belgium. ""We answered his concerns about the impact on Russia of closer economic ties between Ukraine and Europe.  We also pressed the point of the rights of independent countries,"" he said. ""Whatever the geopolitics, we have offered Ukraine a closer association with the European Union, the countries to its west. Not for free, but upon conditions -- which were close to fulfilled. And not against the great neighboring nation to its east, with which it shares a history and culture. ""The offer is still there. And we know time is on our side. The future of Ukraine belongs with the European Union."" But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov presented a rather different take in his remarks to the conference. ""What does incitement of increasingly violent street protests have to do with promoting democracy,"" he asked. ""Why don't we hear condemnation of those who seize and hold government buildings, attack the police, torch the police, use racist and anti-Semitic and Nazi slogans? He suggested European politicians were encouraging Ukraine actions that they would punish as violations of the law in their own countries. Lavrov also said the United States and the European Union appeared to be trying to push their own ideas on Ukraine. ""Freedom of choice is being imposed, and Russia is not going to engage in this,"" he said. Torture claims . Meanwhile, Ukraine's opposition parties continue to call for constitutional reforms to shift power away from the President. They say the new amnesty bill -- which only comes into force if protesters vacate seized government buildings and unblock roads and squares -- is unacceptable. Yanukovych, who has been out on sick leave since Thursday, has resisted calls for him to stand down and defended the government's handling of the political crisis. On Friday, Western leaders voiced growing concern over reports of the kidnap and torture of opposition activists in Ukraine. One, the visibly battered Dmytro Bulatov, reappeared Thursday, more than a week after he went missing. He told reporters he'd been kidnapped and tortured by his captors -- who, he claimed, ""crucified me"" by piercing his hands -- before being dumped in a forest. Both EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and White House press secretary Jay Carney condemned his cruel treatment. ""We are deeply concerned by increasing reports of protesters disappearing and being beaten and tortured, as well as by attacks on journalists,"" Carney said. ""It is especially concerning that some of these reports have suggested the involvement of security forces."" Ukraine's Interior Ministry has said it is investigating what happened to Bulatov. Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, is home to 45 million people. The clashes earlier this month were an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia. He and Putin agreed on a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price of natural gas.","U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry meets with senior Ukrainian opposition leaders .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- During his confirmation hearing Thursday, Attorney General-designate Eric Holder conceded that he ""made mistakes"" during the Marc Rich pardon incident that were ""not typical"" of his conduct over the bulk of his career. Attorney General-designate Eric Holder told senators Thursday that he learned from the Rich pardon incident. Holder said he ""made assumptions that turned out not to be true"" during the Rich pardon process, which became the ""most intense"" and ""searing"" experience he ""ever had as a lawyer."" Holder's willingness as deputy attorney general to go along with the pardon over the objections of Justice Department career prosecutors has continued to haunt Holder. The pardon came in the last days of President Clinton's term. At his confirmation hearing Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Holder said he learned from the Rich pardon incident and will ""be a better attorney general"" as a result.  Watch Holder talk about the pardon of Mark Rich » . One of the lessons of the Rich case, Holder said, was the need for ""full consultation with all lawyers in the pardon process."" Holder said there was a need to improve the pardon process, which seems to experience a ""deterioration... at the end of every administration."" Holder, in response to a question from Sen. Arlen Specter, said he did not recommend that former Clinton White House counsel Jack Quinn, who served as Rich's lawyer during the pardon process, circumvent the Justice Department and go ""straight to the White House"" with the pardon application. Holder admitted he made a mistake by being inadequately informed about Rich's criminal background. Holder's handling of the Rich pardon is a chief concern of Judiciary Committee Republicans. Specter, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said there is ""no doubt"" Holder ""comes with an excellent resume, but there are questions nonetheless."" Earlier, as the hearing began, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy appealed to the deeply polarized panel ""to move past the partisanship of the past decades"" and approve Holder. Leahy, presiding over the panel, said Holder has  a proven ""commitment to the rule of law."" He continued that Holder had the character to serve as attorney general while restoring morale at what Leahy termed a ""demoralized"" Justice Department. A number of Republicans -- as well as some Democrats -- also blame Holder for backing pardons in the late 1990s for convicted FALN Puerto Rican prisoners who had committed acts of violence. Holder told the committee Thursday that President Clinton's 1999 decision to grant clemency to the 16 FALN prisoners ""was reasonable."" Holder noted that there were ""a lot of people in support of that clemency request,"" including former President Jimmy Carter and civil rights leader Coretta Scott King. The prisoners were ""bad people,"" said Holder, but clemency was warranted in part because none of their acts resulted in physical harm to anyone. The FALN -- or Armed Forces of National Liberation -- is a Puerto Rican terrorist group responsible for multiple bombings of U.S. military installations. Holder's confirmation hearing is set to offer the first taste of the rough and tumble partisanship in the new Congress. Leahy, who controls the committee, appears highly likely to have the votes to approve Holder's nomination, but Republicans could make it a bruising and divisive confirmation fight. Specter has vowed to scrutinize the record of the former deputy attorney general. ""We need to be sure the attorney general does not bend his views in any way that is partisan or political,"" Specter said. ""I totally disagree with him,"" Leahy said of Specter during a session this week with reporters. Leahy pointedly noted ""it may be just a coincidence"" that Specter and Committee Republicans began to criticize Holder's record after GOP strategist Karl Rove suggested they should do so. Leahy has repeatedly insisted Holder's record shows the nominee will exhibit independence from the White House if necessary while Specter remains unpersuaded. Senators of each party are expected to line up behind the two men. Specter has not said how he will vote in advance of the hearing. GOP veteran Orrin Hatch has said he may support the nomination in the end, but has questions. Former Sen. John Warner, R-Virginia, testified on Holder's behalf, saying that while Holder's career has been marked by certain ""misjudgments,"" he has proven a capacity to learn from his mistakes. In addition to the pardon matters, Republicans say they intend to grill Holder over his role in the Justice Department decision to raid a Miami, Florida, home to remove then-10-year-old Elian Gonzales. During the tenure of Attorney General Janet Reno and Holder, the boy was handed over to his father and returned to Cuba. The anti-Castro community in South Florida and many other conservatives were livid. Republican senators have also indicated an intention to highlight Holder's strong support for restrictions on gun rights. If confirmed, Holder would be the first African-American attorney general.

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, responded to President Obama's State of the Union speech on Tuesday night from the National Press Club. Here is a transcript of Bachmann's speech. Bachmann: Good evening. My name is Congresswoman Michele Bachmann from Minnesota's 6th District. I want to thank the Tea Party Express and Tea Party HD for inviting me to speak this evening. I'm here at their request and not to compete with the official Republican remarks. The Tea Party is a dynamic force for good in our national conversation, and it's an honor for me to speak with you. Two years ago, when Barack Obama became our president, unemployment was 7.8%, and our national debt stood at what seemed like a staggering $10.6 trillion. We wondered whether the president would cut spending, reduce the deficit and implement real job-creating policies. Unfortunately, the president's strategy for recovery was to spend a trillion dollars on a failed stimulus program, fueled by borrowed money. The White House promised us that all the spending would keep unemployment under 8%. Not only did that plan fail to deliver, but within three months, the national jobless rate spiked to 9.4%. It hasn't been lower for 20 straight months. While the government grew, we lost more than 2 million jobs. Let me show you a chart. Here are unemployment rates over the past 10 years. In October of 2001, our national unemployment rate was at 5.3%. In 2008, it was at 6.6%. But just eight months after President Obama promised lower unemployment, that rate spiked to a staggering 10.1%. Today, unemployment is at 9.4% with about 400,000 new claims every week. After the $700 billion bailout, the trillion-dollar stimulus, and the massive budget bill with over 9,000 earmarks, many of you implored Washington to please stop spending money that we don't have. But instead of cutting, we saw an unprecedented explosion of government spending and debt. It was unlike anything we've ever seen before in the history of the country. Well, deficits were unacceptably high under President Bush, but they exploded under President Obama's direction, growing the national debt by an astounding $3.1 trillion. Well, what did we buy? Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which lightbulbs to buy and which may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill. Obamacare mandates and penalties may even force many job-creators to just stop offering health insurance altogether, unless, of course, yours is one of the more than 222 privileged companies, or unions, that's already received a government waiver under Obamacare. In the end, unless we fully repeal Obamacare, a nation that currently enjoys the world's finest health care might be forced to rely on government-run coverage. That could have a devastating impact on our national debt for even generations to come. For two years, President Obama made promises, just like the ones we heard him make this evening, yet still we have high unemployment, devalued housing prices, and the cost of gasoline is skyrocketing. Well, here's a few suggestions for fixing our economy. The president could stop the EPA from imposing a job-destroying cap-and-trade system. The president could support a balanced budget amendment. The president could agree to an energy policy that increases American energy production and reduces our dependence on foreign oil. The president could also turn back some of the 132 regulations put in place in the last two years, many of which will cost our economy $100 million or more. And the president should repeal Obamacare and support free-market solutions, like medical malpractice reform and allowing all Americans to buy any health care policy they like anywhere in the United States. We need to start making things again in this country, and we can do that by reducing the tax and regulatory burden on job-creators. America will have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Think about that. Look no further to see why jobs are moving overseas. But thanks to you, there's reason for all of us to have hope that real spending cuts are coming, because last November, you went to the polls, and you voted out the big-spending politicians and you put in their place great men and women with a commitment to follow our Constitution and cut the size of government. I believe that we're in the very early days of a history-making turn in America. Please know how important your calls, visits and letters are to the maintenance of our liberties. Because of you, Congress is responding, and we're just beginning to start to undo the damage that's been done the last few years, because we believe in lower taxes, we believe in a limited view of government and exceptionalism in America. And I believe that America is the indispensable nation of the world. Just the creation of this nation itself was a miracle. Who can say that we won't see a miracle again? The perilous battle that was fought during World War II in the Pacific at Iwo Jima was a battle against all odds, and yet this picture immortalizes the victory of young GIs over the incursion against the Japanese. These six young men raising the flag came to symbolize all of America coming together to beat back a totalitarian aggressor. Our current debt crisis we face today is different, but we still need all of us to pull together. But we can do this. That's our hope. We will push forward. We will proclaim liberty throughout the land. And we will do so because we, the people, will never give up on this great nation. So God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.","Rep.

"Texas Rangers are investigating why police in a small central Texas town fatally shot a 93-year-old woman at her home. Pearlie Golden, a longtime resident of Hearne, a town of approximately 4,600 people about 150 miles south of Dallas, was shot multiple times Tuesday. A man believed to be a relative of Golden's made the 911 call asking for help from police, Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said. ""What I understand is (Hearne police) were called out because a woman was brandishing a firearm,"" Siegert said. ""An officer asked her to put the handgun down, and when she would not, shots were fired."" Hearne City Attorney Bryan Russ Jr. said Officer Stephen Stem told Golden to drop her weapon at least three times. Stem fired three times, and Golden was hit at least twice, he said. She was transported to a local hospital, where she died. The Hearne Police Department placed Stem on administrative leave pending the inquiry. ""We're very saddened by this. Everybody in the city government is deeply disappointed that this lady was killed,"" Russ said. ""Now, the investigation is out of our hands. It's under the Texas Rangers, which is where we want it to be."" According to police, the Texas Rangers have a revolver believed to have been in Golden's possession at the time of the shooting. Community members told CNN affiliate KBTX that Golden, known affectionately as ""Ms. Sully,"" was a sweet woman. ""Even if she did have a gun, she is in her 90s,"" Lawanda Cooke told KBTX. ""They could have shot in the air to scare her. Maybe she would have dropped it. I don't see her shooting anyone."" The case will eventually be presented to a grand jury, which is standard procedure when dealing with officer-involved incidents, Russ said. In the meantime, Hearne City Council members will meet Saturday to discuss Stem's employment or whether any disciplinary action will be taken. ""I would expect people to be upset about this, a young police officer shooting a 93-year-old lady,"" Russ said. ""I'm upset about it. Most of our citizens are upset but at the same time I don't believe all the facts have come to the surface yet."" Parents doubt official account of how their son was shot by officer .

"There's a problem haunting the digital-coupon world: Once people use a coupon, they usually don't come back. But Seth Priebatsch, the young founder of a game-life app called SCVNGR and one of the foremost thinkers on using technology to make life more of a game, says he has a fix for that. It's an app called LevelUp, and it's launching in two new cities -- New York and San Francisco -- on Wednesday, Priebatsch said. ""The data (about the app's use) has been just so freaking off-the-charts amazing,"" he said. In pilot cities where the app is already available -- Philadelphia and Boston -- more than 40% of the people who used the app to make a purchase came back to the same retail store within a month, Priebatsch said. Other coupon sites are reported to have lower return rates. A Groupon spokeswoman declined to comment or provide statistics for this story. The difference with LevelUp, says Priebatsch, is in ease of use and game mechanics. Here's how you use it: LevelUp users download an app and link it to a credit card. The app generates a unique QR code (those black-and-white checkerboard things), which can be scanned at stores to make a payment and to earn LevelUp deals. This happens all at once. If you're at the Kingston Station Restaurant in Boston, for example, and you pay with LevelUp, then you automatically get a $10 discount that's offered through the app. Compare that with Groupons, which you have to buy in advance, print out and take with you to the store or restaurant. LevelUp works right in the moment. The app also builds in an incentive for you to return to that business. As its name suggests, customers ""level up"" when they make purchases, letting them unlock better and better deals as they return to a location over and over again. In the Kingston Station example, you'll earn a $20 discount after you've spent a total of $150 at that restaurant. It's a digital version of those punch-card coupons, but there's not a paper card to lose, and it gets punched automatically when you pay with the app. The app is also toying with more game-like features in the future. This makes sense in part because Priebatsch is also the founder of SCVNGR, a real-world game app that takes users on scavenger hunts through parks, museums and businesses. If you take a friend to lunch and pay with the app, each of you gets a $5 coupon, for example. And, in the future, the company is working on a promotion called Make It Rain, in which you'll get a special discount if you make a purchase at a LevelUp merchant while it's raining in your city, since that's when restaurants are slow. The app is adding social and game-like features slowly to avoid ""the Blippy dichotomy of doom,"" he said, referring to a social site that lets users automatically share their credit card purchases on Twitter, freaking many people out. It's also worth noting that LevelUp doesn't take a cut of your purchases, which, according to Priebatsch, makes it a better deal for the businesses that use it. ""The coolest part -- and there's some magic here -- is that when you pay with LevelUp, the merchant actually pays about 50% less in their payment processing fees than the card that you would have paid with in the first place,"" he said. Instead, he said, LevelUp charges participating businesses a monthly fee of $55 after an initial three-month trial period during which the service is free. The app has 100,000 users in Boston and Philadelphia, he said, and LevelUp deals are available in about 500 businesses in those two test cities. About 800 businesses in San Francisco and New York have signed up with the service, he said, but not all will be active at the time of the app's launch in those cities Wednesday. If you give the app a try, let us know what you think in the comments section.","LevelUp is an app that offers deals and payments .

"Indonesia said Friday that Schapelle Corby, an Australian woman convicted almost nine years ago of drug smuggling, has been granted parole. Indonesian Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin announced the decision at a news conference in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, saying Corby's parole review was one of more than 1,000 that had been completed. It was unclear when she will be released from the Bali prison where she has been serving her lengthy sentence. Corby, 36, was convicted in May 2005 for smuggling nine pounds (4.1 kilograms) of marijuana in a bag, while arriving at Bali's Denpasar International Airport the previous October. She has always maintained her innocence. Her lawyers argued the drugs were planted, possibly by airport employees involved in trafficking. But the court found her guilty and sentenced her to 20 years in prison. The punishment fueled anger in Australia, where many people said they felt Corby had been set up. After exhausting the appeals process, Corby applied for clemency. A medical exam diagnosed her as suffering from acute depression with psychotic symptoms. In 2012, Indonesia reduced her sentence by five years, laying the foundation for her parole application. Corby appears unlikely to return to Australia anytime soon, though. Australian media have reported that she will have to remain in Bali on parole until 2017. Some Indonesians have accused the authorities of giving Corby's case special attention. But the justice ministry says she's being treated the same way as other convicts in Indonesia.","The Indonesian Justice Minister says Corby's is one of many parole reviews completed .

"Another sign of new rapprochement with Western culture, or a cynical public relations ploy? Iran's top leaders used Twitter to send Christmas greetings that praised Jesus, continuing a new era of social media outreach by a government previously known for Islamic extremism and political belligerence. ""May Jesus Christ, Prophet of love & peace, bless us all on this day. Wishing Merry #Christmas to those celebrating, esp Iranian Christians,"" said a tweet from the official account of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. In response to Rouhani, the Shiite Muslim country's hardline Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted back: ""No doubt that Jesus #Christ has no less value among Muslims than [he has] among the pious Christians."" Another tweet from Khamenei's account said that ""Jesus #Christ, the Son of #Mary, was a herald of God's grace, blessing & guidance for man."" The messages come as Iran seeks to reshape its relationship with the United States and other Western powers more than three decades after the Islamic revolution launched an era of diplomatic estrangement. Its economy crippled by international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran recently agreed to freeze some nuclear development efforts in exchange for the easing of some sanctions while talks continue on a final deal that U.S. officials say would prevent Tehran from building a nuclear weapon. However, Israel and some U.S. legislators warn that Iran was manipulating President Barack Obama's administration and its allies in the talks without intending to truly give up its quest for a nuclear weapon. Rouhani insists Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says the negotiations will show if that's true because a final agreement will require Iran to give up the technology to develop weapons of mass destruction. IAEA: Iran invites inspectors to visit Arak nuclear site . The chief Iranian nuclear negotiator, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, joined in some of the Christmas tweeting from Tehran. ""May the spirit of Christmas bring joy, peace, empathy and compassion to everyone throughout the coming year. Merry Christmas,"" said a post on his account. The messages came from leaders of an Islamic republic in which religious minorities are not completely free to participate in the Iranian government and often face discrimination. While Jews and Christians can to some extent worship openly in Iran, the government cracks down on converts from Islam and any effort to proselytize faith other than Muslim. ""There are thousands of cases of discrimination against religious minorities like the Baha'is and others who express their own beliefs or any other belief than what the theocratic regime of Iran impose,"" noted Katrina Lantos Swett, the vice chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, in an interview last year with CNN. In 2012, Iran arrested Saeed Abedini, a U.S. citizen who is a Christian convert and was openly preaching his Christian beliefs. He remains imprisoned in Iran, and his wife and others criticized the Obama administration for not negotiating his release as part of the nuclear talks. Iranian leaders have offered Christmas messages in the past citing the teachings of Jesus, who is considered a prophet in Islam. Former President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, a hardliner notorious for virulent anti-Israel rhetoric, had on occasion issued positive statements about Christmas or Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish celebration of a new year. He was much more widely known, however, for saying that Israel should be eliminated and calling the Holocaust a myth. Usually, Ahmadinejad would caution that he was criticizing ""Zionists,"" not all Jews. The more moderate Rouhani easily won the June election to succeed Ahmedinejad, then signaled a major shift when a tweet in September on his English-language account said: ""As the sun is about to set here in #Tehran I wish all Jews, especially Iranian Jews, a blessed Rosh Hashanah."" At the opening of the U.N. General Assembly that same month, Rouhani promised that Iran had the political will to reach nuclear agreement with the United States and its allies. Rumors that he would meet with Obama in New York proved unfounded, but the two men spoke by telephone before Rouhani flew home -- the first direct conversation between U.S. and Iranian top leaders since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Over the weekend, Rouhani made clear his intention to ease tensions with the West. A post on his Twitter account declared: ""We want to rebuild and improve our relations to European and North American countries on a basis of mutual respect."" The Christmas tweets continued the Iranian outreach, this time joined by Khamenei , whose account included multiple tweets that implied Jesus might side with Iran against what he has in the past criticized as Western imperialism. ""If #Christ were among us today, he would not spare even a single moment to fight the despotism &global #arrogance,"" said one of the tweets on Khamenei's account. Khamenei's messages appeared to be an effort to communicate directly with the international community by the 74-year-old religious cleric. It was impossible to know who actually writes on the Twitter accounts of Rouhani and Khamenei, while Zarif, a fluent English speaker, previously has said he writes his own tweets. Just the existence of official accounts for Rouhani and Khamenei makes them authoritative in a nation where Twitter and other social media websites such as Facebook and YouTube are controlled and limited. In an interview with CNN in September, Iranian Tourism Minister Mohammad-Ali Najafi said he expected more openness to social media under Rouhani, a close political ally. ""Social media is actually a great tool that can be used to express beliefs and reveal the reality and truth,"" Najafi said. ""During the previous administration, social media and the Iranian's presence on social media was considered to be illegal. But I think based on the policies of the new administration, there would certainly be changes made in those limitations.""","Iranian leaders praise Jesus Christ as a prophet of God's grace .

"Twelve female students from Le Roy Junior Senior High School in upstate New York are experiencing a mysterious medical condition.  Their symptoms include stuttering, uncontrollable twitching movements and verbal outbursts. Health officials say the symptoms are consistent with ""conversion disorder."" Dr. Jennifer McVige, a pediatric neurologist at the DENT Neurologic Institute who is treating many of the  students affected, said, ""Conversion disorder is a physical manifestation of physiological symptoms where there is traditionally some kind of stress or multiple stressors that provoke a physical reaction within the body.""  McVige said the symptoms are real. ""This is unconscious.  It is not done purposefully."" Thera Sanchez, a senior on the honor roll at the school, said she has been fighting this affliction since October.  She said after waking up from a nap, ""I got upset, I couldn't stop stuttering.""  During an interview with CNN's Jason Carroll, her symptoms were apparent: She was twitching uncontrollably, flailing her left arm and jerking her head to one side. Sanchez said she also faints and has seizures. The seizures are a result of her pre-existing epilepsy disorder, which had been under control for years. Lydia Parker, also a senior at the school, is exhibiting similar symptoms. ""I took a five-minute nap. I passed out for five minutes and I woke up stuttering,"" Parker said.  She said her symptoms also started in October.  Parker has a bruised forehead after banging it on her bedpost during a fainting spell, she said. Officials at the school hired an independent third party to conduct mold and air quality tests but found no environmental cause for the girls' illnesses.  A statement posted on the school's website said, in part, ""The medical and environmental investigations have not uncovered any evidence that would link the neurological symptoms to anything in the environment or of an infectious nature."" Sanchez's mother, Melissa Phillips said she does not agree. ""I don't think that all physical aspects of this have been exhausted; not enough testing has been done."" Phillips said she found out other girls were exhibiting the same symptoms when she brought her daughter to the hospital. The nurse said Thera was the fourth girl in a week to come in with the same issues.  ""I was very irate to not know that other girls were going through this."" She also disagreed with McVige's assertion that the girls are improving, saying, ""Nothing is getting better, you know, the girls are still getting worse. They have good days and bad days."" McVige is not sure why so many girls at the same school are suffering all at once. ""I do know that traditionally when they've (doctors) looked back at different events that occurred in a similar nature, a majority of the time it is girls."" According to the Mayo Clinic, females are much more likely to get conversion disorder and it is more common in adolescents or young adults. McVige said she used the ""diagnosis of exclusion"" to determine what happened to the girls, which means using the process of elimination. She ruled out a laundry list of factors to reach her diagnosis, including infections, drug use,  food allergies  and vaccine reactions, specifically Gardasil. The New York State Health Department agreed with McVige's diagnosis after speaking with several doctors who evaluated the students.  ""There are many causes of tic-like symptoms. Stress can often worsen them,"" said spokesman Jeffrey Hammond. ""The doctors all agree that the symptoms these girls are experiencing are real."" This isn't the first time reports have surfaced of multiple students at one high school experiencing twitching  symptoms.  In 2007, nine female students and one teacher were reported to have the same issues at William Byrd High School in Roanoke, Virginia. The school spent $30,000 testing the school and the surrounding area but found no evidence of any environmental factors that may have contributed to the illnesses. The school principal, Richard Turner, said after closely interviewing the students, they found six of them were faking the symptoms. The teacher who was affected is now symptom free and still teaching at the school. One student who got better within days, according to Turner, was determined to have had a reaction to medication. The other two students' symptoms were eventually resolved. All of them graduated.  ""We haven't had any other reported incidents since then,"" Turner said. The Virginia Department of Health also did an investigation and told CNN it found no contributing environmental factors and concluded the students' symptoms, though varied, were consistent with a social phenomenon called ""mass psychogenic hysteria,"" which suggests real symptoms but no biological cause. Thera Sanchez said all she wants is to get better so she can go to college next year. ""I don't think this is in my head."" McVige said she wanted to assure the public that this illness will not spread. ""I feel we need to put an end to feeling that this is a mystery, that someone is going to catch something contagious."" She expressed confidence all the girls will get better, adding they have ""an excellent prognosis.""","""Conversion disorder"" causes twitching, stuttering, verbal outbursts .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russia's finance minister made a rare admission of responsibility Monday for the country's severe economic crisis. Russia's Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin says his country's economy has been set back by five years. The Russian government overspent its vast oil revenues in recent years, fueling inflation, and did not do enough to reduce the economy's reliance on oil, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said in an exclusive CNN interview. ""Of course, I too bear the responsibility for not managing to diversify the economy as much as we wanted,"" Kudrin said. ""We were spending more money than we could afford, which is why we had a rapid strengthening of the national currency [and] a high inflation rate. ""I think the government should have been more conservative in its financial policy and save more money that it received from the high global oil prices,"" he said. Kremlin officials usually blame the West, and specifically the United States, for the global economic crisis. Kudrin, who is also a deputy prime minister, said the financial crisis had set back Russian shares -- but added that the United States had fared even worse. ""If we are talking about the Russian stock market, it had been growing quickly over the past few years and then dropped rapidly. But we only retreated back five years, as far as I know, U.S. stock markets have fallen back 10 years."" Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Russia's finance minister » . The Dow Jones index of leading shares hit lows not seen since 1997 on Monday. Kudrin confirmed Russia would have a budget deficit of 8 percent in 2009 -- its first for a decade -- and will spend more than it takes in for the next two years as well. He predicted a deficit of 5 percent in 2010 and 3 percent in 2011. Russian government budget forecasts assumed oil would cost $95 a barrel -- more than twice as much as it costs at the moment. The lower price hurt Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters. But Kudrin said Moscow would not cut spending, though it would change its priorities. ""In general, the volume of spending will remain the same, and even slightly increase, which is why the deficit will go up to 8 percent,"" he said. ""We need to optimize our spending and cut certain programs,"" he added. ""First of all, we halted all brand new programs and all new projects. In some cases we've also cut government institutions and government employees' payroll. Besides, we've decreased funding for less important projects by 50 percent and more. But by and large social spending and important infrastructure projects remain untouched."" Russia's stock markets plummeted by nearly 70 percent in 2008, and the country spent one-third of its gold and foreign currency reserves -- or $216 billion -- defending its currency, the ruble. The Kremlin has also committed vast sums to bail out big business in Russia, which is heavily in debt to foreign banks. Kudrin -- who is attending a global investment forum in Moscow -- said there were signs the Russian economy was stabilizing. He confirmed that investors pulled $40 billion out of Russia in January, but said that enormous outflows of cash had stopped. The flight of capital was related to the much-anticipated fall in the value of the currency, he said. ""People have been expecting a devaluation of the Russian ruble, there were a lot of expectations of new devaluation to take place. That's why, before the end of January, before the devaluation was actually completed, there was a very strong incentive to take capital out of Russia. However, in February, such capital outflow practically ended.""

"For close encounters of the furry, feathered, or scaly kind, there's no place on the planet quite like the Galapagos Islands. ""You just see some of the craziest things,"" said Jonathan Brunger, operations manager for Adventure Life, a Montana company that arranges trips to the region. ""While you're out snorkeling, the sea lions will come out and swim with you. ... You feel a little nibble on the end of your flipper, you turn around and there's this sea lion wanting to play with you, wanting you to chase it. ""Other times, they'll come up to your face and they're looking at their own reflection in your snorkel mask."" The Galapagos -- 19 islands that lie 600 miles west of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean -- are home to species of animals found nowhere else on Earth. Famously visited by Charles Darwin in 1835, the archipelago played a key role in his theory of evolution. These days, both tourists and researchers flock to the islands to see giant tortoises that can live 150 years, marine iguanas that dive to find dinner, flightless cormorants, and penguins that somehow thrive near the equator. With few predators to make them wary of humans, many of the creatures seem tame and curious. ""It's just a fantastically wonderful place,"" said Herb Wilson, a biology professor at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, who has been to the Galapagos twice. ""One of the most exciting things about it is that just the animals there are so fearless. So you have to step over sea lions and marine iguanas just to get from one place to another."" With their remote location, the Galapagos used to be more of a legend than a destination for most people -- but that's no longer the case. In the 1960s, just 2,000 tourists a year visited the islands, according to The Charles Darwin Foundation. Today, that number has grown to more than 150,000. To limit their impact on the fragile ecosystem, Galapagos National Park -- which makes up 97% of the archipelago -- requires tourists to be accompanied by a certified guide when they enter protected areas. There are also limits on how many people can be at any visitor site at one time. ""They seem to be doing a reasonable job of trying to find the happy medium between access and protection,"" Wilson said. Here are some tips to consider if you want to pursue your own Galapagos adventure. What's the best time to go? You can have a great experience in the Galapagos year-round, Brunger said, so there's really isn't a ""best time"" to go. The busiest tourist seasons are during the summer and around Christmas, when kids are out of school and people have extra vacation, he said. The warmest months are between January and May, when average temperatures reach the upper 70s and the low 80s. The driest months are from June to December. How do you get there? The first step is to fly into mainland Ecuador and land either in Quito or Guayaquil. A nonstop flight from Miami to Quito takes about four hours. From there, travelers can fly to one of two airports in the Galapagos Islands -- Baltra or San Cristobal -- via Lan Ecuador, AeroGal or TAME Airlines. That leg of the journey lasts about three hours from Quito. Wilson said he didn't find the trip particularly difficult. Where do you stay? You can choose land-based lodgings or a cabin at sea. There are four islands in the Galapagos with accommodations for tourists -- options that include everything from small lodges to luxury hotels, Brunger said. Wilson's hotels ranged from rustic to modern, but they were all comfortable and clean, he recalled. He dined at local restaurants, where seafood and chicken dishes were the most common fare. For those who prefer staying on land, Brunger recommended the Finch Bay Eco Hotel in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island and the Iguana Crossing Hotel in Puerto Villamil on Isabela Island. Many visitors, however, choose to take a cruise around the Galapagos, so they stay on board ships and take lots of land excursions. The cruises carry anywhere from 16 to 100 passengers, and most of the ships are relatively small, so this is not a good option if you get seasick easily or are not keen on living on a boat for several days, Brunger said. Beginning next year, new regulations from Galapagos National Park will ban cruises from visiting any site more than once in a 15-day period. The goal is to cut tourist traffic at some of the most popular spots, according to the International Galapagos Tour Operators Association. You can book a 15-day cruise or, if that is too long, sign up for a shorter itinerary. The most popular option is the 8 day/7 night cruise, which ""gives a good overview of the islands,"" Brunger said. What are some of the most popular activities on the Galapagos? Watching all of the incredible creatures, of course. (You might even catch a glimpse of the courtship dance of the blue-footed booby.) But there's also snorkeling, sea kayaking, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and more. ""The Galapagos is a great, great destination for scuba diving,"" Brunger said. ""But it is for intermediate to expert (divers). It's not a place for beginning scuba diving because you have pretty strong underwater currents and the water is quite cold."" How much does a Galapagos trip cost? As always, it all depends on your accommodations and length of stay, but here's an estimate of expenses: . Coach airfare from the United States to mainland Ecuador varies widely depending on your departure point. Once in Ecuador, a round-trip flight to the Galapagos costs about $400. There is a $100 fee to enter Galapagos National Park. An eight-day cruise around the islands will set you back anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 per person, which includes accommodations, meals and excursions with a naturalist guide, Brunger said.","The Galapagos Islands are home to species of animals found nowhere else on Earth .

"(CNN)After days of anti-government protests in Haiti, the country's prime minister is resigning. Laurent Lamothe announced his resignation Saturday night, the country's Ministry of Communications said on Twitter. ""I leave the position of prime minister this evening with a feeling of accomplishment,"" Lamothe said in a televised speech. The resignation comes after violent anti-government protests calling for elections and for both Lamothe and President Michel Martelly to step down. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti denounced the violence in the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince, and also said it is investigating a report of excessive use of force. Haiti has been mired in extreme poverty and instability for years. It is still grappling with the aftermath of a catastrophic 2010 earthquake that killed more than 230,000. In 2011, the year Martelly was elected, the President gave a sobering account of Haitian politics: . ""We are ruled by corruption,"" he said at the time.

"Washington (CNN) -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott refused to go onstage for the first seven minutes of a debate Wednesday night, because his opponent had a fan. No, not a rowdy supporter in the audience. An actual electric fan. Scott's Democratic challenger, former Gov. Charlie Crist, had set up a small fan underneath his podium, apparently trying to keep himself from sweating under the Broward College stage's lights. Scott saw the fan, a prop that often accompanies Crist at public appearances, as a violation of the debate's rules and said he wouldn't participate. The moderators tried to explain the disagreement while Republicans in the audience chided Crist for breaking rules -- at least as Scott saw them -- against props on stage. ""We have an extremely peculiar situation right now,"" moderator Elliott Rodriguez, a local news anchor, said as the broadcast started. ""Are we really going to debate a fan?"" Crist said while standing alone on stage. Several minutes later, Scott relented and joined the debate. ""That has to be the most unique beginning to any debate,"" Rodriguez said as Scott walked onto the stage. From there, the moderators largely tried to ignore the episode. And on Thursday, Scott tried explain why his opponent needed a fan in the first place. ""I think he was sweating and he needed a fan. I'm surprised he didn't try to ask for dry ice,"" Scott said. That could have actually been a solution to the standoff that took up the first seven minutes of the debate because Scott's protest flamed over Crist's apparent disregard for a previous agreement that electronic devices would be banned from the stage . ""I think he was probably worried about his track record,"" Scott said, bringing up his campaign talking point that more than 832,000 people lost their jobs during Crist's four-year term as governor during the Great Recession. But it had already sparked a social media firestorm, with Twitter users launching the hashtag ""#fangate,"" and a mock Twitter handle devoted solely to Crist's fan -- @CCristFan -- had its moment in the sun. After the debate, the real Crist weighed in. ""#fangate - what a night!"" he tweeted. ""Now, let's get back to the issues that matter to Florida."" But fangate was all some people could think about. Many didn't know what to make of it. Democrats wanted to make sure no one missed it. Tampa Bay Times political writer Adam Smith wanted to know what Scott's advisers could have been thinking. You can watch video of the beginning of the debate here. Update: An earlier version of this story misstated how many jobs Gov. Rick Scott said were lost in Florida while Crist was governor.

"(CNN) -- The number of suspected heat-related deaths reported by health officials across the South and Midwest in the past week reached at least nine Wednesday as temperatures continued to hit triple digits. The health department of Kansas City, Missouri, said Wednesday that the Jackson County Medical Examiner was investigating the city's fourth suspected heat-related death since Friday. In Tennessee, Shelby County Medical Examiner Karen E. Chancellor said a 77-year-old man was found dead Tuesday evening in his Memphis home. His death resulted from natural causes, but heat was ruled to be a contributing factor. In Bartlett, Tennessee, a 67-year-old man collapsed in his yard Friday while mowing the lawn, Chancellor said. He died from chronic illnesses but heat exposure was ruled to be a contributing factor. In Mississippi, a 48-year-old Gulfport man died of heat exposure Monday, according to the county coroner. The man was working on road construction and ""had cramped in the upper extremities,"" said Jackson County, Mississippi, Coroner Vicki Broadus. ""It was his first day on the job as a concrete smoother."" And an 81-year-old Monroe County, Mississippi, woman also died of heat stroke on Saturday, said Monroe County Coroner Alan Gurley. The Alabama Department of Health said one man died of heat exposure last week. No other information was available. The National Weather Service said heat advisories and excessive heat warnings are in effect from the southern and central plains through the lower Mississippi and Tennessee river valleys. The heat index -- what the temperature feels like when combined with the humidity -- is soaring across much of the South. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said that at 10 a.m. Wednesday the index in Memphis, Tennessee, was at 108 degrees; Little Rock, Arkansas, was at 106; and Jackson, Mississippi, was at 104. Morris said the heat indices could peak around 120 degrees later Wednesday. Those at greater risk of heat-related illness include infants and young children, people 65 or older and those who are already ill, especially with heart disease or high blood pressure. Some helpful tips for cooling off from the Jackson County, Missouri, government website: . -- Avoid liquids containing alcohol or caffeine. -- Schedule outdoor activities before noon or in the evening. -- When temperatures reach into the 90s, a cool shower can offer more help than a fan. -- Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, wide-brimmed hats and sunscreen. -- If you must work in the heat, monitor the condition of co-workers and ask them to do the same for you.","Four deaths in Missouri are suspected to be heat related .

"An Ebola outbreak has killed at least 59 people in Guinea, UNICEF said, as the deadly hemorrhagic fever has quickly spread from southern communities in the West African nation. Experts in the country had been unable to identify the disease, whose symptoms -- diarrhea, vomiting and fever -- were first observed last month. Health Minister Remy Lamah said Saturday initial test results confirm the presence of a viral hemorrhagic fever, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body. In a written statement, UNICEF said at least 59 out of 80 people who contracted Ebola have died. At least three of the victims were children. ""In Guinea, a country with a weak medical infrastructure, an outbreak like this can be devastating,"" the UNICEF representative in Guinea, Dr. Mohamed Ag Ayoya, said in the statement. UNICEF has prepositioned supplies and stepped up communication on the ground to sensitize medical staff and local populations on how to avoid contracting the illness, Agoya added. Isolation units . The Guinean Health Ministry warned that the disease is mainly spread from infected people, from objects belonging to ill or dead people, and by the consumption of meat from animals in the bush. So far, most of the cases have been in the forest area of southern Guinea, and health officials say they are offering free treatment for all patients. They've urged people to stay calm, wash their hands and report all cases to authorities. The international medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres announced on Saturday it was reinforcing its medical and logistics teams in Guinea in response to the epidemic. It is also flying in 33 tons of medicines and equipment and setting up isolation units in the three affected areas in the country.

"A federal grand jury investigation has been launched into the West Virginia chemical spill that left 300,000 people unable to use their water supply, CNN learned Tuesday. Sources familiar with the grand jury's activities tell CNN that subpoenas have been issued requiring testimony for what one federal official confirms is a criminal investigation. Meanwhile, an independent water test conducted at CNN's request has found trace levels of the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, or MCHM, remain in both untreated river water and tap water from two homes in Charleston. The results by TestAmerica found the chemical is within the safe level of 1 part per million set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; whether that level is safe is disputed. The test result detected MCHM in the river at .42 parts per billion; residence #1 at 1.5 parts per billion; and residence #2 at 1.6 parts per billion. The amounts in the residences are more than double that found in the river, but still considered a ""trace"" amount and within safe limits as set by the CDC. According to a source familiar with the probe, the grand jury investigation has been under way since just after the spill at the Freedom Industries chemical storage facility on the Elk River in Charleston. The spill came to light in early January. On January 9, more than 7,000 gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol leaked into Charleston's water supply from a Freedom Industries storage tank. The result was a do-not-use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water, some for more than a week. Freedom Industries later told regulators that in addition to the methanol compound that escaped from a ruptured tank, a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers, known as PPH -- was part of the leak. PPH is not believed to pose any new health hazard for the people of Charleston, the CDC said. But the state environmental agency said failing to accurately report the makeup of the leak is a violation of state law. The CDC said little is known about the health hazards of PPH, but it appears to be less toxic than MCHM and made up about 5% of the total volume of the leaking tank. ""Given the small percentage of PPH in the tank and information suggesting similar water solubility as MCHM, it is likely that any amount of PPH currently in the water system would be extremely low,"" it said. ""However, the water system has not been tested for this material."" Elizabeth Scharman, West Virginia's poison control director, told CNN last month that MCHM had not been widely studied. ""We don't know the safety info, how quickly it goes into air, its boiling point,"" Scharman said. The chemical is used to wash coal before it goes to market to reduce ash. Exposure to it can cause vomiting, dizziness, headaches, diarrhea and irritated skin, among other symptoms, the American Association of Poison Control Centers and CNN's previous reporting shows.

"Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has revealed that the inaugural Grand Prix of America in New Jersey will not take place as planned next year, saying the organizers have not raised enough money to fund it. Raced at 19 circuits around the world, F1 generates more than $4bn in revenues annually. The final 2014 calendar will be approved by motorsport's governing body, the FIA, in December but new races need to have financing in place by now to ensure their plans are on track. It was recently revealed that the Grand Prix of America organizers appointed investment bank UBS in June to raise $100 million which is required for the race to go ahead. But Ecclestone told CNN that they have run out of time. ""It's not on the cards for next year,"" he said, adding that the problem is ""they haven't got any money."" However, Grand Prix of America spokesman Alex Howe insisted they expected the race would go ahead. ""We don't comment on financial matters but we are on track for 2014 and will have a statement following the announcement of the official 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship schedule,"" said the spokesman. The race was planned to take place on 3.2 miles of public roads in Port Imperial, a district in the New Jersey towns of West New York and Weehawken. It snakes alongside the Hudson river and would give the race a spectacular backdrop of Manhattan's historic skyline. It has already been postponed once, having been initially scheduled for June this year. The wheels started to come off in August 2012 when Tom Cotter, the president of the race, unexpectedly resigned. Ecclestone put the brakes on it later that month when the organizers missed payment deadlines in their contract with the F1 Group. The Grand Prix of America is the only new F1 race for over 15 years to be dropped from its slot on the calendar. It is also a rare example of a race which was given an F1 contract without having the required funding in place. The most well-known previous example was that of English circuit Donington, which had a 17-year contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010. Instead, the race stayed at Silverstone after Citigroup failed to raise the £135 million ($210 million) required to fund necessary improvements to Donington. Ecclestone said the situation in New Jersey ""is like Donington all over again"" and added that ""it is such a muddle and a mess that it is not worth doing."" He said he originally signed the deal because he believed that the race's promoter --  Leo Hindery Junior, managing partner of private equity fund InterMedia Partners -- would be able to raise the required funds. ""The guy is a multibillionaire and is well-known in New York,"" Ecclestone said. Grand Prix of America spokesman Howe declined to comment when asked for a specific response to Ecclestone's view that the situation in New Jersey was in disarray. Construction on the New Jersey site is well under way, and last year three-time world champion Sebastian Vettel and former F1 driver David Coulthard drove demonstration runs on the circuit for the Red Bull team. However, a lot of the work has focused on the pit building in a new block of garages which was already planned to be built. The plans are close to Ecclestone's heart as he has been trying to hold a Grand Prix in the New York area since the 1980s. He has already provided more support to the New Jersey race organizers than their rivals usually receive. After tearing up the original contract last year, Ecclestone signed a new 15-year agreement in May when the organizers agreed to hire Chris Pook, one of his close confidantes and former chief executive of F1's American motorsport rival IndyCar. Pook works alongside Hindery, who was the first investor in the race. In 2011 Hindery provided the initial $10.3 million investment in race organizing company Port Imperial Racing Associates (PIRA) and obtained an additional $10.1 million loan. In April this year the F1 Group itself provided the company with a credit facility personally guaranteed by Hindery, but it still needs $100 million to get the green light. F1 races require a high-octane level of investment. Tracks typically cost over $250 million to build, but using public roads avoids this expense. The downside is that there is no asset for investment to be secured on, so the budget for street races is usually supplemented with state funding. However, Hindery has confirmed that no public money will be used in the project. The race is part of F1's strategy to break into the lucrative United States market, which is dominated by local rivals NASCAR and IndyCar. Gaining a foothold there is understood to be an important part of revving up the stalled plans to float F1 on the Singapore stock exchange. Stateside television coverage of F1 moved this year to the sports division of NBC, the oldest major broadcast network in the U.S., and the U.S. Grand Prix returned to the calendar in 2012 after a five-year hiatus. It takes place in Austin, Texas, and a further race in California is also under consideration. Losing the New Jersey race could cost F1 more than $375 million across the duration of its contract, as the annual fee has been estimated at $25 million with a small escalation every year. However, the investment opportunity overview produced by UBS in June states that the Grand Prix of America contract gives the organizers ""exclusivity for all F1 races across the northeast corridor"" so the vacant calendar slot could be filled by another new race in the area. Ecclestone is also known to be in discussion about a Grand Prix in Mexico City, which would also plug the gap left by New Jersey. Meanwhile, in other F1 news Friday, world champion Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time in practice for the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa. Vettel recorded a time of one minute 49.331 seconds, just edging Red Bull teammate Mark Webber by 0.059 seconds. Romain Grosjean, in third for Lotus, was almost a second slower in the afternoon session, while Britain's Lewis Hamilton, who won the previous round in Hungary for Mercedes was only 12th quickest. Vettel achieved his time despite missing the last 20 minutes of the session with a rear puncture which left the tire shredded. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso of Spain was quickest in the morning runs for Ferrari in wet conditions. Saturday sees final qualifying for Sunday's race, with three-time defending champion Vettel defending a 38 point lead over Grosjean's teammate Kimi Raikkonen of Finland in the title race.","The inaugural Grand Prix of America will not take place in 2014, says F1 boss .

"While digging through a box that belonged to his father, Robert Ondrovic uncovered a collection of vintage photos that brought him back to the 1964 World's Fair. Armed with a Yashica camera, Ondrovic's father captured everything from family portraits to the modern architecture, which was considered futuristic at the time, said the New York resident. Ondrovic was just 4 years old when his family visited the fair at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. Today, the photos are a throwback to a different era: Many of the women are decked out in dresses (though Ondrovic's mother is sporting mint green capris), a man smokes a cigarette as he strolls through the park, and the Zeppelin-like IBM Pavilion heralds the future of technology.

""Now that I'm out [of the Army], I find it hard because I don't have a set plan day-to-day,"" Jacobson told CNN affiliate WLS.  Browse a map of upcoming job fairs across America » . He was one of hundreds of veterans who attended the Welcome Home celebration in Chicago, Illinois, last week. Officials from Veterans Affairs and the University of Illinois at Chicago were host to the program. Read the WLS report on how some agencies are helping veterans to find work . Though the number of employers was lower than at the inaugural event last year, there were opportunities for job searchers. The Chicago police department was one of the organizations taking applications and résumés. Some service members lost their jobs while overseas. ""There's cases where people are laid off even while they're in Afghanistan. We want employers to help put them into new employment,"" said Dan Grant, director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. South: Virginia woman helps people find work-at-home jobs . Leslie Truex, who calls herself the Pajama Mom, runs a Web site for people who are looking to telecommute. The woman from Fluvanna County, Virginia, has operated workathomesuccess.com for the past 10 years. She said that when she started the site, she added perhaps one job listing a month. Now it is about five posts per day. Truex told WVIR in Charlottesville that even nursing and tutoring positions are available online. She said the money earned from working online can be helpful in this economy. ""Working at home, even if it's just part time, it can fix the gap between what you earn and what your expenses are, because what you earn isn't keeping pace with what we're having to spend to survive,"" she said. Read WVIR's report about the woman who telecommutes for telecommuters . West: Denver ""job clubs"" growing . In the Colorado capital, unemployed workers are gathering in growing number in what are called job clubs. The groups meet at different types of venues, including coffee shops, malls and churches. CNN affiliate KUSA says many clubs have doubled in size in recent months. Many groups include a career counselor who can give tips to job searchers. Several members of one group said the community of people with similar problems and dreams is reassuring. ""This group has been really good for me. It's helped me to really understand who I am and what I can contribute,"" Dr. Nancy Ford told KUSA. Read KUSA's story about the job clubs . Others enjoy the opportunity to network or just the chance to get out of the house. West: Bay Area grocery store hires hundreds . Pittsburg, California, resident Daniel Nungaray and 244 others finally have jobs. Mi Pueblo Food Center, which specializes in Latin American food products, is set to open this week. In Pittsburg, the unemployment rate is more than 14 percent, and more than 3,600 people applied for work at the supermarket. ""It's stressful. It's headaches. [I] can't sleep, can't eat because bills never stop,"" Nungaray told CNN affiliate KGO. A Mi Pueblo spokesman said grocery stores are solid places to work. ""It's a good business. People have to eat to survive, and when you can't afford the restaurants, that's where we come into play,"" said Elijah Walker of Mi Pueblo Foods. Read KGO's story on the Bay Area's new employer . One of the other new employees is Jesus Glaz, who had been out of work for six months. He said of the store, ""It kind of gives everyone a little bit of hope."" Midwest: Churches offer group support for job seekers . Two congregations in the Kansas City, Missouri, area are offering services to the unemployed. At the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, job hunters will find computers they can use, job aides and a book with job listings in it, according to CNN affiliate KSHB. The church also offers a prayer group and a support network. Central United Methodist Church in Kansas City offers similar services, Victoria Kandt said.

"(CNN) -- Lifetime's biopic of the late singer Aaliyah is now without a star. The network confirmed via Twitter on Sunday that Zendaya, the 17-year-old Disney actress and singer tapped to portray Aaliyah in the TV movie, has exited the project. ""We are sad Zendaya will no longer portray Aaliyah,"" Lifetime said. ""Production is currently on hold."" It's an abrupt change for the film, as Zendaya, whose full name is Zendaya Coleman, was just announced as the biopic's lead on June 16. The young star, known for her role on Disney's ""Shake It Up!"" and Season 16 of ""Dancing With the Stars,"" didn't release an official comment on her departure but did acknowledge the casting shakeup on Twitter by quoting a source's statement to E! News. ""Aaliyah has always been an inspiration to Zendaya,"" the source told E!. ""She was honored to portray her and pay tribute to her. If she is going to do it, she wants to do it right."" Aaliyah, born Aaliyah Dana Haughton, was killed in a 2001 plane crash at the age of 22. Her legacy as an R&B/pop singer and actress has been immense, to the point that even using her voice in a song can make fans bristle. Zendaya's casting was similarly controversial, with fans being divided over whether the burgeoning talent should take on the role. With news that she's now out of the project, some are curious if the casting criticism played a role in her departure. Yet from the beginning, the teen star made it clear that Aaliyah has been a lifelong inspiration for her, and she told MTV News on the BET Awards red carpet that she wasn't sure the biopic would do justice to her idol. ""I just felt the project wasn't 100% there,"" she told MTV, saying that the production felt ""a little rushed."" Because ""she's someone I admire and I love so much, it can't be done halfway, or not to the standards I think it should be done at, so I just decided not to do it. ""By all means, when the right project comes along and it's done the right way, I'll be the first person ready to play Aaliyah, but this wasn't the right one for me. I've been into Aaliyah since I was little, so there wasn't too much getting into character. I always pretend I'm her anyway.""","Zendaya Coleman has left Lifetime's Aaliyah biopic .

"(CNN) -- A woman accused of helping kidnap Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart from her bed in 2002 apologized to the young woman Tuesday as she pleaded guilty to federal charges. ""I'm greatly humbled as I realize how much Elizabeth Smart has been victimized and the role I played in it,"" Wanda Eileen Barzee said during a court hearing Tuesday. ""I'm so sorry, Elizabeth, for all the pain and suffering I have caused you and your family,"" she said, according to a court transcript. ""It is my hope that you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me one day."" Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in federal court to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor, and she said she will plead guilty in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping. She also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in the state and federal cases against her husband, Brian David Mitchell, said Brett Tolman, the U.S. attorney for Utah. Read the plea agreement . The couple is accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, Utah, in the company of Barzee and Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home. Smart was not in court Tuesday to hear the apology, but her father, Ed Smart, said afterward, ""I certainly believe that Wanda was a victim to a point. But she chose to be that victim. ... I think that was her choice."" Asked about Barzee's apology, Ed Smart said, ""I just hope that it was sincere and that she will continue on that track and prove that through the rest of Brian Mitchell's trial, or whatever happens. ... I felt it was sincere. I hope it was sincere."" In exchange for Barzee's cooperation in the prosecution of Mitchell, authorities have recommended a sentence of 15 years in prison. ""We believe a sentence of 15 years is just and fair under the circumstances,"" Tolman said. The plea agreement depends on Barzee's cooperation in the case against Mitchell, 56, in state and federal courts, Tolman said. ""We will ask that her sentencing date be continued to allow for her continued cooperation with the government. If Ms. Barzee fails to fully cooperate, we will move to withdraw the plea agreement."" Sentencing was set for May 19, but a sentence will not be imposed until Barzee's cooperation against Mitchell is complete, said Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office. In court, Barzee admitted that she and Mitchell planned Smart's kidnapping and that she encouraged him to carry it out. When he returned to the couple's outdoor camp with the girl, ""I aided and abetted Mitchell in the confinement, control and sexual assault of Elizabeth Smart,"" according to the plea agreement. Barzee said she also assisted in transporting Smart to California from Utah in October 2002 and back to Utah in March 2003 ""with the intent that she engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense,"" according to the agreement. ""Wanda is a person who is a different person than the person who was arrested,"" defense attorney Scott Williams said after the hearing. ""The person she is now is someone who wants to accept responsibility, cooperate."" Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as Mitchell's. After years of being declared incompetent, she recently was declared competent to stand trial, according to the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper. A state court had ruled that she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to proceed with bringing a case against the couple, the Tribune said. ""Today's agreement means that Elizabeth Smart will not have to testify at trial against Ms. Barzee,"" Tolman said. ""It is our belief that this outcome will begin to bring long-awaited closure to Elizabeth and her family."" At a competency hearing for Mitchell last month, Smart, now 21, testified that she had been held captive in Utah and California. Just after her abduction, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her, she said. During the nine months of her captivity, Smart testified, no 24-hour period passed without her being raped by Mitchell. Mitchell's competency hearing is set to continue November 30. His attorneys asked that it be delayed further, but U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball denied their motion Monday. Smart, a student at Brigham Young University and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, testified in October because she was set to leave on a mission, something typical for young Mormon men that is becoming more common for women as well.

"The Michael Jackson wrongful death trial, which promises dramatic revelations and legal fireworks, begins in a small Los Angeles courtroom with opening statements Monday. Jurors earning $15 a day will listen to several months of testimony before deciding whether one of the world's largest entertainment companies should pay Jackson's mother and three children billions of dollars for its liability in the pop icon's death. Famous Jackson family members, including Janet, will sit just a few feet from the jury as Michael's oldest son and daughter describe their father's last days. But they will also endure weeks of tedious testimony from medical and financial experts offering opinions about the singer's health, addiction and career. Later in the trial, jurors will Michael's oldest son and daughter describe their father's last days.  But they will also endure weeks of tedious testimony from medical and financial experts offering opinions about the singer's health, addiction and career. Only 16 journalists and a few members of the public will be allowed inside the courtroom because many of its 45 seats are reserved for parties involved in the trial, including the Jackson family.  Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos denied CNN's request to televise the trial. Pretrial hearings have featured angry and personal exchanges between lawyers for the two sides, made more intense by the intimacy of the tiny courtroom. Jurors chosen to decide Michael Jackson wrongful death case . The central issue . The central issue is simple: Did AEG Live, the company promoting Jackson's comeback concerts in 2009, hire or supervise Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's June 25, 2009, death? Jackson died two weeks before his ""This Is It"" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London.  The coroner ruled Jackson died from a fatal combination of sedatives and propofol, a surgical anesthetic that Murray told investigators he used to put Jackson to sleep almost every night in the month before his death. The Jacksons will argue that AEG executives knew about the star's weakened health and his past use of dangerous drugs while on tour.  They're liable in his death because they pressured Jackson and the doctor to meet their ambitious schedule to prepare for the London shows despite that knowledge, their lawyers contend. A cornerstone of their case is an e-mail AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware wrote 11 days before Jackson's death. The e-mail to show director Kenny Ortega addressed concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before: ""We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."" Jackson lawyers argue the e-mail is evidence that AEG Live used Murray's fear of losing his lucrative job as Jackson's personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health. AEG will defend itself by arguing that Jackson was responsible for his own demise, that he chose Murray to be his full-time doctor and that his drug addiction led him to a series of fatal choices.  Murray was never an AEG employee but rather was chosen and paid by Jackson for nearly four years until Jackson died, AEG lawyers contend. ""I don't know how you can't look to Mr. Jackson's responsibility there,"" AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam told CNN. ""He was a grown man."" Child molestation accusations against Jackson, for which he was acquitted after a trial, are relevant because they ""resulted in an incredible increase in his drug intake,"" Putnam said. ""Mr. Jackson is a person who was known to doctor shop,"" Putnam said. ""He was known to be someone who would tell one doctor one thing and another doctor something else."" When Palazuelos ruled in February that case warranted a jury trial, she found there was evidence to support the Jacksons' claim that AEG Live executives could have foreseen that Murray would use dangerous drugs in treating the singer. Elvis' ghost haunts Michael Jackson death trial . Jackson's family seeks billions . Just before Monday's session began, the judge issued a series of rulings which allow Jackson expert witnesses to testify, although limited some of their opinions. The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009.  Jackson lawyers denied media reports that they were seeking $40 billion in damages if AEG Live is found liable, but it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson's income potential. AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that was up for sale recently with an $8 billion asking price. Palazuelos reversed an earlier tentative decision Monday that would have limited the amount of damages the Jackson's could argued AEG should pay if found liable in the singer's death.  The decision raises the potential damages by about $1 billion, bringing it to as much as $5 billion. One of the Jacksons' experts, certified public accountant Arthur Erk, estimated that Michael Jackson could have earned $1.4 billion by taking his ""This Is It"" tour around the world for 260 shows.  AEG executives discussed extending the tour beyond the 50 shows scheduled for London, Jackson lawyers said. Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders, in arguing for the judge to allow Erk's testimony, said when ""This Is It"" tickets went on sale in March 2009, there was the ""highest demand to see anyone in the history of the world.  No one has ever come close."" ""There was so much demand, they filled 2 million seats in hours,"" Sanders said, quoting an e-mail from AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips sent to AEG's owner. ""We would have had to do 100-plus shows to fill the demand"" in London, he said Phillips wrote.  Jackson could have packed the Tokyo Dome several times in a world tour, he said. But AEG lawyer Sabrina Strong called it ""very speculative"" that Jackson would have even finished the 50 London shows before dying. AEG lawyers argued that Jackson didn't perform 260 shows and make that much money even in his prime.  ""He never came anywhere close to that,"" Strong said.  ""No one other than Cher has ever done that."" Erk also calculated Jackson would have followed with four more world tours before he turned 65. Palazuelos weighed in during a hearing on Thursday, noting that the Rolling Stones are still touring into their 70s. The Jacksons will also try to convince jurors that he would have made a fortune off of a long series of Las Vegas shows, endorsements, a clothing line and movies. Strong argued that Jackson had a history of failed projects and missed opportunities, calling Erk's projections ""a hope, a dream, and not a basis for damages."" Erk, under the new ruling, will be able to tell jurors about the ""loss of earning capacity"" suffered by the family because of Jackson's death.  This means the jury can consider how the Jackson argument that he could have earned millions with a clothing line, endorsements and movies.  The expert's estimate that Jackson would have completed five world tours before he was 65, if he had lived, can also be considered. AEG can argue, however, that Jackson's past failures diminished the potential earnings. None of the Jackson experts can offer an opinion on the question of if Dr. Conrad Murray was hired by AEG. If AEG is found liable, the company's lawyers want the judge to tell the jury to reduce any damages by the amount Jackson's estate earned from the documentary made from video the company shot of his rehearsals.  ""If there is a benefit in it, then that is deducted from a loss,"" Strong said. Jackson lawyer Brian Panish compared giving AEG credit for the ""This Is It"" profits to being ""like you murdered someone, wrote a book about them and gave them the money."" Panish, who will deliver the Jacksons' opening statement Monday morning, said he was not sure who his first witness will be Tuesday morning.  He did tell the court he will show several videos of the depositions given by AEG's top executives in the first week. Panish and AEG's Putnam will each have two and a half hours to describe their cases to the jury in opening statements starting at 10 a.m. Monday. The witness lists include many members of the Jackson family, including matriarch Katherine Jackson.  Other celebrity witnesses on the list are Sharon Osbourne, Quincy Jones, Spike Lee, Ray Parker Jr., Lisa Marie Presley, Diana Ross and Lou Ferrigno.

"Along a winding Chinese mountain road dotted with inns and restaurants is Jinan Orphanage, a place of refuge and site for troubled parents to dump unwanted children. The government-run orphanage in eastern China opened its first baby hatch on June 1, International Children's Day, as a symbolic step to show the country's commitment to improving child welfare. However, it since proved so popular that authorities have had to introduce new rules to limit the number of babies and children being abandoned. In just 11 days, 106 children, all with disabilities or medical conditions, were dropped off at the Jinan facility, according to local state media. That is more than the 85 orphans the city accepted the entire previous year. In one reported case, a six-year-old girl was pushed out of a car in front of the hatch. In her pocket was $430 and a piece of paper with her birth date and time written on it, according to state media. Waiting outside the hatch . CNN waited outside the hatch on a Tuesday afternoon to see how often it was being used. The hatch is a small, detached room at the side of the orphanage, equipped with a crib, incubator and air conditioning. Once the child's guardian leaves the hatch, the door locks and an alarm sounds, alerting staff to the anonymous drop. In the first of two attempted drops, two men walked up to the hatch and started taking photos of a sign with detailed instructions on how to drop off a baby. The instructions said that parents should leave a date of birth, as well as details of any medical conditions the child may have. It also asked people not to take any equipment from the hatch. Half an hour later, the same two men pulled up in a silver hatchback with a woman in the back. Orphanage workers and guards scurried over to the car. The woman told them her baby had a congenital heart disease and they had no money to treat her. The workers advised the woman to take her baby to the city hospital, which provides free medical services. If she could not be treated there, then she could bring the baby back, they said. The men quickly got back into the car drove away. The second drop, only one hour later, involved a 21-year-old man from Sichuan, a province in southwestern China, who walked up the busy road, cradling a baby and a bag of belongings. As the man went to the hatch, orphanage staff and guards stood in his way, preventing him from opening the door. He walked back defeated, silent and stony-faced. When CNN caught up to him, he broke down in tears, sobbing as he held his baby closer to his chest. His son, dressed in clean clothes and a bonnet, was sleeping. The young man said his baby had water on the brain. ""I just want to leave him there because with the state at least he has hope. We have no money. We've spent everything,"" he said as he wept. The man walked back about a half a mile down the road where his uncle had parked after driving him to the hatch. When asked why the orphanage would not accept the baby, the staff replied, ""He's not allowed. We have regulations. We only accept people from this city."" The orphanage staff told the father to travel back to his hometown in Sichuan -- more than 1,000 miles away on the other side of the country -- to drop off his baby. New rules imposed . The locals-only rule was applied soon after the hatch opened to try to limit numbers. Now, babies must also be less than one year old, and can only be dropped off between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. A handful of police, orphanage workers and volunteers stand guard at the hatch 24 hours a day, making it increasingly difficult for any parent to abandon a child anonymously. The country is divided on the topic of hatches, with many believing that the government is condoning child abandonment and even encouraging it by opening hatches. Outside the hatch are prominently placed slogans condemning child abandonment, a reminder from the government that the practice is technically illegal, even though the provision of baby hatches amounts to turning a blind eye to that. History of China's hatches . The first pilot hatch was introduced in 2011. Now there are 32 across the country, according to the official Xinhua news agency. ""We had to find a more humane way to take in abandoned babies,"" said Dr. Wang Zhenyao, one of the founders for China's child welfare policy and a retired Ministry of Civil Affairs official. ""In reality, children were being thrown into trash cans, on the side of roads, in front of hospitals, or in front of the Ministry of Civil Affairs so we had to standardize it and regulate it."" According to UNICEF, there were around 712,000 orphans in China in 2010, but child welfare groups believe that the number could be in the millions if you account for children in non-government orphanages and foster homes. Unlike in the 1980s and 90s, when most abandoned babies were girls, now most suffer from a range of disabilities and medical conditions, such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, congenital heart disease, club feet and cleft lips. Changing attitudes, improving welfare . Wang said baby hatches were a step in the right direction for the country, but acknowledged that changing mindsets and improving social welfare would pose a challenge in the years to come. ""If you don't give up your child, then nobody will help you,"" Wang told CNN. ""But once you abandon your child, the government must take over."" ""This is not a good solution. Instead the government should step forward to subsidize parents and enable them to take care of their children. This is a simple truth that is hard to explain to society."" According to Wang, China has only 10,000 social workers handling 100,000 abandoned children, a ratio of one social worker to ten orphans. In more developed nations, the ratio is normally two social welfare workers to every orphaned child, he said. The Ministry of Civil Affairs seems to have recognized the problem and has set an ambitious target of increasing the number of social welfare workers to two million by 2015. Until then, it's likely the hatches will continue to be used by parents too poor or too overwhelmed to keep their children at home. China's 'baby hatch' numbers set to increase .

"So, you got a drone for ChrismaHanuKwanzakah, huh? You could be among thousands -- potentially tens of thousands -- of new drone users after this holiday season, according to industry leaders. Once you've unpacked your high-tech gift, you should probably read up on the Federal Aviation Association's guidelines to make sure you avoid nearly colliding with a Boeing 747 or slicing someone's face at a TGI Friday's. Yes, both have happened. Three drone associations partnered with the FAA this month to spread the word about the guidelines to safely operate drones -- the Know Before You Fly campaign. But since we both know there's a good chance you could find a way to get into your own kind of trouble, we've boiled down the must-knows right here: . 1. Don't use your camera-equipped drone to get a closer look at airplanes in mid-air. It's illegal for recreational drones to be flown higher than 400 feet or within 5 miles of an airport. The FAA has already recorded 25 incidents when small drones got too close for comfort with manned aircrafts. Pilots have also reported unmanned aerial vehicles, or UVAs, several thousands of feet in the air, sometimes coming within just a few dozen feet of their aircraft, according to FAA data. And drones could do serious damage. Remember when a plane was forced to miraculously land on the Hudson River after hitting at least one bird? Now, replace that bird with a drone. 2. Headed to the game? Leave the drone at home. You might be tempted to send your quadcopter above the field to get an aerial view, but remember there's always the Jumbotron. The FAA advises drone pilots to keep their crafts away from large crowds and out of stadiums and racetracks. The blades on some drones can seriously injure, like when a mistletoe marketing gimmick that involved a drone inside a TGI Friday's went wrong, cutting a photographer. 3. And you definitely want to keep your drone away from power lines. The FAA warns users to keep their drones away from ""power stations, water treatment facilities, correctional facilities, heavily traveled roadways, government facilities, etc."" Earlier this month an Australian man literally crashed a nine-hour police operation, almost hitting one of the police officers, after his drone got tangled in power lines, CNET reported. Anyway, that shouldn't happen as long as you keep your drone within your line of sight at all times, another guideline for drone use. 4. Making money off your drone without a permit -- illegal. The FAA needs to OK the commercial use of any drone, whether that's selling photos or videos, providing security or making a movie using a UAV. The FAA even fined one man $10,000 for using a drone to shoot a promotional video. 5. Don't be a creep. The Academy of Model Aeronautics, one of three drone groups collaborating with the FAA, advises users not to use drones to photograph people secretly or spy on them. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, is already worried enough about the government using drones to invade people's privacy without having to worry about civilian and commercial drones peering into people's windows.","A drone is not an excuse to get up close and personal with an airplane .
And the FAA doesn't want you taking it to stadiums or bringing it close to power lines either .
You need to get authorization from the FAA to make money off your drone .
And, please, don't be a creep ."
"Some Dominicans who have never traveled outside of their country of birth could suddenly find themselves outsiders. The citizenship of tens of thousands of Dominicans of Haitian descent may be stripped, the result of a court ruling that affects those who were born to parents who were in the country illegally. Dominicans of Haitian descent have long faced inequalities, but the enforcement of the last month's ruling will take social exclusion to an extreme. The question of how to integrate immigrants into the national fabric and how to treat them is a familiar debate. In the Dominican Republic, as in the United States, for instance, children of undocumented parents are considered citizens if they were born in the country. But while there have been efforts in the United States to extend opportunities to even more children of immigrants, the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic has taken a very different approach. The court ruled that even those who were born in Dominican territory, if their parents were in the country illegally, should not have citizenship. ""This is absurd. How are they going to take away a document that I already have, that is mine, and give me one as a foreigner when I have never been outside of the country?"" said Ana Maria Belique, a representative of a movement to protect the rights of those affected. Already, since 2007, a law blocked many Dominicans of Haitian descent from acquiring copies of their birth certificates or national identification cards. One of those blocked from getting a national ID card was 29-year-old Juliana Dequis Pierre, who then took her fight to the courts. The high court affirmed that Dequis Pierre did not meet the criteria for citizenship, even though she had been born in the country. The court went further, asking authorities to identify similar cases stretching back to 1929. The U.N. Refugee Agency expressed concern, stating that, ""Should this process indeed be carried out without the necessary safeguards, three generations of Dominicans of Haitian descent could become stateless."" The country's National Migration Council on Wednesday met with representatives of various government ministries and agencies to plan how the court ruling will be enacted. The government says that no one who has their citizenship stripped will be deported, and that a system to give them legal status with a path to citizenship will be put in place. That path to citizenship will include a two-year wait to begin the process. ""The Dominican government reiterates its commitment to the implementation of an immigration policy that is clear and transparent, in line with the Constitution and Dominican laws while respecting human rights and international accords,"" government spokesman Roberto Rodriguez Marchena said. The government's assurances, however, have not ameliorated the fears of Dominicans of Haitian descent, who are protesting and calling for support at home and abroad. ""This measure affects us so much that we can't do anything,"" said Elena Lorac, the daughter of Haitian immigrants. ""This brings consequences such as not being able to work, not being able to study, to not realize the dreams that we have to get ahead in life."" Critics point out the complications that are sure to arise: What about mixed-status families? How can it be that many who cast votes that affected election outcomes are losing that right? What about all the taxes they paid as citizens? ""We are not talking about immigrants, but fellow Dominicans,"" said the Rev.

"Elma Dieppa wonders if her cousin Helen Casillas would still be alive today if she had been more aware of how her weight contributed to her diabetes. ""She refused to take care of herself by not watching what she ate or exercising,"" Dieppa wrote in a blog post honoring the woman she describes as the ""life of the party"" -- funny, beautiful and genuine. Casillas died of a heart attack at age 44. Although Casillas lived with diabetes for years and worked in the medical field, her perception of her own disease was skewed, Dieppa said. Casillas told her cousin that the doctor wanted to take an aggressive approach to her weight loss, but Casillas didn't believe she was obese. ""This is the problem within the Hispanic community,"" Dieppa wrote on the blog. ""We love our curves, but the line between beautiful and deadly curves is blurred."" In a 2010 study, Abbey Berenson and her colleagues surveyed 1,076 Hispanic women who went to public health clinics in Texas about their weight. The researchers found about 25% of the overweight Hispanic women perceived their weight as ""normal,"" while only 15% of non-Latino white women did. ""Hispanic and African-American women were more likely to consider their weight normal when in fact they were overweight,"" said Berenson, a professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Latinos overall are also less likely to lose weight and ""more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease risk factors and other obesity related diseases,"" the study authors wrote. For example, diabetes affects close to 25.8 million people in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- about 8.3% of the general population. But the debilitating disease disproportionately affects Hispanics, almost double those of non-Latino whites, according to the American Diabetes Association. Unfortunately, diabetes isn't the only disease causing concern in the Latino community. Hispanics are also disproportionately affected by obesity and stroke, according to Dr. Helen Troncoso, who serves as a health and wellness consultant in New York. Although stroke rates in the general population have declined dramatically over the last decade, Latinos are still more likely to experience a stroke compared to other ethnic groups. Particularly among Mexican-Americans -- the largest subgroup of Hispanics in the United States --  stroke is the leading cause of disability and third leading cause of death. Overall, Mexican-Americans suffer 34% more from this disease than non-Hispanic whites, according to a 2013 study published in the Annals of Neurology journal. Experts say these health disparities can be attributed to many causes, but chief among them is a lack of access to quality health care. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates 1 out of every 3 Hispanics doesn't have health insurance. About half of whites are covered through an employer-sponsored health plan, compared to 28% of Hispanics, according to a Gallup Poll. ""Right now, many Latinos are unable to manage the costs for preventative care,"" Troncoso said, ""and will often develop secondary conditions that can be even more serious because they could not manage their chronic conditions with proper treatment."" Once the Affordable Care Act goes into effect on January 1, it should ease the stress for many Hispanics who have lower-paying jobs that don't offer health insurance. Cultural factors also play a role in putting the Hispanic community at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Latinos are raised to be self-reliant, which may be the reason 42% of them say they've had ""zero visits"" to a medical provider. It was the ethnic group least likely to use prescription medicine in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""But with some lifestyle adjustments, like switching to a healthier diet and getting regular exercise, Latinos can drastically change their health issues,"" Troncoso said. At their core, authentic Latino dishes include fresh fruits, herbs and beans, all of which are healthy. But with immigration and acculturation to the United States often comes a change in eating behaviors, such as cooking fewer meals at home, eating larger portions, preparing foods differently, and buying more cheap and convenient fast foods loaded with sodium, fat and sugar. Because food and family play such an important role in the Latino community, organizations like the National Council for La Raza are focusing their efforts on implementing more healthy shopping programs like the ""Comprando Rico y Sano"" (Buying Delicious and Healthy) to help Hispanics make healthier and more economical choices when grocery shopping. ""Familism is very strong in the Latino culture,"" said Manuela McDonough, program manager for the Institute for Hispanic Health at the National Council of La Raza. ""The act of sitting down at the dinner table is more important than the actual food."" Many Latino parents feel guilty about putting their own health needs above those of their families, according to the American Diabetes Association. They feel their time and money could be better spent than using it for preventive care. In an effort to break down this mindset, the diabetes association has a Latino Initiatives health campaign called Por tu familia — or ""for your family"" -- encouraging Latinos to stay healthy if they want to be there for their families. While these efforts to help educate Latinos about lifestyle changes will help, Dr. Joel Zonszein, director of the Clinical Diabetes Center at Montefiore Medical Center, said the health care system also needs to change so physicians don't struggle to get their patients the treatments they deserve. ""For each patient I see, I have to spend at least 20 minutes on the phone with insurance companies begging them to approve the proper diabetes medication for my patients, and I don't get reimbursed for that time,"" said Zonszein. ""Unfortunately, Obamacare will not improve this condition."" While the Affordable Care Act may leave something to be desired from physicians, Dieppa hopes that with widespread access to health care, Latinos around the country will better educate themselves about their health and heed the warnings of their doctors. Because knowing that Helen Casillas' death could have been prevented hurts more than anything else.","Hispanic population disproportionately affected by cardiovascular diseases .

"Under court order, the Justice Department turned over nearly 65,000 pages of documents Monday night pertaining to the botched Fast and Furious gun operation. For years, these documents have been at the center of a dispute between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans, who demanded the documents back in 2011 as part of the investigation into the case. The documents were previously withheld under the administration's claim of executive privilege. They portray the behind-the-scenes effort at the Justice Department to respond to the beginnings of the scandal over a flawed operation run by agents from Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and prosecutors in the Phoenix U.S. Attorney's Office. Suspected gun traffickers were allowed to buy thousands of weapons, many of which turned up at violent drug cartel crime scenes in the United States and Mexico. The operation was exposed when a U.S. border agent was killed in a shootout near the Arizona-Mexico border and two firearms tied to Fast and Furious suspects were recovered at the scene. Want to know more about Fast and Furious? Get the fast facts . At first, the Justice Department incorrectly said that the ATF always tried to stop weapons from being trafficked. After months of revelations from whistleblowers, the Justice Department acknowledged the scope of Fast and Furious, and the scandal badly damaged Attorney General Eric Holder's standing. He became the first sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee, said the documents turned over don't satisfy a lawsuit he spearheaded seeking materials. Issa said in a statement: ""When Eric Holder wants to know why he was the first Attorney General held in criminal contempt of Congress, he can read the judge's order that compelled the production of 64,280 pages that he and President Obama illegitimately and illegally withheld from Congress. ""Since these pages still do not represent the entire universe of the documents the House of Representatives is seeking related to the Justice Department's cover-up of the botched gun-walking scandal that contributed to the death of a Border Patrol agent, our court case will continue. ""I am deeply concerned that some redactions to these documents may still be inappropriate and contrary to the judge's order in the case. This production is nonetheless a victory for the legislative branch, a victory for transparency, and a victory for efforts to check executive branch power. ""As the production is extensive and may contain sensitive information, our investigative staff will be carefully examining the documents."" The documents weren't publicly released. But CNN reviewed a handful of the documents, which portray Holder frustrated as he tries to manage a controversy spiraling out of his control. In one April 2011 email exchange, he cautions aides against moving too forcefully to help block an Issa subpoena of a gun dealer who was helping law enforcement in an investigation. Holder lashed out: ""Issa and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of Mexicans were being killed with guns from our country. All they want to do -- in reality -- is cripple ATF and suck up to the gun lobby. Politics at its worst."" The remark was a harbinger of a worsening relationship between Holder and Issa, which became public in bitter confrontations during congressional hearings. Brian Fallon, a Justice Department spokesman, said, ""We have long been willing to provide many of these materials voluntarily in order to resolve this matter outside of court, and believe that producing them now should bring us a big step closer to concluding this litigation once and for all."" The official said the documents provided Monday don't contradict what the Justice Department has said about the Fast and Furious operation and support an inspector general's finding that Holder didn't know about Fast and Furious before the controversy erupted.","Justice Department turned over nearly 65,000 pages of documents on Fast and Furious .

"These days, Marchelle Roberts is a confident 22-year-old who smiles easily and talks excitedly about her plans for the future. But the rising senior at Philadelphia's Temple University had to travel a long and difficult road to get to where she is today. Roberts was taken away from her parents when she was 7 years old. She still remembers vividly the day that long journey began, when a woman she had never seen before and hasn't seen since came in a car to get her and her brother Shawn, who was 3 or 4 years old. ""It was pretty scary for me,"" Roberts said. ""My brother and I were in the back with a bag full of both of our belongings. My biological mother got out of the car and the lady kept driving, and she drove to someone else's house and she told us we'd be staying there, and she left. And so nobody really explained to me what foster care was, or what being taken away from your parents meant, or how long it would be for or why it happened."" Roberts spent five years in foster care in Camden, New Jersey, shuttling from one family to the next. During that time, Roberts said, she suffered sexual abuse and her brother suffered emotional abuse. ""If it wasn't me being abused then it was me seeing my brother being abused, which was more difficult for me,"" she said. ""I felt strong enough to endure the abuse as long as my brother didn't have to go through it, and so I would always try to be there, like after school. I would try to make sure I got home and was just there with my brother to make sure he was OK."" She was eventually removed from that situation and ended up with Lisa Roberts, who later adopted her, adding to a growing family of adopted children. But during the process she and her brother were separated. Marchelle hasn't seen Shawn in 12 years. CNN Heroes: Breaking down barriers so foster kids can find families . Now she is one of 15 former foster children participating in the Foster Youth Internship program run by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. The program aims to give former foster children an opportunity to help shape public policy on child welfare issues. Interns spend the summer working in the offices of members of Congress from both parties. At the end of the program, they make a presentation to the entire Congress with recommendations on how to improve the foster care system. The interns live in a college dormitory and have weekly dinners to talk about their experiences on the Hill and growing up in the system. They also get a stipend for a business wardrobe and informal career counseling from the Sara Start Fund for Foster Youth, an organization that works with CCAI to help them get a start on their professional lives. The program is competitive, about 250 young people apply each year and applicants must have completed at least one semester of college. CCAI Executive Director Kathleen Strottman said the young people who are accepted are the cream of the crop. Former interns have gone on to clerkships and to various positions in state government. Nearly half have entered careers in social service. ""We find that the youth who have survived foster care are, by their nature, more problem solvers,"" Strottman said. ""So what better people to bring to bear on a problem that really needs to be solved?"" Pushing for change . Roberts survived that system and says there's a lot she wants to see changed. She wants to create a one-stop online clearinghouse laying out the resources available to foster youth and former foster youth all across the country, and she wants states to do more to keep siblings together in foster care. ""It's not just keeping them together, but making sure that they're in stable environments,"" she said. ""In the system, youth are taken away from -- most of the times -- their biological parents because they're suffering from some kind abuse or something like that, and so I don't think that being placed into a home where you suffer the same things solves much."" She has been interning in the office of Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, who had her own encounter with an orphan at a young age and has been an advocate for foster children and orphans since she was first elected to office. ""When I was a child, a young teenager, I literally found a little 9-year-old sleeping in a park and it was just horrifying to me that a child would be alone sleeping anywhere, let alone sleeping in a park,"" Landrieu said during an interview in her Capitol Hill office. ""I brought him home and that was my beginning of understanding about a child that was homeless, living with a grandmother incapable of raising him. And then, of course, he went through the foster care system, and that's when I learned how broken it was."" Landrieu, who helped create the internship program 10 years ago, said a tax credit to help families adopt and a program that helps provide education, and training vouchers to foster youth as they transition out of the system, have helped, but more needs to be done to improve the system. ""The foster care interns that come to Washington learn a lot about the system here and how it affects their lives and the lives of children in foster care all over America, which are about 500,000,"" Landrieu said. ""But most importantly, it educates members of Congress and their staffs about what really happens in our foster care system, and we think out of this great changes for the better will occur."" Roberts is still searching for her younger brother, who she believes would be 17 or 18 years old now. ""I worry constantly,"" she said. ""I was able to be adopted and I had a lovely life and all these siblings that love me, I have a mom who loves me, you know I'm just living a great life right now. And I don't know if his situation was as blessed as mine was. ""And then there's also -- he could have been bouncing around from foster home to foster home and I wasn't. He could have been adopted and it's possible his adoptive family didn't want him to have contact with his biological family, and I think about those things all the time."" When she graduates in the winter, Roberts plans to pursue a career in broadcast journalism -- a field she loves and that she hopes might one day help Shawn find her. For now, she feels fortunate to have had what she calls a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spend a summer in the halls of Congress and to share her story. ""There are so many things I want people to know,"" she said. ""One of the main things that I want people to know is that foster youth count.""","Marchelle Roberts was taken away from her parents when she was 7 .

"Nearly a decade ago, radio shock-jock Don Imus uttered these words about the women's basketball team at Rutgers University: ""Those are some nappy-headed hos."" Within one week of saying that, he was out of a job. That's the way it's supposed to work. Last week, it was revealed that Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling said even more heinous words about blacks and Latinos. The NBA said it has confirmed that it was Sterling's voice talking to his girlfriend: ""Yeah, it bothers me a lot...that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?"" And now we see, within days of that revelation, he has been banned from basketball. For life. That's the way it's supposed to work. In both cases, it was industry and public outrage, coupled with significant pressure from sponsors and advertisers, that led to the swift action, ripping from both of these men their public platforms and access to continued revenue. In the case of Don Imus, it was the outrage of many Americans, along with the intense feelings of journalists -- black and white -- within NBC, CBS and the profession at large. TV personalities like Al Roker, CBS board member Bruce S. Gordon and others both publicly and privately called upon the leadership at NBC (who carried his morning talk show on MSNBC) and CBS, (who carried his radio show) to remove him from the air. At the time, I was the president of the National Association of Black Journalists and was among the first to call for Imus to be fired. But it was also pressure from the public and activists such as the Rev. Al Sharpton, who worked behind the scenes to encourage advertisers such a Snapple, Sarah Lee, Proctor & Gamble and American Express to pull their advertising from the shows. And it worked. This week, we saw nearly the same thing happen in the Sterling case. It was the unified outrage of current and former professional basketball players in the NBA, the outcry from fans and the public, the relentless coverage from the media, and then the swift action by more than a dozen advertisers -- Adidas, Sprint, State Farm, Amtrak, CarMax, Kia Motors, Virgin America, to name a few -- that led to the announcement Tuesday by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver that Sterling had to go. As a journalist, I am the fiercest champion of the First Amendment and our right to free speech. In fact, one would hope that Sterling would continue to exercise his right to free speech and speak out directly and publicly about his comments. We'd offer him this space or an opportunity on CNN to do just that. But we learned from Imus, and again with Sterling, that just because you have the right to free speech doesn't mean you have the right to access a commercial platform or to earn millions of dollars airing that speech. Those are both privileges that must be earned, respected and, if abused, that can be taken away. By the customer: the American people. We live in a free society, one where the ultimate arbiters of decency and honor are the marketplace and the public. When you cross that line, the marketplace will speak. That's the way it's supposed to work. In the noise of reality TV, 24-hour news, partisan talk radio and dancing cats on the Internet, there are plenty of examples where the popular overwhelms the good. But occasionally, the system governed by the customer actually delivers the right outcome. Now, in both cases, these men will be just fine. After a few months of soul-searching and apologies, Don Imus went on to land another TV and radio show, this time on FOX Business Network. At 73, he is still worth millions of dollars, and has led a post-Rutgers life largely free of drama. And Donald Sterling, 80, will be just fine, too. The team he bought in 1981 for $12.5 million is now worth well over $575 million, according to Forbes. And his net worth has been reported at more than $1.9 billion. So, even after being slapped with a $2.5 million fine -- the maximum Silver could hit him with under NBA ownership rules -- Sterling's net worth will still be about $1.8975  billion. He's going to be alright. Nevertheless, the real winners here are the players, the fans, the owners (when they vote Sterling out), and the process. In a free, fair and capitalistic democracy, where the decency of the American voice still has some power, this is exactly how it is supposed to work.

"Think hotels are deliberately blocking your personal Wi-Fi networks so you'll buy theirs? No, it's not just a conspiracy theory. It turns out the federal government is concerned about it, too. Marriott has agreed to pay a $600,000 fine after the Federal Communications Commission found the company blocked consumer Wi-Fi networks last year during an event at a hotel and conference center in Nashville. At the same time, Marriott was charging exhibitors and others as much as $1,000 per device to access the hotel's wireless network, the FCC announced Friday. ""Consumers who purchase cellular data plans should be able to use them without fear that their personal Internet connection will be blocked by their hotel or conference center,"" FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc said in a statement. Federal law prohibits people from using a device that interferes with cellular, GPS or wireless networks. It's the first time the FCC has investigated a hotel property for blocking its guests' Wi-Fi, according to a senior FCC official with knowledge of the investigation. The unlawful blocking isn't ""jamming"" in the traditional sense, where someone uses a jammer device to block wireless signals. Instead, Marriott employees were using the hotel's own Wi-Fi system to block other people's hot spots, the FCC official said. The order doesn't just affect one Marriott property. Under the FCC consent decree, Marriott must not block guests' Wi-Fi at all of the properties it owns and manages. The company must also file compliance plans with the FCC every three months for three years. A federal investigation of the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center in Nashville found that Marriott employees had used ""containment features of a Wi-Fi monitoring system"" at the hotel to prevent people from accessing their own personal Wi-Fi networks. ""It is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hot spots while also charging consumers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel's own Wi-Fi network,"" LeBlanc said. ""This practice puts consumers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing Internet access altogether."" The Boogie Down Bronx . Marriott issued the following statement Friday afternoon defending its actions: . ""Marriott has a strong interest in ensuring that when our guests use our Wi-Fi service, they will be protected from rogue wireless hot spots that can cause degraded service, insidious cyber-attacks and identity theft,"" the statement said. ""Like many other institutions and companies in a wide variety of industries, including hospitals and universities, the Gaylord Opryland protected its Wi-Fi network by using FCC-authorized equipment provided by well-known, reputable manufacturers. ""We believe that the Opryland's actions were lawful.  We will continue to encourage the FCC to pursue a rulemaking in order to eliminate the ongoing confusion resulting from today's action and to assess the merits of its underlying policy."" In March 2013, the FCC received a complaint from someone who had attended an event at the Gaylord Opryland and claimed the hotel was ""jamming mobile hot spots so that you can't use them in the convention space,"" the FCC statement said. Saving a Flying Fortress . Blocking a traveler's personal Wi-Fi will only serve to aggravate hotel guests further, said Benet Wilson, who blogs about travel at AviationQueen.com. ""Travelers are already annoyed that higher-end hotels continue to charge for subpar Wi-Fi, which is why they bring their own,"" Wilson told CNN. ""So it's really galling when you hear of a company like Marriott, which has a good reputation that does something that causes a major inconvenience to its customers. And the fact that they profited off of their customers in such a blatant way also doesn't help.""

"K-9 dogs and hundreds of volunteers have joined authorities in West Virginia to look for a missing 3-year-old girl, but a sheriff's department lieutenant said in the two days since she was last seen that ""we haven't come up with anything."" Aliayah Lunsford's mother and 9-year-old sister told police they saw the girl around 6 a.m. Saturday in a bedroom in their home in Weston, West Virginia, located between Charleston and Morgantown. The mother said she returned about three hours later to see the girl -- who had been sick the night before -- and take her temperature, but Aliayah wasn't there, Lewis County Sheriff's Lt. David Parks said Monday. By that time, the girl's stepfather had already been picked up and left for work. The mother got in her car and drove around looking for the child, at one point running out of gas, said Parks. She called police to report Aliayah missing around 11:30 a.m. A sheriff's deputy arrived within 10 minutes and a larger crew by noon, according to Parks. About 100 volunteers were on scene by the end of the day, alongside local, state and federal law enforcement agents. The investigation so far has included search teams diving in nearby waters, interviews with relatives and neighbors, and a door-to-door search. That's in addition to searches conducted by  volunteers. A bloodhound did detect Aliayah's scent in the vicinity of a nearby river, with a dog handler saying the girl likely had been in the area in the last three to seven days. ""We are still on it right now,"" said Parks of the search and investigation. According to a poster from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Aliayah was last seen in pajama bottoms featuring the TV cartoon character Dora, a pink princess sweatshirt and no shoes. The girl is white, weighs about 35 pounds, stands 3 feet tall and has brown eyes and hair. She has pierced ears and is missing her top four front teeth. The center characterized Aliayah as ""endangered missing."" But no Amber Alert has been issued for her, in part because authorities do not have a name or description of a suspect who might have taken her. Parks said there were no signs of forced entry in the home, which the girl shared with four other children, her stepfather and her mother, who is pregnant with twins. There is a screen door, which does not have a handle, and a regular door, which doesn't shut very well, the lieutenant said. He added that authorities have checked with ""just about every sex offender in the county,"" getting alibis for them and not having indications that any were near the girl's residence at the time she went missing. Surveillance video shows the missing girl's mother during her apparent morning search for Aliayah, but there has been no sign yet of the girl. Some people have been interviewed as many as six times, and polygraph tests have been administered, though Parks would not say to whom. ""We are interviewing everybody,"" he added, noting that no one has been identified even as a ""person of interest.""

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- They were the words Elizabeth Smart waited eight years to say, and when she spoke them from the witness stand Wednesday, they poured out with an intensity that brought jurors to the edge of their seats. Brian David Mitchell was no prophet, she said. He was an unholy hypocrite. There was nothing divine about his mission to steal her in the dark of night and make her his unwilling child bride, she said. ""He was crude and vulgar, self-serving,"" she stated, looking directly at the jury. ""He was his number one priority, followed by sex, drugs and alcohol, but he used religion in all those aspects to justify everything."" Assistant U.S. Attorney Felice John Viti asked how she could be so certain about Mitchell's character, and Smart held nothing back. ""Well, nine months of living with him and seeing him proclaim that he was God's servant and he had been called to do God's work, and everything that he did to me and to my family is something I know God would never tell someone to do,"" she said. ''God would never tell someone to kidnap a young girl from her family's home in the middle of the night, from her bed that she shared with her sister, from her sister's side, and continue to rape her and sexually abuse her. ... I know he was not called of God because God would never do something like that."" Within minutes, Smart stepped down from the witness stand, ending three days of riveting testimony against the homeless street preacher accused of kidnapping her and holding her captive as his preordained ""celestial"" wife. Asked if she was glad it was over, Smart paused for a moment, as if carefully considering her response. She then smiled and said, ""Yes."" Smart, who turned 23 last week, led the jury through the ordeal she calls ""my nine months in hell."" She was 14 when she was snatched from her bed at knifepoint and marched into the mountains behind her home to a makeshift camp, where Mitchell ""sealed"" her to him as his wife. Other kidnapped girls were to come, she said Mitchell told her, and her job would be to ""demonstrate"" to the newcomers how to carry out their sexual duties. Smart said she initially was tethered to a cable strung between two trees. She was raped on a daily basis, forced to smoke and drink and parade around naked in a game Mitchell and wife, Wanda Barzee, called ""Adam and Eve."" She said he called himself Immanuel and wrote a book outlining his religious beliefs called the ""Book of Immanuel David Isaiah."" He called his private parts ""Immanuel's Pride,"" and his bed ""Immanuel's Altar,"" she testified. She said she resisted his sexual advances, once biting him as he tried to kiss her. ""He said I would become accustomed and learn to love it,"" she said Wednesday. ""He said he understood and recognized that I felt like a prostitute or a concubine or a second-class wife but that wasn't the case at all."" Although Mitchell claimed to receive revelations directly from God and said he was destined for celestial glory, many of the details of his life, as described by Smart, were earthly and banal. Mitchell and Barzee constantly squabbled over her jealousy and his drinking, Smart said. He had a taste for pornography and boasted about his sexual prowess and his ability to outsmart other people. When he talked about his ""ministry,"" he meant panhandling, Smart added. But Mitchell often was scathing in his criticism of the people who gave him money on the street. She said he talked constantly -- about himself. She never saw him show compassion, or give anyone else money or food. Except for concealing her identity, she said, he didn't show much concern for her or her family. ""He said that I was the apple of their eye and that they were heartbroken I wasn't there but that they would be comforted and reassured that I was in good hands,"" she said. Mitchell, 57, has not been in court during Smart's testimony. As he has during every court appearance since December 2004, Mitchell closed his eyes and began singing hymns as soon as he was brought into court on Wednesday. In what has become a daily ritual, U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball brought the jury in, and intoned: ""Mr. Mitchell, you have a constitutional right to be here, which you now waive if you continue to sing."" In his thin, reedy voice, Mitchell went on singing about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ: ""They pierced his hands and feet and side ..."" He was led from the courtroom, still singing with his hands folded as if in prayer beneath his chest-length beard. According to court records, he stops the moment he enters a room equipped with audio and video feeds that allow him to view the trial. His lawyers don't dispute what happened to Smart but say Mitchell was insane, and therefore not criminally responsible for his actions. They speak of delusions that their client said provided revelations. Defense attorney Robert Steele was gentle in his brief cross-examination of Smart, mainly clarifying small points about her direct testimony. Asked about a statement she gave to a forensic psychologist shortly after she was found in March 2003, Smart conceded that her memory was probably better back then. She crisply thanked the lawyer for refreshing her memory on another point. Smart was followed by several other prosecution witnesses. The prosecution and defense agreed to what two of the witnesses had to offer, and their testimony was read into the court record as a stipulation. A waitress testified that she often served Mitchell and Barzee and saw them joined by another woman wearing a veil during the late summer or early fall of 2002. Another woman testified her husband briefly brought them home for a night or two; the women were silent but Mitchell smoked cigars and talked religion with her husband, Ada Chestnut said. An employee of The Deseret News identified Mitchell as the man who tore down a missing persons poster of Smart in the newspaper's lobby. The witness said the man told her Smart had been found. When she disputed his statement, he said he'd read the news in a competing paper, she testified. Detective Jon Richey testified about his encounter with three people, later determined to be Mitchell, Barzee and Smart, at the public library in Salt Lake City shortly after Smart's disappearance. He'd been called to investigate a tip that Smart was there, but said he considered it a ""long shot."" The women were dressed in robes and veils and were not permitted to speak, He said he asked to look under the younger woman's veil, but the man was insistent that he couldn't. It would violate their religion, the man said, . He seemed adamant and not at all evasive or nervous, Richey told the jury. He did not appear to be mentally ill. ""My impression was that he belonged to a religion or a cult that I had never heard of,"" he said. The trial recessed at the end of the day Wednesday for the Veteran's Day holiday and will resume Monday. It is expected to continue for another three weeks.

"The pilot of a plane that crashed near Buffalo, New York, in 2009, killing 50 people, was in the cockpit despite earlier concerns by airline officials regarding his ability to fly that type of plane, according to e-mails released by attorneys representing crash victims' families in lawsuits. Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by Colgan Air, crashed February 12, 2009, in Clarence Center, New York, about five miles short of its destination, the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed pilot error for the crash nearly a year later, saying that the pilot, Capt. Marvin Renslow, pulled on the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400's control column when he should have pushed. E-mails obtained by CNN Sunday from attorneys representing victims' families, meanwhile, show Colgan Air in August 2008 decided not to include Renslow among those upgrading to fly the Q400. Renslow ""had a problem upgrading,"" chief pilot Bill Honan wrote in the e-mails. ""Anyone that does not meet the (minimum requirements) and had problems in training before is not ready to tackle the Q,"" Harry Mitchel, Colgan's vice-president of operations, responded. Pinnacle Airlines, Colgan Air's parent company, said in a statement Sunday that at the time Renslow requested to transition from the smaller Saab 340 aircraft to the Q400 in August 2008, he had passed three checking tests, known as ""checking events."" ""However, Colgan's chief pilot required that Captain Renslow successfully pass another proficiency check before being allowed to begin transition training,"" said Pinnacle spokesman Joe Williams. ""On September 26, 2008, Captain Renslow successfully completed a proficiency line check flight and was subsequently entered in the October 2008 Q400 transition class."" He successfully completed the training program and transition operating experience in the Q400, Williams said. Colgan did not include the information regarding the e-mails as part of Renslow's employment file, according to an accompanying letter from Hugh Russ, who represents victims' families, adding the documents are ""central to the issues in this case."" In their lawsuits, the victims' families claim include that Colgan, Pinnacle and Continental failed to provide trained and capable pilots and also failed to ensure the pilots were rested and able to perform their duties. After its investigation of the crash, the NTSB said neither Renslow nor the first officer, Rebecca Shaw, realized the plane was slowing down too quickly, and did not react properly when the ""stick shaker"" -- a vibrating column which indicates the plane is entering a stall -- activated, the NTSB said. Renslow, according to the board, reacted ""consistent with startle and confusion"" and pulled on the column, exacerbating the situation and dooming the aircraft. The board agreed that both Renslow and Shaw were fatigued, but disagreed about whether that fatigue contributed to the crash, eventually voting 2-1 not to include it as a contributing factor. NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said last year it it was ""disturbing to hear of the numerous times"" Renslow failed proficiency tests. After the crash, it was revealed that Renslow had failed three pilot tests, known as ""check-rides,"" before joining Colgan Air, but had disclosed only one on job applications. He failed two more while at Colgan Air, officials said. In August 2009, Philip Trenary, president and CEO of Pinnacle Airlines, the parent company of Colgan Air, testified at a Senate hearing that while ""a failure on a check-ride is not necessarily a reason for someone not to fly, it depends on what kind of failure it is."" ""The failures that we were unable to see were the basic fundamental failures that you would not want to have,"" Trenary said. ""Let me stress one thing: Capt. Renslow was a fine man by all accounts,"" he said. ""But ""had we known what we know now, no, he would not have been in that (pilot's) seat."" Allegations that Colgan withheld the information from the NTSB ""or anyone else, is completely false,"" Williams said. ""Colgan voluntarily informed the NTSB that it required Captain Renslow to successfully complete a proficiency check prior to being allowed to begin transition training for the Q400."" The e-mails were provided to plaintiffs in the lawsuits three months ago, Williams said. The documents were classified as confidential, and Colgan agreed to a plaintiffs' request to reconsider ""because we remain confident in our full compliance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations governing our training processes, then and now,"" Williams said. ""This was the first time in the litigation that (plaintiffs) requested a 'confidential' document be de-designated,"" he said., ""However, we have serious concerns that plaintiffs may attempt to continue to attempt to try this case in the media, which could impact Colgan's ability to receive a fair trial in Buffalo."" At the time of the crash, Renslow had 3,379 hours of flight experience, 172 hours in the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400. Williams noted he was Airline Transport Pilot rated -- ""the highest level of certification available"" -- and was in accordance with all FAA regulations. He had more than 100 hours as pilot-in-command of a Q400, the statement said. The NTSB issued more than 20 recommendations after the crash.","E-mails show airline deemed pilot not ready to upgrade, attorneys say .

"Facebook has unveiled a new product, Facebook Home, at an event everyone knew would have something to do with phones and apps and operating systems. ""We're not building a phone and we're not building an operating system,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday. ""But we're also building something that's a whole lot deeper than just another app."" Um, OK. Thanks for clarifying that, Zuck. In all seriousness, though, here's the breakdown on Home, a feature Facebook hopes will make it part of everything you do on your phone. What is it? As described by Zuckerberg and others, Home is a ""family of apps"" that essentially push Facebook content front and center on your Android phone. Once the phone ""wakes up,"" the home screen and lock screen are replaced with something called ""Cover Feed."" Images and posts from friends will appear as the new screen's background. Users can flip through and interact with them -- ""like"" an update, or post a comment -- immediately without having to open a specific Facebook app. One touch takes the user to their apps, or back to the last app they were using. Home's other big feature was called ""Chat Heads,"" which is a basically a tool that combines Facebook Messenger with the phone's regular SMS text-message tool. Messages pop up regardless of what the user is doing at the time, along with the sender's profile picture, enclosed in a little circle. The user can decide whether to open the message (without leaving the app or other screen they're on), dismiss it or save it for later with a single touch. When and where can I get it? Home will be available in the Google Play mobile store on April 12 for at least some Android phones. Users will be able to choose whether to install it permanently, or for a one-off trial session. At release, it will only be optimized for Samsung's Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II and the HTC One line of phones. It will run on the Galaxy S 4 and the HTC One when those phones are released, with other phones being added in the coming months. Facebook said a version for tablets will be released ""within several months."" How about my iPhone? Your wait might be quite a bit longer. Or, you know, forever. During the event, Zuckerberg repeatedly talked about how Google's open Android system was the perfect place to build Home. It's not unusual for mobile-device makers, most notably Amazon with its Kindle Fire tablets, to tweak the system to suit their own needs. Apple, on the other hand, has a very closed operating system, giving its developers far less leeway in exchange for what the company says is a smoother, better-developed user experience. Creating something like Home for Apple's iOS system would require an almost unprecedented partnership between the companies. ""Anything that happens with Apple is going to happen with partnership,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Google's Android is open so we don't have to work with them."" Still, Facebook isn't ruling out the possibility, at least not officially. ""This is a first step and we're continuing to iterate,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to iPhone questions. ""We chose to start building on Android because we could build a more deeply integrated mobile experience. We'll continue to test and iterate on the Facebook experience across all platforms. "" What happened to the Facebook phone I was hearing about? Well, there's not one. While rumors to that effect have swirled for a couple of years, Facebook has always maintained it wasn't ""making"" a phone. That remains technically true. But at Wednesday's event, HTC unveiled the HTC First, an AT&T exclusive Android phone that will be released the same day Facebook Home goes live. The phone will have Home pre-loaded as the default version of its operating system. So it's the closest thing to a Facebook phone for now. Unveiled by CEO Peter Chou, the First will be a mid-range phone that looks vaguely like an iPhone 5, with a 4.3-inch screen and dual-core Snapdragon processor. It will sell for $99 in the United States. Folks looking for a high-end HTC phone may be more inclined to wait for the HTC One, which launches on April 19. What are folks saying? ""Jokes aside, I think Home is a very smart thing for Facebook to do. At least for now. Really is a blanket over Android. Need to play with it."" -- MG Siegler, columnist, TechCrunch . ""Wonder when Twitter and others will introduce their own ""super apps"" that take over lock screen, home page.... ."" -- Stephen Levy, senior writer, Wired . ""It's nice-looking enough, for what it is.  But what it is is an assumption that users want to use Facebook to filter everything they do with their smartphones ... . Putting friends first isn't a bad concept for the smartphone experience.  But Facebook thinks that friends = Facebook and Facebook = friends. If this were ever true, it isn't now."" -- Jesse Brown, columnist, Maclean's .","Facebook Home is a family of apps for the Android system .
It puts photos and posts from the site front and center on your phone .
""Chat Heads"" also joins Facebook Messenger and SMS texts .

"(CNN) -- Record-setting rains slammed the southwestern United States on Monday, turning roadways into rivers as flash floods washed away cars. Up to 200 children were briefly trapped in an elementary school in Moapa, Nevada, due to the waters, the state highway patrol said Monday night. The students at Perkins Elementary school, about 60 miles from Las Vegas, were with teachers and not in danger, said Highway Patrol Spokesman Loy Hixson. Flash flooding also washed a portion of Interstate 15 away near the community of Glendale, taking many vehicles with it. No one has been injured but it has taken so much of the highway that it may not be fixed until Wednesday, Hixson said. In Arizona, the governor declared an emergency Monday as flooding from the historic rains closed roads and schools in her state. A woman was killed after her car was submerged in floodwaters, the Tucson Fire Department said. Rescuers were unable to reach the vehicle in time. ""Within a minute of us getting there, the car washed away,"" Capt. Barrett Baker told CNN. The waters were up to 12 feet deep, he said, and swept the car for several blocks. In Phoenix, the flooding left morning commuters stranded on Interstate 10, CNN affiliate KTVK reported. ""This rain is coming down so hard you can't even see to drive, not to mention the thunder and lightning right now,"" KTVK reporter Jill Galus said in a Twitter post early Monday morning. In just 24 hours, Phoenix saw more than 6 inches of rain, said Chad Myers, CNN meteorologist and severe weather expert. ""The problem with this ... was that it happened in the dark, it happened before the sunlight, and people were driving into it,"" he said. What's causing the record-setting rains and flash floods in the Southwest? Blame Norbert, which hit Mexico's coast as a hurricane on Saturday. Now the storm system is moving through the United States, and it's still packing a punch. ""This could go on for a few more days,"" Myers said. Using the Twitter hashtag #TurnAroundDontDrown, Gov. Jan Brewer's office warned motorists to stay off the streets and said non-essential state employees should remain at home. By mid-morning Tuesday, the National Weather Service said 2.96 inches of rain had fallen at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, breaking the record of the largest amount of rain to fall in a single calendar day. The airport remained open but fights were delayed by the weather. The rainfall total in just one day was more than the average amount of rain the area typically sees during its rainy season, officials said. Videos and photographs from CNN affiliates showed cars submerged in fast-moving floodwaters. At least 5,000 customers are without power due to flooding and storms in the Phoenix metro area, and the number is expected to grow, Arizona Public Service spokesman Steve Gotfried said. The Roosevelt School District called off classes ""due to the heavy rains and low visibility as a result of fog,"" officials said in a Facebook post. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton declared a state of emergency and said his city was facing a historic amount of rain. Police and fire dispatchers fielded thousands of calls as the storm hit, officials said. ""I am confident as mayor that all the appropriate steps have been taken, are being taken right now and will be taken,"" Stanton told reporters. ""Obviously, we're monitoring the weather very, very closely."" By Monday afternoon rains had stopped in Phoenix, but storms could pick up again overnight, Myers said.

"Air traffic controllers may be taking more risks in handling airliners under a 2-year-old rule allowing them to report errors without fear of punishment, congressional investigators say in a report highlighting a spike in incidents. Controllers and the FAA, however, say the rule has actually improved safety. The report by the Government Accountability Office -- which notes a 53 percent increase in controller errors within five miles of airports and a 166 percent jump in errors handling approaching flights up to 40 miles out -- comes at a time of remarkable commercial aviation safety in the United States. The nation has not seen a fatal airliner crash since 2009, the same year the rule went into effect. The increase in errors ""began a notable climb in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, peaked in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, and remained at rates higher than the historical average through the second quarter of 2011,"" the GAO said in its report. The FAA says the jump coincides with the non-punitive reporting rule, which took effect in July 2009. That system encourages air traffic controllers to voluntarily report errors so that dangerous patterns can be identified and the system can be made safer, the agency said. The system, which protects controllers who report efforts from legal or disciplinary action,  has ""produced a wealth of information to help the FAA identify potential risks in the system and make corrections,"" FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said. ""More information will help us find problems and take action before an accident happens,"" she said. But the GAO said  FAA officials who are not identified in the report told investigators that the system also may reduce personal accountability and ""may make some air traffic controllers less risk averse in certain situations."" That may have led to more errors, according to the GAO, which also said some FAA officials told them the rule also limits the ability of managers to take action against employees who make a mistake. The GAO also said 65% of the errors reported through the non-punitive system, some of which may have involved violations of the standards separating aircraft in flight, were not fed into a separate FAA reporting system for operational errors. That may have reduced the number of errors directly reported to FAA supervisors, the GAO said. Rep. Thomas E. Petri, the Aviation Subcommittee chairman and one of six Congress members who requested the GAO study, said the spike in errors raises significant concerns. ""Airlines and FAA controllers alike share credit for the safety record we enjoy today,"" Petri, a Wisconsin Republican, said in a written statement. ""However, the recent uptick in near miss events is a precursor to tragedy."" But Paul Rinaldi, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said his take on the report is that it shows the FAA has ""taken several steps to further improve safety at and around airports."" Bill Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, said he supports the FAA's non-punitive reporting system, saying it is bringing to light errors that would have gone unreported under the old system.  But he said the new system, by itself, can not explain all of the increases in controller errors. ""A jump is inevitable when you change your reporting system. You worry if you don't have a jump because you feel like something hasn't worked,"" Voss said. ""But when you look underneath these numbers, as GAO has done very carefully, you can't explain everything away by a change of reporting. It looks like there's some substance to it too, and that has to be dealt with.""","FAA's non-punitive reporting system took effect in July 2009 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The father of Princess Diana's boyfriend attacked the British Royal family Monday with a series of insults and accusations at the inquest looking into how the couple died. Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi, repeated his allegations of a massive cover-up involving the Royal family, paparazzi and for the first time Diana's sister. He has previously included British intelligence services in the alleged plot. Al Fayed, who spent most of the day in the witness box, let out a torrent of allegations that members of the royal family were racist. He has previously blamed Prince Philip for the deaths, insisting that the royal family couldn't bear the prospect of a Muslim marrying the princess. ""Diana suffered for 20 years from this Dracula family,"" Al Fayed said Monday. ""I will not rest until I die. If I lose everything to find the truth,"" Al Fayed, told the court. Al Fayed, owner of London's famed Harrods department store, began his testimony by reading a statement saying Diana told him in July 1997, the month before the crash, that she feared for her life.  Watch Al-Fayed have his day in court. » . He said Diana told him her ex-husband Prince Charles, and the queen's husband Prince Philip, wanted to ""get rid"" of her. Diana said she had a wooden box with her initials on it containing all the details about why she feared for her life, Al Fayed said. He added she told him that if anything ever happened to her, he needed to know about the box. After the crash, however, the contents of the box were stolen before he could get to them, he said. For the first time Al Fayed implicated Diana's sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, in the alleged cover-up. He said he spoke to her about the wooden box after the crash, but the fact that the contents were later stolen is evidence that she tried to conceal them, he said. Al Fayed has previously said that Diana was pregnant with Dodi's child at the time of the crash, although British and French police investigations into the crash have discounted this. At the inquest, Al Fayed testified that Diana and Dodi were engaged and planned an announcement the Monday after the crash. When an inquest lawyer challenged Al Fayed as to why he didn't tell everybody once he knew about the alleged engagement, Al Fayed claimed he had only just found out himself. ""It was one hour before they were murdered. Am I going to announce it after they were dead?"" John Macnamara, the former head of security for Al Fayed, last week said at at the inquest that he did not he believe Prince Philip was involved in a conspiracy to kill the couple. During the five-month inquest, witnesses have been questioned about a mysterious white Fiat Uno which some witnesses reported seeing shortly before the crash but which was never traced. Al Fayed said the car belonged to paparazzo James Andanson, who did own a white Fiat Uno. Al Fayed said Andanson, who was found dead two years later in a burned-out car, was part of the murder plot and ""assassinated"" to cover up his role. The inquest has also heard testimony about whether the chauffeur, Henri Paul, was drunk on the night of the crash. Al Fayed claimed Paul was sober and that French investigators botched the tests, though he did not give evidence to support the claim. Instead he alleged a coverup by two French investigators: Dominique Lecomte, who conducted the post-mortem on Paul, and Gilbert Pepin, who tested Paul's blood. Al Fayed also questioned the delay in transporting Diana to a hospital after the crash, adding she might have survived had she gotten treatment sooner. He also alleged that MI6, Britain's foreign Intelligence Service, infiltrated the British tax service, as well as the Home Office -- the UK's interior ministry -- and continued to conspire against him. Al Fayed said the Home Office denied him a passport as part of the plot. The inquest is required under British law whenever someone dies in suspicious, sudden, or unexplained circumstances but it will only decide how they died and not lay blame. It began in October 2007 -- after the French and British investigations into the crash concluded -- and is expected to last six months. E-mail to a friend .

"A Federal Aviation Administration official warned this week about the dangers of even small unmanned aircraft, pointing specifically to a recent close call involving a drone and a commercial airliner that could have had ""catastrophic"" results. Jim Williams, the head of the FAA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) office, discussed various potential perils during a presentation Thursday to those attending the Small Unmanned Systems Business Expo. A video of his talk in San Francisco, and those of others, to those who operate, create or otherwise are involved or interested in such unmanned aircraft was posted to YouTube. After saying ""the FAA has got to be responsive to the entire industry,"" Williams referred to a pair of incidents in which drones caused injuries to people on the ground. One came at an event at Virginia Motor Speedway in which an ""unauthorized, unmanned aircraft"" crashed into the stands, and in the other a female triathlete in Australia had to get stitches after being struck by a small drone. Then, Williams segued to a pilot's recent report of ""a near midair collision"" with a drone near the airport in Tallahassee, Florida. The pilot said that it appeared to be small, camouflaged, ""remotely piloted"" and about 2,300 feet up in the air at the time of the incident. ""The pilot said that the UAS was so close to his jet that he was sure he had collided with it,"" Williams said. ""Thankfully, inspection to the airliner after landing found no damage. But this may not always be the case."" According to the FAA, the incident took place on March 22 and involved as U.S. Airways Flight 4650 going from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Tallahassee. Flightaware.com lists that flight as a CRJ-200, with a capacity for 50 passengers. The pilot claimed to pass ""an unreported and apparently remotely controlled aircraft ... five miles northeast of the Tallahassee airport, according to the federal agency. Such close calls are rare, the FAA notes. The pilot reported that the small unmanned aircraft involved looked similar to an F-4 Phantom jet, and not like a helicopter that might hold a camera that many associate more closely with drones. Such planes have gas turbine engines and can fly higher than an average drone, according to the FAA. Neither the drone in this case, nor its pilot, have been identified. In its own statement, US Airways said that it was aware of this reported ""incident with one of our express flights, and we are investigating."" Explaining why this event is significant, Williams referenced to the so-called ""Miracle on the Hudson"" from 2009, when US Airways Flight 1549 safely crash-landed in New York's Hudson River after striking at least one bird upon takeoff from LaGuardia Airport. Airplane crash-lands into Hudson River . Such bird strikes are dangerous enough; a drone, even a small one, getting sucked into a jetliner's engine could be even worse, Williams said. ""Imagine a metal and plastic object -- especially with (a) big lithium battery -- going into a high-speed engine,"" he added. ""The results could be catastrophic."" All these incidents speak to ""why it is incredibly important for detect-and-avoid standards (for small unmanned aircraft) to be developed and right-of-way rules to be obeyed,"" Williams said. He added that such standards are in the works. His agency reiterated this sentiment in its statement Friday. ""The FAA has the exclusive authority to regulate the airspace from the ground up, and a mandate to protect the safety of the American people in the air and on the ground,"" the agency said. ""...Our challenge is to integrate unmanned aircraft into the busiest, most complex airspace in the world. Introduction of unmanned aircraft into America's airspace must take place incrementally and with the interest of safety first."" As to current regulations, Williams noted the FAA has appealed a federal judge's decision in a case involving businessman Raphael Pirker. Pirker used a remotely operated, 56-inch foam glider to take aerial video for an advertisement for the University of Virginia Medical Center. The FAA then fined him $10,000 for operating the aircraft in a ""careless and reckless manner."" A judge on March 6 agreed with Pirker that the FAA overreached by applying regulations for aircraft to model aircraft, and said no FAA rule prohibited Pirker's radio-controlled flight. Pilot wins case against FAA over commercial drone flight . But on Thursday, Williams said that another judge had stayed this ruling pending the FAA's appeal. ""Nothing has changed from a legal standpoint,"" he said, ""and the FAA continues to enforce the airspace rules."" Drones banned from Yosemite, other parks .","Flight 4650 on March 22 was a 50-seat jet, according to Flightaware .

"On the streets of Nigeria, we bear witness to what many see as a bold decision on fuel subsidies is also uncovering decades of frustration and corruption. On the heels of re-election, President Goodluck Jonathan lifted fuel subsides on petrol in an effort to cut $8 billion a year from the government's budget.  Petrol was artificially low at U.S. 45 cents a liter and -- not surprisingly -- prices doubled overnight, both at the pump and on the black market. Economists suggest the New Year's resolution pushed through by the president was the correct policy to implement on paper, but politics is eventually determined by what happens on the street. And the ""street"" right now is crying foul. Nigerians launched a nationwide strike on Monday. Some protests over the end of fuel subsidies were marred by clashes that left 16 people dead and 205 injured, according to a tally collected Tuesday by the Nigerian Red Cross. Nigerians are worn down by inherent corruption. The harsh reality is that despite being in the big league of oil producers with reserves of 36 billion barrels, the country rank, according to the IMF, is 133rd in the world when it comes to per capita income -- the lowest performance of a country with this level of natural resources. That per capita income ranking is just above its poor status in Transparency International's corruption index where Nigeria took the 143rd position in 2011 alongside Belarus, Togo, Russia and Mauritania. This is a tale of two Nigerias -- one that has garnered $67 billion of foreign direct investment, growing at 7-8% a year, and being singled out by Goldman Sachs as being one of the ""Next-11"" economies. Jim O'Neill coined that phrase to group together the next promising bunch of highly populated, fast growing economies for the early part of the 21st Century.    Nigeria is known as a lower-middle income economy, a powerful voice within OPEC and the African Union, but a frontier market classification because of the political risk and poor rankings on corruption surveys. Nigeria's status as a ""Next-11"" economy must seem a world away from the 57% of Nigerians who still live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank.  Nigerians struggle to cope with notoriously poor infrastructure, with electricity in short supply and power cuts still commonplace. ""At the moment Nigeria's electricity generation officially is about similar to what Narita airport in Japan does and consumes,"" said Charlie Robertson of the emerging market investment group Renaissance Capital, ""So Nigeria's growing, booming 7-8 percent even with so little electricity. If they could electricity reform done too, this could be a boom story for a decade."" That is a big ""if"" and certainly why Nigerians have taken to the street. President Jonathan faces backlash because the population view subsidies as the only benefit it gets from the vast hydrocarbon resources.  Many are asking a simple question: Will the money being saved from fuel subsides be spent wisely? The track record is not a promising one.  According to the World Bank, 80% of the oil wealth has really only benefited 1% of the population. It is worth noting, there are other, big complications.  This is a country that remains divided between north and south along religious lines. The president this week suggested the Islamic sect Boko Haram has supporters within the government, creating tensions amongst the ranks of his cabinet.  A spate of church bombings in December adds another level of uncertainty for a government that says it wants to continue to pursue reforms. President Jonathan was given a mandate with his second term to deliver change and make the country an attractive destination for foreign investment.  What Nigerians who are protesting are saying, it should be an attractive place to live day-to-day as well.","Nigeria lifted fuel subsides on petrol in an effort to cut $8 billion a year .

"The photos of Oscar Pistorius and girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp appear to show a young couple in love. The series of images, given exclusively to CNN by a source close to Pistorius, come as the Olympic runner faces a bleak anniversary: one year since he shot his girlfriend dead at his home on Valentine's Day. Pistorius will go on trial accused of Steenkamp's murder early next month. He denies the charge, saying he mistook her for a home invader. The intimate pictures -- some of the final images of the 29-year-old model, taken in the weeks and months before her death -- show the couple looking relaxed and happy. In one, Steenkamp wraps her arms around Pistorius, hanging over his shoulders as he tenderly holds on to her fingers. They grin happily at the camera. The couple are at the beach, with blue waters glistening behind them, and appear relaxed, casually dressed and in sunglasses. Another blurry picture was taken in a kitchen. The fridge magnets are as much in focus as Steenkamp's smiling face as she sits on her boyfriend's lap. She looks dressed up for a night out in a sleeveless black dress with gold trim that sets off her sleek blond hair. Again, they are holding on to each other tightly. The third image is more intimate and passionate, as Pistorius holds Steenkamp protectively in his arms. His eyes are closed as she seems to nestle into him. The photo is not just a holiday picture, but an aching reminder of a relationship and a life cruelly ended on Valentine's Day a year ago. Pistorius looks back a year after killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . 'Devastating accident' or murder? Pistorius, who won world fame for his achievements as a double-amputee runner, fatally shot his girlfriend of three months in the early hours of February 14, when he fired through a bathroom door in his home. Her death at the hands of an athlete regarded as South Africa's golden boy shocked the world. Pistorius does not deny shooting Steenkamp, a law school graduate with a burgeoning TV and fashion career,  but says it was a ""devastating accident."" Police say it was murder and will try to prove in court that the couple had an argument before the shots were fired, legal experts say. The trial, which starts on March 3 before a high court judge, is expected to attract international interest. While the photos prove nothing with regard to Pistorius' guilt or innocence, they give an insight into the couple's shared experiences and apparent intimacy before her death. In a statement released on his website on the anniversary of the shooting, Pistorius said: ""The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life."" In a recent statement, Barry and June Steenkamp, Reeva's parents, said they would like to thank people for their condolences. ""We understand and empathize with friends who have lost a child through violence or abuse,"" they said.","Photos show Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp together not long before her death .

"(CNN) -- It takes quite a character to inspire a legion of women to draw thick black unibrows and mustaches on their own faces. Six decades after Frida Kahlo's death, her distinctive floral headwear, ornate dresses, and flash of red lipstick, still captivates some fans to the point of making themselves in her image. Every time a major gallery launches a new exhibition of the Mexican painter's work, you can bet it will be accompanied by a queue of Kahlo-lookalikes, said art historian Helga Prignitz-Poda. ""It's a real phenomenon,"" said the curator of one of the biggest Kahlo exhibitions in the world, currently on display at Rome's Scuderie del Quirinale. ""I think people are most fascinated by her paintings -- Frida shows her inner life in a very authentic manner. And I think there are very few artists that have painted so much of what they really felt. ""There's a certain honesty, and that's what people understand and feel."" Queen of the selfie? Kahlo's greatest muse was arguably herself, throughout her lifetime painting a huge number of self-portraits depicting deeply personal experiences in raw detail. From miscarriages, to a painful back injury which plagued her, the viewer is given a glimpse into the darkest depths of Kahlo's world. She once famously said: ""I paint myself because I am often so alone, and because I am the subject I know best."" And in an age of the selfie, could Kahlo's self-portraits tell us something about people's need to share their image with others? ""She told her friends: 'I give you this painting so that I am not so alone,'"" said Prignitz-Poda. ""So when people looked at pictures of her in their houses they thought of her, and it was like a white magic -- the more she painted herself, the more she spread her image among her friends, and the more these friends thought of her. ""I think the people who dress-up as Frida Kahlo today want to identify themselves with her because they feel there is a person who has been as lonely as them. There is a person who fought against this loneliness, who was strong enough to overcome their own problems."" A life less ordinary . Kahlo's enduring allure is not simply due to her artwork, but a remarkable life which began in Mexico City in 1907. A horrific traffic accident as a teenager left her with lifelong back problems, and many of her self-portraits depict her body wracked with pain -- in one she wears a necklace of thorns, in another she is a deer pierced with arrows. Her marriage to fellow Mexican painter Diego Rivera -- 21 years her senior and a towering figure beside Kahlo's petite frame -- was a tumultuous one, the couple divorcing in 1939 and remarrying the next year. Both had extramarital affairs, with Kahlo perhaps most famously engaging in a relationship with Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, while he was in exile in Mexico. ""In the beginning Frida was in Diego's shadow, but she very soon stepped out of it,"" said Prignitz-Poda of the couple's avant-garde art careers. ""On their first trip to the United States in 1930, they had been married for one year, and already the press started to notice her appearance by his side as someone very attractive and spectacular. ""When people came to their house to interview Diego, they saw her paintings, and saw that she was also very interesting."" In 1938 Kahlo had her first solo exhibition in New York. A year later her self-portrait ""The Frame,"" was purchased by The Louvre in Paris, the first work by a 20th century Mexican artist bought by the gallery. She had well and truly stepped out of her husband's shadow -- professionally at least. Frame of mind . Gaze across Kahlo's self-portraits and you'll find an unsmiling woman with a harsh unibrow staring back. But the bold persona was all part of a carefully cultivated ""masquerade,"" says Prignitz-Poda. ""She's dressing up in the Tehuana dress, which represents the matriarch in a certain part of Mexico -- the strong woman who fights for her rights, makes her own money. She wants to represent this type of woman. ""She pointed out her mustache and joined eyebrows because they show a male aspect to her personality, and Frida always wanted to be both. She wanted to be a complete human being and not only the sweet wife, so this makes her look so strong."" Kahlo died soon after her 47th birthday in La Casa Azul -- ""The Blue House"" -- where she was also born, now a museum attracting thousands of visitors each month. The official cause of death was respiratory failure, set on by pneumonia. Today, Kahlo's paintings sell for a whopping $5.6 million, her face adorns Mexico's 500-pesos note, and a 2002 Hollywood biopic of her life featured Salma Hayek in the Oscar nominated lead role. Major retrospective exhibitions of her work continue to draw huge crowds. And among them are the Kahlo lookalikes, who quietly contemplate their hero hanging on the wall.

"Before boarding the last flight of his life, UPS cargo pilot Capt. Cerea Beal Jr. confided to a colleague: ""These schedules over the past several years are killing me."" Just before takeoff, his co-pilot also expressed concern about fatigue. In a conversation captured by the cockpit voice recorder, First Officer Shanda Fanning told Beal that she had just gotten a ""good sleep,"" but she was still ""so tired."" Both Beal, 58, and Fanning, 37, died last August when their plane, an Airbus A300, crashed just short of the Birmingham, Alabama, airport just before dawn. Details of the conversations were revealed Thursday during a National Transportation Safety Board public hearing. The board released documents around its investigation and heard testimony from UPS officials, pilots, and other experts. Until Thursday, the issue of fatigue had received little attention in the UPS accident. But with the release of the cockpit transcript and interview records, the crash of UPS flight 1354 is now part of one of the hottest debates in commercial aviation: pilot rest. 'One level of safety' In January, the Federal Aviation Administration enacted new rest rules for all airline pilots. But the rule excludes  cargo crew. Cargo pilots say the FAA should have ""one level of safety"" for all pilots -- a sentiment expressed in the doomed cockpit -- and say government and industry should place the same value to cargo pilot's life that they give to airline pilot and passenger lives. Cargo pilots have special rest needs, they say, because they typically fly ""on the back side of the clock"" -- at night -- which raises havoc with sleep rhythms and contributes to fatigue. UPS argues that it gives pilots ample opportunity to sleep, that it has a non-punitive system for pilots who say they are too tired to fly, and that work hours have been largely negotiated with the pilots' union. Finally, they stress that pilots share responsibility that they get adequate rest and are fit to fly. Cockpit conversations . Even though the NTSB is months away from determining the probable cause of the accident, the rest issue erupted in full Thursday. It was raised, in this case, by the ill-fated pilots themselves, their haunting words captured on the cockpit voice recorder. As the plane cruised toward Birmingham, Beal noted the two-person crew would have two extra hours off-the-clock on the ground, and pointed out their rest period during a previous leg was cut short by a 30-minute ride to the hotel. ""This is where, ah, the passenger side (passenger airline pilots) ... they're gonna make out,"" he said. ""I mean I don't get that. You know, it should be one level of safety for everybody,"" he said. Fanning agreed. ""It should be across the board to be honest. In my opinion, whether you are flying passengers or cargo or, you know, box of chocolates at night, if you're flying this time of day..."" she said. ""The, you know, fatigue is definitely,"" she added, her voice becoming unintelligible. ""I was out and slept today. I slept in Rockford. I slept good,"" she said. ""And I was out in that sleep room  and when my alarm went off, I mean, I'm thinkin' 'I'm so tired,'"" she said. ""I know,"" Beal responded, saying cargo companies ""got a lot of nerve."" 'They told us' The union representing the 2,600 pilots who fly for UPS took note of the cockpit conversation. ""Pilots rarely get to speak for themselves from beyond the grave in these cases,"" said Brian Gaudet, a spokesman for the Independent Pilots Association. ""I'm going to take their word at face value. They told us what was going on at the beginning of that flight,"" he said. UPS said its rules are within FAA requirements, and that it had a FAA-mandated fatigue risk management program. A typical UPS pilot is on duty 70 hours a month, and flies less than half of that time. UPS said both crew members were coming off extended time off.  The captain had been off for eight days before beginning his final trip, and the first officer had flown just two of the previous 10 days. Beal had flown 41 hours in the previous 30 days; Fanning had flown 31. UPS representative Capt. Jon Snyder said that ""a majority"" of the company's flights occur at night, so the company can keep its commitment to deliver packages by 10 a.m. ""That's the nature of the business,"" he said. Last year, he said, pilots flew 123,000 flights, and on 138 occasions called in to report they were too tired to fly. In 96 cases, the company determined that the pilot was within his or her rights, and in 42 cases it deducted days from their sick days after concluding the pilots could have managed their rest periods better. IPA representative Lauri Esposito said pilots are reluctant to call in tired. ""Members view it (the company's response) as being punitive; they get dinged for it."" At the hearing, experts testified Beal and Fanning missed numerous cues that the plane was descending too rapidly. NTSB investigator in charge Dan Bower said he has found no indication that the plane had mechanical problems. Democratic legislation proposed last year in the Senate proposes to align rest rules for cargo pilots with those of their passenger airline counterparts.","Two pilots talked about rest; transcript of cockpit conversation released at safety hearing .

"The raspy, gruff voice behind some of the most soulful songs of the past six decades is now gone. Legendary soul singer Bobby Womack died Friday, Womack's publicist said. He was 70. ""I am sadly able to confirm but I have no details at this time,"" said Sonya Kolowrat, his publicist with XL Recordings. Womack, whose career started before he was 10, wrote and performed hits such as ""That's the Way I feel About Cha"" and ""Across 110th Street."" He also wrote The Rolling Stones' first U.S. No. 1 hit, ""It's All Over Now."" Womack was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Last year, he revealed to BBC 6 music that he had early signs of Alzheimer's disease. ""With the support of many good doctors, my family, and all of my wonderful fans, I will continue to write and perform and bring the good music to the people for as long as I can,"" Womack told CNN after his diagnosis. He thanked his fans for their prayers and well wishes, adding, ""I truly appreciate and can feel your love."" Womack's diagnosis came after several other health issues including pneumonia, diabetes, and colon cancer. The evolution of a legend . Bobby Dwayne Womack was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1944. His father, a steelworker, also sang gospel -- and young Bobby followed in his father's musical footsteps. ""We came up very poor. My kids have had a much better life than I'd ever thought of livin',"" Womack said on his website. By age 10, Womack and his four brothers -- Friendly Jr., Cecil, Harry and Curtis -- formed The Womack Brothers. They started touring the gospel circuit. Then came an encounter that would change the course of the group. In 1953, The Womack Brothers met Soul Stirrers lead singer Sam Cooke. After The Womack Brothers changed their name to the Valentinos, Cooke signed them to his SAR Records label, and the Valentinos' success took off with the hit ""Lookin' for a Love."" ""Sam had charisma and a very special way to get into people's hearts through his songs and his music,"" Womack said in the book ""Midnight Mover."" ""But Sam wasn't just a singer, he was a leader, and he was getting ready to shake things up, to raise the consciousness of the world and stop prejudice."" But in 1964, Cooke was shot to death at a Los Angeles motel. Four months later, Womack married Cooke's widow. That same year, The Rolling Stones covered Womack's ""It's All Over Now"" -- and scored their first No. 1 hit in the United States. And Womack became rich. He broke off into a solo career, which took off in 1967 with his first song ""Trust Me."" His song ""Across 110th Street"" became a hit in 1972 and rode a new wave of popularity in 1997 when it was featured in the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's film ""Jackie Brown."" Mourning an icon . Decades after The Rolling Stones made it big with Womack's song, guitarist Ronnie Wood recalled his friend's ability to captivate his audiences. ""I'm so sad to hear about my friend Bobby Womack -- the man who could make you cry when he sang has brought tears to my eyes with his passing,"" Wood tweeted. ""My heart goes out to his family & friends and everyone who loved his music. Bobby you will be greatly missed."" Singer Darius Rucker also remembered Womack's renowned baritone voice. ""To the great Bobby Womack. Rest In Peace u legend,"" Rucker tweeted. ""Heaven just got another great singer for its choir.""","Womack dies at 70; his publicist reveals no other details .

"A child has died after contracting a rare but deadly brain-eating amoeba infection while visiting a home in Louisiana, according to state health officials. Officials believe the child is a 4-year-old boy from Mississippi who may have come in contact with the waterborne Naegleria fowleri amoeba while playing on a plastic toy water slide, St. Bernard Parish President David Peralta told CNN affiliate WWLTV. Water samples taken from the home tested positive for the amoeba, according to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. The state health department has not released the child's age or identity. Out of what officials describe as ""an abundance of caution,"" St. Bernard Parish on Thursday began treating its water system with additional chlorine and flushing any potentially contaminated water from its lines. This treatment may result in changes in the smell, taste and color of the local water, the health department said, but it is still safe to drink. While initial tests for the amoeba were negative, the health department said tests showed low levels of chlorine in some areas of the water supply. ""We are working with the parish to make sure precautionary measures are being taken while we await additional test results on samples taken from the area's water system,"" Assistant Secretary for Public Health J.T. Lane said in a statement. The health department said the amoeba results may take up to a month to confirm. The Mississippi boy's death is the second widely reported loss of a child due to Naegleria fowleri in less than two weeks. Last month, the same parasite killed Zachary Reyna, a 12-year-old from Florida. A third child, 12-year-old Kali Hardig from Arkansas, survived the infection that struck her after she contracted the amoeba in July. Between 2001 and 2010, there were only 32 reported cases of people getting Naegleria fowleri in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the cases have been in the Southeast. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm freshwater, most often in the Southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking contaminated water, the CDC said. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Kali's case. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the agency website says. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days.""","Child may have come in contact with parasite through a plastic toy water slide .

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was hospitalized Sunday after doctors discovered a blood clot during a follow-up exam related to a concussion she suffered this month, her spokesman said. She is expected to remain at New York Presbyterian Hospital for the next 48 hours so doctors can monitor her condition and treat her with anti-coagulants, said Philippe Reines, deputy assistant secretary of state. ""Her doctors will continue to assess her condition, including other issues associated with her concussion,"" Reines said. ""They will determine if any further action is required."" Reines did not specify where the clot was discovered. Clinton, 65, was suffering from a stomach virus earlier this month when she fainted due to dehydration, causing the concussion. Clinton spent the holidays with her family last week after working from home. She was scheduled to return to work at the State Department this week after being sidelined for the past three weeks. Her illness forced her to bow out of testifying December 20 before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns appeared in her place. The medical setback comes as Clinton is wrapping up her busy tenure as secretary of state, during which she has logged more than 400 travel days and nearly a million miles. She plans to step down from the post if and when Sen. John Kerry -- President Barack Obama's choice to replace her -- is confirmed by the Senate.

"Editor's note: Jeffrey A. Miron is senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University. A Libertarian, he was one of 166 academic economists who signed a letter to congressional leaders last week opposing the government bailout plan. Economist Jeffrey Miron says the bailout plan presented to Congress was the wrong solution to the crisis . CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Congress has balked at the Bush administration's proposed $700 billion bailout of Wall Street. Under this plan, the Treasury would have bought the ""troubled assets"" of financial institutions in an attempt to avoid economic meltdown. This bailout was a terrible idea. Here's why. The current mess would never have occurred in the absence of ill-conceived federal policies. The federal government chartered Fannie Mae in 1938 and Freddie Mac in 1970; these two mortgage lending institutions are at the center of the crisis. The government implicitly promised these institutions that it would make good on their debts, so Fannie and Freddie took on huge amounts of excessive risk. Worse, beginning in 1977 and even more in the 1990s and the early part of this century, Congress pushed mortgage lenders and Fannie/Freddie to expand subprime lending. The industry was happy to oblige, given the implicit promise of federal backing, and subprime lending soared. This subprime lending was more than a minor relaxation of existing credit guidelines. This lending was a wholesale abandonment of reasonable lending practices in which borrowers with poor credit characteristics got mortgages they were ill-equipped to handle. Once housing prices declined and economic conditions worsened, defaults and delinquencies soared, leaving the industry holding large amounts of severely depreciated mortgage assets. The fact that government bears such a huge responsibility for the current mess means any response should eliminate the conditions that created this situation in the first place, not attempt to fix bad government with more government. The obvious alternative to a bailout is letting troubled financial institutions declare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy means that shareholders typically get wiped out and the creditors own the company. Bankruptcy does not mean the company disappears; it is just owned by someone new (as has occurred with several airlines). Bankruptcy punishes those who took excessive risks while preserving those aspects of a businesses that remain profitable. In contrast, a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending. Thus, the bailout encourages companies to take large, imprudent risks and count on getting bailed out by government. This ""moral hazard"" generates enormous distortions in an economy's allocation of its financial resources. Thoughtful advocates of the bailout might concede this perspective, but they argue that a bailout is necessary to prevent economic collapse. According to this view, lenders are not making loans, even for worthy projects, because they cannot get capital. This view has a grain of truth; if the bailout does not occur, more bankruptcies are possible and credit conditions may worsen for a time. Talk of Armageddon, however, is ridiculous scare-mongering. If financial institutions cannot make productive loans, a profit opportunity exists for someone else. This might not happen instantly, but it will happen. Further, the current credit freeze is likely due to Wall Street's hope of a bailout; bankers will not sell their lousy assets for 20 cents on the dollar if the government might pay 30, 50, or 80 cents. The costs of the bailout, moreover, are almost certainly being understated. The administration's claim is that many mortgage assets are merely illiquid, not truly worthless, implying taxpayers will recoup much of their $700 billion. If these assets are worth something, however, private parties should want to buy them, and they would do so if the owners would accept fair market value. Far more likely is that current owners have brushed under the rug how little their assets are worth. The bailout has more problems. The final legislation will probably include numerous side conditions and special dealings that reward Washington lobbyists and their clients. Anticipation of the bailout will engender strategic behavior by Wall Street institutions as they shuffle their assets and position their balance sheets to maximize their take. The bailout will open the door to further federal meddling in financial markets. So what should the government do? Eliminate those policies that generated the current mess. This means, at a general level, abandoning the goal of home ownership independent of ability to pay. This means, in particular, getting rid of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with policies like the Community Reinvestment Act that pressure banks into subprime lending. The right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place. Someone has to pay for that. That someone should not be, and does not need to be, the U.S. taxpayer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Jeffrey Miron: Government encouraged lenders to relax their standards .

"As newly picked Ebola czar Ron Klain gets started, some are wondering if America could also use a new surgeon general. As Republicans criticize the Obama administration's appointment of Klain, Democrats are intensifying their push for a vote on the delayed nomination of Dr. Vivek Murthy for surgeon general. ""Given the public's increasing fears regarding the spread of the disease, it is imperative that we confirm a Surgeon General who will play a significant role in educating the American public about the disease and how to best protect their health,"" write Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee,  Judy Chu and Ami Bera and dozens of other House Democrats in a letter being sent this week to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""The American public would benefit from having a Surgeon General to disseminate information that is desperately needed."" Murthy, a doctor and entrepreneur from Boston, was nominated last fall after Vice Admiral Regina Benjamin stepped down. His pick ran into controversy because of some of his political advocacy and statements saying guns are a health care issue. In 2008 he co-founded a group Doctors for Obama which backed Barack Obama's campaign and his push for health care reform. The group later was re-named Doctors for America, which advocated for some gun control measures. In an editorial Thursday the Boston Globe said: ""It's a bad time to be without a surgeon general; dismayingly, Obama's appointment of Dr. Vivek Murthy of Brookline sank earlier this year because of [National Rife Association] opposition. But the president needs a confidence-inspiring figure to lead and explain the nation's Ebola efforts â€” or should be prepared to step into that role himself."" As the editorial notes, the nomination stalled after the NRA in February wrote to Reid and McConnell saying it ""strongly"" opposed Murthy. ""Given Dr. Murthy's lengthy history of hostility towards the right to keep and bear arms,"" the NRA said ""there is little reason to believe that he would not work to further a gun control agenda if confirmed as Surgeon General."" How much difference would a confirmed surgeon general make in the Ebola response? Currently there is an acting surgeon general, Rear Admiral Boris Lushniak, but he has not taken a major public role during this crisis. The job of surgeon general is not known as one of the most powerful health care positions in the administration. He or she reports to an assistant secretary of health, does not directly supervise any of the agencies responsible for dealing with the Ebola outbreak but does oversee a group of 6,800 uniformed public health professionals working for the government. ""It was stripped of its power in the 1960's,"" said author Mike Stobbe describing the power of office of the surgeon general. ""Since then the surgeon general has been a health educator, a spokesman. It has been up to the government how much reign they want to give that person,"" Stobbe, author of the book ""Surgeon General's Warning: How Politics Crippled the Nation's Doctor,"" added. In some past recent health crises either the Health and Human Services Secretary and/or the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been the frontline spokesmen for the government. So far Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who took over in June, has not publicly stepped out as a public voice of the government's response. She did one round of the network morning shows last week. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden instead has appeared on many television shows and been most commonly the administration's choice for briefing the public on the status of the Ebola outbreak in the U.S. Known as the ""nation's doctor,"" a confirmed surgeon general could fill a void as the administration's face on Ebola although as some former officials have said the office doesn't have much direct responsibility and is rather weak. The White House says however it wouldn't hurt. ""In terms of what role the surgeon general would play in this specific response, I guess what I would say about that is it's hard to imagine it would hurt, and that we would only benefit from a scenario where we had a dedicated public health professional who was involved in helping us communicate with hospitals and medical professionals all across the country to ensure that these protocols, the proper protocols, were in place and closely followed,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said last week. Some of those who have served in the job also said they had helped with government preparedness in past crises. ""As surgeon general I was involved in a lot of the training, education, working with my colleagues at [National Institutes of Health] and CDC to ramp up after 9/11 to ensure we had the best preparedness programs in place which included bio agents. The problem is after these things happen, our memories start to fade. Our government stops to fund programs. Research is not as robust as it should be and so on, so there's a rippling effect that goes out,"" Dr. Richard Carmona, who served in the job in the George W. Bush administration, told CNN's ""New Day"" last week. Stobbe said some of the most successful recent surgeon generals were independent and ""were willing to say what they thought the truth was even if it wasn't according to the script of the White House."" He specifically pointed to doctors who took prominent positions on issues which were not directly related to ongoing health care crises -- C. Everett Koop, who spoke out about smoking and AIDS and Jocelyn Elders, who was very public about her views on sexuality.","Dr. Vivek Murthy has been awaiting confirmation to be the next surgeon general since last fall.

"New York (CNN) -- New York police said Thursday that they will talk to an inmate who admitted to being part of the 1994 robbery and shooting of rapper Tupac Shakur. The  inmate was quoted on the website allhiphop.com this week admitting to  being a part of the attack and saying he was paid by a music  mogul for it. ""Detectives are going to speak to the individual,"" a New York Police spokesman said early Thursday morning. Shakur publicly blamed the 1994 attack, which occurred at a music studio  in New York, on Christopher ""Notorious B.I.G."" Wallace and Sean ""P-Diddy""  Combs. While Shakur survived the 1994 attack, he was fatally shot in Las Vegas in 1996. Wallace was shot and killed in 1997 in Los Angeles. Both murders have not been solved. The 1994 shooting and robbing of Shakur is viewed as sparking the infamous West Coast versus East Coast feud in rap music, which ultimately led to the shooting deaths of both Wallace and Shakur. The hip hop website named the inmate as Dexter Isaac and said he is an inmate currently  serving life in prison for an unrelated murder and robbery. Isaac apologized to Shakur's family for the incident and blamed it on the music mogul. CNN is witholding the music executive's name because he has not been reached for comment.

"Washington (CNN)On what was supposed to be the last day before summer recess, dysfunction reigned in Congress. House Republican leaders called off a vote Thursday on their $659 million emergency response to the border influx from Central America overwhelming immigration resources, unable to agree among themselves about what to do. That sparked a revolt in their caucus over doing nothing, which forced GOP leaders to delay the start of August break to discuss the matter further on Friday morning. And in the Senate, a $2.7 billion Democratic plan to respond to the immigrant surge failed in a procedural vote. Caucus revolt . Asked what happens now, Speaker John Boehner said he'd be working with his caucus. Asked if that would go into the night, he responded: ""Oh yeah."" The Senate measure fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance after Republicans opposed the measure because it didn't include any policy changes to make it easier to deport children back to Central America. Two moderate Democrats voted with Republicans to block the bill. The end result? Politicians eventually go home for five weeks to campaign for the November congressional elections without sending President Barack Obama legislation to address what both parties agree is a humanitarian crisis at the southern border. Volatile issue . Such inability to compromise, let alone even pass any kind of legislation, showed the volatility of the immigration issue in America just over three months before the November  elections. Obama asked for $3.7 billion in emergency funding to strengthen border security and speed up the processing of the tens of thousands of arrivals -- many unaccompanied minors -- from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in the past 10 months. House Republicans slashed that figure and added changes to a 2008 anti-trafficking law that would remove the guarantee of an immigration hearing for children arriving on their own from Central America. Facing Democratic opposition, GOP leaders needed almost all of their majority caucus to support the bill. However, many Republicans -- mostly conservatives -- argued against approving any new money and argued the measure failed to effectively limit Obama from acting on his own to allow illegal immigrants to stay in the country. Obama criticism . They contend he has failed to enforce immigration laws by halting deportations of some child immigrants who arrived years earlier. And they now expect further unilateral steps signaled by the White House that would allow more undocumented immigrants to work in the United States. After a partisan debate on the measure, an expected vote suddenly got canceled. A subsequent 90-minute GOP caucus meeting behind closed doors resulted in the decision to keep going on Friday to get something passed, participants said. ""I was prepared to be very critical of the decision to go home but thankfully the leadership is doing the right thing and saying we're going to get this thing through,"" said Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, while Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana described it as ""an emotional 'we've got to do something' kind of cheerleading event."" Several House Republicans told CNN that GOP leaders made it clear they won't hold a vote on the border bill until they knew it had enough support t pass, even it that took beyond Friday. Embarrassing result . It was an embarrassing result for Boehner and his new leadership team put together after former Majority Leader Eric Cantor's primary defeat last month, displaying the continuing deep divisions between conservative and more moderate House Republicans that has caused similar episodes in the past on other spending matters. ""This situation shows the intense concern within our conference -- and among the American people -- about the need to ensure the security of our borders and the President's refusal to faithfully execute our laws,"" the House Republican leadership said in a statement. In one of the political ironies of Washington, the GOP leaders called for Obama to take steps on his own to address the border issue without congressional approval, a day after voting to sue him for doing exactly that. ""There are numerous steps the President can and should be taking right now, without the need for congressional action, to secure our borders and ensure these children are returned swiftly and safely to their countries,"" the statement said. Shortly after, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted: ""By pulling their own bill, the House GOP once again proves why the President must act on his own to solve problems."" Unilateral action . White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama will do what he can to address immigration reform because House Republicans have refused to vote on a comprehensive measure passed last year by the Senate. ""The President can't do as much as Congress could do in terms of addressing some of these problems, but we're gonna figure out what exactly the law will allow the President to do and we're going to do as much as possible within the confines of the law to address a problem whose solution Republicans in Congress continue to actively block,"" Earnest said. He told reporters the Obama administration already shifted resources from the nation's interior to the border to try to speed up the processing of new arrivals. ""We have surged some technology to allow immigration judges and other ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) prosecutors and asylum officials the opportunity to try to whittle down the bottleneck or the backlog of immigration cases that currently exists,"" Earnest said. ""We've prioritized the cases of recent border crossers to try to process those cases more efficiently."" Senate challenges . Republicans led by conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama say Obama plans to unilaterally issue work permits to as many as 6 million immigrants living illegally in the United States, which the critics call a violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Sessions tried to get an amendment that would block such presidential action added to the Senate border legislation, but Democrats defeated his motion. However, Senate Democrats were unable later to secure the 60 votes necessary to overcome a budget challenge against the measure, which included $2.7 billion in immigration funding along with $900 million to fight U.S. wildfires and bolster Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. Sessions raised the budget challenge, noting the total $3.6 billion cost of the proposal would all be borrowed.

"The crash of a small plane in Nashville appears to be a familiar story: A pilot not authorized to fly in foul weather meanders into a foggy soup and tries to land. Things go wrong. The plane crashes. The pilot is killed. But in other respects, Tuesday's crash is anything but ordinary. The doomed Canadian pilot flies to a major airport apparently without radioing controllers. And when the plane crashes just off a main runway, erupting in fire, the crash goes undetected. By anyone. Likely for hours. On Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board painted some broad outlines to an accident picture that is begging for specific details. NTSB investigator Jay Neylon said the NTSB is focusing on a seven-hour window in which the Cessna 172R crashed along runway 2C at Nashville International Airport. The crash, he said, occurred sometime between 2 a.m. -- when an airport worker conducted a routine runway check  -- and 8:45 a.m. -- when a taxiing aircraft reported seeing ""debris on the runway.""  Rescue workers were dispatched and found the plane's sole occupant dead amid the fire-scarred wreckage. ""At this point we have no idea the exact time (of the crash),"" Neylon said. Neylon said the safety board had not yet determined whether the pilot attempted to contact air traffic controllers. ""We will look at everything in the investigation, and that does include air traffic control,"" he said. The pilot was Michael Callan, according to a source at the Ontario-based Windsor Flying Club, which owns the plane. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. The club previously said the pilot was a club member who rented the plane and planned to return it the next day. The accident is ""certainly a little unusual, to say the least,"" said Bruce Landsberg, president of the AOPA Foundation and Air Safety Institute. ""To have an airplane, even a small airplane, crash at a major airport and go unnoticed for quite a while does seem unusual,"" said Tom Haueter, former director of the NTSB's Office of Accident Investigation. Both men say the dense fog, which may have contributed to the crash, likely prevented controllers from seeing the incident. The control tower is roughly one mile from the end of Runway 2C, the crash site. But they said the crash raises intriguing questions about the actions of the pilot and controllers. ""My biggest question is Why? Why was the pilot there? Why wasn't he talking to anybody?"" said Landsberg. Aircraft are required to communicate with controllers when entering controlled airspace. Haueter echoed that thought. ""Whether it's day or night, when you're approaching an airport of this size and density, you have to start contacting controllers well in advance, usually from about 25 miles out... to let them know you're arriving,"" Haueter said. If the pilot was unfamiliar with Nashville airport's frequencies, he could have used a universal frequency to contact controllers, Landsberg said. Both men speculated that the pilot could have strayed into foul weather and been too preoccupied with flying the plane to contact the tower. The Federal Aviation Administration said the tower had normal staffing early Tuesday, but it declined to specify the number of controllers on duty. Landsberg and Haueter said the accident also raises questions about the air traffic controllers. ""How did the airplane get to the airport without the controller saying, 'Hey what is this guy doing out there?'"" Landsberg said. Said Haueter: ""Certainly this is an airport that has very good facilities. It has radar; it has lots of capabilities and how an aircraft could approach, possibly circle, we're hearing, then crash short of the runway, unnoticed for so long, does raise some questions."" David Gillies, president of Windsor Flying Club, said the pilot, who was unaccompanied, rented the club plane for an overnight trip. ""It is not usual for this individual to rent an airplane overnight,"" he said. The pilot was certified to fly under ""visual flight rules,"" allowing him to fly in fair weather, and was qualified to fly at night. But the pilot did not have an instrument rating allowing him to fly into weather systems, Gillies said. Gillies said Nashville airport officials told him the pilot ""circled"" over the airport ""for some time"" and that the plane crashed while trying to land about 2:30 a.m. ""They've indicated to us that they have tapes of him circling and that the time of his demise was about 2:30,"" he said. Airport officials have declined to discuss the accident in detail, citing the NTSB investigation. The Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority, in a statement, said ""the time of the crash has not been determined and reports to the contrary are not factual.  These facts will be determined as part of the NTSB investigation."" On Wednesday, the NTSB surveyed the crash site, investigator Neylon said. He plans to examine air traffic control tapes and radar soon.  And the NTSB will examine the pilot's flight records and interview his instructors. The investigation, Neylon said, is in the early stages, and it may take a year before the board determines a probable cause. Asked whether this wreck was anomalous, Neylon said, ""Every accident's unusual.""

"U.S. President Barack Obama wrapped up his visit to South Africa on Sunday with a visit to the prison cell where anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela was held and a call to students to help build a new Africa. Speaking at the University of Cape Town, Obama said a rising Africa offers new hope for a continent where more than 60% of the population is under 35. But he said Africa's economic growth and political progress in African states ""rests on a fragile foundation,"" still vulnerable to corruption, repression and inequality. ""Just like previous generations, you've got choices to make. You get to decide where the future lies,"" he said. ""You've got time and numbers on your side, and you'll be making decisions long after politicians like me have left the scene,"" he added. ""And I can promise you this: The world will be watching what decisions you make."" Obama told students that the American college campaigns against investment in apartheid-era South Africa in the 1980s inspired him to get involved in a public cause for the first time.  Cape Town University was the site of a famous speech by Sen. Robert F. Kennedy at the height of apartheid in 1966, and Obama said the leadership of figures like Kennedy, the now-ailing Mandela and Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi -- who began his career as a lawyer in South Africa -- ""stand as a challenge to your generation."" ""They tell you that your voice matters,"" he said. ""Your ideals, your willingness to act on those ideas, your choices can make a difference. And if there's any country in the world that shows the power of human beings to effect change, this is the one."" Obama spoke after touring Robben Island, where Mandela was held during most of his 27 years in prison for fighting South Africa's now-dismantled system of white minority rule and racial segregation. The president spent a few minutes in the cell where Mandela slept during that stretch, quietly contemplating the concrete walls and the mat that served as a bed. Veteran anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Kathrada, who had been imprisoned with Mandela on the island, was the first family's guide during the visit. Obama had visited the island prison once before, in 2006. Sunday's visit was the first for the family members who accompanied him -- first lady Michelle Obama; the couple's daughters, Sasha and Malia; Mrs. Obama's mother, Marian Robinson; and a cousin, Leslie Robinson. ""For me to be able to bring my daughters there and teach them the history of that place and this country ... that's a great privilege and a great honor,"" Obama told the students. Obama also visited the anti-HIV program now led by Desmond Tutu, the former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town and another leading anti-apartheid campaigner.  While Obama praised the center's battle against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, Tutu urged Obama to keep up his efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and close the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ""As you have been here before to Africa, you have heard us speak of something called 'ubunto,' "" Tutu said. ""Your success is our success. Your failure, whether you like it or not, is our failure. And so we want to show you that we pray for you to be a great success."" Mandela, 94, has been in a Pretoria hospital for more than three weeks and has been in critical condition since June 23. He was hospitalized for a lung infection that has plagued him since his days on Robben Island. Obama met some of Mandela's relatives Saturday and spoke by telephone with his wife, who maintains a vigil by his bedside. The president's decision not to visit the hospital was out of respect for the family's wishes, according to the White House. ""I expressed my hope that Madiba draws peace and comfort from the time that he is spending with loved ones and also expressed my heartfelt support for the entire family as they work through this difficult time,"" Obama said, referring to Mandela by his clan name. A meeting between the U.S. president and Mandela would have had historic significance. Like Obama, Mandela broke through racial barriers to become the first black president of his country. The two met when Obama was a senator. Mandela became an international figure for his fight against apartheid. He was elected to the nation's highest office in 1994, four years after his release from prison, and remains popular worldwide as an icon of peaceful reconciliation. Obama's visit to Africa's biggest economy is part of a three-nation trip that started in Senegal and will end in Tanzania this week. It aims to bolster U.S. investment opportunities, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy. It comes as China aggressively engages the continent, pouring billions of dollars into it and replacing the United States as Africa's largest trading partner. During the trip, Obama pledged $7 billion to help combat frequent power blackouts in sub-Saharan Africa. The ""Power Africa"" campaign aims to double access to electricity throughout the region, extending service to 20 million new businesses and homes, the White House said. ""Access to electricity is fundamental to opportunity in this age. It's the light that children study by, the energy that allows an idea to be transformed into a real business. It's the lifeline for families to meet their most basic needs, and it's the connection that's needed to plug Africa into the grid of the global economy,"" Obama said at Cape Town University. His visit also included a town hall with young people in Soweto, a Johannesburg neighborhood at the heart of the anti-apartheid struggle. He also held bilateral talks with South African President Jacob Zuma in Pretoria, with trade high on the agenda.","Obama tells students, ""The world will be watching what decisions you make""

"The first Iraq war combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at reducing the number of military veterans who commit suicide. No matter the cost of the measures urged in the sweeping bill, ""that is the cost of war,"" Democratic Sen. John Walsh of Montana told CNN. Every day, 22 veterans commit suicide. To Walsh, that is more than a number.  From 2004 to 2005, he commanded an infantry battalion of the Montana National Guard in Iraq. When the unit returned home, one of Walsh's soldiers committed suicide. When Walsh became adjutant general of the Montana National Guard, a few more guardsmen died by suicide. Read more at CNN's 'The Uncounted' ""Far too often, we're leaving our veterans to fight their toughest battles alone,"" Walsh said. ""Returning home from combat does not erase what happened there, and yet red tape and government dysfunction have blocked access to the care that saves lives. It is our duty to come together for real solutions for our heroes,"" Walsh told CNN on Thursday. The Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act is collaboration between Walsh and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Founded in 2004, IAVA is the first and largest organization for new veterans and their families, with 270,000 members nationwide. The next step for Walsh is to get a co-sponsor for the bill. He said he's already received bipartisan support behind the scenes. The veterans organization is working on getting a similar bill in the House, said IAVA political director Kate O'Gorman. What's in the bill? Among the bill's key objectives is to give veterans more time to receive mental health treatment. Currently, when a service member separates from active duty -- whether they are transitioning to being a veteran or becoming a Reservist or a member of the National Guard -- they have five years to receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, O'Gorman said. Sometimes it can take longer than five years for service members and veterans to realize they're experiencing the symptoms of  Post Traumatic Stress and other mental injuries. Read the bill (PDF) About 25% of IAVA's members, O'Gorman said, have experienced a delayed onset of PTSD after getting out of the service. Many times, five years is just not long enough for veterans who are dealing with the stigma of mental health issues. It can take many years to emotionally come to grips with the diagnosis alone, and then it takes time to find and receive the right care. To address that, Walsh's bill would extend the time to receive mental health treatment from five years to 15 years. Watch: Veteran talk about long struggle with PTSD before receiving help . The legislation also seeks to improve the quality of mental health care providers by making their jobs more competitive with the private sector, O'Gorman said. Right now there are more than 1,000 open jobs at the VA for mental health care jobs, including psychiatric nurses, physician assistants and psychiatrists, among others, she said. The bill will introduce a pilot initiative that would allow a student to have their loans repaid if they work for the VA, O'Gorman said. It also calls for annual reviews of care programs within the Defense Department and the VA to ensure resources are being used effectively to help service members and vets struggling with mental health issues. Further, the legislation points out that the VA and the Defense Department use two different computer systems and mandates that those systems be amended so that they speak to each other more seamlessly. The legislation would also try to streamline the way the Pentagon and the VA prescribe medication.  Currently, they use different drug prescription protocols, Walsh and military experts told CNN, and that can create a difficult situation. For example, a service member overcomes the hurdle of admitting they need care, seeks help from a DOD doctor and, after several tries, gets on a drug that works for him or her. When that warrior become a veteran, they go to a VA doctor only to be told that the drug the DOD doctor gave them is not available under VA protocols. The bill was introduced the same week that Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America held its annual Storm the Hill initiative. Teams comprised of four veterans whoses live have been rocked by a fellow warrior's suicide met with lawmakers in Washington. The veterans shared their stories, and implored those in power to do something substantial to address the problem. Dollar costs and mental costs . It's unclear how much it would cost to do everything the bill lays out, according to Andrea Helling, Walsh's spokeswoman.  Walsh is waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to provide a figure, she said. But the senator stressed that it will cost far more in years to come if changes are not made soon to improve mental health care. The legislation comes at a time of fierce belt tightening in the armed forces. In February, the Pentagon said it would reduce the size of the Army to pre-Word War II numbers, retire the a popular A-10 ""Warhog"" attack jet and reduce some benefits for warriors. ""This is a budget that recognizes the reality of the magnitude of our fiscal challenges, the dangerous world we live in, and the American military's unique and indispensable role in the security of this country and in today's volatile world,"" Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said in February. ""There are difficult decisions ahead,"" he said. ""That is the reality we're living with."" Downsizing due to modernization and budget constraints began under Hagel's predecessor, Robert Gates. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars are the longest continuous battles the United States has fought. The Iraq war lasted from 2003 to 2010 and Afghanistan has been raging since soon after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.  President Barack Obama has said that the United States could withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. More than 2 million Americans have served in combat in those two wars. Researchers estimate that as many as 300,000 service members may meet criteria for PTSD and between 200,000 and 300,000 have suffered a traumatic brain injury from mild to severe, according to Dr. Stephen Cozza with the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress. The nonprofit think-tank RAND Corporation estimates a third of veterans likely have TBI, PTSD or depression, which puts the overall number affected at around 600,000. A large body of research indicates PTSD is associated with increased likelihood of suicidal behavior. Beyond the bill . Walsh was sworn into the U.S. Senate in January after Montana Gov. Steve Bullock named Walsh, his lieutenant governor, to serve the remainder of Sen. Max Baucus' term after he became U.S. ambassador to China. Walsh is running for election in November. Walsh's legislation, IAVA's O'Gorman told CNN, has bipartisan support. And the goal is to get it passed by Memorial Day, far before an election is a concern. Walsh said lawmakers must also address suicides amongst military family members, too. The Pentagon is currently not tracking the number of suicides among relatives. CNN recently explored the topic and spoke to dozens of relatives who said they had contemplated or attempted killing themselves. Warrior suicides and military family member suicides are ""connected,"" Walsh said. Speaking about a warrior under his command who had been deployed three times whose wife was left to care for triplets, Walsh said he understood that families have been under extreme stress for years. The relatives have made ""enormous sacrifices,"" he said.","Sen. John Walsh has introduced legislation to reduce military suicides .

"(CNN) -- In life, Aaron Swartz was a force in creating today's Web, helping write game-changing code in his early teens before turning his attentions to Internet activism. In death, an apparent suicide that came as he faced federal charges that could have sent him to prison for decades, he became a martyr of sorts -- a champion for a new generation of believers that the Web, and the information on it, deserve to be free. Now, his story is the subject of a documentary film being released Friday. ""The Internet's Own Boy"" is a look at Swartz's life and untimely death at age 26. For director Brian Knappenberger, it's a tale that merges a captivating life story with a look at some of the most important legal, social and ethical issues of the digital age. ""On the one hand, it was a very compelling personal story that was just, by itself, inspirational and interesting but, ultimately tragic,"" said Knappenberger. ""Then there's this kind of sharp combination with the issues Aaron was involved in, which are really, really relevant for our time. ""I wanted to tell this personal, ultimately tragic, story that also touches on a broken criminal justice system, outdated computer laws"" and other issues, he said in a phone interview. 'Digital savant and wise elder' Swartz was a digital prodigy who helped craft the Internet we know today. By age 14, he had co-written the specifications for RSS -- a Web-publishing system for delivering content from frequently updated sites like blogs. As a teen, he was one of the architects of Creative Commons, writing code for the nonprofit devoted to letting creators make their works available for others to share and improve upon. At 19, after a single year at Stanford, he formed his own company, Infogami, which would merge with, and help create, Reddit -- the vast, freewheeling social-sharing site built on the foundation of free-expression and online anonymity. ""World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down,"" said World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee, in a tweet about the death of a man 31 years his junior. 'A legal nightmare' On January 6, 2011, Swartz was arrested by police officers from MIT and charged with breaking and entering for downloading more than 4 million documents from a campus digital library. Federal prosecutors tacked on wire fraud, computer fraud and other charges. In all, Swartz faced up to 35 years in prison and a $1 million fine if convicted. Supporters note that none of the documents he acquired included sensitive personal data or would have netted Swartz any financial gain. JSTOR, the digital library from which the documents came, declined to press charges and asked prosecutors to drop the case. Two years later Swartz was found hanged to death in his Brooklyn apartment, just two days after prosecutors had turned down his lawyer's second plea-bargain offer. ""He certainly was the kind of person who carried the weight of the world on his shoulders,"" Knappenberger said. ""While he was rousing the troops for this political cause, he was also going through this kind of personal hell."" His film notes that friends described depression-like symptoms in Swartz and that he suffered from ulcerative colitis, a painful intestinal condition similar to the one suffered by Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain, who killed himself in 1994. But Knappenberger feels it was the legal ordeal that pushed Swartz to his final desperate moments. ""I think it was the two-year legal nightmare that left him exhausted, emotionally and mentally,"" he said. ""I don't let the case off that easily. I think that, without this, we'd still have him."" 'A beautifully crafted film' ""The Internet's Own Boy"" was funded in part through a Kickstarter campaign and screened earlier this year at the Sundance and South by Southwest film festivals, where it got largely positive reviews. ""While the film borders on hagiography ... the celebration of what Swartz accomplished never feels forced or inauthentic,"" wrote Geoff Berkshire in Variety. ""Instead, 'The Internet's Own Boy' is a beautifully crafted film that opens a window on a world not everyone has entered yet, and exposes ways in which both the legal system and the U.S. government is lagging hopelessly behind technology."" Katherine Kilkenny, writing for IndieWire, said one of the film's running themes is the question of whether ""this generation's programming magicians"" will choose to use their power for purpose or profit. ""We often see stories of slight, sloppy-looking young coders like Swartz transformed into national icons by the tech industry, but rarely with such close attention to ethics,"" she wrote. ""Knappenberger has delivered a film brimming with outrage."" It's that sort of outrage that turned Swartz's death into a cause celebre among Internet-freedom advocates. Tributes after death . Multiple memorials were held for Swartz, from his hometown of Highland Park, Illinois, to Cooper Union in Manhattan to Capitol Hill, where attendees included U.S. senators and representatives who spoke out in favor of the freedom of information online. An online movement tagged #PDFtribute encouraged academics and others in the public sector to make their writings and other documents freely available online, and many did. Princeton University announced new scholarships in Swartz's name. He was posthumously named to the Internet Hall of Fame, and members of the ""hacktivist"" movement Anonymous hacked two MIT websites, posting calls that Swartz's death become a rallying point for the open-access movement. ""That was part of the reason I was so drawn to it,"" said Knappenberger, who had previously profiled Anonymous in the documentary ""We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists."" ""There was obviously this big wave of anger and frustration and sympathy that came out of the Internet after he died that was notably not there during his case. ""It wasn't just people who knew him. It was people from far beyond the online world where he was a celebrity. All kinds of people really responded to his story."" To those closest to him, the film is a bittersweet tribute. ""It's extremely difficult for me to watch,"" Aaron's father, Robert Swartz, told CNN. ""I think that Brian has done a wonderful job presenting who Aaron was, where he came from, what he tried to accomplish, and what kind of role model he represents to others who can use those skills rather than simply making money as a means to improve the world and make the world a better place."" ""The Internet's Own Boy"" premiered Thursday in Los Angeles and begins rolling out to theaters in more than 25 cities on Friday. It is being released simultaneously in multiple digital formats, including on Creative Commons, where it will be made available for any use that does not involve making a profit from it.

"One moment Monday morning, a Ukrainian flag still was flying over a military base in Ukraine's Crimea region -- the base's commander reportedly kidnapped by pro-Russian troops the day before. Later Monday, masked troops were at the base, and the Ukrainian flag was gone. The bloodless incursion by apparently pro-Russian forces onto the Ukrainian base in the city of Bakhchisaray -- amid disputed accounts over whether the base commander had switched sides -- was one of the latest encounters between pro-Moscow troops who are consolidating their hold on the Black Sea peninsula and Ukrainian forces who still are there. The incident at the base came a day after German Chancellor Angela Merkel bluntly told Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone the Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia is illegal and would violate Ukraine's constitution if it goes ahead on March 16. Legal or not, Crimean referendum will shape Ukraine crisis . Putin has defended breakaway moves by pro-Russian leaders in Crimea, where Russian forces have been tightening their grip on a region that has been the epicenter of a battle for influence among Moscow, Kiev and the West since Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's ouster last month. Pro-Russian forces last week pushed into the autonomous region in a bloodless siege, prompting criticism from Western nations and Ukraine's interim government. Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities, putting the two countries on a collision course over control of Crimea, which has longstanding ties to Russia and has thousands of Russian troops stationed there. Putin has said Russia has the right to protect Russians living in the former Soviet republic. As tensions mount, Ukraine's armed forces carried out training exercises to test their readiness, the country's Defense Ministry said. Citing televised comments made by Defense Minister Ihor Tenyukh on Sunday, it said the army was not calling for full mobilization, as diplomacy was still the preferred method to resolve the crisis. The Prime Minister of the autonomous region, Sergey Aksenev, was recently appointed commander-in-chief by the region's parliament, giving him the power to form an army, government spokeswoman Ekaterina Polonchuk told CNN. Aksenev told the Interfax news agency that the decision to form a military stems from ""the presence of illegal armed groups in the territory of Crimea,"" comments confirmed to CNN by Polonchuk. So far, it appears a small number of men have joined the new army. Opinion: Five myths about the crisis . Masked troops at Ukrainian base . Monday's appearance of masked troops at the Bakhchisaray base came a day after a pro-Russian group appeared to have kidnapped base commander Vladimir Sadovnik at a checkpoint, according to the Ukrainian military. When a CNN crew visited the base Monday morning, the Ukrainian military was in charge, but Sadovnik still was missing. The deputy commander said that if ""they to try blackmail us into giving up the base, it won't happen."" Three hours later, the crew returned to the base, and the Ukrainian flag was no longer flying there. Masked gunmen were on the property, looking at the crew from the other side of a fence. The deputy commander told CNN said 15 gunmen came to the base with Sadovnik, and that the gunmen were planning to take vehicles from the base. CNN was not allowed inside. What Sadovnik did upon his return is disputed. Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said Sadovnik had switched allegiance and persuaded some of the Ukrainian troops there to join him. Sadovnik and the men who joined him loaded trucks with fuel, radios and other goods to take away from the base, according to Seleznyov. But Sadovnik, talking later to CNN by phone, denied Seleznyov's account. He said his kidnappers allowed him to return to the base, and that he still was loyal to Ukraine. He said pro-Russian forces did ask Ukrainian troops at the base to change sides Monday, but that he did no such thing. He said he still was at the base; CNN couldn't immediately verify his location. The control of base wasn't immediately clear Monday.  Seleznyov said both Ukrainian and Russian flags were flying at the base late Monday afternoon. Putin earlier this month secured permission from his parliament to use military force to protect Russian citizens in Ukraine. The move came days after Yanukovych's flight from the country. Yanukovych was ousted after three months of protests against his decision to spurn a free trade deal with the European Union and turn toward closer ties with Moscow. Are the Russians listening? At the United Nations, French Ambassador Gerard Araud told reporters the situation in Crimea ""is worsening by the day."" Russian troops are being reinforced and Moscow appears ready to annex the region, he said after a Security Council session Monday afternoon. ""(The session) was a call to the Russians: We want to negotiate. We want a political settlement. Please don't worsen this crisis,"" Araud said. But he added, ""The Russians are not showing any signal that they are listening to us -- not only to the Security Council, but to all the heads of state and government."" And British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said no ""free and fair"" vote could be held ""while Crimea is under the illegal control of Russian troops and armed militias who are denying access to international monitors."" ""In the light of these concerns, if the referendum goes ahead on the 16th of March, its results must be considered illegal and illegitimate by all nations,"" Grant said. Opinion: Clock is ticking on Crimea crisis . Propaganda war . Earlier, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said a group of about 20 pro-Russian activists from the so-called Crimea self-defense squads had broken into the military hospital in the region's main administrative city, Simferopol, and thrown out its chief. In a later statement, it said the hospital chief was back at work after negotiations but added the premises were being blockaded by the activists. However a CNN team that traveled to the hospital found it very quiet, with no one around. A guard on duty said he had not heard or seen anything unusual and that there was no senior official to speak with as Monday was a public holiday. In the course of the rapidly changing events of the past week, a propaganda war over Ukraine has quickly developed as each side seeks to strengthen its stance. Scenes of balaclava-wearing men without insignia patrolling streets or other premises have now become a familiar sight in the region. Reports of confrontations weren't limited to Crimea. In the eastern mainland Ukrainian city of Lugansk, just a few kilometers west of the Russian border, 50 to 60 pro-Russian activists burst into an IRTA TV station building on Monday, editor-in-chief Katerina Rakova said. The intruders initially threatened to burn the building if they weren't allowed to broadcast. But they eventually left, warning that they would return if they are dissatisfied with the station's news broadcasts about pro-Russian demonstrations in Lugansk, Rakova said. Russia, meanwhile, accused far-right groups Monday of ""conniving"" with the new authorities in Ukraine. In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry condemned ""lawlessness"" in eastern Ukraine and accused the West of being silent over violence and detentions taking place against Russian citizens, such as one incident last week when it said masked gunmen fired on and injured peaceful protesters. On Monday afternoon, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""increasingly alarmed"" by developments in Ukraine. ""Recent events in Crimea in particular have only served to deepen the crisis.  As tensions and mistrust are growing, I urge all sides to refrain from hasty actions and provocative rhetoric,"" he said.","French U.N. ambassador says Russia isn't listening to anyone .

"(CNN)Alabama's governor apologized for what he called an ""unfortunate use of excessive force"" by a police officer against an Indian man, even as the officer in question pleaded not guilty to assault. Gov. Robert Bentley wrote a letter to the consul general of India in Atlanta, Ajit Kumar, offering an apology to the government of India for the ""tragic incident."" Bentley was referring to an encounter where a Madison County, Alabama, police officer forced a 59-year-old man to the ground, causing partial paralysis. ""I wish to assure you and the government of India that we will see that justice is done,"" Bentley wrote. On Tuesday, the officer, Eric Parker, entered a plea of not guilty in court. Parker, 26, has been charged with third-degree assault, a Class A misdemeanor. He waived arraignment, according to Limestone County court documents. CNN reached out to Parker's attorney, Robert Tuten, for comment, but didn't get an immediate response. Parker posted bail of  $1,000 last week and was released from jail. Sureshbhai Patel needed spinal fusion surgery to repair damage to his back after Parker forced him to the ground. Video from the dash cameras of two police cars recorded the encounter, which took place the morning of February 6. Patel was walking through a neighborhood in Madison when Parker and another officer answered a call about a suspicious man. When police responded, there was a language barrier. Patel, who is helping take care of his developmentally delayed 17-month-old grandson, speaks little English. A police statement said Patel was taken to the ground after officers attempted to pat the subject down and he attempted to pull away. An attorney for the Patel family said Tuesday the grandfather was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on  Monday. ""He has a long, difficult and uncertain rehabilitation process ahead of him,"" Hank Sherrod wrote in an email to CNN. A trial by judge is scheduled for April 29.","Eric Parker was released last week after posting $1,000 bail .

"It's ""just the tip of the iceberg."" That's what a congressional committee chairman investigating allegations of delayed care and cooked books at Veterans Affairs health care facilities told CNN. Rep. Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican who heads the House Veterans Affairs panel, on Thursday forecast more serious developments in the national program serving nearly 9 million veterans. ""We've received some information and some tips that will make what has already come look like kindergarten stuff,"" he told CNN's New Day. The controversy has broadened since CNN first reported six months ago on allegations of alarming shortcomings within the VA medical care system that potentially have had deadly consequences in dozens of cases. Developments taking shape on Thursday included a meeting later in the day between embattled Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki and the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Richard Durbin of Illinois. Shinseki, who has come under pressure from some quarters to step down, told reporters after the meeting that he has not offered his resignation to President Barack Obama, who is standing by him. He later issued a statement to the nation's veterans stressing that the entire matter is the subject of an internal review and an independent investigation. ""The reports of veterans' negative experiences while seeking VA care are of great personal concern to me"" and promised action if ""any allegations under review are substantiated,"" he said. ""As we approach our observance of Memorial Day and its special significance to our nation, VA is re-doubling its efforts, with integrity and compassion, to earn your trust,"" he added. No shows at meeting . The top Republican in Congress weighed in on Thursday with his concerns about allegations of systemic problems at the VA. ""I have not called for General Shinseki to resign although I have to admit I am getting a little closer,"" said House Speaker John Bohener. ""But here is the point: This isn't about one person. This isn't about the secretary. It is about the entire system underneath him."" Also on Thursday, Robert Jesse, the VA deputy undersecretary, met with members of the House Health Care and Wellness Committee, but three senior VA officials asked to meet with Miller's committee didn't show up. The VA said the committee didn't give it enough notice, an explanation Miller called disingenuous. ""My intent is to go ahead and subpoena them"" for a hearing before his committee on May 30, Miller said. The officials were identified as Dr. Thomas Lynch, an assistant undersecretary for health and clinical operations; Joan Mooney, an assistant secretary for congressional and legislative affairs, and Michael Huff, a congressional relations officer. Miller has accused the VA of failing to adequately respond to his panel's May 8 subpoena, which included a request for information about the alleged destruction of a secret waiting list for care at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System. In a statement to CNN, the VA said it ""is committed to working with the committee to provide relevant information expeditiously"" and that it has ""produced over 3,000 pages of documents to the committee"" so far. Separately, Sen. Marco Rubio sought to advance a proposal that would change federal rules to make it easier to fire VA executives. Similar legislation was approved by the House on Wednesday. Rubio said that Shinseki should have the power to hold people accountable. ""Give the secretary the power to fire employees underneath him who are not doing their jobs,"" he said. ""This is a matter of urgency."" Obama speaks out . The overall scandal prompted a response on Wednesday from Obama, who expressed dismay and demanded accountability, but also said he needed more time to find out what was going on. ""If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it, period,"" Obama said. Obama noted that the public wants a ""swift reckoning"" on the VA issue, but he defended the record of his administration and Shinseki. Hospital delays are killing war veterans . On Wednesday, it was disclosed that some veterans hurt in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan are being made to wait for months to be seen in Phoenix, despite a mandate that they be give priority, according to a VA doctor. Dr. Katherine Mitchell, the medical director of the Phoenix VA's post-deployment clinic, outlined the allegations on CNN's ""AC 360."" Probing record keeping, lists . CNN reported last month that in Phoenix, the department used fraudulent record-keeping -- including the alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. The list in Phoenix was part of an alleged scheme designed by VA managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources. Overall, the number of VA facilities under investigation has expanded to 26, the agency's Office of Inspector General said Tuesday. An internal VA memo from 2010 showed officials warned of ""inappropriate scheduling practices"" to cover up excessive waits for veterans four years ago. But the CNN investigation shows such practices have continued. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care, and the agency's inspector general has launched an investigation of the Phoenix allegations that involve up to 40 other deaths. At a Senate hearing last week, the inspector general said his investigation so far found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in Phoenix but added there was no evidence that excessive waiting was the reason. Obama said Wednesday that the cooked books and excessive waits applied more to veterans with chronic conditions who are among the 85 million VA appointments each year instead of those needing emergency attention.

"The United States is offering its help, but making clear that the Nigerian government must take the lead in finding more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. Officials told CNN the Obama administration is sharing intelligence with Nigerian authorities and could provide other assistance, but there is no planning to send U.S. troops. With a World Economic Forum gathering set to begin Wednesday in Abuja, the Nigerian government came under mounting pressure to save the girls abducted in the country's remote northeast and threatened with being sold into slavery. On a trip to Africa, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States ""will do everything possible to support the Nigerian government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the perpetrators to justice."" In Washington, U.S. officials offered few specific details on American help being provided. ""We are going to keep working with the Nigerians privately on that,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters. ""Obviously they have come out very publicly and said that they are, you know, making every effort to find these girls. I just don't think we are going to outline how we are helping them. What we are focused on is making sure they can find (the girls) and bring them home to their families."" No U.S. troops . Harf noted that Sarah Sewall, the undersecretary of state for civilian security, democracy and human rights, would be traveling to Nigeria in coming days. Asked if she anticipated U.S. troops or other assets getting sent to Nigeria, Harf replied: ""I do not."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama has been briefed on the situation a few times. Carney also listed a series of U.S. programs and steps in Nigeria, most predating the latest kidnappings, intended to strengthen its criminal justice system, improve its ability to combat improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and expand economic opportunity for women. ""There are other things, I am sure ... but this is an outrage and a tragedy and we are doing what we can to assist the Nigerian government to support its efforts to find and free the young women who were abducted,"" he said. According to two senior U.S. officials, Nigerian authorities so far have not asked for specific help in any kind of possible joint rescue mission. One of the officials said the Nigerians privately indicated they want to handle the situation themselves, perhaps because they don't want visible American forces in their country. ""We are sharing intelligence that may be relevant to this situation,"" said another U.S. official with direct knowledge of the situation, speaking on condition of not being identified due to the sensitive nature of the information. ""You are going to see a focus on this in all three channels of government: diplomatic, intelligence and military."" Sharing intelligence . The United States could offer satellite imagery and electronic intelligence such as communications intercepts in the effort to rescue the kidnapped girls. Another American official said the U.S. military is not planning to send troops, but could consider helping Nigerian forces with any planning for a rescue mission, under existing military cooperation agreements. U.S. Africa Command has long been helping Nigerian forces improve their training and operations to counter Boko Haram militants. Last week, the State Department's annual report on global terrorism described Boko Haram as a group that ""espouses a violent Sunni extremist ideology"" and has received funding from al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb. The United States designated Boko Haram a terrorist organization last November, said the report, which blamed the group for attacks in northern and northeastern Nigeria that have killed thousands of people since 2009. Among the most notorious attacks by Boko Haram were a 2011 bombing at a United Nations building in Abuja that killed more than 20 people, and a wave of bombings in Kano, Nigeria, in 2012 that killed 180 people in one day, the State Department report said. The group also has freed prisoners and killed students and soldiers in other attacks, and kidnapped French citizens in neighboring Cameroon, according to the report. Link to al Qaeda affiliates . Boko Haram ""receives the bulk of its funding from bank robberies and related criminal activities, including extortion and kidnapping for ransoms,"" as well as the al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb funding, the report added. According to U.S. authorities, Boko Haram has gotten training in weapons and communications from AQIM as well as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Last week, Attorney General Eric Holder asked U.S. intelligence agencies to prepare a report for him on the latest schoolgirl kidnappings in Nigeria, an American law enforcement official told CNN. The attorney general also requested an assessment of Boko Haram that could help the Justice Department seek indictments or curtail funding sources for the group. The name Boko Haram means ""Western education is sin,"" and a video made public Monday showed a man claiming to be Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau saying the kidnapped girls should get married instead of going to school. ""I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,"" the man says in the video first obtained by Agence France-Presse. Selling humans . ""There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women,"" he continues, according to a CNN translation from the local Hausa language. According to accounts, armed members of Boko Haram overwhelmed security guards at a school in northeastern Borno state, pulled the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks. The convoy then disappeared into a forest bordering Cameroon. The total number kidnapped was 276, according to Nigerian authorities. At least 53 escaped, leaving 223  missing, police said. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said Sunday that his government would free the girls. In Washington, a group of U.S. senators from both parties has introduced a resolution condemning the kidnappings and calling for the United States to help the Nigerian government improve school security and go after Boko Haram. The resolution stops short of calling for sending American troops, instead urging ""timely civilian assistance"" from the United States and allied African nations to help rescue the abducted girls. ""Attacking and abducting young women simply for going to school is despicable and must never be tolerated,"" Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, said in a statement. ""The international community must make clear that all children deserve the chance to pursue an education without fear and that those responsible for these heinous crimes will be held accountable."" 6 reasons why the world should demand action .

"(CNN) -- Last year, 27-year-old Grant Gadoci declared that he needed a year off of work. ""I love traveling,"" said Gadoci, who works for the software company HotSchedules. ""So here, if you need to take time off, you send an e-mail notification, and they say, 'have a good time!' "" Gadoci took his boss up on an offer for a leave of absence and moved to Italy. He's now back in the office, working in sales, after his year off. ""They recognized that work-life balance, for many people, is just the definition of being a happy worker,"" Gadoci said. Unlimited paid vacation -- as long as you still get your work done -- is one of the many perks Gadoci enjoys at Austin, Texas-based HotSchedules. The company also provides its young staff members with a massage chair, a pingpong table, a tricked-out gaming suite including ""Rock Band,"" and a monthly cookout served by the boss. Gen-Y'ers: Delaying adulthood . HotSchedules CEO Ray Pawlikowski, who founded the company in 1999, says that catering to Gen-Y workers is smart business. Thirty-nine of his 65 employees are under the age of 32. ""If you create an environment like we have here, which is a fun place to come work, and you engage them and you really capture their attention, they're fantastic employees,"" Pawlikowski said. Who is this new breed of worker, and why do companies like HotSchedules pamper them? Generation Y, or millennials, make up roughly 50 million 18- to 30-year-olds. According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study on social trends, this generation is on course to become the most educated in history and, in a decade or so, will account for nearly half the employees in the world. Dr. John Butler, a University of Texas professor, has conducted extensive research on innovation and millennials. He says one defining characteristic of millennials is their short attention spans. ""I think that Gen-Y does not expect necessarily to be tied to a job,"" Butler said. That's a gutsy decision for a generation with 13 percent unemployment. ""The big one I hear about, and I'm guilty too, is a sense of entitlement,"" said Gen-Y consultant Jason Dorsey, who rakes in up to $25,000 per speech teaching Fortune 500 companies how to work with his generation. ""It's showing up and just feeling like people owe you things,"" the 33-year-old says. Dorsey adds that some millennials also have a hard time dealing with negative feedback. He says it stems from the way many were raised. ""The reality is, we've had parents who have told us how great we are since we were kids, you know. We listen to Baby Einstein to get smarter. We go to school and suffer from grade inflation, and if we didn't get an A, we went and negotiated. We've built up our self-esteem, and the result is, we can't deal with adversity,"" Dorsey said. Millennials: Marriage ideal but parenthood the priority . Why would anyone even want to hire millennials? Are they worth the trouble? ""We want to make a difference from day one, which is totally huge. We show up, and that's why we think we should be vice president,"" joked Dorsey. ""Gen-Y brings a lot of valuable skill sets in terms of thinking outside the box. We don't know what status quo means, but we know that if something doesn't work, we're going to speak up about it."" Dorsey has words of wisdom for companies like HotSchedules that employ a multitude of Gen-Yers: ""When millennials show up at the office, you have to provide specific examples of what you expect. And the reason is, we often lack real world experience. So we may have degrees and big expectations, but we don't necessarily know what 'business casual' means. ""You have to give feedback to millennials at least once a month. Other generations were taught if your boss is talking to you, you're doing something wrong. Millennials were taught the exact opposite: If your boss isn't talking to you, you're doing something wrong."" HotSchedules boss Pawlikowski swears by his staff. ""I think the biggest thing is that they bring a new level of dedication that we haven't seen in the past."" And his Gen-Y employees, including Gadoci, may have a better perspective on life than generations before them. ""I want to make sure I'm doing things that make me happy,"" Gadoci said. ""So if it means maybe starting a little bit later down a long career path, then I'm absolutely going to take that opportunity to enjoy life."" Perhaps Dorsey sums up the Gen-Y work attitude best: ""The truth is, millennials just want something they can put on Facebook!"" CNN's Poppy Harlow contributed to this report.","HotSchedules gives workers unlimited paid vacation -- if they get work done .
Generation Y, or millennials, account for roughly 50 million 18- to 30-year-olds .

"In an announcement that triggered massive jubilation among supporters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi was declared Egypt's new president Sunday. Morsi had more than 13 million votes in a run-off election, while Ahmed Shafik, who served as the last prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak, had more than 12 million, election officials said. Who is Mohamed Morsi? Egypt's largest Islamist party, the Muslim Brotherhood, lost its grip on legislative power earlier this month after the country's highest court declared parliament invalid. The Brotherhood dominated parliamentary elections in December, winning about half the seats. But Egypt's interim military rulers -- who have long been at odds with the Brotherhood -- declared full legislative authority in the aftermath of the ruling. However, Morsi's victory in the presidential election puts the party in a position to reclaim power. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? The Muslim Brotherhood is a religious and political group founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion, but a way of life. It advocates a move away from secularism, and a return to the rules of the Quran as a basis for healthy families, communities, and states. The movement officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals. However, offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past, and critics blame the Brotherhood for sparking troubles elsewhere in the Middle East. Many consider it the forerunner of modern militant Islamism. When was it created? The Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years. It was formed there by Hassan al-Banna in 1928. Teacher Al-Banna and his followers were initially united by a desire to oust the British from control in Egypt, and to rid their country of what they saw as ""corrupting"" Western influences. What is its history? In its early years, the group concentrated on religion, education and social services, but as its membership grew, it moved into the political sphere, organizing protests against the Egyptian government. In the 1940s, an armed wing of the Brotherhood was blamed for a string of violent acts, including the assassination of Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmud Fahmi al-Nuqrashi in 1948 -- shortly after he had ordered the dissolution of the MB. Al-Banna himself was assassinated soon afterwards -- his supporters claimed he had been killed on the wishes of the government. The movement went underground in the 1950s, and decades of oppression by successive Egyptian rulers led many of the Brotherhood's members to flee abroad, while others were jailed. The MB grew throughout the 1980s as part of a general growth of interest in Islam, and the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 saw a spike in membership. Why is it important in Egypt? The Brotherhood is the oldest and largest opposition group in Egypt. It has widespread support among Egypt's middle classes, and its members control many of the country's professional organizations. Up until last year, it was illegal under Egyptian law banning all parties based on religion. But in December, it dominated parliamentary elections, winning about half of the seats up for grabs. How influential is the Brotherhood elsewhere? There are branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in countries across the Middle East and North and East Africa, including Sudan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. There is also a branch in the U.S. Its offshoots outside Egypt are markedly more conservative in their views: The Kuwaiti branch is said to oppose the right of women to vote. Sayyid Qutb, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the 1950s and 1960s, developed the doctrine of jihad, and the radical group Hamas is believed to be an offshoot of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood.","The Muslim Brotherhood has been part of Egyptian politics for 80 years .

"Eight people were arrested outside the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department on Sunday night when demonstrations grew violent yet again, police say. Each was charged with failure to disperse and resisting arrest, Lt. Ron Miesner of Missouri Highway Patrol said. Only one of those arrested was from Ferguson; the others were from elsewhere in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Three were from St. Louis, one was from Richmond Heights, one was from Florissant, one was from Bridgeton and one was homeless, he said. Protests erupted last month following Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson's fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. They quickly devolved into nights of looting, vandalism and violence before the tenor of the protests eventually calmed. Last week, the burning of a memorial near the site where Brown was killed reignited the demonstrations. Sunday night's protests unfolded in front of the police station, about 2 miles from the five-lane drag that typically plays host to the demonstrations. While previous protests at the police station have been largely peaceful, some demonstrators among a crowd of about 150 people began throwing rocks and bottles at officers around 10 p.m., according to CNN affiliate KTVI. No injuries were reported. The eight people arrested were taken to a nearby jail, booked and released, KTVI reported. Details emerge in officer's shooting . Details also emerged about the circumstances surrounding the shooting of a Ferguson police officer at a community center on Saturday. The suspect was pointing a gun at the officer's chest when the officer pushed it away, a law enforcement official said. That's when the gun went off, the official said, striking the officer in his left arm. With his right arm, the officer pulled out another weapon that he used to shoot at the suspect, the official said. The officer's wound was not life-threatening, and he was released from a local hospital after being treated. Authorities have said there's no reason to believe the shooting was connected with demonstrations over the August police shooting of Brown. But the shooting stoked emotions among protesters who were on the street demonstrating over Brown's death. The officer had been working for the Ferguson Police Department for several years, the official said. Authorities haven't released a description of the suspect, the official said, because it was dark at the community center and the event unfolded quickly. The officer was wearing a body camera at the time of the shooting, according to the Saint Louis County sheriff's office, but it was ""not activated,"" officials said. That's because the officer wasn't ""in contact with the public"" when the shooting occurred, the law enforcement official said.","Details emerge in officer's shooting over the weekend .

"China's space plans are ambitious, incremental and extensive. Should Americans be worried that China will overtake us in both space exploration and military capability in space? No, not yet. This week, China successfully achieved its first manned space docking with the launch of the Shenzhou 9 spacecraft that carried two men and China's first female astronaut. Part one of China's Project 921, a 30-year plan for space exploration that was approved in 1992, is complete. This is progress, indeed. Project 921 is the result of China's fear of being left behind in the development of space technology.  Part one was about attaining human spaceflight. Part two -- which is where China is now -- focuses on testing  advanced technologies, like maneuvering and docking. Part three envisions a large (about 20 tons, the size of Skylab) space station. China sends first female astronaut to space . A manned mission to the moon was never included in the plan and has only recently become a topic of discussion in China. When talks do come up of putting a Chinese on the moon as early as 2016, they can rile U.S. officials and engender international prestige for China, especially as the U.S. space program appears to be floundering. But China is not overtaking the United States in space. It is, however, advancing. The execution of China's space program has led to ""tortoise and hare"" comparisons with the United States. During the Apollo phase, the United States advanced very quickly, launching many missions which culminated in reaching the moon by a decade's end. In contrast, China launches a mission about every two years, but takes large steps with each one and has a much longer timeline for achieving its goals. What China has that the United States lacks -- and what may give the Chinese an advantage over the long run -- is patience. China's path to space is not without obstacles, though. Launching their large space station will require a new heavy lift vehicle, the Long March 5, which is still in development and behind schedule. And China's ambitions do not come with an unlimited budget, even though it has already spent billions. In response, the U.S. needs to keep moving forward. The Obama administration's decision to redirect the civilian space program to a private-public partnership is smart. A space exploration program fully funded by the government is unsustainable. The recent use of the privately developed Flacon-9/Dragon duo to resupply the International Space Station indicates that if the private sector can handle low-Earth orbit needs, then over time NASA can focus its limited budget on new, more distant exploration goals. But Americans are not known for patience. The real danger for the United States is in ceding space exploration and leadership to China because it lacks the political will to proceed at a steady, supportable pace. This will have broad strategic implications. Complicating the issue is the largely dual-use nature of space technology, which can be used for both civilian and military purposes. And it is difficult to discern whether military space assets are intended for offense or defense. The difference between a rocket and a missile is considerable in political considerations, but nominal in terms of technology. A country that possesses missile defense could also use it as a weapon. So what can be done if we need to protect our space assets? One thing is clear -- weapons are not the answer. China's irresponsible 2007 anti-satellite weapon test exponentially increased the amount of space debris in orbit, which is dangerous to operating satellites. Space debris is now recognized by all countries (and militaries) as a threat to space assets. An International Space Code of Conduct is being discussed in the United Nations. It would state what responsible spacefaring nations consider acceptable behaviors in space. Though legally nonbinding, it would be a first step toward maintaining the sustainability of the space environment for use by all. The United States largely knows what space technology China possesses, but it doesn't know what China's intentions are. The United States should try to better understand China's space goals. However, NASA is prohibited by law from working with China. This makes no sense. If one believes that China and the United States are not inherently enemies, then working together on space projects -- with technology transfer controls -- will benefit both countries. If one believes that China is inherently a threat to the United States, then the adage ""keep your friends close and your enemies closer"" comes to mind. The script for U.S.-China relations -- and space relations in particular -- is constantly evolving. The United States can influence the direction, but only if we engage and persuade the Chinese to engage with us. It's one way of preventing a scenario of a galactic Wild West in which China has become the world's leader in space. Historic Chinese space mission docks successfully .

"Egyptian forces have killed nearly three dozen people so far in its fight against jihadis in the volatile Sinai peninsula, the army said Saturday. The deaths occurred during an ongoing Egyptian operation against militants near the Palestinian territory of Gaza, a military spokesman said, according to state media. Sinai has fallen into a state of lawlessness since the uprising that toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last year. Both Israel and the United States have voiced their concern about the rise of terrorist cells in the Sinai. Soldiers killed 32 suspected terrorists and destroyed 31 tunnels connecting Gaza and Egypt since a military offensive in the region began last month, said spokesman Col. Ahmad Mohamed Ali. Scores of tunnels have been used for smuggling everyday goods to Palestinian civilians because of an Israeli trade strictures. Weaponry has also been smuggled. Gaza tunnel economy hit by clampdown . Ali said soldiers have seized unmanned drones to be used for attacks. They also confiscated rifles, anti-aircraft machine guns, mortar launchers, artillery ammunition, anti-tank mines, and vehicles. Troops have arrested several dozen people. Israeli and Egyptian authorities have coordinated to allow the helicopter gunships and heavy machinery into the demilitarized zone in accord with the Camp David agreement signed in 1979. Ali said the military operations don't breach the treaty. Once called Operation Eagle, now Operation Sinai, the offensive started after more than a dozen Egyptian soldiers were killed and seven others were wounded in an August 5 attack near the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. The assailants stole two armored vehicles from Egyptian forces and tried to enter Israel. Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has visited the Gaza border and vowed to bring justice to those affected. He dismissed several security officials and the governor of North Sinai province in the wake of the attack.","More than 30 people have been killed, Egyptian forces said .

"Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected president, has been ousted from office just over a year into his presidency. Deposed by the military and reportedly held under house arrest, Morsy's fall from power has been nothing if not rapid. Egypt's powerful military stepped in July 3, hours after a deadline the generals had set for Morsy to order reforms expired. The military's intervention followed days of opposition protests, during which hundreds of thousands of people massed in Cairo's Tahrir Square and elsewhere to demand that he step down and call fresh presidential elections, or face a campaign of civil disobedience. The news of Morsy's downfall prompted further mass street demonstrations, with both his opponents and his supporters turning out to celebrate, or protest, his ouster. Protests turn deadly as deadline looms for Morsy . Morsy, who is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest and best-organized political movement, insists he remains the country's legitimate leader. As the deadline neared, he offered to form an interim coalition government to oversee parliamentary elections and revise the constitution that was enacted in January. But Egypt's top military officer, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, said he ""did not achieve the goals of the people"" and had failed to meet the generals' demands that he share power with his opposition. So where did it all go wrong? A strict Islamist educated in southern California, Morsy was elected Egypt's president in June 2012 after a campaign focused on appealing to the broadest possible audience. But critics say he became increasingly authoritarian and forced through a conservative agenda during his year in power. He is also blamed for failing to revive Egypt's economy, which crashed when the 2011 uprising, which toppled longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak, drove tourists away. That led many of his supporters among Egypt's poor and middle class to become disaffected, said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics, speaking before Morsy fell. ""That some of the revolutionaries are calling on the army to return to politics is a testament to how polarized Egypt is a year after the election of Morsy,"" Gerges said. ""Think of the millions of people who cheered Morsy after his election. Think of the millions of Egyptians who pinned their hopes on Morsy. ""A year later, now, the millions of Egyptians who cheered for Morsy are saying he must go."" Opinion: Give Morsy a chance to fix this . Eric Trager, writing for the New Republic, described an anti-Muslim Brotherhood backlash that is the ""product of mounting popular frustrations regarding the organization's failed governance of Egypt"" during Morsy's year in office. Among the causes for complaint are lack of security, rising food prices, long fuel lines, and frequent electricity cuts during the scorching Egyptian summer, Trager said, all of which foster widespread anti-Brotherhood rage. ""The Brotherhood, however, is in complete denial of this. Brotherhood leaders and members contend that Morsi has been a mostly successful president,"" he said. Huge challenges . For Omar Ashour, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and senior lecturer at Exeter University, Morsy faced an almost impossible challenge from the start. Inexperienced in campaigning, he and his rivals made a raft of ""wild promises"" that raised expectations very high, and Morsy could not deliver on them once elected with just over half the vote, Ashour said. He inherited a huge public debt and a legacy of 30 years of corruption under President Hosni Mubarak. Dissatisfaction with economic conditions in the country was already high. Egypt unrest pushes oil prices near $100 . On taking office, he also experienced very strong resistance from a number within the state institutions, many of them Mubarak loyalists. The majority of those who backed him in the election are still behind him, Ashour said. But some, including those who voted for Morsy only because the alternative was to see Mubarak's former prime minister elected, have now joined the ranks of those lined up against him. Those opposed to Morsy include the Mubarak loyalists who seek a return to power; the Salvation Front, a broad coalition of opposition groups; the youth groups who are disenchanted not to see major change after a year; and the average citizen unaffiliated with any group but frustrated by rising costs. Uncharismatic, not inclusive . Morsy's personal style has contributed to his current predicament, Ashour said. He lacks charisma and oratorical skills, and at the same time he hasn't been able to back his orders with a stick in the same way that Mubarak and his predecessor, Anwar Sadat, did, he said. Although the country's deficit has fallen and tourism revenue has slightly improved over the past year, the effects are not being felt by the man and woman on the street, Ashour said, so Morsy has not benefited. Before his election, there were concerns in some quarters that Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood would seek to introduce a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? But Ashour rejects the idea that the discontent is ideologically motivated, saying it is in fact a ""pragmatic"" power struggle between those who won the democratic election and those who lost, as well as those who feel they lost out in Egypt's 2011 revolution. Shadi Hamid, director of research for the Brookings Doha Center, said ""a long list of mistakes"" had added to Morsy's unpopularity. ""He didn't do enough to build consensus among Egypt's very fractious forces and he had a style of government that wasn't inclusive,"" he told CNN. But Hamid also highlighted the structural problems Morsy faced. ""Anyone who was going to be president right now was going to deal with a deteriorating economy and a rotten, corrupt bureaucracy, many of whom are hostile to President Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood,"" he said. One example of that is the security sector, where a big chunk of the Interior Ministry didn't support him and then protested against him, he said. ""Part of it is Morsy's fault. But we can't lose sight of the bigger perspective, that Egypt is a very unwieldy country to govern and no one would have been able to make real improvements in the course of just one year."" Troubled times . After assuming office in June last year, Morsy took a number of steps that proved unpopular with certain sectors of Egyptian society. In August, the president moved against the military leadership, sending into retirement Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi, who, as chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, had acted the country's de facto ruler in the wake of Mubarak's ouster and prior to Morsy's election. A few months later, in November, he issued an edict declaring his decisions immune from judicial review until the holding of the constitutional referendum. He also sacked the head of the judiciary, many of whose members had remained loyal to Mubarak. The opposition saw the moves as a grab for dictatorial powers and poured into the streets, converting Tahrir Square in central Cairo back into the center of public discontent it had been during the uprising that brought down Mubarak . In response, Morsy dropped his decree, but the situation remained tense. His supporters were accused of beating and detaining opposition protesters during deadly clashes near the presidential palace in Cairo in early December. After a referendum in which more than 60% approved the new constitution, Morsy signed it into law in late December. Critics argued it was passed too quickly, with liberals, Christians and other minority opposition groups saying they felt excluded from the Constituent Assembly that drafted it. Supporters hailed what they said was its protection of personal rights. The international rights group Human Rights Watch said the constitution ""protects some rights but undermines others,"" and that it ""fails to end military trials of civilians or to protect freedom of expression and religion."" At the beginning of last month, the upper house and legislative power of parliament, the Shura Council, was invalidated by the country's highest court. Once a lower house is elected -- to replace the democratically elected parliament dissolved by the court last year -- the Islamist-dominated Shura Council will be dissolved. New parliamentary elections are due later this year but Morsy has not yet set a date. Central player . Morsy served as a central behind-the-scenes player for much of the decade before his election to the presidency, analysts say. His official biography on the website of the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Freedom and Justice Party website describes him as ""one of the most prominent political leadership figures of the Brotherhood, the organization that led the struggle against the ousted repressive regime in its last decade."" He led the Brotherhood's parliamentary bloc from 2000 to 2005 in addition to serving as president of the Department of Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering at Zagazig University. Morsy was arrested several times under Mubarak's regime ""due to his constantly firm stance against the repressive measures and oppressive practices of the overthrown regime,"" the party said. At one point, he spent seven months in jail. Morsy told CNN's Christiane Amanpour during the election campaign that his party sought ""an executive branch that represents the people's true will and implements their public interests."" He also said he would support democracy, women's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won. He added, ""There is no such thing called an Islamic democracy. There is democracy only. ... The people are the source of authority.""","Mohamed Morsy is pushed from office by Egypt's military and is reportedly detained .

"Google says it will replace a Google Maps image after a California father complained it shows the body of his teen-age son, who was shot to death in 2009. Jose Barrera, of Richmond, California, said he discovered the image, visible on Google Maps' satellite view feature, last week. ""When I see this image, it's still like that happened yesterday,"" Barrera told KTVU-TV in Oakland, a CNN affiliate. ""And that brings me back to a lot of memories."" Kevin Barrera, 14, was shot and killed in 2009. Police discovered his body near a railroad track in Richmond on August 15 of that year, at an address that roughly matches the one of the scene in question. His killer has not been found. ""Our hearts go out to the family of this young boy ...,"" said Brian McClendon, vice president of Google Maps, in a written statement sent Monday to CNN and other media outlets. ""Google has never accelerated the replacement of updated satellite imagery from our maps before, but given the circumstances we wanted to make an exception in this case."" McClendon said replacing the image will take about eight days and that Google has spoken to the Barrera family ""to let them know we're working hard on the update."" The image, which was still accessible on Google Maps on Monday afternoon, shows a police cruiser and a small group of people standing near what appears to be a prone human form near a set of train tracks. CNN will not show the image without approval from the slain teen's father. Messages left for Barrera had not been returned as of Tuesday morning. Barrera had said he planned to formally complain to Google and to lobby state lawmakers for their help in removing the image if needed. ""What's the point to show those pictures to the people, you know -- pictures of  my dead son?"" he said. ""This is really painful to the whole family."" People frequently ask Google to remove content they find objectionable on its Maps pages, including Street View and Google Earth. In many cases, the company declines such requests, though it's not a sure thing. ""Your privacy and security are important to us,"" the company writes on a Google Maps privacy page. ""The Google Maps team takes a number of steps to help protect the privacy and anonymity of individuals when images are collected for Street View, including blurring faces and license plates. You can easily contact the Street View team if you see an image that should be protected or if you see a concerning image."" The page says users ""can also request the removal of images that feature inappropriate content (for example: nudity or violence)."" Google's unprecedented ability to attach imagery with its Maps product has been controversial for years. As early as 2008, a Pennsylvania couple sued Google over their home being pictured on Street View. They argued the value of their home, which they purchased in part for privacy, was diminished. Google was ultimately ordered by a judge to pay the couple $1. The U.S. military prohibits Google from capturing images of military installations, and the company has cooperated with a request to remove ones that already existed. Some privately owned communities also have succeeded in asking the company to remove Street View and satellite images from Maps. Google has faced even stiffer opposition outside the United States to its mapping services. In Germany, where opposition came from political leaders as well as privacy watchdogs, households were eventually given the option to opt out of Street View. Images of about 240,000 German addresses were blurred out in the feature's first few months there.","Google says it will remove apparent image of dead teen .

"As a tenuous peace holds in the Syrian city of Homs, many of its residents are returning home for the first time in years to see what war spared them. The neighborhood known as Old Town on Monday looked entirely dusty and gray. Many of its buildings, many thousands of years old, are heaps of rubble after non-stop of shelling. Hassan Deshash sweated in the midday sun, cleaning up his trashed shoe store. He came back to Homs to take inventory, he told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, who met him there. Deshash escaped Homs two years ago and has been living in Damascus, where he managed to open another shoe store. Remembering the time he was forced from his home, he simply said, ""It was awful."" Less than a mile from where Deshash picked up rebar and threw it into a pile, some parts of Homs look untouched by war. Sports stores are open, selling Adidas and Nike. Lines are moving briskly in clean and stocked grocery stores. People pass time at busy cafes. But that's the reality of the place -- some parts were hit, others were not. Homs was, though, the center of the first large demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Now it is one of the areas of the country where stability may hold. Rebels withdrew from Homs last week. A truce was declared after rebels agreed to a prisoner release involving 70 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters, 20 Iranian officers captured by the Islamic Front in Aleppo and a female Iranian agent who was captured at the end of March. Hezbollah and Iran have backed al-Assad's government in the war. In Old Town, it would be understandable if Syrians felt bitter, angry or pessimistic. There is no water or electricity in many areas. Attempts at peace coordinated by international diplomats have fallen through in the past. Nearly everyone has a story of loss. At least 2,500 people were trapped in Homs, and it was incredibly difficult to deliver humanitarian aid to the city. The war has taken, by most estimates, at least 100,000 lives and has displaced millions. As if the situation could get any more brutal, looters showed up in Old Town to swipe whatever was left in the ruins, Syrians told Pleitgen. And yet many Syrians seemed optimistic. Most were friendly, though some politely told the correspondent they didn't want to talk on camera. They explained that they just wanted to focus on seeing what possessions they could reclaim. Some heaved mattresses and refrigerators and shoved them onto truck beds. They thought the truce would stick. Travel was once a life-risking endeavor in Homs. But on Monday drivers rolled through checkpoints staffed by Syrian government soldiers. Even they were unusually friendly, telling Pleitgen they thought that Western media has misrepresented them as the bad guys in the civil war. One soldier told Pleitgen that he supports the truce between the rebels and the government. ""I think this was the best thing,"" said the soldier who did not give his name. ""It gives the people the chance to come back and start rebuilding their lives."" Syria war fast facts - revisit the history of the conflict . The roots of the war in Syria began in March 2011 after a group of teenagers and children were arrested for writing political graffiti that disparaged al-Assad, who has controlled the country since July 2000. His father, Hafez al-Assad, ruled Syria from 1970 to 2000. When protests stirred over the arrests, the Syrian government violently cracked down, and violence followed, metastasizing throughout the country. Over time the civil war grew more complicated and involved various fighters, some of whom were Syrian, some of whom were from other countries. By March 2012, after one year of fighting, the United Nations reported that more than 8,000 people had died. Activists fighting to oust al-Assad from office estimated the death toll to be much higher with more than 10,000 dead. Most of them were civilians, activists contended. By February 2013, the U.N. Security Council estimated that the number of civilians killed in the two-year civil war was approaching 70,000. In a January 2014 report, Human Rights Watch slammed international powers for failing to stop ""the unchecked slaughter of civilians in Syria."" The bloodshed, Human Rights Watch said, ""elicited global horror and outrage but not enough to convince world leaders to exert the pressure needed to stop it.""","A truce was declared between rebels and the Syrian government .

"(CNN)French security agencies stopped monitoring the brothers who attacked the staff of Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine months before they carried out the attack, despite a previous tip-off from American intelligence agencies that one of them had likely trained with al Qaeda in Yemen, a French news magazine reported Saturday. Charlie Hebdo terror attacker Said Kouachi is suspected of slipping off for terror training in Yemen in July 2011 during a trip he made with another French national to Oman in July 2011, according to multiple French officials who spoke to L'Express national security reporter Eric Pelletier. Pelletier shared the details of his reporting with CNN. U.S. intelligence agencies developed intelligence suggesting a high probability he slipped across to Yemen during the trip to Oman, and informed their French counterparts, according to Pelletier's French sources. The French responded by placing Said Kouachi under surveillance in November 2011 by issuing a ""Fiche de Surveillance"" -- a survillance notice, multiple French officials told Pelletier. The surveillance was conducted by both DGSI -- France's domestic security service -- and later by the judicial police. Wiretaps were authorized for his cell phones and that of his brother Cherif. A U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr that Said Kouachi's 2011 travel lasted three or more months and that he is believed to have trained with al Qaeda in Yemen during that period. But the surveillance of Said was terminated in June 2014 because French security services judged him no longer dangerous, Pelletier was told. The surveillance of his brother Cherif stopped earlier -- at the end of 2013. Cherif's phone calls suggested he had disengaged with violent extremism and was focusing on counterfeiting clothing and shoes. French intelligence believe there is a strong probability Cherif also traveled to Yemen for a short trip in 2011, separately from his brother. Pelletier's sources said that Cherif Kouachi was already under some form of control order in France at the time. He had previously served a prison sentence, after being convicted of terror offenses in 2008 for being part of a recruitment network for al Qaeda in Iraq. Pelletier said it was not clear what type of control order he was under. Some require the surrender of passports, while others require regularly reporting to designated officials. Morten Storm, a former jihadist who became a double agent working for western intelligence services, told CNN's Nic Robertson that training trips such as Kouachi's were a regular part of operations for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula when the terror group's external operations head was Anwar al-Awlaki, an American imam. Recruits were told to return home and avoid any appearance of radicalization. ""And that is what Anwar al-Awlaki had asked me for in the past to get brothers, i.e., Muslim terrorists, to get them over,"" Storm told Robertson. ""But the condition was that they had to have a clean passport and they had to have a clean name. They do not have to be under any sort of radars or surveillance or interest by the government. So, they had to be totally clean from that."" Al-Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike on September 30, 2011. Around this time, or soon after, Said Kouachi is believed to have returned to France. CNN's Barbara Starr, Tim Lister and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","The Kouachi brothers were monitored by French agencies because of their histories,  L'Express says .
But monitoring faded months ago despite a U.S. tip-off that one brother had trained with al Qaeda in Yemen ."
"A massive manhunt, touched off more than a year ago when a California man is believed to have killed his family, ended Sunday when authorities announced they'd found the man's remains. Shane Miller, the prime suspect in the deaths of his wife and two young daughters, was recently featured on CNN's ""The Hunt With John Walsh."" His remains were found not far from where Miller's truck was located in Petrolia, California, last year, said Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko. It was not immediately clear how long they had been there. The remains were reported Friday on the banks of the Mattole River, according to a statement from the Sheriff's Office, and were identified through dental records. Miller was featured in Episode 1 of ""The Hunt."" Authorities had been looking for him since May 2013. On May 7, 2013, a 911 dispatcher got a call from the Miller residence. The sounds of breathing and crying, then loud bangs, could be heard before the line went dead. When police arrived at the home, they found the bodies of Miller's wife, Sandy Miller, and the couple's two daughters -- Shelby, 8, and Shasta, 5 -- with multiple gunshot wounds. Shane Miller quickly became the lead suspect in the case. After the killings, he, his truck and the family dog went missing. Miller was later spotted by an ex-girlfriend in Petrolia, sparking the manhunt. He ditched his truck and authorities had thought he fled on foot into the mountainous forests of California's ""Lost Coast."" His remains were found about 1,500 feet from Miller's vehicle, the Sheriff's Office said. Near them, authorities recovered a handgun and loaded magazines. The ammunition in the magazines was consistent with ammunition found in Miller's truck, and at the family's slaying scene, the Sheriff's Office said. ""The Hunt,"" which premiered on CNN on July 13, aims to expose stories of ongoing criminal investigations of fugitives and expand the search internationally. Last week, a 32-year-old suspected sex offender featured on the show died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in. Investigators said they sifted through hundreds of tips in their search for that suspect, Charles Mozdir, but a phone call they got during ""The Hunt"" helped them crack the case.

"A federal appeals court Thursday blocked a ruling that deemed the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy unconstitutional, while removing the judge from the case as other appeals are heard. The three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the lower court judge ""ran afoul"" of requirements that judges avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Judge Shira A. Scheindlin, the appeals court said, jeopardized ""the appearance of partiality ... by a series of media interviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the District Court."" Scheindlin, in a related 2007 proceeding, said, ""If you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good constitutional case, why don't you bring a lawsuit? You can certainly mark it as related,"" adding, ""I am sure I am going to get in trouble for saying it, for $65 you can bring that lawsuit,"" the ruling said. New York City appealing stop-and-frisk ruling . The ruling also points to interviews with the New York Law Journal, The Associated Press and The New Yorker in which the judge spoke about her personal beliefs on the issue and defended her decision. The stop-and-frisk policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they deem suspicious, even if they've committed no crime -- has been one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent time, fueled by clashes between civil rights and civil liberties groups challenging the practice as racist and illegal. Law enforcement and other proponents say the practice works to reduce crime. In August, Scheindlin ordered that the stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it is unconstitutional in part because it unlawfully targets blacks and Latinos. City officials had bristled at the contention that police racially profile suspects and appealed the ruling. Scheindlin, ruled that the policy violated plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable searches, finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to June 2012 without reasonable suspicion. She also found evidence of racial profiling, violating plaintiffs' 14th Amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection. The panel did not rule on Scheindlin's decision in the case. Michael A. Cardozo, counsel for the New York City Law Office, applauded the appeals court's ruling. ""We could not be more pleased with the court's findings,"" he said, because the ruling puts off a decision on the constitutionality of the policy until another judge can weigh in. The nonprofit organization representing the plaintiffs in the case criticized the ruling. ""We are dismayed that the Court of Appeals saw fit to delay the long-overdue process to remedy the NYPD's unconstitutional stop-and-frisk practices, and we are shocked that they cast aspersions on the professional conduct of one of the most respected members of the federal judiciary and reassigned the case,"" the Center for Constitutional Rights said in a statement. Thursday's ruling effectively stalls changes mandated by Scheindlin, who said stops should be based on reasonable suspicion and made in a racially neutral manner. Her ruling called for the appointment of a former Manhattan prosecutor to develop reforms of the NYPD's policies and a pilot project in which NYPD patrol officers in five precincts -- one in each borough with the most stops in 2012 -- must wear video cameras. Outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg is an outspoken proponent of the policy, saying it saves lives and lowers crime. NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly was forced to cancel a speech at Brown University on Tuesday after protesters shouted at him on stage about stop-and-frisk policies. On Thursday, Kelly said he has been ""concerned about the partiality of Judge Scheindlin, and we look forward to the examination of this case."" The controversy about the policy extended into the mayoral race. Democratic nominee Bill de Blasio, who is heavily favored to win Tuesday, has made his opposition to stop-and-frisk a major campaign issue. ""I'm extremely disappointed in today's decision. We shouldn't have to wait for reforms that both keep our communities safe and obey the Constitution,"" he said in a statement. Republican nominee Joe Lhota said, ""Bravo! As I have said all along, Judge Scheindlin's biased conduct corrupted the case, and her decision was not based on the facts.""","A three-judge appeal panel finds a lower court judge ""ran afoul of the Code of Conduct""

"(CNN)If there is one regional player that gained the most from America's gamble in Iraq, it is Iran. With its invasion in 2003, the United States ousted Tehran's sworn enemy, Saddam Hussein, from power. Then Washington helped install a Shiite government for the first time in Iraq's modern history. As U.S. troops became mired in fighting an insurgency and containing a civil war, Iran extended its influence over all of Iraq's major Shiite factions. Today, the Iranian regime is moving to exert influence beyond its Iraqi proxies, and is comfortable taking overt military action. There is no one to restrain Tehran, and the rise of ISIS, which views Shiites as apostates, threatens the interests of all Iraqi Shiite factions and of the Iranian regime. In late November, Iranian warplanes launched several airstrikes against targets in eastern Iraq, pushing back ISIS militants who had neared a self-declared ""buffer zone"" that Iran established along the border. It was the latest example of how Iran is expanding its military and political influence in Iraq, a country wracked by a complex civil war that leaves it open to outside manipulation. Iraq is at the center of several regional proxy battles: Iran is heavily involved in shaping Iraqi policy, while ISIS represents spillover from the Syrian civil war next door. The militant group is also a byproduct of the Gulf Arab states that support Sunni jihadists in both Syria and Iraq. And the United States is bombing ISIS and other jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria. Opinion: Iran's hypocrisy in condemning U.S. The Iranian regime has several concerns: Iraq provides strategic depth and a buffer against Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab states that are competing with Iran for dominance over the Persian Gulf. More broadly, Tehran wants to ensure that Iraq never again poses an existential threat to Iranian interests, as Saddam did when he invaded Iran in 1980, instigating the eight-year Iran-Iraq war that devastated both countries. Saddam was supported by the Sunni Arab states and most Western powers. (The Shiites are the majority in Iraq, but since its independence in 1932, the country had been ruled by the Sunni minority until the U.S. invasion in 2003.) Iran will do whatever is necessary to keep a friendly, Shiite-led government in power in Baghdad. The long game . Iran has excelled at playing the long game, especially in Iraq. Iran's willingness to spread money around to various proxies and factions gave it great agility in maneuvering through Iraqi politics. Soon after the U.S. invasion, Tehran reached out to the Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr -- who was an early critic of Iranian meddling in Iraq -- and financed his growing militia and social service networks. One diplomatic cable sent by U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Christopher Hill to officials at the State Department in November 2009 estimated that Tehran's financial assistance to its Iraqi surrogates ranged from $100 million to $200 million a year. Iran also was willing to invest across sectarian lines: ""The IRIG (Islamic Republic of Iran Government) recognizes that influence in Iraq requires operational (and at times ideological) flexibility,"" Ambassador Hill pointed out in his cable. ""As a result, it is not uncommon for the IRIG to finance and support competing Shia, Kurdish, and to some extent, Sunni entities, with the aim of developing the Iraqi body politic's dependency on Tehran's largesse."" Like Iraq's other neighbors, Iran helped fuel and prolong the Iraqi insurgency and civil war. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps financed, armed and trained numerous Shiite militias that targeted U.S. troops and Iraq's Sunni community. The Iranians provided rockets, explosives, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and other small arms. They also brought Iraqi militiamen to Iran to be trained in the use of explosives and as snipers. The United States helped Iraq's Shiite factions compromise on Nuri al-Maliki as prime minister in 2006. As he struggled to remain in power, he became more dependent on Iran. He grew more repressive and authoritarian, using the Iraqi security forces to intimidate political rivals and exclude Sunnis from power. For Iran, Maliki was a reliable ally, who allowed Iranian flights over Iraqi territory to transport weapons and manpower to shore up Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria after a popular uprising in 2011. Maliki also allowed thousands of Iraqi Shiites to cross the border and fight alongside the Syrian regime. Since ISIS swept through northern Iraq in June, Tehran has mobilized to protect the Shiite-led government from the Sunni militant threat. General Qassim Suleimani, commander of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, traveled to Baghdad at the start of the crisis to coordinate the defense of the capital with Iraqi politicians and military officials. He also directed Iranian-trained Shiite militias—including the Badr Brigade and the League of the Righteous, two notorious militias responsible for widespread atrocities against Sunnis—in the fight against ISIS. With a weakened and corrupt Iraqi military, the militias have proven crucial in stopping ISIS' advance. When Iraq's political elite finally agreed in August to replace the divisive and sectarian Maliki as Prime Minister, the Iranian leadership—along with the United States and most Western powers—threw their weight behind his successor, Haider al-Abadi. Like Maliki, he is a leader of the Dawa Party, a Shiite Islamist group supported by Iran. In recent months, U.S. officials say, Tehran has provided tons of military equipment to the Iraqi security forces and has been secretly directing surveillance drones from an air base in Baghdad. Iran has also sent hundreds of its Quds Force fighters to train Iraqi forces and coordinate their actions. But last month was the first time that Iran used its fighter jets to directly bomb ISIS targets inside Iraq, striking in eastern Diyala province where the fighting neared the Iranian border. Iranian officials have slowly acknowledged their covert operations inside Iraq. ""Iran has helped Iraq in an advisory role and has quickly organized Iraqi militias,"" Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Forces, told the Fars News Agency in September. ""Were it not for Iran, the Islamic State would have taken over Iraqi Kurdistan."" In late December, a Revolutionary Guards commander, Brigadier General Hamid Taqavi, was killed by a sniper in the Iraqi city of Samarra while he was training Iraqi troops and Shiite militia fighters. Taqavi was the highest-ranking Iranian official to be killed in Iraq since the Iran-Iraq war. Thousands of Revolutionary Guards gathered for his funeral in Tehran on Dec. 28, where Ali Shamkhani, head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, told mourners: If ""people like Taqavi do not shed their blood in Samarra, then we would shed our blood"" within Iran. Iraqi leaders warned that as long as the United States did not provide military assistance, they had no choice but to ask Iran for more help. ""When Baghdad was threatened, the Iranians did not hesitate to help us,"" Abadi, the Iraqi prime minister, said in a recent television interview in Baghdad. He noted that unlike Iran, the United States ""hesitated to help us when Baghdad was in danger, and hesitated to help our security forces. And the reason Iran did not hesitate to help us was because they consider ISIS as a threat to them, not only to us."" The proxy wars . Today's Middle East was shaped by several proxy wars that unfolded over the past decade. In Iraq, neighboring Sunni regimes backed Sunni militants, while Iran supported Maliki's Shiite-led government and Shiite militias. In Lebanon, an alliance between Washington and authoritarian Sunni Arab regimes—Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries—backed a Sunni-led government against Hezbollah, a Shiite militia funded by Iran. And in the Palestinian territories, Iran supported the militant Hamas, while the United States and its Arab allies backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah movement. When various Middle Eastern regimes realized that America would lose its war in Iraq, they began maneuvering to protect their interests and to gain something out of the American defeat. Saudi Arabia, which viewed Iraq as a bulwark against Iranian influence, tried to undermine the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. The ruling Al-Saud dynasty views itself as the rightful leader of the Muslim world, but Iran has challenged that leadership for several decades. Although Saudi Arabia has a Sunni majority, its rulers fear Iran's potential influence over a sizable and sometimes-restive Shiite population concentrated in the kingdom's oil-rich Eastern Province. In Bahrain (another American ally in the Gulf), the Shiite majority is chafing under Sunni rulers who also fear Iran's reach. Through a combination of funding, training for militias and political support, Iran will continue to extend its influence over the major Shiite groups in Iraq. Maliki did not start out as beholden to Iran, but as he struggled to remain in power, he became more dependent on Tehran. Even if Abadi, the new Prime Minister, has shown signs that he wants to be closer to the West, he needs Iranian support to keep his government in power. More broadly, the United States and Iran now share common interests in defeating ISIS and maintaining a stable regime in Baghdad that can transcend sectarian conflicts. The Obama administration and Tehran insist that they are not coordinating directly in Iraq, but they essentially have an undeclared alliance. Washington has been looking the other way as Iran increased its military involvement over the past six months. Without committing far more U.S. troops and resources, there is little that the Obama administration can do to contain Iranian power in Iraq. Iran has many levers to maintain its influence over Iraq. It will not hesitate to use them, even if that means taking on a deeper military role in a civil war that has no end in sight.","Mohamad Bazzi says Iran is free to exercise power in vacuum created by fall of Saddam Hussein .
He says Iran is expanding its influence in Iraq, partly to counter ISIS ."
"A truce between Syrian government and rebel forces in the strategic and symbolic city of Homs has gone into effect, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Wednesday. An operation to evacuate opposition fighters and their families has begun, the London-based group said. The ancient city became known as the capital of the uprising against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It has experienced some of the worst of the violence in a bloody civil war that has left more than 100,000 people dead and driven millions of people from their homes across the country. As many as 2,500 people are thought to be trapped in Homs, portions of which have been under siege since June 2012. Efforts to get humanitarian aid to those inside the city have been plagued by difficulties amid the fighting. Syrian rebels have said that the truce in the city was brokered after they agreed to release 70 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters, 20 Iranian officers captured by the Islamic Front in Aleppo and an Iranian female agent who was captured at the end of March. Hezbollah and Iran have backed al-Assad's government in the war. Truce follows talks . Under the deal, once the opposition fighters reach their final destination in Al-Dara Al-Kabira in the province of Homs, the first group of pro-regime prisoners will be released from the towns of Nubul and Zahra in rural Aleppo. Representatives of the rebel fighters and of Islamic battalions have negotiated in recent days with those of Syrian government forces, the pro-regime National Defense militias, the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah and the governor of Homs, according to the observatory. The talks were mediated by civil committees and the United Nations in the presence of representatives from the Iranian and Russian embassies. In a statement to the state-run Syrian news agency SANA, Homs Gov. Talal al-Barazi said that the process of settlement and reconciliation will begin simultaneously with the rebels' departure so as to have the city cleared of arms. After the city is cleared, a Syrian army unit will begin a search to detect and dismantle explosive devices, mines and remove barricades, he said. Opposition defiant . Syria's opposition has tried to spin the truce as a victory over al-Assad's regime. But handing over control of the city could be a strategic setback. ""This deal proves that the Assad regime is a puppet manipulated by Iran, and that it is the sole importer of terrorists, and perhaps the exclusive agent of terrorism in the region,"" Noura Al Ameer, vice president of the opposition Syrian Coalition, said before the truce went into effect. Al-Barazi has said the removal of rebel fighters and weapons from Homs will help the government improve security and stability in Syria. But the coalition has expressed doubt that the truce will hold. ""We fear for the safety of those in Homs as the regime has always reneged on its promises,"" the group said. Terms of the deal . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said that the Homs pact will call for: . 1. The withdrawal of rebel and Islamist fighters from Homs neighborhoods under the supervision of regime forces and delegates from the United Nations; . 2. The opening by rebel forces of a safe passage for the provision of food and medical aid to the Shiite enclaves of Nubul and Zahraa in the Aleppo countryside, considered to be regime strongholds the rebels have blocked for months; . 3. The withdrawal of rebel forces from Homs via the Hama-Homs highway toward Al-Dara Al-Kabira in Homs province's north countryside; . 4. The granting of amnesty to 50 fighters who defected from regime forces in Homs' al-Waer neighborhood; . 5. The takeover by regime forces of the al-Waer neighborhood in Homs in addition to the entrance and exit into the neighborhoods of Jouret Shiah, Al-Qarabees, Hamidiyeh, Wadi Al-Sayeh and the Old City of Homs; . 6. Retreating rebel and Islamist fighters to keep their personal weapons for protection in the event of any breach of the pact. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said later Wednesday that about 600 fighters had left the besieged part of Homs for an area in the northern part of the city, with more expected to follow. But efforts elsewhere in Syria to help those suffering weren't all proceeding as planned. The observatory said that an ""Islamic battalion"" had blocked an aid convoy aiming for al-Nubul and al-Zahra, two Shiite villages in Aleppo province.

"Investigators say they sifted through hundreds of tips in their search for Charles Mozdir, but a phone call they got during CNN's ""The Hunt"" with John Walsh helped them crack the case. On Monday, eight days after the show first aired, the 32-year-old suspected sex offender died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in. During the show, first broadcast on July 20, a deputy U.S. marshal fielding calls got a tip about Mozdir, accused in a 2012 California child molestation case. ""I know Mozdir. He left here 10 months ago,"" the caller said, according to Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Steve Jurman. The call ""really stood out,"" Jurman said, ""because they mentioned that he had a dog."" The last time Mozdir had been spotted, Jurman said, his black Labrador, Lucky, was with him. The tip was the first strong lead about his whereabouts that investigators had in more than two years, but they didn't know where he'd gone since. ""It was the newest information we had,"" Jurman said. ""Our case went cold in 2012. He was definitely living on cash, with a good fake ID. He was off our grid."" That changed Monday, when a New York police detective and two U.S. marshals entered the smoke shop in New York City where Mozdir worked. Mozdir ""fired on officers at a very close range,"" New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said, and ""officers returned fire."" The officers were wounded during the shootout but are expected to recover, authorities said. He used a five-shot revolver and fired five times, a law enforcement official said. New York Police Department Detective Mario Muniz, 45, was hit three times -- twice in a bulletproof vest and once underneath, a source briefed on the investigation said. A U.S. marshal was shot once in the leg. It's unclear whether the second marshal was shot in the arm or the injury resulted from shrapnel and flying glass, according to the source briefed on the investigation. Mozdir had 10 bullet wounds -- six to the abdomen, two to the chest and two to the left arm, the law enforcement official said. A medical examiner will try to determine how many times he was shot; some of the injuries could be entry and exit wounds. In addition, there is a chance that friendly fire injured one of the marshals, given the tight quarters where the shooting occurred, the law enforcement official added. Armed with a search warrant, authorities seized a number of items from Mozdir's apartment Monday night, including a Gateway computer, an Acer laptop, a West Virginia driver's license and prescription pills, the law enforcement official said. Mozdir had been sought by authorities since June 2012. He had ""apparently changed his appearance from earlier times,"" Bratton said, declining to provide further details on what he said was an ongoing investigation. A series of leads . Walsh said that after the episode featuring Mozdir, authorities received a tip that he was working at a restaurant in Manhattan, but the information didn't pan out. After CNN re-aired Mozdir's episode Sunday night, another tip came in that resulted in an address for him, according to Walsh. That tip led police to a woman in Florida. She gave Mozdir's cell phone number, a senior law enforcement official said. U.S. marshals tracked the number to New York City's West Village, a source briefed on the investigation said. Muniz and the two U.S. marshals went to the store to see if he was there. The detective entered the shop, recognized Mozdir and then left, police said. The marshals and Muniz then went back into the store to arrest him, and that's when Mozdir opened fire, authorities said. Mozdir had changed his appearance with a beard and longer hair, an NYPD official said. While CNN's ""The Hunt"" aired Sunday, police warned that Mozdir was believed to be armed. ""Charles Mozdir owns a gun and is known to live off of the land,"" police in Coronado, California, posted on Facebook last week. Mozdir had a .32-caliber revolver with 20 spare rounds of ammunition in his pocket at the time of his death, the police commissioner said. Police are canvassing the area for video, according to a New York law enforcement source. Read more on Mozdir . More on CNN's ""The Hunt"" The wounded officers, all of whom were part of a U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force, were transported to Bellevue Hospital, Bratton said. Officials said their injuries did not appear to be life-threatening and they were in stable condition. It's likely that a bulletproof vest  that Muniz was wearing saved his life, Bratton said. ""We appreciate their bravery, their strength, their decisiveness,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said, ""and we're going to make sure each one of them is taken care of."" Family 'was destroyed, terrified' Mozdir was arrested in California in 2012 after the young son of two close friends told his parents that Mozdir had touched his private parts. Mozdir was at their house, helping care for the now 7-year-old boy, who was ill with a high fever. His parents, who requested that their names not be used, immediately went to police. ""He was on the run for almost two years. And this family was destroyed, terrified that he would come back and hurt them because they had the courage to come forward and file charges against him,"" Walsh said Monday. On the run from authorities, Mozdir had apparently shared with others his plan to one day kill the young boy's father for turning him in, Walsh said. ""And now they don't have to worry if this guy's coming back to hurt the family or hurt their little boy. So there's a big sigh of relief tonight that Charles Mozdir is off this planet."" After the parents' report in 2012, investigators in Coronado, California, executed a search warrant on Mozdir's house and found evidence of child pornography and bestiality on his cell phone and computers, according to U.S. Marshals Service Deputy Brian Grimes. Mozdir was arrested four days after the incident and booked into the San Diego County jail before posting bail the next day. The district attorney told the couple that Mozdir had been accused in another child assault case when he was baby-sitting a young boy, who told his mother. On June 15, 2012, Mozdir failed to appear at his arraignment. Charges were immediately filed, and a $1 million arrest warrant was issued. Grimes said investigators think he took all his money and fled. Mozdir indicated that he was considering going to Mexico or Japan during one of his last phone calls. His roommate told police that Mozdir had two guns and had threatened to kill himself and kill a victim's father. The Coronado Police Department and the U.S. Marshals Service searched for Mozdir in Georgia and California, as well as the Mexican state of Baja California. On June 20, 2012, Coronado police found Mozdir's abandoned vehicle hidden in the brush outside the coastal Georgia town of Darien. The license plate had been ripped off, and there was an extra gas tank inside. A bloodhound picked up Mozdir's scent near U.S. Highway 17. Walsh: 'This is our first capture' ""The Hunt,"" which premiered on CNN on July 13, aims to expose stories of ongoing criminal investigations of fugitives and expand the search internationally. On Monday, Walsh described Mozdir's death as a ""tough ending."" ""It really reaffirms my belief that people don't want to be vigilantes. They want to be involved and do the right thing,"" he said. ""This is our first capture. I'm very sorry that those police officers got wounded in the line of duty,"" Walsh said, ""but this is one more lowlife that's off the streets.""","Marshal says a tip during CNN's ""The Hunt"" helped investigators crack the cold case .

"When the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, is fully implemented, many of the disparities that have plagued the nation's health care system will significantly lessen. Even so, ensuring that all Americans have adequate access to health care remains a major issue in the election campaign, and may prove to be far from a settled matter.  This is because both President Obama and Mitt Romney agree that insurance is unaffordable for many families and small businesses, but they differ on solutions. If Mitt Romney is elected, he has said he would repeal the act. This would likely mean that adequate health care would remain unavailable to many, particularly minorities. Nearly half of Americans are insured through their jobs. This includes members of Congress, who enjoy great health plans with low premium payments. For everyone else without such coverage, whether to purchase health insurance is not a black and white decision. Rather, it's a black and white difference. Broken down by race, the disparity is even more startling.  About half of whites are covered through an employer-sponsored health plan, in contrast to the rate for African-Americans (38%) and Hispanics (28%). Why? Many minorities have lower-paying jobs that do not offer health insurance, and because of the high cost of self-insuring, they choose not to purchase coverage. This leaves one out of every three Hispanics and one out of every five African-Americans without insurance. Politics: 2012 ballot initiatives -- Voter-run or special interest-hijacked? Of course, the uninsured can access the emergency room for care, as Romney has argued. We know that people without insurance use emergency departments much more frequently, and for less urgent issues, than those with health insurance. Yet the reality is that low-income communities and those with higher minority populations have more hospital closures in their area compared with higher-income communities. As a result, access to emergency rooms for many minorities can be problematic, because they have to commute longer distances to reach the hospital. As emergency physicians at one of the largest public hospitals in the country, we see firsthand how the lack of insurance and then access to a regular health care provider affects our patients, from the middle-aged black man with a stroke from uncontrolled and undiagnosed high blood pressure to the young black woman with breast cancer who chose to use her money to feed her children rather than seek health care. Uninsured patients with diabetes and high blood pressure generally have more complications from these chronic illnesses than insured patients, resulting in prolonged hospital stays. Without an overhaul of our health care system, we will continue to see disproportionately more preventable deaths and disabilities among the uninsured minority population. Health: Report compares Obama, Romney health care plans . A national survey found that African-Americans and Hispanics were more likely than whites to lack a regular provider, regardless of insurance status, and that the disparity was even worse without insurance. A specific example of how this disparity plays out is with breast cancer. Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with larger, more aggressive tumors. Moreover, uninsured women are four times more likely to have widespread cancer compared with those with private insurance. To be sure, if everyone had some sort of health insurance, many of these disparities would be reduced. A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that Medicaid expansions were associated with a reduction in mortality in older adults, nonwhites and residents of poorer counties. However, half of physicians in a national poll said they had stopped accepting or were limiting the number of Medicaid beneficiaries they will see because of low reimbursement payments. Currently, 27% of blacks and Hispanics are Medicaid recipients, compared with approximately 11% of whites. A concerted and drastic improvement is needed in both access to care and adequate insurance coverage for all. Fact-checking candidates on key issues . We must ensure that everyone in the United States has the same opportunity to receive the health care they need. As the Affordable Care Act is implemented, greater health care coverage and access to health care will be cost effective over the long term. If it is repealed, we will see increased rates of illnesses and added expenses, particularly in underserved populations. A healthy nation is a productive nation.","Houry, Heron: If Romney wins, ends health reform, minorities especially affected .
They say people of color are a third of U.S. population, account for nearly half of uninsured .

"The searing drama ""12 Years a Slave"" was named best picture at the 86th Academy Awards on Sunday night. The story of Solomon Northup, a free African-American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery, won just three awards, but they were all major: best picture, best supporting actress (Lupita Nyong'o) and best adapted screenplay (John Ridley). Brad Pitt, one of the film's producers, accepted on behalf of the film before deferring to its director, a noticeably excited -- and tongue-tied -- Steve McQueen. ""Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live. This is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup,"" McQueen said. He added, ""This is for all the people who have endured slavery, and the 21 million people who still endure slavery today."" Check out our list of Oscar winners . Nyong'o, a newcomer, paid tribute to her character, Patsey, a slave in 1840s Louisiana. Her voice cracked as she spoke. ""It doesn't escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is because of so much pain in someone else's,"" she said. The force of 'Gravity' ""Gravity"" topped all films with seven Oscars, including an award for director Alfonso Cuaron. The Mexican director devoted four years of his life to making the technically challenging film about a space mission gone wrong. He's the first Latin American to win the award. ""Gravity's"" other Oscars are for original score, visual effects, sound mixing and sound editing, cinematography and film editing. ""Dallas Buyers Club"" won three awards, including two in acting categories: best actor for Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto for best supporting actor. The film also won for makeup and hairstyling. As expected, Cate Blanchett won best actress for her turn as a modern-day Blanche DuBois in the Woody Allen film ""Blue Jasmine."" Blanchett praised films with female protagonists. Female-centric movies are ""not niche -- they make money!"" she exclaimed to an ovation. ""Let It Go,"" from the animated film ""Frozen,"" won best song. Robert Lopez, one of its songwriters, became an EGOT with his Oscar win: He now has an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. ""Frozen"" also for won best animated feature. One of the evening's highlights was Darlene Love, one of the singers featured in documentary winner ""20 Feet From Stardom."" Love launched into an impromptu version of ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" upon the film's win, and her full-throated take brought down the house. ""The Great Gatsby"" won two Oscars, for production design and costume design. Italy's ""The Great Beauty"" took home the Oscar for foreign-language film. ""American Hustle,"" which had tied ""Gravity"" for the most Oscar nominations (10), was completely shut out at the awards ceremony. Five things to know . Ellen sets a record . Oscar host Ellen DeGeneres managed to set a social media record with a celebrity-filled selfie that was retweeted more times than any photograph in Twitter history. She went into the audience and gathered a number of stars -- including Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey and Bradley Cooper, who shot the image -- and encouraged people to send it around the world. She had a pretty good head start, given that she has more than 25 million followers on Twitter. DeGeneres was generally loose and low-key throughout the broadcast, inspiring smiles more than laughs. In her opening monologue, she cracked the usual jokes about Hollywood and image. Later, she went into the audience to ask if anyone wanted a pizza -- and even borrowed Pharrell's famous hat to collect a few bucks for payment. There were also some somber moments. The ""In Memoriam"" segment, which has received scrutiny in recent years after certain omissions, included notables who recently died -- among them Sid Caesar, Harold Ramis and Shirley Temple Black -- and concluded with Philip Seymour Hoffman. And when he took the stage to present the award for best cinematography, Bill Murray worked in a shout-out for his old ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Groundhog Day"" friend Ramis. Blues in the night . On the red carpet, blue was the color of choice for many stars. Nyong'o was dressed in a striking sky-blue Prada gown. Liza Minnelli and best actress nominee Amy Adams (""American Hustle"") also were in shades of blue. Jennifer Lawrence was an exception: She was in a striking red dress. But for ""12 Years"" actress Alfre Woodard, very little of the glitter mattered. Asked by CNN's Piers Morgan what she was wearing, Woodard laughingly turned the question back toward the work that got all the nominees to the red carpet in the first place.

"The testimonies, one after another, have been damning, disturbing and, at points, excruciating. A North Korean prison camp survivor told of a pregnant woman in a condition of near-starvation who gave birth to a baby -- a new life born against all odds in a grim camp. A security agent heard the baby's cries and beat the mother as a punishment. She begged him to let her keep the baby, but he kept beating her. With shaking hands, the mother was forced to pick up her newborn and put the baby face down in water until the cries stopped and a water bubble formed from the newborn's mouth. It's just one example of the kind of testimony heard during an 11-month inquiry into alleged violations of human rights in North Korea, and documented in a report released by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights on Monday. The commission concluded that North Korea has committed crimes against humanity. The commission investigated issues regarding the right to food, prison camps, torture and inhuman treatment, arbitrary detention, discrimination, freedom of expression, the right to life, freedom of movement, and enforced disappearances, including abductions of other citizens. The panel reported a stunning catalog of torture and the widespread abuse of even the weakest of North Koreans that reveal a portrait of a brutal state ""that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world."" It remains to be seen what impact the report might have and whether China, a member of the U.N. Security Council and staunch ally of North Korea, will block action seeking human rights redress. Collection of evidence . Since its creation last year, the commission of inquiry has examined satellite imagery, evidence and testimonies from more than 100 victims, witnesses and experts regarding North Korea. Some of the testimonies were held confidentially because of protection concerns for family still remaining in North Korea. International attention on North Korea has previously focused on halting its nuclear weapons program, but, in response to increasingly detailed reports of human rights abuses emerging from the isolated state, the U.N.'s Human Rights Council elected in March to establish the commission. For many North Koreans who testified, it was an acknowledgment of the sufferings they endured living and fleeing the regime.  North Korea is said to practice ""guilt by association"" -- punishing members of a person's family and succeeding generations for one person's perceived misdeeds. Pyongyang has refused to cooperate with the investigation and rejects the commission's validity. The commission of inquiry requested access to North Korea and also invited its authorities to examine its evidence and also contribute in the process. In May 2013, North Korea sent a letter saying it ""totally and categorically rejects the Commission of Inquiry"" and has not answered subsequent letters, said Michael Kirby, the chair of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry. The commission comprises three appointees, chaired by Kirby, a former Australian High Court judge, along with Sonja Biserko of Serbia and Marzuki Darusman of Indonesia. Through its official news agency, KCNA, North Korea in August condemned the hearings as a ""charade"" to ""hear testimonies from human scum."" A life in imprisonment . Throughout public hearings held in Seoul, Tokyo, London and Washington, D.C., former North Koreans told of torture and imprisonment for watching soap operas or trying to find food to sustain their families. Many of them ended up in prison camps for crossing the border to China or for having family members who were suspect to the regime. The North Korean prison camps have survived twice as long as Stalin's Soviet gulags and much longer than the Nazi concentration camps. One witness said that young male inmates in North Korean prison camps became so desperate for food they would eat live worms or snakes caught in the field to feel something in their stomachs. ""Because we saw so many people die, we became so used to it,"" one prison camp survivor told the commission. ""I'm sorry to say that we became so used to it that we didn't feel anything. In North Korea, sometimes people on the verge of dying would ask for something to eat. Or when somebody died we would strip them naked and we would wear the clothes. Those alive have to go on, those dead, I'm sorry, but they're dead."" Jee Heon A told the commission of her time in a North Korean prison. She was sent there after being repatriated from China. She befriended a young girl, named Kim Young Hee and became like a sister to her. While they were forced to work in the fields, they were looking for a type of grass to eat, as their prison rations were not enough. ""We finished our work and we were about to pick up this grass or the plant that we knew we could eat,"" Jee told the commission. ""And then the guards saw us, and he came running and he stepped on our hands and then he brought us to this place and he told us to kneel."" They were forced to eat the grass along with the root and the soil as punishment. Kim became increasingly sick with diarrhea after eating the soil. ""There was nothing I could do,"" Jee said. ""I could not give her any medicine. And when she died, she couldn't even close her eyes. She died with her eyes open. I cried my heart out.""

We later found out that the old man who was guarding the place had his dogs eat the bodies. He raised five dogs and the dogs were eating the heads and the body parts of dead bodies."" This is the reality of the North Korea prison, Jee stated. She ended her testimony saying: ""I am embarrassed, I am ashamed to be here. There are people dying but because I was so desperate to make ends meet for myself, I was not able to help and I'm guilty of it."" ""I live like a prisoner, the reason for my living, the reason that I had to come to South Korea, in addition for my own freedom, is to survive and live on behalf of those who didn't make it.

"Some call it courage, others madness. Still others attribute it just to excessive alcohol. Whatever their motivation, thousands of daredevils from across the globe were on the streets of Pamplona, Spain, on Sunday testing their nerve by sprinting through the city streets in front of six huge, charging bulls. Risking injury at the horns of a frantic, three-quarter-ton creature may not sound like everyone's idea of a pleasant vacation. Yet the legendary, centuries-old  Running of the Bulls in Pamplona -- part of the annual San Fermín Festival -- has attracted more and more tourists to this small, northern Spanish city in recent years. What's the attraction? There's no longer a practical need to herd the bulls through the city streets to the bull ring in the center of town. The frenetic race is maintained because it's fantastic publicity for Pamplona, as well as one of the world's most memorable tests of bravery and agility. Amazing and scary . So, what's your chance of injury? Not as high as the fearful-looking contest might suggest. On the first day of this year's bull run, among the thousands of runners, only four were treated for injuries. But maybe they're counting themselves lucky, showing off their bruises as a mark of courage. After all, it's a sign they almost certainly weren't hiding in a doorway as the bulls thundered past.","Running of the Bulls in Pamplona has attracted more tourists in recent years .

"London (CNN) -- Around the world, hot air balloons are used to give tourists a spectacular view of the landscape, as well as for sport and private recreation. But, with 19 people dead after a hot air balloon crash in Luxor, Egypt, just how safe are they? What are the basics of ballooning? Essentially a balloon is a nylon bag -- known as an envelope -- filled with hot air, which is created by burning liquid propane in a steel burner. More heat makes the balloon rise, less makes it descend. Balloons fly in the direction of the wind. Dunnington described hot air ballooning as ""man's first form of flight."" The French invented it in 1793 and since then it has been developed for sport and tourist rides. Balloons have also been used by the military. How safe is hot air ballooning? Until Tuesday's incident, the deadliest accident in recent memory happened in 1989, when 13 people were killed as two hot air balloons collided in Australia. CNN iReport: After tragedy, vacationers recall glorious balloon rides in Egypt . Weber said while every activity had its risks, ballooning was ""one of the safest means of flying in existence."" ""You are floating in the air like a feather. You put some heat into the envelope to get you up and then you float with the atmosphere, there is no speed involved."" If the fuel ran out, a balloon could still be landed safely, he said. ""It's not like an airline crash. It's like a huge parachute. If you do it [descend] wisely and if you do it in a controlled way you can come down with cold air in the envelope but it's still inflated -- it's still a big balloon."" Weber added that a fire on board was the most dangerous situation for a pilot because the only way to escape it was by jumping overboard. ""If passengers are jumping the balloon is getting lighter -- it's climbing again. It's getting in a more dangerous situation because the higher you go the more dangerous it is to jump out."" Dunnington also said fire resulting from contact with power lines was probably the biggest risk for hot air balloonists. ""If you've hit a power line there isn't a fire extinguisher made that can put that out."" He pointed to a 2012 accident in New Zealand, in which 11 people died. ""New Zealand was a wire contact and it had fatal results and that's certainly the balloonist's biggest worry,"" he said. So what was the cause of the crash in Egypt? State-run EgyNews reported that a gas explosion caused the crash but Egypt's government said a committee from the Ministry of Civil Aviation would investigate. The government said the balloon was ""flying at 300m [about 900feet] when it caught fire and exploded."" How safe is hot air ballooning in Egypt? The last hot air balloon accident in Luxor happened in 2009, when 16 foreign tourists were injured after a balloon struck a cell phone transmission tower. Dunnington described Egypt as having ""a rather chequered history"" when it came to ballooning. The country had probably had more accidents than some others, he said, but on the other hand probably made more flights. ""They've probably had half a dozen serious accidents in the last five years. If that had happened in the UK there would be a big hoo-ha about it."" But Weber said Egyptian operators carried a lot of passengers and flew on a daily basis and the Luxor crash was ""quite exceptional."" How is hot air ballooning regulated? There is no body dealing with air ballooning regulations globally. Around the world, 191 countries are members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations body that issues advice on aviation standards and regulations. But Dunnington said there was no legal obligation to comply with the ICAO's Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS). The ICAO's recommendations were ""sufficiently broad to always need local interpretation,"" he said, adding that this was where ""things get difficult."" ""The regulations are pretty similar in every country. The question in each different country is to what extent are those regulations enforced,"" Dunnington said. ""The Egyptian civil aviation authority is in ultimate charge of what goes on in anything to do with civil aviation in Egypt."" Dunnington said in Britain, for example, pilots had to sit regular medical tests and assessments and balloons were checked after every 100 hours of flight. He said Egypt had a similar system but that it was ""somewhat less independently supervised."" How have Egyptian authorities reacted to the crash? Egypt's Civil Aviation Agency has stopped all ballooning in the country since Tuesday's accident. But Dunnington said a blanket ban didn't solve the problem. ""That kind of knee jerk reaction is symptomatic of the way such problems are approached,"" he said. In Britain, he added, the authorities would look at a particular set of circumstances rather than shutting down everything.

"A resolution passed in the most populous city in Vermont could lead to a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. Burlington's City Council members voted 10-3 in favor of the resolution. City Councilor Norm Blais, a Democrat, said he was moved to sponsor the proposal after hearing what he called President Barack Obama's pleas to have a discussion about weapons in our country after the deadly Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, in December. Next, the resolution has to be presented in public hearings, voted on by the public and be approved by the state legislature before it becomes city law. Giffords, Kelly launch battle against gun lobby . Blais said his city wasn't nearly as safe as people thought, saying that ""if somebody was not a convicted felon and was walking through our thoroughfare and had an AK-47 slung over his shoulder, there's nothing we could do about that. Most people are surprised to hear that."" But most people at Monday's city council meeting spoke out against the resolution, calling it too broad and unwarranted, according to CNN affiliate WPTZ. Burlington Police Chief Michael Schirling said most gun crime in the city involves handguns, not assault weapons, WPTZ reported. Vermont is one of the most lenient states when it comes to gun laws, allowing concealed or openly carried firearms without permits anywhere except school property and courthouses. CNN affiliate WCAX reported that meeting attendee Matt Storer encouraged the city council to not pass the amendment based on emotions because of recent events.  ""I think it's a dangerous course to let emotions get into the driver's seat when writing legislation that could potentially infringe on constitutional rights."" Blais told CNN he had intentionally drafted the proposal broadly so that he could encompass details from officials and those in the community who support gun rights to ensure a fairly written amendment. He said he was not looking to keep sportsmen from hunting and people from being able to defend themselves but rather wants to make sure what happened in Newtown did not happen in his city.

"For a big chunk of the Cold War, the U.S. Air Force turned to the SR-71 Blackbird for many of its most important spy missions. The jet-black jet could fly at more than three times the speed of sound at altitudes of 85,000 feet, faster and higher than anything adversaries had to counter it. The last of the Blackbirds flew in 1999, and the U.S. military hasn't had anything close since. Now, Lockheed-Martin, the maker of the SR-71, says the ""Son of the Blackbird,"" the SR-72, is in the works, and it will be twice as fast as and way more lethal than its father. That's because the SR-72 will be designed to launch missiles, something the SR-71 didn't do. ""Even with the SR-71, at Mach 3, there was still time to notify that the plane was coming, but at Mach 6, there is no reaction time to hide a mobile target,"" Brad Leland,  Lockheed Martin's program manager for hypersonics, told Aviation Week and Space Technology. The publication provided the first detailed look at the SR-72 plans last week. Navy launches new stealth destroyer . ""Hypersonic aircraft, coupled with hypersonic missiles, could penetrate denied airspace and strike at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour,"" Leland said in a news release. And, by the way, the SR-72 is envisioned as a drone, unlike the original Blackbird with its crew of two: a pilot and a reconnaissance officer to operate its radar jammers and spy gear. ""The SR-71 was developed using 20th-century technology. It was envisioned with slide rules and paper. It wasn't managed by millions of lines of software code. And it wasn't powered by computer chips.  All that changes with the SR-72,"" Lockheed Martin says. A smaller-scale model of the SR-72 could begin testing in five years and be in the air in 10, Leland told Aviation Week. The full-scale SR-72 could be operational by 2030, according to Lockheed Martin. If it comes to fruition, one thing the SR-72 won't be is stealthy. The design needed for the Mach 6 speed doesn't allow for such construction, according to the Aviation Week report. ""Speed is the new stealth,"" Aviation Week quoted Al Romig, engineering and advanced systems vice president at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division, as saying. ""Speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades. The technology would be a game-changer in theater, similar to how stealth is changing the battle space today,"" Leland said in the statement. Of course, none of this will fly without money, and that will probably be up to taxpayers. ""We have been continuing to invest company funds, and we are kind of at a point where the next steps would require large-scale testing, which would significantly increase the level of investment we've had to make to-date,"" Leland told Aviation Week. ""Between DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and the Air Force, it would be highly likely they'd have to fund the next steps.""","SR-72 could fly six times the speed of sound .

"Cesar Chavez is something of a national icon. His face is on a U.S. postage stamp. Countless statues, murals, libraries, schools, parks and streets are named after him -- he even has his own national monument. He was on the cover of Time magazine in 1969. A naval ship was named after him. The man even has his own Google Doodle and Apple ad. Yet his footprint in American history is widely unknown and that's exactly the reason why actor-turned-director Diego Luna decided to produce a movie about his life. ""I was really surprised that there wasn't already a film out about Chavez's life, so that's why I spent the past four years making this and hope the country will join me in celebrating his life and work,"" Diego Luna said during Tuesday's screening of ""Cesar Chavez: An American Hero"" in New York.   The movie opens nationwide on Friday. After seeing farm workers harvesting the country's food unable to afford feeding their own families --  let alone the deplorable working conditions they faced --  Chavez decided to act. He and Dolores Huerta co-founded what's now known as the United Farm Workers. They became the first to successfully organize farm workers while being completely committed to nonviolence. Without Chavez, California's farm workers wouldn't have fair wages, lunch breaks and access to toilets or clean water in the fields. Not to mention public awareness about the dangers of pesticides to farm workers and helping outlaw the short-handled hoe. Despite widespread knowledge of its dangers, this tool damaged farm workers' backs. His civil rights activism has been compared to that of Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. Difficult conditions in America's fields . But as the film successfully highlights Chavez's accomplishments, viewers will also be confronted with an uncomfortable truth about who picks their food and under what conditions. Unfortunately, Chavez's successes don't cross state lines. States such as New York, where farm workers face long hours without any overtime pay or a day of rest, are of concern for human rights activist Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. The Kennedys have been supporters of the UFW since Sen. Robert Kennedy broke bread with Chavez during the last day of his fast against violence in 1968. ""New York is 37 years behind California. Farm workers here can be fired if they tried collective bargaining,"" Kennedy said after the ""Cesar Chavez"" screening. ""We need a Cesar Chavez."" Opinion: Why I didn't eat for 22 days . California is still the only state where farm workers have the right to organize. Kennedy is urging the passing of the Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act, which would give farm workers the right to one day of rest each week, time-and-a-half pay for work past an eight-hour day, as well as unemployment, workers' compensation and disability insurance. It's not just New York. Farm workers across the country face hardship. In Michigan's blueberry fields, there's a great deal of child labor, Rodriguez said. ""Because they're paid by piece-rate, it puts a lot of stress on all family members to chip in. Plus, families work under one Social Security number because about 80% of the farm worker population is undocumented,"" Rodriguez added. That's why the UFW and major grower associations worked closely with the Senate's immigration reform bill to include special provisions that would give farm workers legal status if they continued to work in agriculture. ""Farm workers shouldn't struggle so much to feed their own families, and we can be part of that change,"" Luna said. A national holiday in honor Chavez? To help facilitate that change, Luna and the film's cast -- Michael Peña as Chavez, America Ferrera as his wife, Helen, and Rosario Dawson as labor leader Dolores Huerta -- have been trekking all over the country promoting the film and a petition to make Chavez's birthday on March 31 a national holiday. ""We aren't pushing Cesar Chavez Day just to give people a day off. It's to give people a 'day on' because we have a responsibility to provide service to our communities,"" United Farm Workers president  Arturo Rodriguez told CNN. In 2008, President Barack Obama showed his support for the national holiday and even borrowed the United Farm Workers famous chant ""Si Se Puede!' -- coined by Dolores Huerta -- during his first presidential campaign. Obama endorsed it again in 2012, when he created a national monument to honor Chavez, but the resolution still has to be passed by Congress to be recognized as a national holiday. Right now, Cesar Chavez Day is recognized only in California, Texas and Colorado. Huerta, 83, is still going strong in her activism and has also helped promote the film.  She said she wishes the film could have included more history, but she knows it's impossible. ""There were so many important lessons in the film. All the sacrifices Cesar and his wife, Helen, had to make and the obstacles we had to face against the police and judges. We even had people that were killed in the movement but we were still able to organize,"" Huerta said. Actor Tony Plana, who attending the New York screening, knew the late Chavez and credited him with the launch of his acting career.  Plana, known for his role as the father on ABC's ""Ugly Betty"" TV series, said his first acting gig was in the UFW's theatrical troupe educating and helping raising farm workers' awareness about their work conditions. ""I've waited more than 35 years for this film to be made, and I can't tell you how honored I am to finally see it happen,"" Plana told CNN. Cesar Chavez an inspiration to Obama campaign . It's not that there wasn't interest in making the biopic before: Hollywood studios and directors have approached the Chavez family in the past, but the family kept turning them down, mainly for two reasons. ""Well, first Cesar didn't want to spend the time making the film because there was so much work to do, and he was hesitant on being singled out because there were so many others that contributed to the UFW's success,"" said Rodriguez. It wasn't until Luna came around and asked the Chavez family how they felt the movie should be made that the green light was given. But when it came time to getting the funding to produce the film, Hollywood was not willing. ""Hopefully this film will send a message to Hollywood that our [Latino] stories need to be portrayed in cinema,"" Luna added. ""Latinos go to the movies more than anyone else, but we're the least represented on screen. It doesn't make any sense,"" Dawson told CNN. In 2012, Hispanics represented 18% of the movie-going population but accounted for 25% of all movies seen, according to Nielsen National Research Group. ""I hope young people use the power of social media to help spread the word about social change,"" Dawson said. ""There is power in being a consumer and boycotting. If we want more as a community, we need to speak up.""","Cesar Chavez's life not widely known, but actor-director Diego Luna hopes to change that .

"The devices used in the Boston Marathon attack Monday are typical of the ""lone wolf:"" the solo terrorist who builds a bomb on his own by following a widely available formula. In this case, the formula seems very similar to one that al Qaeda has recommended to its supporters around the world as both crudely effective and difficult to trace. But it is also a recipe that has been adopted by extreme right-wing individuals in the United States. The threat of the ""lone wolf"" alarms the intelligence community. ""This is what you worry about the most,"" a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN's Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. ""No trail, no intelligence."" Officials have told CNN that among the materials used in the attack on the marathon were some sort of timing device, a basic mixture of explosives and some sort of metal container containing nails and other projectiles. The FBI said late Tuesday that what appeared to be fragments of ball bearings, or BBs, and nails had been recovered and had possibly been contained in a pressure cooker. One federal law enforcement source told CNN's Deborah Feyerick the devices contained ""low-velocity improvised explosive mixture -- perhaps flash-powder or sugar chlorate mixture likely packed with nails or shrapnel."" An explosives expert told CNN the yellowness of the flame probably came from carbon or some organic fuel such as sugar that contains it. The expert, who is frequently consulted by the FBI and other government agencies, said the white smoke made it ""unlikely that a military-grade high explosive, such as those used in shells and bombs, which is usually grey or black, was used."" U.S. Rep. Mike McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said ""most likely gun powder"" was used in the devices. Such improvised devices use readily available materials that cannot be easily traced. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, in its English-language online magazine Inspire, noted such ""ingredients are readily available"" and they are ""easily disposed of if the enemy searches your home."" There is no evidence that AQAP or any of its supporters was involved in the Boston attack. Nor is it clear whether the attack was the work of one or more individuals. But AQAP has championed 'do-it-yourself terrorism' in the last three years, urging Muslims in the West to take action on their own. ""How to Make a Bomb in Your Mom's Kitchen,"" published in a 2010 edition of Inspire, has been downloaded by Islamist militants plotting terrorist attacks in both the United States and the U.K., according to counterterrorism officials. Eight pages were devoted to building a basic but lethal device. The ingredients included sugar and a black powder made from match heads. Combining step-by-step instructions and diagrams, the magazine described wiring a ""timed circuit as it is simple"" and using small nails as shrapnel. It said gunpowder or powder from fireworks can be used as a substitute for match heads. It continues: ""It only works if contained in a high-pressure environment. So you may use iron pipes, pressure cookers, fire extinguishers or empty propane canisters ... The pressure cooker is the most effective method."" The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has issued several unclassified bulletins about the use of pressure cookers as part of an explosive device. In July 2010, the DHS said that while pressure cookers are common in countries such as Afghanistan, ""the presence of a pressure cooker in an unusual location such as a building lobby or busy street corner should be treated as suspicious."" Such a formula is certainly not unique to AQAP. Variations appear all over the Internet.  A senior U.S. counterterrorism investigator told CNN that pressure cooker bombs have also been a signature of extreme right-wing individuals in the United States who he said tend to revel in building homemade bombs. For example, the devices planted by Erich Rudolph at an Atlanta park during the 1996 Olympic Games were pipe bombs filled with gunpowder and nails  to increase their lethality; it also had an alarm clock as a timing mechanism. Like the bombings in Boston, those devices were concealed in a backpack, according to a Department of Homeland Security report detailing the 1996 attack. At least two previous terrorist plots on U.S. soil have involved variations on the Inspire recipe, and both involved ""lone wolves."" Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad tried to detonate a vehicle bomb in Times Square in 2010 that included ""a pressure cooker containing approximately 120 firecrackers,"" according to the 2010 DHS bulletin. The indictment against another alleged ""lone wolf"" militant, Jose Pimentel, described a video ""showing the defendant following precisely the instructions from the Inspire Magazine article by (i) scraping the heads from the matches and collecting the incendiary powder in a bowl; and (ii) connecting a Christmas tree light to the battery using wiring to create an ignition device."" Pimentel was arrested by New York police in November 2011 and pleaded not guilty to state terrorism charges.  He had not received training overseas, but Shahzad had received training from a bomb-maker with the Pakistani Taliban. And exactly one year before Pimentel's arrest, Taimur Abdulwahab al-Abdaly flew to Sweden from England. There he built a powerful but  rudimentary bomb, using ingredients he was able to purchase locally: pressure cookers, fireworks, explosive chemicals, and nails and ball bearings. He too had received bomb-making training, not in Pakistan, like many others, but in Iraq. Abdulwahab died when he tried to detonate a device in central Stockholm in December 2010.","Boston Marathon bombs seem to follow widely available recipe, experts say .

"The news from Pakistan is generally bad news. In the past week, which was far from atypical, suicide bombers attacked a court building in the northwestern city of Peshawar taking hostages and killing four people. In the southern city of Karachi the director of a renowned social program working in the megacity's poorest neighborhoods was shot and killed. And gunmen kidnapped two female Czech tourists in southwestern Pakistan. But this past week also saw more than a glimmer of good news from Pakistan: Saturday, March 16 marked an extraordinary moment in Pakistani history, as this is the first time  a civilian government has served its entire five-year term (from 2008 to 2013). And, for the first time in its history, the Pakistani military appears unwilling to mount a coup against the civilian government. The military has successfully executed three coups and attempted a number of others since Pakistan's independence in 1947. Today the army understands that the most recent coup by General Pervez Musharraf who took power in 1999 has tarnished its brand. Musharraf hung on to power for almost a decade and his imposition of emergency rule in 2007 triggered massive street protests and eventually his ouster. On Saturday, Musharaf announced he is returning to Pakistan from self-imposed exile on March 24 to run in elections that are to be held two months from now. In a telling sign that Pakistan is moving into something of a new era, Pakistani military officials are not supportive of Musharraf's return and nor is much of the Pakistani public. On May 11, Pakistanis will go to the polls to elect a new civilian government for a five-year term, and there is now a good prospect for continued, uninterrupted civilian government until at least 2018. In terms of Pakistan's long-term health and stability, the fact that the country is in an unprecedented era of lengthy civilian rule will help erode the Pakistani military's present position as having uncontested supremacy in all matters that relate to the country's national security, in particular its relations with India and with Afghanistan. The military has backed insurgent and terrorist groups in India and Afghanistan to maintain its perceived interests in these countries. A more confident civilian Pakistani government will, hopefully, over time be less likely to support these militant groups. Another great opportunity (and potential peril) will present itself in Afghanistan, when Afghans go to the polls in April 2014 for the third presidential election since the fall of the Taliban. If that election is perceived as being relatively free and fair this would go a long way to ease tensions in the Afghan body politic, increase Afghanistan's overall security and reassure both Afghan and outside investors that the country has a promising future. On the other hand, if the 2014 election is seen as unfair, corrupted and is deeply contested, this would likely precipitate a vicious circle of conflict, deteriorating security and capital flight. The United States, therefore, should do everything it can to provide technical and security assistance to make these elections go as well as possible. But unlike what happened in the run-up to the 2009 Afghan presidential election, U.S. officials should not get involved in privately backing certain candidates. This private support had the unintended effect of splitting the opposition to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, as key leaders of the anti-Karzai opposition all believed they were ""America's candidate."" It also deeply alienated Karzai, whose occasional diatribes against the United States are best understood as due to his lingering resentment over this issue. A key aspect of U.S. and NATO planning for the Afghan presidential elections in April 2014 is that given the fact that there are no discernible front-runners to succeed Karzai, there may be no clear winner who attains more than 50% of the vote, which under Afghan electoral laws would necessitate a runoff election between the two leading candidates. Security, technical and economic assistance for the Afghan elections should be prepared to extend into  summer 2014, because it is not clear as yet when that runoff might be held. Last year the United States and Afghanistan negotiated a Strategic Partnership Agreement, which ensures America will continue to play a supporting role there until 2024. The exact details of what that agreement means in practice are still being hammered out (according to U.S. officials, these negotiations may take until November) but they are likely to include not only significant U.S. aid but also many thousands of American soldiers stationed in Afghanistan for years into the future as a guarantor of the country's stability. The U.S. military has given President Obama a range of options under which as few as 6,000 or as many as 20,000 soldiers would remain in Afghanistan after 2014. Those forces would work as advisers to the Afghan army and mount special operations raids against the Taliban and al Qaeda. Whatever the final decision is on troop levels, the key point is that the Obama administration and other U.S. officials should emphasize very clearly that the thousands of American soldiers who will remain in Afghanistan are there to support the United States' long-term partnership agreement with Afghanistan -- and that its life extends well beyond 2014. This is important to emphasize, because Afghans have been understandably confused by some of the different signals the Obama administration has made about its commitment to Afghanistan in the past. Major confusion arose after President Obama's December 2009 announcement of the ""surge"" of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, which was coupled with the announcement that those troops would begin to withdraw beginning in July 2011. In many Afghans' minds, the withdrawal date became more important than the fact that during his first term Obama actually tripled the number of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan from around 30,000 to a total of 90,000. When the Obama administration announces the number of soldiers who will remain in Afghanistan post-2014, it should emphasize that the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan is set to last until at least 2024. This will help in multiple ways: First, this guarantee of a long-term U.S. commitment to Afghanistan will encourage other NATO countries to maintain some of their own troops in Afghanistan to work with the Afghans in areas like training the army and police past the end of the NATO combat mission in December 2014. Such an announcement will also help reassure Afghans that the United States won't be simply turning off the lights in Afghanistan in December 2014. And it will signal to regional powers like Pakistan and Iran that the United States plans to remain engaged in Afghanistan for many years into the future. A key issue facing the Afghan government as the United States draws down its forces is how will the Afghan economy fare? Should the economy collapse, the Afghan government's ability to deal with security issues would be substantially eroded. Already, rents in Kabul are tumbling and nongovernmental organizations are laying off staff. Surprisingly, however, a rigorous and comprehensive World Bank study last year found that Afghanistan will continue to have a healthy growth rate, dropping from its present robust 9% a year rate ""to closer to 5% on average until 2018."" (The U.S. economy's yearly growth rates over the past four years have been around 2%.) The economic contraction as the United States draws down is likely to be less severe than might be supposed, partly because the hundreds of billions that the U.S. military has spent in Afghanistan over the past decade is spending that almost entirely benefits the United States. The World Bank study points out that ""military spending by the United States (and other countries) finances the salaries of military personnel, investments in weapons equipment and systems. ... The impact of its withdrawal is therefore likely to be muted."" Another encouraging sign is the investigation of the troubled Kabul Bank, in which some $900 million was lost to fraud, indicating that the culture of impunity for corrupt Afghan officials might be beginning to erode. Earlier this month, 21 officials were found guilty of fraud and two of the former heads of the bank were sentenced to five years in prison. The Afghan Attorney General's office said last week that it would appeal the sentences as being too soft given the scale of the fraud. A key question is the extent to which the Afghan army and police can operate effectively against the Taliban as the United States withdraws. As yet the Afghan army hasn't shown the ability to conduct large-scale operations without significant American support. In addition, a big issue for the army is the extraordinarily high attrition rate. Today, a little more then a quarter of the recruits to the army drop out every year. Because of this high dropout rate, NATO is now considering maintaining the Afghan army and police at its present large size of 352,000 men through 2018. (Estimates of the size of the Taliban typically are in the 25,000 range.) One indicator of the increasingly Afghan-led nature of the fight against the Taliban is the fact that some 300 Afghan soldiers and policemen are now dying every month in the war, while in January three U.S. soldiers were killed, which was the lowest number of any month during the previous four years. On Afghanistan, Pakistan has some important common goals with the United States, NATO and Afghans themselves. Pakistan does not want to see Afghanistan collapse into a renewed civil war, which would destabilize Pakistan, nor does it want to see the Taliban in charge of the country again. When the Taliban was in power in Afghanistan the group resisted Pakistani efforts at control, while the Pakistani Taliban have killed many thousands inside Pakistan. These basic shared goals, no civil war and no Taliban control of Afghanistan, can help to create the conditions for a successful post-2014 Afghanistan . Pakistan also wants a Pashtun-led government in Kabul and for the Taliban to have some representation in the south and the east. These are also goals the Afghans can live with. Karzai is, after all, a Pashtun and given the fact that Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, the next president of Afghanistan almost certainly will be a Pashtun. And other ethnic minorities can live with a situation in which the Taliban assume a number of provincial and district governorships providing they lay down their arms, join the political process and recognize the Afghan constitution. According to a senior Afghan government official, numerous discussions between representatives of the Taliban and the Afghan government have taken place over the past years to discuss such a political accommodation, although, so far, not much of anything has come of these talks.

"(CNN)It must have seemed like the apocalypse. In less than 60 seconds, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake shifted Haiti's landscape and changed millions of lives forever. The government estimated about 220,000 deaths from the disaster, which occurred five years ago Monday. It also left about 1.5 million Haitians homeless. Then things got worse. A massive cholera outbreak followed, killing nearly 8,600. ""Speaking with the people, listening to their stories, I think that they experienced something that was really inhuman, something that it is impossible to understand, or to narrate,"" said award-winning Italian photographer Marco Gualazzini, who visited Haiti last month. He said there's still a lot of work to do. Nearly 80,000 live day to day without a ""proper roof over their heads,"" according to the International Organization for Migration. Many of these homeless live in displacement camps. Related: Impact Your World . During his visit, Gualazzini found hopeful signs of recovery. But he also noticed disappointing evidence that the nation might be heading toward a dark future economically and politically. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. His photograph of a street market in the capital, Port-au Prince, ranks among his favorite images from this trip because of its soft and peaceful light and the mist rising from the pier. The people at the market represent so much about the state of Haiti today, he said. The scene depicts ""just an ordinary market, a lively market which has been bartering, buying and selling all day long under the baking heat of the sun,"" Gualazzini pointed out. ""But for a city that only five years ago suffered an earthquake -- creating so many orphans, widows and cripples, making so many poor people even poorer -- I think it is an extraordinary sign of recovery."" Gualazzini's visit wasn't all as peaceful. Three days a week, anti-government anger and frustration prompted thousands of Haitians to stage protests in slum areas such as Cite Soleil and Waf Jeremie. Protest slogans during these demonstrations often were followed by police firing tear gas and then the sound of gunshots, he said. Related: Prime minister quits after widespread protests . ""People are tired of this ever-increasing divide which is being created between the rich and the poor,"" Gualazzini said. Haiti, like many other developing countries, Gualazzini said, ""needs to bridge this gap between the opulence of the rich and the inhuman poverty of the ever-more-impoverished poor."" From the moment he arrived, Gualazzini knew where he could capture photos to illustrate that idea. Tiny, brightly painted homes in a slum area known as Jalousie form a backdrop to Petion-Ville, one of the richest and wealthiest districts of Port-au Prince. ""These small buildings clinging to the hills look like houses in a nativity scene,"" Gualazzini said, ""and the inattentive visitor would never imagine that this is actually an extremely poor slum area in which violence is still congenital and the inhabitants do not have access even to the most basic facilities."" But Gualazzini had trouble capturing Jalousie in the right light. Nearly every day for three weeks, he fought his way through Port-au Prince's gridlocked traffic to return to the slum and try for a good picture. Finally, at 6 in the morning on the last day of his visit, he found himself looking at Jalousie again. All packed up and ready to leave the island, while waiting for a taxi, he decided to try one more time. He pointed his camera and focused. And that's when it happened. ""The light came up from behind the hills and entered the camera,"" he recalled. With a push of his shutter button, Gualazzini had captured his elusive shot. (The second photo in the gallery above.) ""The quake left an indelible mark on Haiti,"" Gualazzini said. ""Yet the people still managed to get back on their feet. They cleared away the rubble and started to build again where there was only pain and death."" If they can successfully confront such devastation, can Haiti's people next figure out a way to work and prosper together? As Gualazzini put it, ""They're at a crossroads.""","Marco Gualazzini's photos show Haiti five years after a devastating earthquake .

"A kid raised in a middle-class Boston suburb, Michael Bloomberg took out loans to pay for his tuition at Johns Hopkins University and worked as a parking lot attendant. He learned early to pay it forward. Bloomberg's first gift to his alma mater was a whopping $5 in 1965, a year after he graduated with a bachelor's degree in engineering. Fast forward to Saturday, when the Baltimore university announced Bloomberg has now given a total of $1.1 billion. The latest commitment came in the form of a cool $350 million toward a ""transformational"" initiative aimed at cross-discipline solutions to societal problems. In a statement, Johns Hopkins said Bloomberg, a former trustee, is believed to be the first person to ever reach the $1 billion level of giving to a single U.S. institution of higher education. The university's Twitter feed was aglow with information on the gift. One tweet heralded the announcement with the words, ""Big News,"" which might have been an understatement. Among other things, the donation will fund 2,600 Bloomberg Scholarships over 10 years and 50 distinguished scholars. Of the $350 million, $100 million will go toward ""need-based financial aid"" for undergraduate students. ""Johns Hopkins University has been an important part of my life since I first set foot on campus more than five decades ago,"" Bloomberg said in the press release. ""Each dollar I have given has been well-spent improving the institution and, just as importantly, making its education available to students who might otherwise not be able to afford it."" The remarkable tally speaks to the generosity and success of New York City's mayor, who grew a business empire after leaving Baltimore. He will turn 71 on Valentine's Day. Bloomberg earned an MBA from Harvard Business School. He was hired by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers in 1966, according to his biography on NYC's website. After he was let go from Salomon when it was acquired in 1981, the budding entrepreneur used his information systems expertise to launch Bloomberg LP, which provided advanced computer systems for traders and financial firms. Bloomberg's media interests followed and the company now has more than 15,000 employees worldwide, according to his biography. Bloomberg eventually devoted his energies to philanthropy and politics. He was elected mayor of the Big Apple in 2001 and has held the office since. His first $1 million commitment to Johns Hopkins was made in 1984, 20 years after graduation, in honor of his mother, Charlotte. The university's president, Ronald J. Daniels, said Saturday's announced gift ""illustrates Mike's passion for fixing big problems quickly and efficiently. It will ensure not only that Johns Hopkins helps to solve humanity's problems, but also that it leads the world's universities in showing how it should be done."" The mayor's overall giving includes $240 million for capital and infrastructure improvements, $219 million for student financial aid and $336 million for research. ""Giving is only meaningful if the money will make a difference in people's lives,"" said Bloomberg. ""And I know of no other institution that can make a bigger difference in lives around the world through its groundbreaking research -- especially in the field of public health.""","NYC mayor's latest gift to Johns Hopkins is $350 million .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, has withdrawn his name from consideration as surgeon general of the United States, he said Thursday. Dr. Sanjay Gupta will continue his work as a surgeon and for CNN. ""This is more about my family and my surgical career,"" Gupta told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" The neurosurgeon said he would likely have had to give up practicing had he taken the job as the nation's top doctor. In addition, the 39-year-old and his wife are expecting their third daughter any time, and the government job would have meant long periods away from his family, he said. ""I think, for me, it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else,"" he said. ""I just didn't feel I should do that now.""  Watch Gupta explain his reasoning » . Gupta said he had not been formally nominated for the job, though he had spoken with senior members of the Obama administration, who made it clear he was their choice, he said. ""I think there was a real melding there,"" he said, adding that he felt flattered to have been considered. Earlier Thursday, an administration official said Gupta ""was under serious consideration for the job of surgeon general. He has removed himself from consideration to focus more on his medical career and his family. We know he will continue to serve and educate the public through his work with media and in the medical arena."" Sources said in January that Gupta had met then-President-elect Obama in Chicago, Illinois, in November to discuss the post. At the time, Gupta declined to comment. The transition team was impressed with the combination of Gupta's government experience, as a White House fellow in 1997 and a special adviser to then-first lady Hillary Clinton, along with his medical career as a neurosurgeon and his communication skills, the transition sources said. Gupta is a member of the staff and faculty of the Department of Neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. He regularly performs surgery at Emory University Hospital and at Grady Memorial Hospital, where he serves as associate chief of neurosurgery. Gupta joined CNN in 2001. As chief medical correspondent for the health and medical unit, he is a lead reporter on breaking medical news, provides regular health and medical updates for ""American Morning,"" anchors the half-hour weekend medical affairs program ""House Call with Dr. Sanjay Gupta"" and reports for CNN documentaries. Based in Atlanta, Gupta also contributes health stories to CNN.com, co-hosts ""Accent Health"" for Turner Private Networks, provides medical segments for the syndicated version of ""ER"" on TNT and writes a column for Time magazine. He also anchors the global health program ""Vital Signs"" for CNN International and is featured in a weekly podcast on health issues called ""Paging Dr. Gupta."" Just after joining CNN, Gupta became part of the team covering the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Later that year, he led breaking news reporting on a series of anthrax attacks. In 2003, Gupta reported from Iraq and Kuwait as an embedded correspondent with the U.S. Navy's medical unit -- and worked alongside them, performing brain surgery five times. In addition, Gupta reported from Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the tsunami that swept the region in December 2004. He also helped cover the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina from New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2005. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan and his medical degree from the University of Michigan Medical Center.","""This is more about my family and my surgical career,"" Gupta says .

"It was another December afternoon back in 2000, spent like hundreds of others combing the rocky hills of the Dikika region, when Ethiopian scientist Zeray Alemseged heard one of his assistants nearby calling him. ""He said 'oh, doctor I see something there,'"" recalls Alemseged, who'd been excavating the hot and dry landscape for over a year, helped only by a small inexperienced crew of locals. ""And I went there and I see the cheek bone part ... sticking out of the rock. I turned it upside down and my jaw literally dropped."" Instantly, Alemseged realized this was an extraordinary discovery that could make scientific history. ""Right away I could tell this is a child of a human ancestor,"" says the paleoanthropologist. ""You have this child in a block of sandstone, with the baby teeth still visible, very vertical forehead, small canine,"" he adds. ""But it's so rare and so unbelievable that I just couldn't accept that was the case, that what I saw was the skeleton."" Read this: Civil war survivor creates bionic limbs . Yet Alemseged did not want to make news of his discovery public until he had a more complete picture of what he'd unearthed. So he kept it quiet as he meticulously prepared and analyzed the fossil. ""The skeleton was encaved in a block of sandstone matrix, which is very densely compact, very inured sand, so that I had to go remove the sand grain by grain,"" says Alemseged. ""So I took my time, and people advised me to employ technicians, and technicians can do that job, but I said 'no, it's going to take as long as it takes but I'm not going to delegate this work of the exploration of this unique child to anyone else but me.'"" Alemseged then spent years in the lab painstakingly picking away the sand grain by grain. By using a super microscope, he was able to see details in the teeth embedded in the skull that revealed to him the skeleton's age and the sex. He now knew the fossil was that of a three-year-old girl who had died 3.3 million years ago. Finally, after more than six long years, Alemseged was ready to present to the world ""Selam,"" the fossil known as ""the world's oldest child."" ""When the time came to go to the press conference,"" remembers Alemseged, ""it was like a woman is pregnant and she is holding that baby for nine months and when the baby comes out, what happens is -- in spite of the pain, in spite of the long, tedious process of carrying the baby -- you see her smiling, you see her beautiful wonderful face trying to share the baby with her husband or the doctor. ""So I shared my baby with the audience but the different thing is that I was sharing a child that belonged not only to me but to humanity, to seven billion individuals."" Read this: African midwife, Nobel Peace Prize? That press conference in 2006 turned Alemseged, who was just 31 when he'd discovered Selam, into a hero in the world of science. Over the next few years, his work took him all over the world, winning him international admiration for his achievements.  Today Alemseged is the director of anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences, a multifaceted scientific institution and museum where he combines his scientific research with his passion for public education. ""When I got involved in this type of research I decided to not only read what has already been discovered but also to make my own discoveries and I can proudly say that I have achieved that with the discovery of Selam and many other fossils,"" he says. ""Those finds are finds that change textbooks, literally, so I am happy but I'm not satisfied -- I will be satisfied only if I could instill the same type of psychology, the same type of excitement, the same type of passion to the next generations of Africans."" Read this: Ethiopian town breeding Olympians . Alemseged, a father of two, enjoys the opportunity to share his findings with the world and possibly inspire a new generation of scientists. In recent years, he's teamed up with other scientists from his continent to create the East African Association for Paleoanthropology, a group holding regular conferences to bring together top scientists and researchers from the region and beyond. And while his achievements have made him a success story that young Ethiopians can aspire to, Alemseged's efforts to create a positive impact on young Africans are just a small step toward his ultimate goals. ""I think both my family and Ethiopia are proud of me, but I still think that I still have so much to offer, not just to Ethiopia, but to Africa and to humanity in general,"" he says. ""My work is beyond nations, beyond nationalities, beyond continents -- it unites everyone on the planet. So when I achieve that, I'm sure Ethiopia and my family are or will be proud of me and I thank them for all of the opportunities they have provided me with also.""","Ethiopian Zeray Alemseged discovered the fossil known as ""the world's oldest child""

"The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv underwent emergency surgery after being shot in the back, city officials and police said Monday, amid continuing unrest in the region. The attack on Mayor Gennady Kernes happened around noon local time, the Kharkiv city office official website said. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the shooting. After a two-hour operation, Kernes was out of surgery but in critical condition, the city office said. ""The surgery was successful. His life-threatening condition is expected to go on for several days,"" a statement said. ""He was unconscious when brought to the hospital."" The online statement also said a bullet casing was found at the scene. Police said an investigation unit was trying to determine the circumstances of the shooting. In a major challenge to Kiev's new leaders, armed rebels have captured towns and government buildings across eastern Ukraine and are holding a team of European monitors hostage. Western nations accuse Moscow of supporting the separatist gunmen who are occupying official buildings in cities across the region. Sanctions . The United States on Monday imposed sanctions against seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in its latest action to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine. The White House said the seven Russians, including two from Putin's inner circle, are now subject to a freeze on any assets they hold in the United States and a ban on U.S. travel. In addition, the United States will deny export license applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. The Commerce and State departments will revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions, the White House said in a statement. ""The sanctions build on the ones that were already in place. We're moving forward with an expanded list of individuals,"" U.S. President Barack Obama earlier told reporters in Manila, Philippines. The move, Obama said, was to spur Putin to ""walk the walk, not just talk the talk"" in resolving the crisis in Ukraine. If the latest round of sanctions does not work, the next phase could target economic sectors like banking, Obama said. The European Union also announced Monday that it was imposing sanctions on 15 people who are ""responsible for actions which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine."" A list of the people targeted by the latest sanctions will be published Tuesday and will go into effect at the same time, the Council of the European Union said. The sanctions will include asset freezes and travel bans. U.S. and Russian defense secretaries speak . U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke on the phone with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Monday. According to a Pentagon description of their conversation, Shoigu ""reiterated his assurance that Russian forces would not invade Ukraine."" Hagel, the Pengaton said, called for an end to what he described as ""Russia's destabilizing influence inside Ukraine"" and ""warned that continued aggression would further isolate Russia and result in more diplomatic and economic pressure."" The Russian government's description of the call said Shoigu ""definitively denied the groundless allegations of the presence of Russian sabotage and military intelligence groups on Ukrainian territory"" and criticized what he called ""anti-Russian hysteria recently unleashed in the Western press."" He also criticized what he said was an ""unprecedented"" increase in activity of U.S. and NATO troops in Eastern Europe near the Russian border, according to the Russian government's description of the call. Ukrainian soldier killed . A homemade bomb exploded near Ukrainian soldiers who were in the eastern Donetsk region Monday, killing one and injuring another, Ukraine's Defense Ministry said. The death came days after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants in an operation to clear roadblocks near the city of Slavyansk last week. Police are investigating Monday's blast, the Defense Ministry said. A CNN team covering a pro-Ukraine rally in Donetsk watched violence unfold Monday as pro-Russian separatists wielding batons beat demonstrators who said they wanted to see a united Ukraine. Observer freed . Pro-Russian separatists holding a European military observer team in eastern Ukraine released one of the observers for medical reasons Sunday, shortly after parading them before cameras. At least seven of the inspectors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe appeared at a news conference staged by Vyacheslav Ponomarev, the self-declared mayor of Slavyansk, who referred to them as ""prisoners of war."" The freed observer was from Sweden and had been suffering from diabetes, Ponomarev spokeswoman Stella Khorosheva told CNN. Michael Bociurkiw, an OSCE spokesman in Kiev, called it ""a welcome development."" The monitors were seized Friday outside Slavyansk, one of the flashpoints in the standoff between Ukraine's interim government and pro-Russian factions challenging its authority in the east. They said that although they have diplomatic status, they went along with Sunday's news conference because the mayor asked them to. Germany strongly criticized the group's appearance before the media. The ""parading of OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is abhorrent and a flagrant violation of their human dignity,"" Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement. He added that Russia had a duty to ""influence"" the separatists so that the other members of the mission could be freed as soon as possible. Putin has repeatedly criticized what he says is Kiev's use of force against Ukrainian civilians.","The European Union announces it's imposing sanctions on 15 people .

"(CNN) -- And then there were 10. ""I think this is probably our last reunion,"" said Howard Van Schoor, 86, of Mentor, Ohio. ""I wish it could continue, but we're getting shorter in numbers."" At a hotel where I was staying near an Ohio interstate highway exit, I had seen a small group of elderly men having breakfast together each morning. In front of the little area that had been reserved for them was a placard with a military insignia and the words: ""Blood and Fire."" I would see them in the elevators; I introduced myself, and found out that this was the annual reunion of the 63rd Infantry Division that, in World War II, had fought its way through France and Germany. Fifteen-thousand American soldiers in that division had crossed the ocean to Europe; the men I spoke with said that some 1,100 had been killed in combat, with many thousands more injured, some grievously. The ones who were lucky enough to make it home after the war began having reunions in 1947. They were large events during the 1950s and into the 1960s; 500 or 600 veterans of the 63rd Infantry would convene for regional gatherings, and would bring their families. Sometimes, the men told me, there would be thousands of people at the get-togethers. Ten soldiers were well enough to come to the national reunion this year. ""They would love to hold onto it,"" said Mary Fran Collier, the daughter of former infantry sergeant Bill Byrnes, whom she had accompanied to the reunion. ""But this will almost certainly be the final time. With so few of the men who are still alive and able to attend, we don't even have a large enough group to get a good rate at hotels."" Her dad -- 86, a retired carpenter who lives in Oak Lawn, Illinois -- said he was 18 when he went into the service. Fighting in Europe, he said, ""You had to depend on one another for whether you lived or not. When you lost one, it was like losing a brother."" That is why the reunions have always meant so much to him: ""We went through the same things, and we're the only ones who can understand that. When you're getting shelled together ... the lucky ones who made it through, it's just so good to see each other every year. You're just so glad to see them."" They were riflemen and artillerymen and mortarmen during the European campaign; they slept out in the open when the temperatures were below zero and when the temperatures were 80 degrees, they sometimes had to go weeks without bathing, they dug foxholes for shelter and ate cold rations and dreamed of home. They encountered, and helped to liberate, Nazi concentration camps and, the indelible horror fresh in their eyes and in their minds, they fought on. Young men then, they often feared that they would never have the chance to see their families again. At the dinnertime banquets at the three-day reunion this year, even with family members and an honor guard present, there were only around 35 people in the room. A ventriloquist entertained the old soldiers one night; at one meal there was a combo playing songs from the 1940s. In the weeks since the reunion, I have kept in touch with some of the men and have spoken with them some more. They told me that the motto of their division -- that ""Blood and Fire"" line -- derived from a wartime speech by Winston Churchill, in which he said that the Axis powers would ""bleed and burn in expiation of their crimes against humanity."" The men know that very few people remain who recall the duty of the 63rd. But their pride in their combat remains fierce. ""This division accomplished everything it was asked to do,"" said Edward F. Fowle, 88, of Springfield, Ohio, who was 19 when he went in. ""Never gave up an inch of ground, literally or figuratively."" The men said they hope that American military men and women who are serving around the world right now will someday find the same comfort and warmth when, 50 or 60 years in the future, their own surviving numbers grow small, and they are able to get together with those who fought beside them: with the people who know best what they went through, who shared such an arduous and defining part of their young lives. ""The feeling is still there,"" said Dr. Jack Linscott, 86, a retired family physician in Marysville, Ohio, who enlisted when he was 17. ""We have something in common. We counted on each other then, and we still do. It helps to know that there is someone who will watch your back."" At the hotel the men sat and talked quietly. Some walked slowly; other guests at the hotel either waited patiently, or hurriedly walked around them, intent to get where they were going without delay. ""My eyesight isn't too good anymore,"" said Howard Van Schoor. ""But I like seeing these friends every year. They protected me, and I am grateful for that."" During the war, Bill Byrnes said, when a member of the 63rd would die in combat, replacement troops would be brought in. ""After a while, we learned not to get too friendly, in a way,"" he said. ""Because we knew that it would be breaking up your heart again when one of them goes, too."" The end of the reunions is something the men say they know they will have to accept. ""We don't cry on each others' shoulders about it,"" Jack Linscott told me. ""The feeling is that it has come to this, and there's nothing we can do about it.""

"(CNN)Connect the dots, piece together the paths of terrorists. That's one challenge for authorities in the wake of last week's bloodshed in France. Understanding what happened is one thing. Understanding why it happened requires not just knowing the players involved but also their backgrounds and how they were linked. And, according to authorities and sources, the links extend between the suspects in the Paris shootings and some of biggest names in the terror world. They have been tied to two of the world's biggest and strongest terrorist groups: al Qaeda and ISIS. The names Cherif Kouachi, Said Kouachi, Amedy Coulibaly and Hayat Boumeddiene are now known around the world, with three of them dead and the fourth -- Boumeddiene -- being sought. Here's what they did and their relationship to one other. CHERIF KOUACHI . Who was he? Like his brother, Said, the 32-year-old French citizen of Algerian descent was born in Paris and raised in orphanages and foster homes from a young age. Reports in French media described him as a rap fan more interested in chasing girls than going to the mosque -- at least until he became a student of well-known French spiritual leader Farid Benyettou. Where did he go? French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira told CNN that one of the Kouachi brothers had been in Yemen in 2005, but did not say which one. On Friday, shortly before his death as police stormed the building where he and his brother had holed up, Cherif Kouachi told CNN affiliate BFMTV that he'd trained in Yemen with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The United States believes Cherif Kouachi traveled to Yemen in 2011, but investigators are still trying to confirm that the trip happened and corroborate details with other intelligence, a U.S. official said. In 2005, he was arrested for being part of a jihadist recruitment ring in Paris that sent fighters to join the conflict in Iraq. The arrest came not long before he and another man were about to set off for Syria en route to Iraq, where war was raging. Evidence suggests Cherif Kouachi traveled to Syria and returned to France in August 2014, a French source close to that nation's security services told CNN. Who did he know? In his conversation with BFMTV, Cherif Kouachi said he met with Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Muslim who was the face of AQAP until he was killed in the fall of 2011 in a U.S. drone strike. While in pretrial detention before his eventual conviction of being part of a jihadist recruitment ring, Cherif met Djamel Beghal, who was in prison for his role in an attempted attack against the U.S. Embassy in Paris in 2001. Beghal, a French Algerian, was once known as al Qaeda's premiere European recruiter. Cherif Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly were also close associates, according to court documents obtained by CNN, which show that French authorities knew alarming details about them as recently as a year ago. Once they were freed from prison, they would visit Beghal, bringing him food and money and sometimes spending days at his apartment. Boumeddiene was also part of the visits. Cherif Kouachi and Coulibaly hid their conversations by using code names over disposable cell phones, according to the court documents. SAID KOUACHI . Who was he? Like his brother, Cherif, the 34-year-old French citizen grew up an orphan. Mohammed Benali, who runs the mosque in Gennevilliers, the suburb where Cherif Kouachi had an apartment, said the two brothers used to come to Friday prayers there ""not assiduously but regularly."" He told Le Figaro that he knew Said Kouachi better, but that he hadn't seen either of the brothers at the mosque in at least two years. He said the older brother was ""a very reserved man,"" but he recalled one angry outburst in the mosque when the imam encouraged the faithful to vote in the presidential election. Said Kouachi ""had an angry reaction, he left the prayer room and voiced his disagreement,"" Benali said. ""For these lunatics, when we practice and teach moderate Islam -- actual Islam -- we're nonbelievers."" Where did he go? A senior Yemeni national security official told CNN that Said Kouachi entered Yemen multiple times with an officially issued visa, during which time he was ""not being watched."" Kouachi first went to Yemen in 2009, said Yemeni journalist and researcher Mohammed al-Kibsi. Officials haven't confirmed a connection between the two. He stayed there until mid-2010 before leaving briefly and returning at the end of that year. He remained in Yemen most of 2011, according to Kibsi, who said he met the man twice. U.S. officials have said Said Kouachi spent several months in Yemen in 2011, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Kibsi said he saw Kouachi again in 2012, in the old city of Sanaa at another Arabic language center. USA Today reported that Said Kouachi traveled to Syria. Who did he know? While in Yemen, he lived in the same apartment as convicted underwear bomber Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, journalist al-Kibsi said. This would have had to have been before December 2009, when AbdulMutallab was detained in Detroit after his commercial airline bombing plot failed. Kouachi said that he and AbdulMutallab used to pray together at Yemen's al-Tabari School, and that they shared an apartment for one to two weeks in Yemen, according to al-Kibisi. Kouachi was studying Arabic grammar at the Sanaa Arabic Grammar Institute, al-Kibisi said. CNN does not have official confirmation that Said Kouachi knew AbdulMutallab, a Nigerian national who, authorities said at his U.S. trial, told the FBI that he that he had links to Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . It's also possible that he met al-Awlaki while in Yemen. Last year alone, his wife exchanged 500 phone calls with at-large suspect Hayat Boumeddiene, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molin. The wife told investigators that her husband and suspect Amedy Coulibaly knew each other well. AMEDY COULIBALY . Who was he? The 32-year-old went by the alias Doly Gringny. Before this week, he was known to French authorities dating back at least to his May 18, 2010, arrest for his involvement in an attempt to free an Algerian serving time for a 1995 subway bombing, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Where did he go? Little is known about Coulibaly's travels, beyond that he and girlfriend Hayat Boumeddiene traveled to Malaysia together. Who did he know? At the time of his 2010 arrest for the prison break plot, he had 240 rounds of ammunition for a Kalishnikov and photo of himself with Beghal. Cherif Kouachi was also implicated in the prison plot, but he denied involvement and was not jailed for that. In court documents, Coulibaly was described as a logistics expert in charge of accumulating weapons and arms for the prison break plot. Police also found computers with security and encryption and recipes for poison purportedly capable of killing a million people.  He was sentenced to four years in prison but released early. Last week, after he was killed during his attack on a kosher grocery store in Paris, police again raided his apartment and found a cache of arms and detonators. Before he was killed by police, Amedy Coulibaly purportedly told CNN affiliate BFMTV by phone that he belonged to ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the terror group trying to create a fundamentalist religious state across Sunni areas in those two countries. That information hasn't been corroborated by authorities, and it's not known whether he knew any leaders or members of that terrorist group. Coulibaly shared a residence with Boumeddiene, and they traveled to Malaysia together, the source said. HAYAT BOUMEDDIENE . Who is she? The French newspaper Le Monde posted photos purporting to show the 26-year-old Boumeddiene in 2010, in a rural location, wearing a niqab and holding a weapon that appears to be a crossbow. A niqab is a head-to-toe black covering a woman's body completely except for the eyes. CNN has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the stills. In one of the photos, a woman Le Monde identifies as Boumeddiene is shown in a niqab is posing near cheek-to-cheek with Coulibaly in what the newspaper called a selfie. French authorities said they wanted her in connection with Thursday killing of a policewoman in Montrouge. But now it's come out that she may not have even been in France at the time. She's still wanted by authorities in connection with the attack. A neighbor in a southern Paris suburb said she seemed kind and polite, always wearing a veil and often motoring around on a scooter with her romantic partner Amedy Coulibaly. Where did she go? Beyond traveling to Malaysia with Coulibaly, Boumeddiene's official travel history in recent years is sparse. Boumeddiene is believed to have left for Turkey ""of course to reach Syria"" at the beginning of the year, according to a French source close to the nation's security services. She was tracked by Turkish authorities to a location near the Turkey-Syria border, according to an official in the Turkish Prime Minister's office. Boumeddiene arrived at the Istanbul airport on a flight from Madrid on January 2 with a man. During routine screening of passengers, the couple were flagged by Turkey's Risk Assessment Center and a decision made to maintain surveillance on their movements, the official said. Who did she know? Boumeddiene exchanged 500 phone calls with the wife of Cherif Kouachi in 2014, according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins. The wife told investigators that her husband and Coulibaly knew each other well. CNN's Josh Levs, Michael Martinez, Barbara Starr, Nick Paton Walsh, Evan Perez, Lonzo Cook, Scott Bronstein, Drew Griffin and Deborah Feyerick and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.","Court documents detail 2010 prison break plot .

"The chants of protest heard across America in recent weeks echoed Wednesday in the small city where the civil rights movement reached a crescendo five decades ago. About 20 protesters walked up Selma's famed Edmund Pettus Bridge and yelled: ""Hands up! Don't shoot!"" and ""I can't breathe,"" in reference to the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. But here in Selma, there was an added chant: ""Show the tape."" Protesters want Police Chief William Riley to make public a videotape of a police shooting that took place more than a year ago. Ananias Shaw, 74, was killed last December after he rushed an officer while wielding a hatchet, police said. Shaw was black. So was the police officer. Riley said the tape clearly shows the killing was justified. A grand jury heard the case and decided not to issue an indictment, as was the case in Ferguson and New York. It was the Ferguson protests that inspired longtime activist Faya Rose Toure to lead the charge for the Shaw family in Selma, though the circumstances are vastly different here. Selma, which is more than 80% African-American, has a black mayor, a black police chief, a black district attorney and a majority black city council. But for Toure, the problem in Selma goes far beyond this one case. Selma once shocked the national consciousness when police beat and tear gassed 600 civil rights marchers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on their way to Montgomery. The day became known as Bloody Sunday and led the way to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A movie depiction of the Selma story will release nationwide on January 9. Selma, said Toure, has come a long way since then, but black people are not yet free of injustices. ""Even to this day, we are suffering from the inferiority complex stemming from days of slavery,"" she said. ""It's not just about color. It's about a mindset."" Toure demanded Riley release the tape. ""It's a matter of transparency,"" she said. Shaw's brother, Edward Shaw, said his brother's death was unnecessary. ""Show the tape to the whole town,"" Shaw said. But the police chief said he would not release the tape until the family has had a chance to view it. It won't be easy to watch and they deserve space to process what they'll see on their own, he said. ""I don't care who's jumping up and down,"" Riley said. ""I do what's right and that's what I'm going to do. We want the family to see it first. It's only fair."" Riley said he has made arrangements for Ananias Shaw's children, who live in the Chicago area, to view the tape there. A copy is sitting in a Chicago-area law enforcement agency, ready to be seen by Shaw's son and daughter whenever they come in. And on Friday morning, local relatives including Edward Shaw will gather to see it, too. The day before the protest, Edward Shaw pointed to the spot near a Church's Chicken restaurant where his brother fell to the ground. He said he had rushed to the scene about 15 minutes after his brother was shot to find an entire block cordoned off with tape. Shaw said he saw his brother's body lie on the ground for hours, uncovered. ""Everyone around here knew him,"" Shaw said. ""He walked the streets for many years."" Ananias Shaw once worked as a mechanic but ""lost himself"" after his wife left him decades ago and his house burned in a fire. Even so, he earned the nickname Ambulance, because he came to the aid of people, said his brother. Edward Shaw said Selma police knew his brother ""acted crazy"" but that he never harmed anyone. But to hear it from the chief, the officer who shot Shaw had no choice. When officers responded to a call about a disturbance at Church's Chicken, Shaw had ducked into a vacant building, Riley said. Shaw then came out with a hatchet, ""cussing like a dog."" Riley said officers told Shaw they didn't want to hurt him and repeatedly asked him to drop the weapon. But then Shaw turned on an officer, the hatchet raised, and that's when the single shot was fired. Truth is, Riley said, ""the officer let him get too close."" Added Lt. Johnny King: ""We could have had an officer's funeral."" King has been with the department for nearly 28 years. He said he knew of only two police shooting fatalities in all that time. But Edward Shaw said his brother left the restaurant on his own accord and there was no reason for the police to give him chase. ""Why would you follow him?"" Shaw asked. ""That's what gets me."" That Shaw had problems was no secret, the chief said. But he can't help but wonder why Shaw's family, in all the decades he was troubled, didn't get him the help he needed. Why didn't they have him committed? ""They knew his propensity to act crazy. Evidently he was deteriorating, and they saw it happening,"" Riley said. The videotape of the shooting was taken by the officer's lapel camera. Toure, the activist, said it was her husband, Alabama State Sen. Hank Sanders, who was responsible for $30,000 in funding for the city of Selma to buy lapel cameras for the police force. ""Ferguson,"" she said, ""is advocating for something we already have. But why can't we see the tape?"" The chief takes no issue with protests tied to the tensions roiling through the country. What happened to Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and Tamir Rice in Cleveland bothers him, too. ""We have things going on in policing that aren't right,"" he said. If people want to scream outside his department, ""I can't breathe,"" he's all for it. But what he can't get behind is how what happened in Selma is being lumped with these cases. ""It's wrong and disingenuous,"" he said. ""We're no Ferguson,"" and pretending Selma is, he said, ""hurts the message.""","Protest links Selma police killing of man a year ago to Ferguson, New York cases .
Protesters want video of incident to be made public .
Officer, victim were black; police chief says cases shouldn't be lumped together ."
"(CNN) -- Moroccans voted Friday to approve a referendum on constitutional reforms that would weaken the king's powers and boost those of the government. The referendum was approved by 98.49% of voters, the country's interior minister said. Despite a particularly warm day, more than 70% of the country's 13 million registered voters turned out to decide on the referendum, Interior Minister Taieb Cherkaoui said. ""I voted yes because I agree with the proposed changes,"" said Rachida Khalil of Casablanca. ""There is still a lot of work to be done, like appointing of a completely new government, but I am very hopeful."" King Mohammed VI announced the referendum in a rare address to the nation last month, after a series of unprecedented protests swept the North African country. Under the referendum, voters are empowered to select a prime minister, ending the longstanding practice in which the king has selected his own man for the job. The prime minister has tended to take his lead from the sovereign on key matters of state. Over recent months, thousands of young Moroccans have taken to the streets, inspired by the Arab Spring. The youth-based February 20 Movement wants jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies. It had urged its supporters to boycott the referendum on the constitution, saying it fails to meet their demands. The countries biggest political parties, including the Islamist Justice and Development Party (PJD), the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP) and the conservative Istiqlal party, had asked their supporters to vote ""yes"" to the proposed changes. ""Although this project may seem to some non-revolutionary, it has the advantage to make the parties face their responsibilities. It forces them to make their own cultural revolution,"" said Industry Member Ahmed Reda Chami, a member of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces party. The revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable, the Parliament in Rabat more dynamic and will give the government greater powers, the 47-year-old king said when he announced the referendum on June 17. The new prime minister would have new powers in decision-making and in day-to-day management -- relieving the king of a number of duties and aligning the style of management along the lines followed by some European Union countries. In an example of power sharing, the draft constitution empowers the prime minister to dissolve the House of Representatives, and stresses that the king shall consult him before announcing the dissolution of Parliament. ""It specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches,"" the king said. ""The idea is to establish democratic institutions where all active parties participate and bring in prosperity."" Under the reforms, Morocco will also have an independent judiciary and provide equal rights for women. Analysts, however, question whether the proposed change will prove sufficient. The reforms ""appear to be genuine,"" wrote Joel Hirst, an international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.  But ""the security apparatus, cabinet positions and religious appointments remain under the finger of the king."" ""For a country that has been accused of human right abuses in the past, these reforms for some do not go far enough,"" he added. ""The king may well have succeeded in staying ahead of the protest that has led to the demise of the regimes in Tunisia and Egypt and plunged Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain into turmoil and violence,"" said Marina Ottaway, director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""Whether this is just a short-lived victory in the first skirmish of a long battle or a turning point on the road to transforming Morocco into the Arab world's first constitutional monarchy will depend not only on how the king acts in the coming months, but also on the capacity and willingness of Moroccan political organizations to build on the opportunities the constitution offers them,"" Ottaway wrote. ""It may also depend to some extent on the persistence of a protest movement that has so far not been able to mobilize the huge crowds seen in Tunisia and Egypt,"" she stressed. CNN's Elise Labott and journalist Aida Alami contributed to this report.","NEW: Referendum is passed by 98.49% of voters .

"(CNN)A camel trampled two people to death over the weekend at a farm in Texas, authorities said. Peggye McNair, 72, the owner of the farm and a well-known camel breeder, was one of the victims of the attack Saturday, police told CNN affiliate KFDX. The incident at  Camel Kisses Farm in Wichita Falls happened after Mark Mere, 53, got into a pen with three camels -- one male and two females. Mere apparently went into the holding pen because the animals' water trough had frozen over. The male camel was in rut and became very aggressive, Wichita County Sheriff David Duke said. Rut is a male animal's peak period of fertility and sexual excitement. It charged Mere and he tried to get out of the pen, according to authorities. Owner McNair tried to close the gate, but the male camel came after both of them and trampled them to death, police said. The sheriff said when deputies arrived at the scene, all three camels were acting aggressive toward them. Relatives of the farm's owner gave Texas game wardens permission to kill the male camel, police said. In a 2009 interview with the Wichita Falls Times Record News, McNair said ""camels have gotten a bad rap."" The article goes on to say that ""like dogs, if they are raised with cruelty, they will be dangerous. ... But, also like dogs, if they are raised with love, affection, attention, treats and companionship -- as hers are -- they will be tame and enjoyable."" ""Of course, there are some caveats,"" she said. In the interview, she said she always takes extra precautions when the animals are in rut. She told the newspaper about two women who raised camels as pets, who were killed when a male camel knocked them down and planted his front feet on them, common mating behavior.","Peggye McNair, 72, the owner of the farm, was one of the victims .

"ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain on Monday defended his opposition to a Democratic bill that would expand education benefits for veterans, saying it would hurt the military that he hopes to lead. Sen. John McCain is co-sponsoring alternative legislation to the GI Bill that the Senate passed last week. The new GI Bill being debated in Congress would expand education benefits for veterans who served at least three years in the military after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The bill's main sponsor, Sen. Jim Webb, is a Virginia Democrat and, like McCain, a Vietnam War veteran. The Senate passed Webb's bill 75-22 last week. McCain was not in Washington for the vote. Democrats have targeted McCain for his opposition to the Webb legislation. Watch McCain talk about the U.S. debt to veterans . Saying he takes ""a back seat to no one in my affection, respect and devotion to veterans,"" McCain said Webb's bill would be a disincentive for service members to become noncommissioned officers, which he called ""the backbone of all the services."" ""In my life, I have learned more from noncommissioned officers I have known and served with than anyone else outside my family,"" McCain said at a Memorial Day event in Albuquerque. ""They are very hard to replace. Encouraging people to choose to not become noncommissioned officers would hurt the military and our country very badly."" A former Navy officer, McCain was a prisoner of war during Vietnam. McCain, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Burr of North Carolina, has introduced an alternative bill that would increase education benefits on a sliding scale based on an individual's years of service. McCain argues his bill would have a smaller impact on retention rates than the legislation that the Senate passed. ""The office of president, which I am seeking, is a great honor indeed, but it imposes serious responsibilities,"" the presumptive GOP nominee said. ""I can only tell you, I intend to deserve the honor if I am fortunate to receive it, even if it means I must take politically unpopular positions at times and disagree with people for whom I have the highest respect and affection."" Over the weekend, Sen. Barack Obama, who appears to be the likely Democratic nominee, again tried to tie McCain to Bush by noting that both of them oppose the GI Bill expansion. ""I revere our soldiers and want to make sure they are being treated with honor and respect,"" Obama said Saturday. ""I think the GI Bill is one way for us to do that, and I hope that John McCain and George Bush decide they believe the same thing."" Sparring between McCain and Obama over the GI Bill got personal last week when McCain said he would not be lectured from someone ""who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform."" Obama hasn't served in the military. Referring to Iraq in his closing comments Monday, McCain said he recognized Americans have grown tired of the war and the mistakes made, ""but we cannot react to those mistakes by embracing a course of action that will be an even greater mistake, a mistake of colossal historical proportions."" ""We must give Gen. [David] Petraeus and the Americans he has the honor to command adequate time to salvage from the wreckage of our past mistakes a measure of stability for Iraq and the Middle East, and a more secure future for the American people,"" he said. Later Monday, McCain will attend a fundraiser in Albuquerque. On Tuesday, President Bush will fly to Phoenix, Arizona, for a fundraiser at a private residence. Bush has been one of the Republican Party's most prolific fundraisers, and McCain will need help to keep up with Democratic fundraising this fall. The McCain campaign said the event will be held at the senator's home because it is more private. But the Phoenix Business Journal said the event was moved from the Phoenix Convention Center due to lackluster ticket sales and concern over anti-war protesters. A McCain aide denied the report on poor ticket sales. The aide also said the event wasn't moved to McCain's private residence to avoid having the senator and unpopular president appear together on camera. ""We have a policy that fundraising events are closed events,"" the aide said, adding that any confusion about the fundraiser originally being open to the press should be chalked up to the campaign ""working out the kinks"" on its first event with Bush. McCain consistently has trailed the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates in fundraising. The $17 million McCain raised in April was dwarfed by the nearly $31 million by Obama and the $21 million by Sen. Hillary Clinton. McCain also trails both Democrats in the amount of cash on hand. He had nearly $22 million in the bank at the end of April, while Obama had more than double that amount -- nearly $47 million -- and Clinton had nearly $30 million. CNN's Alexander Marquardt, Ed Henry, Mary Snow and Robert Yoon contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen. John McCain says general must have time to bring stability to Iraq .

"Look out NASCAR, one of the world's fastest motor sports wants to steal your fans. We're talking about air racing, where powerful, small planes compete on a looped path in the air, reaching speeds between 200-500 mph. This thrilling sport is just as fast as NASCAR, IndyCars and Formula One. But with the added vertical dimension, the action seriously amps up. In Hollywood terms, it's Top Gun-meets-Days of Thunder-meets-Star Wars. It's not quite the ""podracers"" that raced in ""The Phantom Menace,"" but it's pretty intense. Picture these planes streaking across the landscape at only 80 feet above the ground. That's about the same height as a seven-story building. Dangerous? Perhaps. Some people might go one step further and call it nuts. This ain't new. It's been going on since France hosted the first air race in 1909. In the United States, races started a year later and gained momentum in the 1920s, drawing pilots, thrill seekers and aviation enthusiasts. Related story: Excitement, speed key to air racing appeal . Three years ago, a deadly plane crash at the Reno National Championship Air Races raised new safety questions about the sport. Now, insiders say these events are safer and poised for growth. This weekend, some of the world's best air racers are competing in an international air race series owned by Red Bull at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a few miles north of the Strip. In Red Bull's version of air racing, planes rocket around a loop one at a time. The pilot who can complete the course in the least amount of time wins. Red Bull is holding races this year in Europe, Asia, America and the Middle East. It's ""very analogous to dogfighting,"" says race director Jimmy DiMatteo, referring to the deadly midair combat ballet between two fighter planes. ""It's the exact same skill set."" DiMatteo knows what he's talking about. He's a retired captain and former instructor at the Navy's famous fighter pilot school, unofficially known as Top Gun. And it shows -- right down to the way he talks. This former F-14 Tomcat driver loves to talk about ""angle of attack,"" ""proficiency level"" and ""pulling Gs."" It is those G forces that are so important to surviving this sport. When these planes make breathtaking turns, they're being radically pulled and pushed in ways that can challenge the structure of the aircraft and the health of the pilot. Some pilots report pulling as many as 10Gs during races, equivalent to 10 times the force of gravity. The pilots are ""flying extremely aggressive, in very tight locations,"" DiMatteo says. For most sports fans, ""It's not something you've ever seen before."" The planes fly so low that spectators who sit in the grandstand nosebleed seats will actually be able to look DOWN on the planes as they shoot by. The course includes inflatable, 82-foot pylons. Pilots are supposed to fly between these pylons. They're not supposed to hit them. But sometimes -- traveling at 230 mph -- it happens. ""When you hit them under a humongous amount of Gs, then it can be a little bit exciting,"" says pilot Kirby Chambliss. ""Basically you slice through, like a hot knife through butter. Just, BOOM -- and you're through it."" The pilots are racing against time, but it's hard to keep an eye on the clock while you're twisting and turning through the gates. Chambliss says his Zivko Edge 540 aircraft doesn't have any kind of special ""head-up"" display in front of the windshield that would let him keep his eyes forward while watching his time. Widely described as one of the world's greatest stunt pilots and racing aviators, Chambliss won Red Bull's Air Race championship in 2004 and 2006. Flying comes so naturally to this guy that he says he feels like his plane's ""wings are nothing but an extension of my arms."" The key to winning, pilots say, is pulling through the turns fast -- but not so fast that you lose speed. It's a delicate balance that DiMatteo says good fighter pilots share with champion air racers. Nonetheless, that doesn't mean you have to be an ex-fighter jockey to excel. Chambliss has never flown in the military. He graduated to air racing after piloting Boeing 737s for Southwest Airlines. Before that, ""I loved motocross as a kid,"" Chambliss said. ""I was always a speed junky."" The Red Bull series launched in 2003, but by the end of the decade rising speeds and scary aerobatics were making race organizers nervous. So, beginning in 2011, they put the series on pause to regroup. This year it's back with new safety restrictions limiting how low pilots can fly and banning certain trick maneuvers. The rules surrounding air races differ. In the United States, one of the oldest events is the national championship in Reno, where multiple planes race each other around a circuit. The first pilot across the finish line wins. The 2011 crash at Reno raised serious questions about safety. During a six-lap race, a modified World War II-era P-51 Mustang flying at about 500 mph went out of control and collided with an airport ramp in the spectator seating area. The pilot and 10 people were killed and 64 others were hurt. Investigators blamed ""deteriorated"" parts that contributed to fatigue cracks that led to the crash. Related story: Speed, worn parts contributed to Reno crash . The tragedy led to new Federal Aviation Administration rules requiring all air racing organizations to go through a standardized safety accreditation process. ""They check the capability, skill set and training of the pilots,"" says DiMatteo. They also monitor aircraft maintenance and the mechanics who work on the planes. ""They really look at the full scope of your operation."" The 2011 Reno crash was believed to be the first in the 50-year history of the event to kill spectators. Last month, during a Reno qualifying race, a former champion was killed when his experimental Backovich GP-5 aircraft crashed, away from spectator seating, bringing the total deaths at Reno events to 20 since the races began in 1964. Red Bull boasts zero deaths in the 11 years since the series began, and only one pilot injury from a crash into a river during an Australian practice run in 2010. ""Our record shows that we've been doing a good job -- knock on wood,"" DiMatteo says. ""It's actually safer than some of these other sports that are out there."" A newcomer to the sport might assume racing with other planes -- as they do in Reno -- would be more dangerous than racing one at a time. Not necessarily, says John Cudahy, president of the International Council of Air Shows, an industry trade organization. ""I wouldn't say one is inherently safer than the other,"" Cudahy says. ""They each have a different set of safety challenges and they've addressed them for the most part pretty successfully. The Reno planes are in some cases older ... but the Red Bull pilots participate in pretty aggressive aerobatics."" Its strongest supporters believe American air racing can one day rival the popularity of NASCAR. Last year's NASCAR Sprint Series drew nearly 70 million unique TV viewers in the United States, according to NASCAR. In 2009, the Red Bull Air Race was televised in more than 180 countries, reaching more than 300 million viewers, Red Bull says, although it's unclear how many viewers actually watched. The potential for growth is there, says Chambliss. ""I think in this country we love racing,"" he says. ""Some people wonder if the sport is easy enough to understand. But it's still a race. And the one thing we do understand is, the fastest ... is going to win.""","Three years after a deadly crash, experts say air racing is safer and poised for growth .

"Apple is looking into launching iPhones with a 4.7-inch and a 5.7-inch screen, Reuters reports, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The company is also considering launching a cheaper variant of the iPhone, that would cost around $99 and come in 5-6 colors. The moves are described as being ""under discussion,"" meaning they may never actually happen. If they do, however, it would mean Apple has more or less abandoned its position as the standard-setter in the smartphone market and become just another trend-follower. Long-known for its limited palette of products, Apple always focused on the premium segment of the market, claiming the form factors of its devices, as well as the prices, are just right. For example, Samsung currently offers smartphones and phablets with more than 10 different screen sizes, while Apple has only two: the 3.5-inch iPhone 4S and the 4-inch iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 was launched last September, and Apple is widely expected to unveil a new iPhone around that time this year. One of Reuters' sources claims the company ""constantly changes product specifications almost to the final moment,"" so — as usual — no one except Apple really knows whether we'll also see a bigger or a cheaper iPhone in September as well.

"The pilot of an Asiana Airlines jet that crashed in San Francisco  this year told investigators after the accident that he had been ""very concerned"" about landing without help from an airport navigation system that was out of order. Capt. Lee Kang Kuk, who was highly experienced in a Boeing 747 but was transitioning to flying a 777, told the National Transportation Safety Board that he found it ""very stressful, very difficult"" to land without the glideslope indicator that helps pilots determine whether the plane is too high or too low during approach. ""Asked whether he was concerned about his ability to perform the visual approach while piloting Asiana Flight 214, he said 'very concerned, yea,'"" the safety board revealed at a hearing on Wednesday on its investigation into the July 6 crash that killed three people and injured more than 180 others. The jet struck a sea wall and broke apart on the runway following a missed approach. The navigation aid that syncs up with aircraft instruments was out of service while the Federal Aviation Administration made runway safety improvements. But a second, visual lighting system was operable at the time of the daytime crash and the weather was clear. The safety board investigation is focusing on whether pilots have become overly reliant on automation to fly commercial planes, and whether basic manual flying skills have eroded. Investigators have also focused on the pilot understanding -- or misunderstanding -- of the plane's auto-thrust system, which controls aircraft  power. Automated cockpit systems key to Asiana probe . Some of the crew of the Asiana flight from Seoul told investigators the auto thrust was always engaged. But the safety board has said that system was not engaged, and the jet descended in altitude faster than it should have, and had a slower forward speed than intended. The combination put the plane into a perilous situation in the final minute of flight. The relief first officer, Bong Dongwon, who was sitting behind Lee and instructor pilot Lee Jungmin, said he observed the fast descent -- or sink rate -- and called out the excessive sink rate ""more than four times."" Bong told investigators the pilot appeared to be correcting the ""sink rate"" and did not advise further changes. But its speed was declining at about the same time. The plane was flying at 170 knots 73 seconds before impact, dropped below the target speed for landing of 137 knots at roughly 38 seconds before impact, and plummeted as low as 103 knots just seconds before the plane's front landing gear and tail hit the sea wall at the end of the runway. Will firefighter be charged after Asiana crash? The crew made its first reference to the plane's speed problem just seven seconds before the crash. The pilot called out a ""go around"" -- a command to abort the landing -- three seconds before impact. Boeing's former chief pilot for the B777 program said automated systems are intended to help pilots, but that they still need to exercise diligence. ""We accept the fact that pilots, as all humans, make errors,"" he said. Automation is intended ""as a tool to aid the pilot, not replace the pilot,"" he said. Information released at Wednesday's hearing also showed investigators are concerned about the role Korean and airline culture played in the crash. Bong said the crew practiced ""cockpit resource management,"" training that encourages subordinates to speak up about safety concerns to other crew members, despite their senior rank, experience or seniority. But when Lee -- who was considered a student pilot in the 777 -- was asked whether he had contemplated an aborted landing as the plane descended, he said it was a ""very hard"" decision to make, given the deference shown to superiors in Korean culture. By the time Lee pushed the throttle forward just seconds before impact,  he discovered his instructor had already done so. Three passengers died in the accident -- two in the crash and a third on the ground when hit by a rescue truck responding to the scene. The accident was the first fatal commercial airline crash in the United States since February 2009. Crash survivor Ben Levy told CNN he was forfeiting an opportunity to watch the proceedings. ""I think something that I've done quickly after this plane crash has been to focus on work and family and things that matter to me,"" Levy said. ""I'm extremely happy that something is being done to get to the bottom of what happened that day because it should not have happened.""

"A top official at the Department of Veterans Affairs has resigned amid the growing scandal about wait times and care at veterans' hospitals, the department's leader said Friday. News about the resignation of Dr. Robert Petzel, undersecretary for health in the Department of Veterans Affairs, came one day after he spoke at a Senate hearing about the issue alongside Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki. In a short statement, Shinseki announced that he accepted Petzel's resignation. ""As we know from the veteran community, most veterans are satisfied with the quality of their VA health care, but we must do more to improve timely access to that care,"" Shinseki said. ""I am committed to strengthening veterans' trust and confidence in their VA healthcare system."" Petzel was scheduled to retire sometime this year, the department said in 2013. The news of the resignation was met with derision by a leading veterans' rights group, which said Petzel's resignation does little to address the problem. ""We don't need the VA to find a scapegoat; we need an actual plan to restore a culture of accountability throughout the VA,"" according to a statement released by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. ""To be clear, Dr. Petzel's resignation is not the step toward accountability that our members need to see from VA leaders. Anyone who has been following this situation knows that Dr. Petzel had already announced his retirement earlier this year."" The chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Republican Jeff Miller of Florida, called the resignation as ""the pinnacle of disingenuous doublespeak."" But President Barack Obama supported Shinseki's decision to accept the resignation, according to a statement released by the White House. ""As the President has said, America has a sacred trust with the men and women who have served our country in uniform and he is committed to doing all we can to ensure our veterans have access to timely, quality health care,"" the statement said. The White house reiterated the President's previous order that Shinseki conduct a review of the Veterans Health Administration's practices at its facilities. Petzel's resignation came a day after he testified before the Senate's Veterans Affairs' Committee looking into reported delays at numerous VA hospitals and a long list of serious problems and allegations of falsifying wait times, many of which were exposed and reported by CNN. For six months, CNN has been reporting on delays in medical appointments suffered by veterans across the country and veterans who died or were seriously injured while waiting for appointments and care. The VA requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner, typically within 14 to 30 days. The most disturbing and striking problems emerged in Arizona last month as inside sources revealed to CNN details of a secret waiting list for veterans at the Phoenix VA. Charges were leveled that at least 40 American veterans died in Phoenix while waiting for care at the VA there, many of whom were placed on the secret list. But even as the Phoenix VA's problems have riveted the nation's attention, numerous whistle-blowers from other VA hospitals across the country have stepped forward. They described similar delays in care for veterans and also varying schemes by officials at those facilities to hide the delays -- in some cases even falsify records or efforts to ""cook the books."" The secret waiting list in Phoenix was part of an elaborate scheme designed by Veterans Affairs managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources who spoke exclusively to CNN. Phoenix VA officials denied any knowledge of a secret list, and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times. They acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there, but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans may have died. The director of the Phoenix VA, Sharon Helman, was put on administrative leave by Shinseki two weeks ago, along with two of her top aides. But sources inside the VA in Phoenix tell CNN the wait times and problems are still ongoing there. As a direct result of the allegations at the Phoenix VA, investigators from the VA's inspector general's office have gone to Phoenix and have been conducting an investigation there for months.","The President supports Shinseki's decision to accept the resignation .

"The Pentagon unveiled plans Tuesday for fully integrating women into front-line and special combat roles, including elite forces such as Army Rangers and Navy SEALs. While Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine and special forces commanders detailed steps they will take, not all shared the same comfort level with the initiative, raising potential real-world scenarios that must be addressed before moving too far forward. There was concern for how women might handle some of the more taxing physical demands of combat across the board and for how men might view the presence of female troops in tight-knit elite units. Women are permitted to serve in some hazardous jobs and did so in Iraq and Afghanistan where a number were killed. But it wasn't until January that then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta formally lifted the official ban on women in combat. Top leadership embraced the overall concept and goal of completing the change by January 2016, but gave service commanders some room to fill in the details. ""The department remains committed to removing all gender barriers wherever possible and meeting our missions with the best qualified and most capable personnel,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a May 21 memo to individual service leaders that was released on Tuesday. Obama: Assaults threaten military trust . ""I remain confident that we will retain the trust and confidence of the American people by opening positions to women, while ensuring that all members entering these newly opened positions can meet the standards required to maintain our warfighting capability,"" Hagel said. More than 200,000 women are in the active-duty military, representing about 14.5% of the overall force, according to Pentagon figures. Most serve in the Army. Despite the past official ban on combat, some women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan found themselves in firefights. They have been part of gun crews, air crews and in seamanship specialties. Officially assimilating women into the most grueling elements of the armed forces comes as the Defense Department wrestles with new concerns about sexual assault in the military, with statistics showing an increase in those reports. It also comes as the U.S. military adjusts its mission and force to a post-war era for the first time in 12 years as it winds down combat operations in Afghanistan and confronts severe budget cuts. Military leaders released individual plans for the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and special forces on Tuesday, and said they would spend the next year or so evaluating how they should be carried out. The service branches will collect and analyze information on the impact of introducing potentially hundreds of thousands of new positions into the armed forces. They also will validate standards and agreed that it was premature to forecast how things might play out and whether women would ultimately be admitted to all combat roles. Services will evaluate cultural issues and physical demands associated with fully integrating forces and, in some cases, assessing the views of men who comprise the Rangers, SEALs and Army Green Beret units. Moms, daughters think about rape before enlisting . ""I want to let it work. I think we owe it to everybody,"" said Army Maj. Gen. Bennet Sacolick, the director of force management and development for the U.S. Special Operations Command. Sacolick said he wanted to be ""an honest broker"" and raised more overall caution than the other officers. ""I just want to see what happens,"" he said. Areas to be examined range from psychological or behavioral problems that could arise in small elite groups deployed in remote locations to performance-based tasks like repetitive lifting of a 55-pound tank round that is required by a Marine infantry unit. The Pentagon said the extended window is necessary for a thorough job and said it would proceed in a ""measured and responsible"" manner. In many cases Congress would be notified. ""There is an understanding that doing this right takes a period of time,"" said Juliet Beyler, who directs the officer and enlisted personnel management.","Pentagon ordered in January to open combat jobs for women .

"(CNN) -- Tom Wheeler's Monday started with protesters, ended with protesters, and was punctuated with pressure from President Barack Obama in between. The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission tried to leave his house in the morning, but his driveway was blocked by a small group of demonstrators who urged him to adopt tighter net neutrality rules. At first Wheeler tried to play along by helping them hold up a sign that blares ""Save the Internet."" ""I'm on your side,"" he argued, saying he also believes in an open internet. But he could hardly get in a word in, as the protestors, affiliated with the group Popular Resistance, chanted and sang songs outside his house. Both sides claim they want a free and open Internet, but they disagree on just how to make that happen. The protesters want tighter regulations to ensure none of the major Internet providers get better access to websites and services than smaller competitors. Such access, also known as ""fast lanes,"" has been supported by Wheeler in the past. ""I think you've all made your points. Can I get out of my driveway now?"" Wheeler asked, saying that they were now violating his rights. ""It's the only moral choice we have,"" one of the protesters replied. Wheeler was more than familiar with the group. They had staged multiple protests earlier in the year outside of the FCC, including an event that they billed as a musical. After about five minutes Monday, Wheeler is seen stepping around the demonstrators, abandoning his car and seemingly heading to work by foot. Edward Wyatt, a New York Times reporter, tweeted that Wheeler took the metro. Wheeler's office did not immediately return a request for comment about the group. Later Monday morning, in a surprise announcement, Obama made clear his own proposals for net neutrality, agreeing that there shouldn't be any fast lanes and calling for stricter regulations to keep things equal. Wheeler, in a written statement, said Obama's plan was a ""welcome and important addition."" Encouraged by the president's proposals, the protesters returned to Wheeler's home Monday night. But this time the mood was a bit lighter. Margaret Flowers, organizer with Popular Resistance, told CNN that they ""decided to change the tone a little bit."" They gave Wheeler's wife a bottle of wine, and politely urged the chairman to be their ""Internet hero"" by adopting the President's proposals. He wasn't quite as eager to engage with the protesters as he was in the morning, but things still remained cordial. Flowers said she was surprised the police weren't called. After Wheeler went inside, there was more singing. The group plans to hold another event Thursday night by the FCC, Flowers said. Perhaps ""some sort of dance party, something more festive.""","Net neutrality protesters showed up at the home of FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler .

"Record-breaking temperatures have been searing large swaths of China, resulting in dozens of heat-related deaths and prompting authorities to issue a national alert. People are packing into swimming pools or taking refuge in caves in their attempts to escape the fierce temperatures. Local governments are resorting to cloud-seeding technology to try to bring rain to millions of acres of parched farmland. The worst of the smoldering heat wave has been concentrated in the south and east of the country, with the commercial metropolis of Shanghai experiencing its hottest July in at least 140 years, according to state media. Temperatures in the sprawling city of 23 million inhabitants reached 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher on 25 days in July, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported Wednesday. More than 10 people died from heatstroke in Shanghai during the month, it said. But the brutal temperatures aren't confined to the Shanghai region. ""About 19 provinces and regions are experiencing scorching heat, covering more than 3 million square kilometers, almost a third of the country,"" He Lifu, chief weather forecaster at the National Meteorological Center, told the English-language newspaper China Daily. The China Meteorological Administration issued its second-highest national heat alert on Tuesday, China Daily reported, adding that the highest alert has never been used. Photos carried by state media showed people frying food like eggs, shrimp and bacon in pans placed on the road surface in some cities. In Shanghai, the heat was being blamed for mounting numbers of dead fish in ponds and rivers, reported Shanghai Daily, an English-language newspaper. Some of the highest temperatures were clocked in and around the eastern city of Hangzhou, about 100 kilometers southwest of Shanghai. The thermometer went above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Hangzhou on six out of seven days in the past week, state media reported. In the district of Xiaoshan, it reached 42.2 degrees Celsius (about 108 Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, the highest temperature recorded for the area. Seven cities and counties in the surrounding province of Zhejiang used cloud-seeding techniques on Tuesday to bring rain to drought-hit farmland, China Daily said. Forecasters say the aggressive heat is likely to continue into the middle of August.","Shanghai experiences its hottest July in at least 140 years .

"At first glance, a cotton T-shirt from independent label Small Trades might look like any other basic striped crewneck. But Small Trades founder Robin Weiss says there are a few things that set her brand apart. Her rib knit shirts and dresses last longer than usual fast-fashion fare, she says, because the people who make them bring a legacy of craftsmanship and manufacturing expertise. Plus, buying them supports 64-year-old Beverly Deysher, who has worked for Mohnton Knitting Mills since she was 18, always living within walking distance of the factory in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country. Supporting Small Trades also means supporting factory owner Gary Pleam, whose great-great grandfather built a water wheel in 1873 to power the hat factory that became Mohnton Mills in 1906. Deysher's first job was to put elastic in underwear waistbands, back when mass-produced garments were the company's bread and butter. When production of commodity goods went overseas, Mohnton Knitting Mills found a niche in custom jobs for boutique clients like Small Trades, creating shirts from high-quality combed ringspun yarn. Today, Deysher is the sewing floor supervisor who ""makes everything work,"" Pleam said. So here's the question: Does knowing Deysher's story, the history of Mohnton Knitting Mills, or a boutique's commitment to selling them make you more likely to buy a Small Trades shirt -- starting at $50? Made in America: The short list . A handful of brands and retailers are banking on that, hoping consumers will pay a premium for the stories behind their labels, and that their efforts will mirror the farm-to-table movement. Weiss says it's a formula that's good for her business. ""You know who you're supporting. It makes you feel good,"" she said. ""There's nothing like having that personal relationship. I can talk to Gary on the phone in the same time zone or drive to the mill if I have to."" ""People care about where their clothes come from"" Small Trades is just one brand that will be featured on Zady, a shopping site launching this week dedicated to fashion transparency. Zady co-founder Soraya Darabi says the price of goods they showcase isn't really a premium. It's simply a fair price for quality products made by skilled employees like Deysher and sold by business owners like Weiss. ""The fast-fashion frenzy has come at the cost of the quality of clothing and fair working conditions for factory workers. We see it over and over again in factory disasters around the world,"" Darabi said. ""People care about where their clothes come from, and they want to know the story behind the label."" Shoppers concerned with the ethical treatment of garment workers and with what goes into their tops and tees are showing more interest in where their clothing comes from. A series of deadly incidents in the past year in overseas garment factories prompted widespread outrage and calls for companies to improve conditions and oversight. After a building collapse in April killed more than 400 factory works in Bangladesh's garment district, more than a million people signed an international online petition urging companies to commit to an enforceable fire and building safety agreement. Outraged shoppers also registered their anger on companies' social media sites. Major U.S. retailers announced a plan to improve safety conditions in Bangladesh garment factories in July, and companies worldwide have pledged to improve worker safety conditions through funding, inspections and training. But will that outrage translate to conscious consumerism? Even people focused on the issue say it's hard to know. Co-founders Darabi and Maxine Bédat say they are targeting people like themselves, style-conscious and socially aware shoppers who have outgrown their trendy wardrobe of cheaply made goods. They say they're looking to build a timeless collection of quality pieces they can feel good about. The two are familiar with conscious consumerism. The high school friends from Minnesota reconnected while Bédat was planning the Bootstrap Project, a non-profit that promotes artisan goods from around the world. Darabi, who had made a name for herself as a digital strategist at the New York Times and co-founder of Foodspotting, served as a consultant. Their goal with Zady isn't just to sell stuff, but to start a movement, one they compare to what Whole Foods did for local and organic food, Bédat said. ""We've seen through the whole farm-to-table movement that people care about where their food comes from,"" she said. ""We're trying to reach those people."" Elizabeth Cline, author of ""Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion,"" agrees that the local food movement shows that consumers are willing to pay more for transparency -- and a good story. ""Consumers want to feel like they're supporting something positive and authentic, not just rejecting something negative when they buy,"" she said. ""Up until now, ethical clothing's story was it was sweatshop free or organic,"" Cline said, ""but what was missing was an authentic and feel-good human story about the people who design and make clothes."" The story behind the clothes . Zady is just one brand that's trying to tell the stories of where clothes come from. Apparel brand Patagonia has long touted its dedication to promoting ""fair labor practices and safe working conditions,"" through detailed information on its website. Several e-tailers with a heavy emphasis on American-made products, such as Made Collection and Huckberry, play up the stories of makers with transparent sourcing and manufacturing and the fashion universe is full of sites dedicated to ethical and sustainable fashion. When the executives behind American brand Everlane toured the Chinese factories that make its silk shirts, cashmere sweaters and canvas bags, it documented the journey on the company's Tumblr and Instagram accounts. Everlane founder Michael Preysman said ""radical transparency"" was the company's philosophy from the start, and it established a pattern of transparent pricing, listing costs and markups for each of Everlane's bags, shirts and belts. Showing where clothes were made seemed like the natural next step, he said. Preysman and his colleagues spend months finding the right manufacturers for each product anyway, so why not share that information with customers? ""Transparent pricing and ethical manufacturing are part of our core values as a company because we believe they lead to the best products,"" he said. In turn, he says, it's better for his customers. Some call it slow fashion, ethical fashion or conscious consumerism. Brad Bennett uses the term ""honestly crafted"" to describe the goods featured on his site, Well Spent, which started under the name Commerce With a Conscience in 2009. Its goal is to promote products that are ""attractive, affordable and made in the U.S. or similar first-world/non-sweatshop conditions."" When Bennett started his website ""going green"" was still the big trend, he said. Today, people seem to care less about the eco-properties of the goods they buy and more about where they're made. That's why some big-name brands, including Apple, Motorola and Levis, are starting to make some products in the United States, he said. ""I think the fact that sites like mine are able to thrive is proof that there's a demand for ethically made goods,"" he said. ""More and more people want to know the story behind their clothes, and they're turning to the internet to find it."" Finding stories of uncertainty . This month, Bédat and Darabi piled into a car with Small Trades founder Robin Weiss to visit Mohnton Knitting Mills. Dressed in clothing and jewelry from Zady's partner brands, including Small Trades shirts, they greeted owner Gary Pleam outside the main office, where a 1950 black-and-white picture of the mill's staff hangs. When it launches this week, Zady will include information on where products are made, the raw material sources and a story about each brand's origin. Zady also assigns each brand badges of ""criteria for sustainability,"" such as locally sourced, made in the United States, environmentally conscious or handmade. Factory and workshop visits are part of Zady's vetting process, although it hasn't completed visits for all of its 45 partner brands, especially those based in Europe. In those cases, it relies on documentation vouching for the company's commitment to creating quality products using sustainable methods. Pleam walked them through the process of making garments, while Bédat, a former law clerk at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, took notes about cotton sourcing and how knitting machines work. Darabi tweeted images from the tour and posted photos to Instagram: awards hanging from Pleam's office walls, a picture of his great-grandfather Aaron Hornberger, bundles of waffle knit fabric, calendars hanging from work stations. They shot video of Adnan Azar as he cut patterns for shirts and Beverly Deysher as she sewed striped shirts. Over a pizza lunch in the employee break area adjacent to the sewing floor, Pleam recounted the business' struggles over the past decade. The last good year was 1998, Pleam said. Since then, he's laid off most of his workforce and cut their benefits, although he tried to make up for it by increasing hourly wages by $1.50 so they could pay for their own insurance. Today, the mill employs 20 full- and part-time workers, including his son. If Pleam could do it again, he'd do it all the same, he said, because business was good most of the time, and they've had a lot of laughs at work, staff picnics and Friday hot dog lunches. As they rode home, Darabi said the visit was uplifting, but sad. They'd found a ""hidden story"" at the factory, something genuine and kind. But it was also a story of struggle and uncertainty. ""It's just so tough,"" she said. ""The fact he isn't sure of his future, his son's future..."" she trailed off. ""It just gives us our drive and motivation to make Zady work."" ""It embodies what we're trying to do,"" Bédat added, ""bring prosperity to heritage and share their stories.""","Some fashion brands, retailers emphasize transparency to appeal to conscious consumers .

"Washington (CNN) -- In another dramatic victory for firearm owners, the Supreme Court has ruled unconstitutional Chicago, Illinois', 28-year-old strict ban on handgun ownership, a potentially far-reaching case over the ability of state and local governments to enforce limits on weapons. A 5-4 conservative majority of justices on Monday reiterated its 2-year-old conclusion that the Constitution gives individuals equal or greater power than states on the issue of possession of certain firearms for self-protection. ""It cannot be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as states legislated in an evenhanded manner,"" wrote Justice Samuel Alito. The court grounded that right in the due process section of the 14th Amendment. The justices, however, said local jurisdictions still retain the flexibility to preserve some ""reasonable"" gun-control measures currently in place nationwide. In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer predicated far-reaching implications. ""Incorporating the right,"" he wrote, ""may change the law in many of the 50 states. Read in the majority's favor, the historical evidence"" for the decision ""is at most ambiguous."" He was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. At issue was whether the constitutional ""right of the people to keep and bear arms"" applies to local gun control ordinances, or only to federal restrictions. The basic question had remained unanswered for decades, and gave the conservative majority on the high court another chance to allow Americans expanded weapon ownership rights. A key question was how far the court would apply competing parts of the 14th Amendment to preserve some ""reasonable"" gun control measures currently in place nationwide. The appeal was filed by a community activist in Chicago who sought a handgun for protection from gangs. Otis McDonald told CNN outside his South Side home that he wants a handgun to protect himself and his family from the violence in his neighborhood. ""That's all I want, is just a fighting chance,"" he said. ""Give me the opportunity to at least make somebody think about something before they come in my house on me."" His application for a handgun permit was denied in a city with perhaps the toughest private weapons restrictions in the nation. The justices two years ago affirmed an individual's right to possess such weapons, tossing out restrictive laws in the federal enclave of the District of Columbia. The larger issue is one that has polarized judges, politicians and the public for decades: Do the Second Amendment's 27 words bestow gun ownership as an individual right or as a collective one -- aimed at the civic responsibilities of state militias and therefore subject, perhaps, to strict government regulation? And is that regulation limited to federal laws, or can it be applied to local communities? The amendment states: ""A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."" Gun rights groups applauded the decision. ""Today marks a great moment in American history,"" said Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association. ""It is a vindication for the great majority of American citizens who have always believed the Second Amendment was an individual right and freedom worth defending."" Some gun control advocates tried to put a positive spin on the opinion. ""There is nothing in today's decision that should prevent any state or local government from successfully defending, maintaining, or passing, sensible, strong gun laws,"" said Paul Helmke, of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The court majority refused to limit its 2008 District of Columbia ruling. That decision offered at least partial constitutional validation to citizens seeking the right to possess one of the most common types of firearms in their homes. The Chicago ruling now extends that right significantly. The Justice Department estimates that as many as 275 million guns are in the United States. In 2005, three-quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns. Underpinning the legal basis for the court's jurisdiction in this appeal is a complex reading of the 14th Amendment, passed after the Civil War to ensure that all citizens -- including newly freed slaves -- were protected from state laws that might restrict their fundamental rights. One part ensures that states cannot deprive people of ""life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" That has been commonly applied by federal courts when it comes to disputes over basic rights, so-called ""ordered liberty"" cases. Such cases include affirming the right to abortion, and to homosexual sex. But another rarely used provision also prevents states from depriving the ""privileges or immunities"" of all citizens. The specific question for the high court in the Chicago case was whether the ""immunities and privileges"" clause should be used to overturn the handgun ban. An 1873 ruling limited use of that provision when considering a variety of state laws. McDonald's lawyer, Alan Gura, promoted a new reading of the clause, in his lead role representing gun owners. The constitutional theories are dense, but some legal scholars had said that if the high court embraced this ""privileges and immunities"" clause, it could open up to fresh review a huge range of issues, like property rights and gay marriage. Courts have generally upheld other cities' restrictions on semiautomatic weapons and sawed-off shotguns. The conservative high court majority has in recent years upheld a California ban on assault rifles, similar to a federal ban that expired in 2004. Forty-four state constitutions protect their residents' right to keep weapons, according to a brief filed by 32 state attorneys general in support of the individual weapons owners in the current appeals. Some constitutional experts have noted the Bill of Rights had traditionally been applied by courts only to the federal government, not to local entities. It was not until the past half-century that the justices have viewed free speech, assembly, and the press -- among other rights -- as individual in nature, and fundamental to liberty, superseding in many cases the power of states. There have been limits. The high court has repeatedly refused to extend to states the 5th Amendment requirement that persons can be charged with serious crimes only by ""indictment of a grand jury."" The current case was McDonald v. Chicago (08-1521).","5-4 decision reiterates and expands conclusion in 2008 D.C. decision .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Viewers may have to get used to a steady stream of reruns now that television and film writers have gone on strike. Members of the Writers Guild of America manned picket lines Monday morning outside NBC studios at Rockefeller Plaza, carrying signs and yelling, on the first day of the Writers Guild of America's strike against studios and production companies. Late-night talk show and comedy shows, including ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,"" ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" and ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien,"" have announced they'll air reruns Monday night and until further notice. If the strike continues, it could affect soap operas and prime-time television programs as well. ""I support them,"" Leno said of the writers. ""People get the wrong idea about how much writers make.""  Watch Leno back striking writers » . The writers' union says the strike, which began at 12:01 a.m. PT (3:01 a.m. ET), is necessary to protect their members' future incomes as the shows they write are increasingly distributed over new media, primarily through Internet downloading. A last-day effort to reach a new work agreement collapsed Sunday night despite the writers conceding a demand for a doubling of how much they are paid for DVD sales. This had been considered the major stumbling block to a deal. ""The DVD situation has always been a catastrophe,"" Warren Leight, the executive producer of NBC's ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent,"" said Monday. But, he stressed, ""At the moment, we have no piece of the Internet at all.""  Watch what's at stake » . While studios have been hoarding scripts for months in anticipation of a strike, some television shows that are more topical -- particularly late-night TV talk shows -- are expected to immediately go to reruns.  Watch ""30 Rock's"" Tina Fey talk about the issues » . ""It's affecting us in the most visible way possible,"" John Oliver, a writer and correspondent for ""The Daily Show,"" told CNN on Monday as he stood amid the pickets, who carried signs that read ""On Strike"" and ""Pencils Down."" The group had also brought a large inflatable rat, which they had tethered to metal railings set up along the street. ""We're off the air,"" Oliver said. ""We'd much rather work than stand in the cold. Writers are people who fear the sunlight,"" he added, smiling. However, he said, the writers need new contracts that incorporate new media's impact. ""Clearly, revenue is being created"" from new media, he said, ""but we are not receiving any of it."" In Hollywood, California, writers marched Monday outside Paramount Pictures, carrying signs and shouting over traffic and honks from supporters. Dozens more picketed outside NBC studios in Burbank, Calif. On Sunday night, the president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) criticized the WGA negotiators for walking out of the talks. ""When we asked if they would 'stop the clock' for the purpose of delaying the strike to allow negotiations to continue, they refused,"" said AMPTP President Nick Counter. The union's statement early Monday morning said that while it chose to withdraw its DVD proposal -- which they say would have doubled writers' residuals -- the studios and production companies were still insisting on a framework concerning Internet distribution that ""makes a mockery of any residual,"" the statement said. The WGA said producers want to deny the union future jurisdiction over scripts written for most new media and have offered no economic proposal for the parts of new media writing the guild wants covered. Other rules demanded by producers would give writers no residuals when a movie is streamed online or during a ""window"" when online consumers have free reuse of downloads, the WGA said. Counter placed the blamed for the failed talks on the negotiators for the writers. ""We made an attempt at meeting them in a number of their key areas, including Internet streaming and jurisdiction in new media,"" Counter said. ""Ultimately, the guild was unwilling to compromise on most of their major demands."" While working writers are generally paid well, they depend on residuals to get them through often-frequent times of unemployment. And, as video iPods and Internet downloads increasingly supplant traditional television and movie theaters, writers confront a changing industry. Reality television has been another wake-up call for writers, since most do not require scripts. ""American Idol"" and other hit shows should not be affected by a prolonged strike. AMPTP said that 67 percent -- 64 of 96 -- television series this season are scripted, down from 81 percent just two seasons ago. Late-night television hosts like David Letterman, Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel, as well as programs like ""The Daily Show,"" are feeling the pinch of the strike first. Because of their topical nature, networks do not typically shoot these shows in advance. Daytime soaps normally stockpile about 30 days in advance and most prime-time shows would likely make it through the end of the year without any major impact on programming. A spokeswoman for the guild, Sherry Goldman, told CNN on Monday that the strike would not affect news divisions. But networks would have to resort to reruns, news programs and reality shows to fill the schedule in 2008 if a strike were to drag on. If the strike lingers, the WGA faces the danger of writers opting out of full membership for ""financial core"" status, which would allow them to return to work. They would lose their voting privileges, but retain all benefits. The last WGA strike 20 years ago lasted five and a half months. It cost the entertainment industry an estimated $500 million.

"Creigh Deeds remembers turning his back just before his son attacked him, stabbing the Virginia state senator multiple times. Deeds had gone out to the barn to feed the horses. His son, Austin ""Gus"" Deeds, came across the yard. ""I said, 'Hey bud, how'd you sleep?' He said, 'fine.' I turned my back ... and he was just on me,"" Deeds told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in an interview that aired Sunday night. ""I said, 'Gus, I love you so much.'

Less than 24 hours before the November 19 stabbing, Deeds' son had undergone an evaluation by mental health professionals while he was under an emergency custody order. Officials reportedly had to release Gus, 24, because no psychiatric bed was available and an individual could only be held under emergency custody for up to six hours. ""The system failed my son,"" Deeds said he told a representative of the county agency that manages mental health care. ""I was concerned that if he came home there was going to be a crisis,"" Deeds told ""60 Minutes."" After Newtown, mental health gains prominence in gun debate .

"(CNN) -- All that texting and social networking by teenagers could come back to byte them. A new study by the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine links poor health behaviors -- including smoking, drinking and sexual activity -- to hypertexting and hypernetworking. The study defines hypertexting as sending more than 120 messages per school day. Hypernetworking is spending more than three hours per school day on social network sites like Facebook, it said. ""The startling results of this study suggest that when left unchecked texting and other widely popular methods of staying connected can have dangerous health effects on teenagers,"" said Scott Frank, lead researcher on the study.  ""This should be a wake-up call for parents to not only help their children stay safe by not texting and driving, but by discouraging excessive use of the cell phone or social websites in general."" Teenagers are ""spending really an excessive amount of time online,"" he added later during a CNN interview.  By doing so, they are contributing to ""high-tech peer pressure."" Hypertexting was reported by nearly 20 percent of the Midwestern teens surveyed, according to the study. According to the study, teens who are hypertexters are: . -- two times more likely to have tried alcohol . -- nearly 3.5 times more likely to have had sex . -- 40 percent more likely to have tried cigarettes . -- 41 percent more likely to have used illicit drugs . -- 43 percent more likely to be binge drinkers . -- 55 percent more likely to have been in a physical fight . -- 90 percent more likely to report four or more sexual partners . Hypernetworking was less pervasive, at 11.5 percent, but still associated with a similar list of maladies, the study found. According to the research, these teens are: . -- 60 percent more likely to report four or more sexual partners . -- 62 percent more likely to have tried cigarettes . -- 69 percent more likely to be binge drinkers . -- 69 percent more likely to have had sex . -- 79 percent more likely to have tried alcohol . -- 84 percent more likely to have used illicit drugs . -- 94 percent more likely to have been in a physical fight . Frank noted that minorities, children of parents with less education, and teenagers from homes without a father are more likely to engage in hypertexting and hypernetworking.  He also cautioned, however, that the study ""does not demonstrate cause and effect."" ""We are not saying texting causes these behaviors,"" he stressed.  ""We can recognize that these kinds of connections ... may be facilitating or enabling these kinds of behaviors, but we certainly can't think of (the online connections) as causing them."" Nevertheless, researchers say the results of the study are so striking that they are giving rise to a new health risk category for the age group. The study is not the first time texting and social networking have come under fire.  The activities have been blamed for accidents and promoting bad grammar skills. In January, federal safety regulators proposed a set of guidelines for states to create laws that would ban text messaging while driving. Under the proposed guidelines, drivers caught typing on a handheld device while behind the wheel would face a minimum fine of $75 and unspecified action against their driving privileges. In cases resulting in serious injury or death, a driving while texting offense could be considered a felony. A ban on texting behind the wheel has already been enacted in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Seven states have banned the use of all handheld devices while driving. And educators have long decried electronic forms of communication for gutting written language skills in students, starting with e-mails, expanding to instant messaging and continuing with text messaging and social networking. But it should be noted that teachers also complained about poor grammar before the internet came to be.

"Another Washington political showdown took shape Tuesday as the House of Representatives passed a Republican plan that would extend the payroll tax cut and speed the process for government approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The bill, approved on a 234-193 vote largely on party lines, now goes to the Senate, where it was unlikely to pass due to strong opposition from Democratic leaders. And the White House says President Barack Obama will veto the plan if it reaches his desk, setting up further brinksmanship with Congress scheduled to leave Washington for its holiday recess at the end of the week. ""This Congress needs to do its job and stop the tax hike that's scheduled to affect 160 million Americans in 18 days,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement after the vote. ""This is not a time for Washington Republicans to score political points against the president."" The impasse involves a convergence of major issues, including the payroll tax-cut extension and a spending bill that must pass in order to keep the government funded after Friday. Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, agreed that Congress must not go home for the holidays without extending the payroll tax cut that saves working Americans an average of $1,000 a year, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. Without spelling out a specific order of necessary steps, Carney made clear that Obama wants Congress to approve both a payroll tax plan and the broad government spending bill. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky characterized the Democratic stance as a threat to delay action on the spending plan until a compromise is reached on the payroll tax cut measure. That could cause a government shutdown after Friday, McConnell warned. Carney, however, insisted that Congress has plenty of time to act on all of the outstanding measures, and called for a payroll tax extension free of the pipeline provision. Earlier, Speaker John Boehner and other House Republican leaders told reporters that the payroll tax measure to be voted on later in the day had bipartisan support and would create jobs while also preventing a tax increase for American workers next year. When the vote came, 10 Democrats joined 224 Republicans voting for the bill, while 14 Republicans joined 179 Democrats voting against it. Asked about opposition by Senate Democrats who say they will reject the House measure, Boehner said: ""The Senate will have to do whatever they have to do."" The pipeline, which is currently in limbo as the State Department considers objections from environmentalists, would bring oil from Canada's oil sands in northern Alberta to Texas. More on the pipeline showdown . The State Department recently said its decision on the Keystone XL pipeline would be delayed until 2013 to allow examination of environmental issues raised by critics, a move Republicans labeled as political, to put off the issue until after next year's presidential election. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said the payroll tax cut measure does exactly what Obama has been calling for by providing tax protection for working class Americans while creating new jobs through the pipeline project. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, offered a colorful take on what will happen if  Reid blocks the House plan, as threatened. ""If Sen. Reid wants to hold up the jobs bill, he will go on Santa's naughty list,"" Hensarling said. Reid and other Democrats argue the pipeline project requires more study and should not be fast-tracked as part of a political calculation by Republicans. On Tuesday, Reid said Republicans must compromise with Democrats instead of trying to push through proposals intended to appease conservatives in their caucus. ""Speaker Boehner had to add ideological candy coating to his bill to get rebellious, rank-and-file Republicans on board,"" Reid said, adding: ""They are wasting time catering to the tea party when they should be working with Democrats on a bipartisan package that can pass both houses."" The House GOP proposal would both change the process and shorten the time frame for the government to approve the proposed pipeline from Canada to Texas. But Monday, the State Department said that would make it impossible for it to complete needed environmental, national security and safety studies. ""In the absence of properly completing the process, the department would be unable to make a determination to issue a permit for this project,"" the State Department said in a written response to questions about the measure. Boehner dismissed the State Department's warning later Monday, saying the pipeline had been under review for three years and, ""All the work has been done."" ""The only thing arbitrary about this decision is the decision by the president to say, 'Well, let's wait until after the next election,'"" Boehner said. ""The American people want jobs, and this is as close to a shovel-ready project as you're ever going to see."" The House GOP measure extends the payroll tax cut for one year and renews aid for the unemployed, while cutting back the maximum length of jobless benefits from the current 99 weeks to 59. The bill also allows states more flexibility in distributing unemployment assistance, permitting states to require those applying to submit to drug tests or show they are pursuing a high school degree, if they don't have one. The bill would also avoid a scheduled cut in pay for Medicare physicians for two years, a provision known as the ""doc fix."" To pay for the bill, GOP leaders use a series of spending cuts, including freezing pay for federal employees and members of Congress, eliminating a child tax credit for those in the United States illegally, and increasing Medicare premiums for those who earn more than $80,000 annually. The pipeline issue is just one part of the problem for Senate Democrats who disagree with ""central elements"" of the GOP bill, including the length of the unemployment insurance extension, the proposed cost offsets and the weakening of some environmental regulations. Carney said Tuesday the spending cuts go deeper than levels agreed to in August in the deal negotiated by Congress and the White House to raise the federal debt ceiling. Democrats led by Obama have been pushing for the payroll tax cut extension; Republicans initially opposed the plan but have now signed on. However, the parties are at loggerheads over how to pay for it as well as the political optics over who should get credit, as an election year approaches. As a way to garner support from reluctant conservative Republicans, who voiced concerns about the impact of the payroll tax cut on Social Security, GOP leaders insisted on keeping the provision aimed at moving toward approving the pipeline project within 60 days. Senate Democrats have begun working on a new bill of their own after Republicans blocked progress on their previous proposals that included a surtax on income over $1 million. Meanwhile, in the other big bill Congress needs to get done before funding expires, House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers told reporters off the House floor Monday that negotiators have worked out a deal on the year-end spending bill that wraps nine remaining bills into one package. The Kentucky Republican said there are some ""policy riders"" in the deal, but he declined to get into any specifics on which ones, saying he wants the staff to finish writing the legislation before he talks about any details. But Rogers said it is taking some time to ""cross the T's"" so the bill would not be posted online Monday night, which puts off the House vote to Thursday at the earliest. Rogers was confident the House would pass the bill, saying, ""We'll get it done by"" Friday. According to two senior House Republican leadership aides, Reid has told Boehner he would hold up the spending bill until both sides negotiate a compromise on the payroll tax cut bill. Asked about a potential government shutdown, House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Congress may need to pass a short-term spending measure to prevent a shutdown if the parties fail to reach agreement on the various unresolved issues, including the extension of both the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. Carney also said Tuesday that a continuing resolution on spending is a possible short-term solution to provide more time to work out a deal on the payroll tax measure.","""Congress needs to do its job and stop the tax hike,"" the White House says .

"(CNN) -- It used to be billy clubs, fire hoses and snarling German shepherds. Now it's armored personnel carriers and flash-bang grenades. The weaponry has changed, but the target is still the same. If some of the photos from Ferguson last week were in black and white, you might confuse them with scenes from the 1950s south. White police officers beating black protestors. Young black men lying face down in the street with police officers standing over them with assault rifles. We have a long history of aggressively policing communities of color in America. Police have treated black and brown people like the enemy for decades. In that context, the recent events in Ferguson in the wake of Michael Brown's shooting come as no surprise. But they go way beyond Ferguson. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . What we're witnessing is the militarization of policing, and it has become commonplace in towns across America. Every year, the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Justice funnel billions' worth of dollars and military equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies to help them amass arsenals of combat-ready weaponry, according to our report ""War Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing."" Two of the armored vehicles patrolling St. Louis right now were purchased with these federal funds. An estimated 600 police departments have received Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, which are tanks built to withstand armor-piercing roadside bombs. In the years since the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, this sort of federal funding has only become more available for state and local police departments. We're told that part of the impetus for the federal agencies is to get rid of surplus military equipment. But that's certainly not the whole reason. At least one third of the wartime weapons flowing to state and local police departments are brand new. The better explanation is that the militarization of state and local police is a deliberate strategy funded by the federal government to aggressively fight the failed ""war on drugs."" As has always been true of the war on drugs, the battlegrounds are disproportionately in communities of color. This deliberate strategy explains why almost 80% of the paramilitary raids we studied were to search homes (usually for drugs); why SWAT teams forced their way into people's homes using military equipment like battering rams 60% of the time; and why they were 14 times more likely to deploy flash-bang grenades, originally invented to ambush wartime enemies, in drug raids than during SWAT raids for other purposes. And just has been true for decades, our police's most aggressive tactics are doing disproportionate damage to communities of color. Overall, 54% of people impacted by the paramilitary searches were people of color. Dumping weapons and equipment designed for overseas combat into local neighborhoods is only adding dangerous fuel to the fire of aggressive policing. It might be tempting to think that the brutal tactics we've seen are the result of a few bad police officers. It might be comforting to think this is a fluke. And that might be partially true. But when the government arms cops like soldiers, trains them in counter-insurgency tactics, tells them they are fighting an enemy, we should expect this type of combustive, tragic result. But that doesn't mean we should accept the status quo. We need to change it. It's time for Congress to rein in its support for programs like the Department of Defense's 1033 program that allows the Pentagon to dole out weapons and stop the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security from handing out cash to police departments. Cutting this funding is part of a larger recognition that aggressively fighting the war on drugs has failed to abate drug use and instead done incredible damage to communities. The federal government must recognize that the funding currently going toward this war can and should be spent on more effective interventions like drug and mental health treatment and housing. Concurrently, state and local governments should constrain the ability of law enforcement to raid people's homes and police neighborhoods using wartime weapons and tactics. Part of the reason this hasn't happened yet is that many people were simply unaware of how militarized our police have become. The events in Ferguson should dispel any illusions people may have about that. It's time for the federal government to stop financing a siege on communities of color.","Kara Dansky: The militarization of policing has become commonplace across America .

"A tiger swims in a pond to cool off on a hot Saturday morning. School children stroll under a canopy of trees and watch Kalimantan gibbons playfully swing on the branches. All seems fine at the Surabaya Zoo, Indonesia's oldest zoo and once its most impressive. But a closer look reveals the sad state it has fallen into. Out of the public's sight, tigers are kept in small, dark cages. There is little room outside for all of its 15 tigers to roam, so only one is let out at a time. A Sumatran tiger ""Betina"" is so sick she cannot keep any food down. A few cages away is another emaciated white tiger ""Santi."" ""See, these tigers never go out their whole life, they're very skinny tigers,"" said experienced zookeeper Tony Sumampau. Sumampau was brought in by the Indonesian government to lead a temporary team to improve conditions when it took over the privately run zoo in 2010. He now spends two days a week trying to teach zoo staff how to care for animals kept in cramped and unsanitary living conditions for far too long. Before Sumampau arrived, about 25 of the zoo's 4,000 animals died each month, many of them prematurely, from disease and neglect. Among them was a cheetah, a gift from South Africa's President, whose leg was bitten off by a tiger and later died. Sumampau says trained zookeepers would never put cheetahs and tigers together. ""I think this is the only zoo I heard where a cheetah fights with the tigers, in this zoo, because they never meet in the wild,"" he explained. There has been some progress since his temporary team came in. Now, an average of 15 of the zoo's animals dies each month. In March, the zoo's last remaining giraffe was one of them. An autopsy revealed that the adult male had eaten a staggering amount of plastic; around 18 kilograms or 40 pounds was found in its abdomen, mostly food wrappers. According to Sumampau, it is not the only animals to have ingested trash that ends up in the enclosures. Poor sanitation and uncontrolled breeding also remain serious challenges for the zoo. A pelican nurses her chick in a pen it shares with about 160 other pelicans. There is so little room, the birds can barely stand and unfurl their wings. Several primates and birds are kept side by side in what was once the zoo's quarantine area. A brightly-coloured macaw no longer has any feathers on its breast. It has become so stressed by living in captivity that it has plucked them all out, Samampau says. Lutvi Achmad, the head of the East Java Natural Resources Conservation Center, who works with Sumampau, told CNN, ""This overpopulation has been going on for so long, there's inbreeding and for sure this won't be a good thing for the Surabaya Zoo."" The biggest problem Sumampau says is the lack of understanding of animal welfare and conservation. He is slowly training the zoo's 70 keepers but faces resistance from some who have worked in the zoo for years, even decades. A baby elephant pulls against the chains secured around its legs as it moves around a cramped, concrete cell. One of the keepers tells Sumampau the chains are used to train the young elephant to walk. Frequent changes in management and infighting are to be blamed for the zoo's appalling state, according to the team. Sumampau appointed one of the zoo's staff, Sri Pentawati, as the new curator. She says she was reluctant to take on the position but is heartened by the changes.  ""Our zoo is old"", she said. ""It will take time to modernize it, however, some of visitors notice the changes because some of the cages are getting fixed already."" Enclosures for the Komodo dragons, endangered and found only in Indonesia, have been renovated and the younger lizards are now kept separate from the adults who can prey on them. The barriers are low and properly installed for visitors to safely watch the Komodo dragons sunbathe. ""If you can set up exhibits showing the animals' normal behavior so people will see and know about tiger behavior, elephant behavior and things like that, the zoo in fact is education for the visitor,"" Sumampau said. Rebuilding the zoo will require expertise and money. However, with tickets priced at less than $2 each, revenues are just enough to feed the animals and keep the zoo running. Sumampau and his team have proposed plans to modernize the zoo, but stakeholders, including Surabaya's local government and the Indonesian Forestry Ministry, have yet to agree on a scheme and appoint a management team. The Forestry Ministry wants the Surabaya local government to appoint a third-party team of professionals to run the zoo. The Surabaya administration prefers a body owned by municipality to take over. ""We will support whoever, professionals, chosen by the local government to run the zoo,"" Achmad said. ""Our duty here is temporary and it is to save the animals, rescue them and prepare for the eventual transfer to the next management."" ""We need everyone to have the same vision to fulfill animal welfare of the zoo animals, that's the most important thing"", stressed Sumampau. ""The surplus animals have to be out, or euthanized, whichever is better, or some can be released to the wild. This has to be done and then we need funding to rebuild the zoo completely.""","Years of neglect are evident in mortality rates at Indonesia's Surabaya Zoo .
Until the government stepped in two years ago, 25 animals were dying each month .
Conditions have improved but overcrowding, poor sanitation and inbreeding remain problems .

"Tyrone Woods became a Navy SEAL after his mother suggested he join the military. Friday afternoon, Cheryl Croft Bennett attended a ceremony to honor the life of her son, Ty, and grieve his death alongside three other Americans in Tuesday's assault on the U.S. Consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi. Woods, who had retired from the Navy, handled security for diplomats and perished with fellow former SEAL Glen Doherty, computer expert Sean Smith and U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. ""Tyrone's friends and colleagues called him 'Rone,' and they relied on his courage and skill, honed over two decades as a Navy SEAL,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. U.S. Embassy in Cairo was warned . ""In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from Central America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior, earning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to Tyrone's wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few months ago."" Back at home in California, Woods worked as a registered nurse in his wife's dental practice in La Jolla, his mother told CNN affiliate KGW TV in Portland, Oregon, but he gained fulfillment in his military role. ""He loved the cutting edge. He loved danger. He loved an adrenaline rush,"" Bennett said. ""But he loved the thinking part of it, too. He was very street smart, and he was the guy you would want to have in your corner if you were in a tight situation."" A diplomatic source told CNN that Doherty was in Libya to search for shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles -- a mission given high priority after the fall of longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Opinion: Arab Spring nations don't yet grasp freedom of dissent . Doherty grew up in Massachusetts with a passion for the outdoors, particularly the mountain West, his family said. Outside the family's home in Woburn, near Boston, his sister remembered him as ""our American hero."" ""Glen lived his life to the fullest,"" Katie Quigley told reporters. ""He was my brother, but if you ask his friends, he was their brother as well."" The 42-year-old graduated from high school in 1988 in neighboring Winchester, where flags were displayed at half-staff on Thursday. He played on the varsity tennis and wrestling teams, school officials said in an announcement marking his death. His junior-year English teacher, Judy Hession, recalled him as ""bursting with life."" ""Every day his huge smile and his happy-go-lucky optimism filled my classroom,"" Hession said in a statement released by the school district. ""He got along with all types of people, was a class leader and, from the perspective of 30 years of teaching, one of my most memorable students."" After college in Arizona and stints as a ""ski bum"" and raft guide in Utah, Doherty joined the Navy and became a member of the elite Navy SEAL commandos in 1995, his family said in a statement. ""He told me he wanted to be a SEAL and I tried to use reverse psychology with him and say, 'Well, you won't make it. You can't make it. You don't pay attention to me -- never mind a superior officer,'"" his father, Ben, told CNN affiliate WCVB in Boston. ""He showed me."" Doherty had planned to leave the service after knee surgery in 2001, but after the al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, he ""was not allowed to leave and didn't want to,"" his family said. Doherty served two tours of duty in Iraq, starting with the U.S. invasion in 2003, before leaving the military in 2005. He then became a private security contractor, working in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen -- a job that took a toll on his home life and contributed to a divorce, his family said. He also joined the advisory board of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, a group that has battled religious intolerance in the U.S. armed forces. Its president, former Air Force officer Michael ""Mikey"" Weinstein, said he was ""in a state of shock"" after learning of Doherty's death. ""He was one of our most active advisory board members,"" Weinstein said. ""I was surprised he was willing to come on and lend the gravitas that comes with being a Navy SEAL to our cause."" Doherty's involvement ""made it easier for others to come to us,"" Weinstein added. Arrests made in attack on U.S. Consulate in Libya . He said Doherty believed the kind of violent jihadists American troops faced were ""a very small percentage of the overall mosaic of the Muslim faith,"" and saw anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States and in the ranks as something that hurt U.S. national security. ""He went back to the Middle East because he cared deeply about the Muslim people, and because he cared about bringing freedom and democracy and human rights to the Middle East,"" Weinstein said. Doherty ""was a kind and caring person, and I'm sure that he gave every last bit of his courage and strength"" to defend the consulate and Stevens, he added. ""All this is going to do is light a further fire under us in Glen's name and memory to continue to fight for religious freedom and respect and tolerance."" He also co-authored a 2010 book, ""The 21st-Century Sniper: A Complete Practical Guide,"" with former comrade Brandon Webb. In a statement accompanying the family's, Webb said, ""Don't feel sorry for him, he wouldn't have it."" ""He died serving with men he respected, protecting the freedoms we enjoy as Americans and doing something he loved,"" Webb said. In her statement, Clinton said Doherty, a paramedic, was referred to as ""Bub"" by his friends and family. ""In the end, he died the way he lived -- with selfless honor and unstinting valor,"" she said. Smith's death was among the first reported in the Benghazi fracas. Clinton eulogized him Wednesday as a 10-year veteran of the Foreign Service, an information management officer who had served in Iraq, South Africa, Canada and the Netherlands. Smith was better known by his online alter ego, which was legendary in the gaming world. Six things to know about the Benghazi attack . In real life, he was an Air Force veteran with a wife, a son and a daughter. But in the virtual universe of the computer game EVE Online, Smith was ""Vile Rat"" -- one of the leaders of a gamers' alliance renowned for his diplomatic skill in the multi-player space warfare simulation. ""If you play this stupid game, you may not realize it, but you play in a galaxy created in large part by Vile Rat's talent as a diplomat. No one focused as relentlessly on using diplomacy as a strategic tool as VR,"" Smith's friend Alex Gianturco wrote in a tribute posted on his website. Gianturco wrote that Smith had been under fire before, while posted to Baghdad. When that occurred, he usually broke off his messaging. ""We'd freak out and he'd come back OK after a bit,"" Gianturco wrote. But Tuesday night, after reporting ""GUNFIRE,"" Smith ""disconnected and never returned,"" he added. A few hours earlier, Smith had posted, ""assuming we don't die tonight. We saw one of our 'police' that guard the compound taking pictures,"" he recounted. The death of Stevens also left many across the United States and in foreign posts around the world reeling. The U.S. ambassador died in the very city where he had arrived aboard a cargo ship in the spring of 2011 to help build ties between the upstart rebellion and the rebels. Stevens graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1982, then took a pause in his studies to join the Peace Corps. He later worked as an international trade lawyer in Washington before joining the Foreign Service, the career diplomatic corps, in 1991. ""When he went to Libya, he had no illusions about where he was going,"" said longtime friend Daniel Seidemann. ""He has probably done more than anybody on the planet to help the Libyan people."" On Friday, in a ceremony marking the return of the four victims to the United States, President Barack Obama said that amid all of the horrific images coming out of Benghazi this week, ""I also think of the Libyans who took to the streets with homemade signs expressing their gratitude to an American who believed in what we could achieve together. ""I think of the man in Benghazi with his sign in English, a message he wanted all of us to hear. It said, 'Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.' Chris Stevens was a friend.""

"Dozens of concertgoers were hospitalized during a show by superstar DJ  Avicii in Boston on Wednesday night, CNN affiliates reported. Local media put the number of patients anywhere between 30 and 80. Massachusetts General Hospital told CNN it  received 13 patients between ages 16 and 19. All of the patients are being evaluated, said Kory Zhao, a hospital public affairs officer. Most patients had a problem with dehydration, drugs and alcohol, authorities told CNN affiliate WHDH. Avicii, the Swedish artist behind the hit song ""Wake Me Up,"" performed at  the TD Garden as part of his True Tour. Dozens of ambulances lined up outside the garden  venue as crowds spilled into the streets after the concert. Other ambulances zoomed off, red lights flashing, as frazzled parents waited. ""I have a 15-year-old and her girlfriend that came to the Avicii concert ... we just heard about this, "" Pam Jones told WHDH. ""I'm very shocked. We have to find her."" Chanel Andre, who also attended the concert, said the venue was hot. ""These concerts should be outside ... I think it was a combination of heat and drugs, more of the latter,"" she said. The artist, whose real name is Tim Bergling, became an international star as a DJ and producer in electronic dance. His other hit songs include ""Hey Brother"" and ""Levels,"" which was nominated for a Grammy for Best Dance Recording last year. This is the latest incident involving concertgoers. A man collapsed and died after leaving the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas on Saturday morning, the Las Vegas Sun reported. Avicii was on the schedule of performers at that festival. It's unclear whether his death was linked to the festival. An investigation is under way. Police told  the newspaper that nearly 800 people were treated for medical conditions, 25 of whom were transported to local hospitals. About 400,000 people attended the Las Vegas music event during its three-night run, the paper said. Avicii cancels Ultra Festival performance to undergo gall bladder surgery .

"It is a stark and sobering fact of American life in the 21st century -- black, Hispanic and Native American boys and young men are less likely to graduate, stay out of jail and get a job than those who are white. Chances are greater they'll grow up with a single parent or none at all, won't read well, and will get suspended or expelled from school or just drop out. Saddest of all, such statistics aren't new or particularly shocking in a society that has come to expect such class, racial and ethnic disparities. President Barack Obama launched his ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative three months ago to focus on solutions to such chronic and deep-rooted social ills. The initiative included a task force to examine the issue, and an invitation for businesses and foundations to help out. ""No excuses. Government, and private sector, and philanthropy, and all the faith communities, we all have a responsibility to help provide you the tools you need,"" Obama told a group of black students in February when he announced the initiative. ""We've got to help you knock down some of the barriers that you experience."" Transcript: Obama announces 'My Brother's Keeper' On Friday, the White House released the task force's first report -- a recitation of the challenges faced by young black, Hispanic and Native American males struggling with a legacy of poverty and accompanying hardship, as well as ways to help them persevere and succeed. In a conference call with reporters, administration officials emphasized the initiative wasn't a new government program, but instead sought to assess existing public and private efforts to assess what worked and could be expanded. The goal is ""sharpening what we do to make sure we are really maximizing the impact of the federal resources that we have,"" said Cecilia Munoz, the White House director of domestic policy. Also maximized would be the participation and contributions of a growing segment of the American population, noted White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who said: ""It's not only the right thing to do, it's vital to the long-term strength of our communities and the economy of the United States."" She noted the Obama administration launched the White House Council on Women and Girls five years ago to focus on equal opportunity, and now the ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative sought to do the same for other historically disadvantaged demographics. The 60-page task force report identifies key milestones for predicting later success for a non-white boy or young man, including: . Getting a healthy start in life and school . Reading well by third grade . Graduating from high school . Completing post-secondary education or training . Getting a job . Staying on track and getting a second chance . ""At each of these milestones, some individuals start to fall behind,"" the task force report says. ""Once a young person falls behind, success becomes exponentially more difficult."" It presents a litany of statistics that amplify the magnitude of the challenge. Black, Hispanic and Native American children are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as white children. About two in three black children and one in three Latino children live with one parent, and those raised by single mothers are way more likely to drop out of school. Among black males 10 to 24 years old, homicide is the leading cause of death. And in 2012, black males were six times more likely to be imprisoned than white males, while Hispanics were 2.5 times more likely. To respond to such disparities, Obama will call for Americans to commit themselves to long-term mentoring or tutoring programs to provide guidance and stability to children and young men of color, said Broderick Johnson, the White House Cabinet secretary who co-authored the task force report. Other focuses will be expanding access to quality pre-school and early education programs, eliminating expulsions and suspensions in early learning settings, and promoting literacy and reading programs, the task force report said. The initiative also includes investments expected to top $200 million from foundations and organizations involved in educational and social issues. Some of the wonky language of the report reflected the long-running programs, some public and some private, on which its recommendations and proposals are based. For reducing violence and providing boys and young men of color a second chance, its recommendation is to ""institutionalize community oriented policing practices in the field and employ methods to address racial and ethnic bias within the juvenile and criminal justice systems."" Translation: Improve coordination between federal, state, city and community leaders, as well as police and neighborhood groups, while reforming the juvenile justice system to keep kids and young men out of reform schools or jail cells and ensuring that those in prison have access to a quality education. Back in February, Obama spoke with rare candor about his own childhood in an effort to show that people from broken homes and other challenging backgrounds can succeed. ""I didn't have a dad in the house and I was angry about it, even though I didn't necessarily realize it at the time,"" he said. ""I made bad choices. I got high without always thinking about the harm that it could do. I didn't always take school as seriously as I should have. I made excuses. Sometimes I sold myself short."" He compared himself to young men now who are growing up like he did. ""The only difference is that I grew up in an environment that was a little bit more forgiving. So when I made a mistake, the consequences were not as severe,"" the President said. ""I had people who encouraged me, not just my mom and grandparents, but wonderful teachers and community leaders. And they pushed me to work hard, and study hard, and make the most of myself. And if I didn't listen, they said it again. And if I didn't listen, they said it a third time - and they would give me second chances and third chances. ""They never gave up on me, and so I didn't give up on myself.""","The President's ""My Brother's Keeper"" task force issues its first report .

"(CNN)Anita Ekberg, the Swedish-born actress whose role in ""La Dolce Vita"" made her into an international symbol of sensuality, died in Italy on Sunday. Her death was widely reported in Italian media, citing complications from a longtime illness. She was 83. Ekberg died in the country that made her an international star thanks to her turn as Sylvia, Marcello Mastroianni's unattainable dream woman the 1960 Federico Fellini classic. However, she was often quoted as saying that Fellini owed his fame to her, not the other way around. A scene from ""La Dolce Vita"" of her bathing in Rome's Trevi fountain, clad in a black gown with a plunging neckline, cemented her sex symbol status, a designation she would later refer to as a ""handicap."" American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan also immortalized Ekberg in the song ""I Shall Be Free."" Born in Malmo, Sweden, in 1931, Ekberg's road to stardom began in 1950, when she represented Sweden in the Miss Universe competition, according to internet movie database IMDb. She did not win, but she landed a modeling contract in the United States, where she posed for Playboy and American pinup magazines. She landed Hollywood roles over the next decade that played on her beauty and her voluptuous figure. She appeared in the comedy ""Abbott and Costello Go to Mars"" as a guard on the planet Venus. She also appeared in two comedies with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, ""Artists and Models"" and ""Hollywood or Bust,"" and another with Bob Hope, ""Paris Holiday.""

"The family of a teenager who committed suicide after she was allegedly gang-raped and bullied is urging Canadian officials to reconsider filing criminal charges. Rehtaeh Parsons, a 17-year-old high school student from Halifax, Nova Scotia, was taken off life support on Sunday, three days after she tried to hang herself.  Her family told CNN they met with Canadian justice officials on Wednesday and the officials assured them they would take a fresh look at filing charges. The teen was bullied for more than a year after the alleged sexual assault, which happened in November 2011 when she was 15, her family said. Authorities confirmed that a photograph allegedly showing Parsons having sex with one of the boys was circulated to friends' mobile phones and computers.

"The Texas state senator whose filibuster of an abortion bill became a national phenomenon has a long history of persisting against tough odds. Wendy Davis -- the 50-year-old Democrat who stood and spoke for 13 hours Tuesday at the Texas Capitol -- went from being a teen mom to graduating from Harvard Law School. She began working after school at age 14 to help support her single mother and three siblings, according to her campaign website.  ""By 19, Wendy was a single mother herself, working two jobs to make ends meet in hopes of creating a better life for her young daughter."" She pursued community college, then transferred to Texas Christian University. With the help of scholarships and loans, she graduated first in her class. She went on to graduate with honors from Harvard Law at the age of 33. She also had a second daughter. While standing during the filibuster, Davis wore pink running shoes. It was unclear whether the color was chosen because anti-abortion Republican feminists have been referred to as ""pink elephants."" In 2010, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin spoke of a ""stampede of pink elephants,"" promising a movement of GOP women against abortion. Davis entered public life in 2008, defeating a longtime Republican incumbent to enter the Texas Senate. Her district covers parts of Fort Worth and its suburbs. This week's was not her first filibuster. Filibuster rivets online . She previously took on Gov. Rick Perry and the Republican majority, ""staging a filibuster and forcing a special session in her attempt to stop $5 billion in crippling cuts to Texas public schools,"" her website says. When she was running for the state Senate last fall, a Fort Worth Star-Telegram editorial described her as ""a successful attorney with a powerful personal narrative,"" but it pointed out she has legal clients that are public entities, such as Dallas/Fort Worth Airport and the North Texas Tollway Authority. Davis pledged to abstain on voting on some legislation that at least one client -- the tollway authority -- was expected to advance. The newspaper endorsed her candidacy last fall, calling her ""a tough fighter, a conscientious public servant and an able leader."" Her politics, however, apparently inspired some critics to violence. Last year, firebombs were thrown at Davis' office. She was not present at the time, and no one was injured. ""Thank you all for your expressions of support and concern,"" Davis said on Twitter at the time. ""My team and I are concentrating on moving forward and staying focused."" With tens of thousands of new followers Wednesday as a result of her filibuster, Davis tweeted, ""Thanks to the powerful voices of thousands of Texans, #SB5 is dead.
