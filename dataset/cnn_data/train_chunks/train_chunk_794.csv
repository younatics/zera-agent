"By . Mark Prigg . Amazon is believed to be working on a phone with a glasses-free 3D screen for release in June. According to reports in the Wall Street Journal, the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.' The handset will be revealed in June and launched in September, the report claims. Scroll down for Video . Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen . Amazon's most reent launch was the Fire TV box. It features: . Quad-Core Processor and Graphics Engine . 2GB of memory, 4x the memory of Apple TV . Streams in High Definition 1080p with Dolby Digital Plus Surround Sound . Box is 0.7” thin . Fire TV’s remote uses bluetooth . Voice search using microphone on remote . Average price of paid games is $1.85 . This would pit it directly against Apple's upcoming iPhone 6, which is also expected to go on sale in September. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes the firm will launch a phone. 'We predict Amazon (US) will launch its own brand smartphone in 3-6 months, using the same hardware strategy as used for its e-reader and tablet,' he recently wrote. 'The supply chain will start stocking up materials in Q2 2014 for production.' It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console. The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40.Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box. 'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said. The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September . 'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO. The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus. The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast. The firm said it plans to add more services in the future. Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US. Speculation about Amazon smartphones began in 2011.","Phone rumoured to show images that 'float above the screen like holograms'

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Biking hero: Many cycling enthusiasts have been inspired by the success of Sir Bradley Wiggins . Sales of prostate products have increased as biking has become the new way of keeping fit among middle-aged men. Known as MAMILs - middle-aged men in lycra – they have become a common sight on country roads and city streets, following the success of Sir Bradley Wiggins at the 2012 Tour de France and Team GB at the London Olympics. As British Cycling’s memberships have increased by 50 per cent in the past two years, sales of prostate products have quadrupled among customers aged between 40 and 45 in 2013, an online chemist reports. The link between cycling and prostate . problems has been documented in The Sports Medicine Book by Dr. Gabe . Mirkin, which revealed that genital numbness, swelling, and pressure on . the prostate were common side effects of cycling. On rare occasions, cases of infertility, blood in the urine or inflammation of the prostate were also reported, he says. Incidents of prostate problems caused by cycling were the result of . compression of the prostate from sitting in the saddle for long periods . of time, researchers . at Tel Aviv University found. ChemistDirect Superintendent Pharmacist, Omar El-Gohary said:  ‘Cycling is not directly linked to prostate problems, but repetitive . trauma to the prostate on the saddle can occur which can lead to . inflammation of the prostate. The biggest increase in sales of prostate products has been seen in the South East, which saw an annual increase of 20 per cent. The East saw a 15 per cent rise total rise and the South West 10 per cent, ChemistDirect said. Sales of prostate products including Flomax Relief, Healthaid Prostavital, Saw Palmetto and iMan Prostate Health Formula + at ChemistDirect rose by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013. Prostate problems tend to affect nearly 50 per cent men over the age of 50 and as many as 90 per cent of men in their seventies and eighties. ‘But we have seen a steady increase in sales for prostate products over the last year, particularly amongst younger men in their 40s,' said Mr El-Gohary. He believes the surge may be down to the boom in . cycling. In October, British Cycling, the UK cycling governing body, . reported that membership had surpassed 80,000, a rise of more than 50 . per cent following Sir Bradley Wiggins’ win at the 2012 Tour de France. Risky business: The rise of the MAMIL - middle aged man in lycra - may have had consequences, as sales of prostate products quadrupled for customers aged 40 to 45 in 2013 . Retail analyst Mintel also revealed last year that half of all British men cycle, with the overall growth in bike sales propelled by men aged 35-45. Mr El-Gohary added: ‘If you are feeling pain when cycling, assess whether the pain subsides when you get off the saddle. 'If the pain remains, and is accompanied by other problems such as urinary problems or erectile dysfunction, you should book an appointment with your doctor.’ Finding ways to reduce pressure on the groin area (as the prostate is located just below the bladder), such as regularly standing on the pedals to wearing padded shorts, can help. A study in the British Journal of Urology International showed that grooved seating produced less numbness in the penile area and impact on erectile dysfunction, but also, the position of the ride is key. As a result, more bike manufacturers are now making bikes with specially fitted saddles.","Sales of prostate products have quadrupled for customers aged 40-45 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Long before the Golden Gate Bridge became an iconic piece of American engineering, a 1932 proposal called for the center of the structure to be submerged in the San Francisco Bay allowing ships to safely pass above. The 'boat tunnel' idea, as shown on Modern Mechanix, would've run right through the center of the bridge and was the brainchild of inventor Cleve F. Shaffer. According to Shaffer's obituary, he's . imagination 'foresaw the tank, the bazooka, and the moving sidewalk, . though he failed to win fame from any of them.' The 'boat tunnel' would allow cars to drive underwater as boats glided easily through the bridge's center . Shaffer's plan was attractive as it was thought to cost just a third of the bridge's $35 million budget, the Atlantic reported. Plans called for regular truss spans at both ends leading inwards into sections floating on pontoons. Interior ramps not unlike those found in parking garages would crisscross the interior. Traveling down one ramp would take a vehicle 45 feet below the waterline, traveling to the other ramp then back to the surface would be via a 1,200-foot-long tube. The design is problematic because of the sudden deceleration needed to enter the ramp areas, which could have led to gridlock. Today the bridge is a marvel of American engineering, even if boats travel under it the old fashioned way . To protect against the currents, Shaffer advised building a resilient chain barrier to be hung from anchored buoys carrying lights and sound warnings. What reason the plan was abandoned is lost to time, and today ships pass the Golden Gate by simply steering under it, guided by foghorns.","Inventor Cleve Shaffer proposed alternate plan that would have let boats pass above bridge over San Francisco Bay .

Two drivers who raced at 70mph on a 30mph road have been jailed after a cyclist was knocked down with such force she suffered five broken bones and her bike was snapped in two. Helen Beere was injured as she crossed a Coventry . street when Keith Riley, 31, and Anas Raja, 22, sped towards her after they agreed to race from some traffic lights. The 40-year-old can only remembers seeing . headlights on the wrong side of the road and then waking up in the city's . hospital. Victim: Helen Beere in hospital after  being run down at 70mph, leaving her with a broken arm, shoulder and two broken legs . Jailed: Keith Riley, 31, and Anas Raja, 22,  have been sent to prison for 28 months and 18 months respectively . Impact: This is the remains of the Helen Beere's bike, which broke in two from the impact of the crash . She suffered a broken collar bone, a broken arm and shattered elbow, and . two broken legs and had to be told by police why her body was shattered. Recovery: Police say Mrs Beere is lucky to be alive but nine months on she still needs crutches to walk . Riley, . who hit her, sped from the scene while Raja stayed and called an . ambulance. The pair were jailed at Leamington Spa Crown Court for 28 . months and 18 months respectively. 'I've read about people who killed others while driving so I was pleased they were both jailed immediately,' Mrs Beere said. 'It is worrying that people have such disregard and respect for other people using the road. 'It is unbelievable to think they were racing. I was told they were doing around 70mph. 'I am lucky to be alive, basically. It is what has kept me going for all this time.' Mrs Beere spent four-and-a-half weeks in hospital and had 12 hours of surgery. She is still using crutches to walk nine months after the crash. Her parents moved in with her for six months to help her look after sons Oscar, five, and Jake, 10. The men who were responsible for her injuries were jailed for a total of 36 months. Brutal: This image shows how badly broken her arm was after a racer ploughed into her at around 70mph . Broken: The cyclist had several rods had to be inserted to help support her crushed body and this x-ray shows metal plates and pins in her right arm and clavicle . Injury: Her left leg was in a cage for some time to fix her broken leg, which required screws and rods driven into it . Riley was also banned from driving for four years and Raja for two years. Investigating officer Pc Craig Graves told the court Mrs Beere was 'extremely fortunate' not to die. He . said: 'The particular section of the Holyhead Road is a 30mph . restricted road and the two drivers have very foolishly decided to race . one another whilst heading out of city. 'It . is estimated that both vehicles were travelling at speeds more . consistent with that of a motorway and way in excess of 70mph. 'This . has shown a total disregard for other road users be they motorists or . pedestrians.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Rising levels of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere has been blamed for increasing temperatures, but elevated levels of CO2 could also be damaging our crops. A field study of wheat has shown that its nutritional value decreases when it is exposed to higher levels of the greenhouse gas. The issue is caused when plants turn nitrate into proteins.They do this to stay healthy, but CO2 inhibits their ability to perform the process. Rising levels of carbon dioxide could make crops like wheat less nutritious, claims a new study . This means their nutritional value drops as they struggle to stay alive. In the study Professor Arnold Bloom of the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of California and his colleagues exposed wheat to varying levels of CO2. They showed that under elevated levels of CO2, as compared to regular levels, the level of nitrate assimilation was slowed. Protein and nitrogen concentrations decline in plants under elevated levels of CO2. This decline could be caused by the plant growing larger with more CO2, diluting the protein in their tissues. Carbohydrates could also accumulate on the leaves, decreasing the amount of a prevalent protein called Rubisco. Elevated CO2 also inhibits plant nitrogen metabolism. All in all, increased CO2 reduces the amount of protein in crops. This makes them less nutritious for humans. ‘These findings imply that food quality will suffer under the CO2 levels anticipated during this century unless more sophisticated approaches to nitrogen fertilisation are employed,’ they write. The food quality of field-grown plants has already begun to decline, but until now no plausible theory had been put forward to explain why it’s happening. This research is the first to point the finger at CO2 as the cause of this decline. The study examined samples of wheat from 1996 and 1997 in the Maricopa Arigultural Center near Phoenix, Arizona. During that period air enriched with CO2 had been released on the fields, similar to what is expected to be present in the air by 2030. Alongside this a controlled planting of wheat in ambient air was also grown. Leaf material from the plots was then iced, dried and stored in vacuum-sealed containers. This allowed Professor Bloom and his team to study the plants and make their findings with methods that were not available when the experiment was first performed over a decade ago. Nitrogen fertilisation (pictured) has been touted as a possible solution, but it can harm the environment . Other studies have shown that protein concentrations in wheat, rice, barley and potato tubers decline by about eight per cent on average under increased levels of CO2. The expected rise in the CO2 in the next few decades will in turn drop the protein content available to humans by about three per cent. While small, it is an effect that could snowball if left to get out of control. One possible solution is nitrogen fertilisation to sustain nitrate levels in the plants. However, this would have an adverse effect of leaking nitrate into groundwater and increasing emissions of nitrous oxide, another greenhouse gas. A new method of fertilisation might instead need to be devised in order to counteract the effects of rising CO2.","New research studied the effects of increased CO2 on field crops .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . You’d be forgiven for thinking console gaming was thriving - following major launches of new consoles from Microsoft and Sony, plus a series of high-profile games. But some experts are taking a much more sober view. Although video games spending is expected to grow by 10 per cent this year, only $4 (£2) in every $10 (£6) in the industry is set to come from disc-based games played on consoles and PCs. The rising popularity of online games, and the increase in mobile gaming, has led to a drop in traditional games as we know them. Experts predict only $4 (£2) in every $10 (£6) in 2014 will come from console games. Disc-based games will account for just 41% of all video games revenue, down from 68% in 2009, while online games will jump to 31% and mobile will account for 28% of games . Strategy Analytics claim that over the next year, disc-based games will account for just 41 per cent of all video games revenue, down from 68 per cent five years ago. Online games will make up 31 per cent of revenue - up from 21 per cent in 2009 - while mobile is expected to account for 28 per cent of games sales – two and a half times its 11 per cent share, five years ago. ‘Disc-based games have suffered from the emergence of digital gaming and won’t ever recapture the peak years of the PS2 and Wii generations,’ said Eric Smith, analyst at Strategy Analytics’ Digital Consumer Practice. Senior Analyst Michael Inouye from ABI Research told MailOnline: ‘In addition, more consumers are downloading games, eschewing the physical copies. Although video games spending is . expected to grow by 10 per cent this year, only $4 (£2) in every $10 . (£6) is set to come from disc-based games, played on consoles and PCs.

While mobile is expected to . account for 28 per cent of games sales - two and a half times its 11 per . cent share, five years ago. Around 28 million consoles were shipped . globally in 2013, half the volume shipped five years ago. However . shipments are expected to jump 14 per cent in 2014 to 32 million units. This has been helped by the release of Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4. Experts predict spending on disc-based . games to peak again 2016, but further growth depends on more the launch of Android micro-consoles such as Ouya, nVidia’s Shield and . Huawei’s Tron. ‘Mobile is popular because so many of us have these devices in our possession throughout most of the day, but it’s important to see the delineation between mobile and what many call core gaming.’ And Brian Blau, research director of consumer technology and markets at Gartner added: ‘Console games today are still very expensive when you compare purchase price with mobile games, and gamers are starting to realise they can get value from less expensive content.’ Mobile gaming is popular because the devices are portable and the games are cheap – usually selling for less than £3 ($5), or are free, but funded by in-app purchases. Mobile gaming, stock image pictured, is popular because the devices are portable and the games are cheap, or even free. Mobile games are still relatively small in size compared to console titles, and mobile processors are improving in order to match and rival those found on consoles . While mobile games are still relatively small in download size, console titles can be quite large, too. Due to the recent surge in mobile gaming, the industry is increasingly supporting mobile, and the processors are steadily becoming more powerful, in order to rival consoles. Blau told MailOnline: ‘Mobile is the fastest growing category in the video game market and because mobile game apps are always with you, there is also a large number of players and also a big engagement with those types of apps. Around 28 million consoles were shipped globally in 2013. Shipments are expected to jump 14 per cent in 2014 to 32 million units, helped by the release of Sony's PlayStation 4, pictured . ‘So as part of an overall game market, because of the rise of mobile, you can say that other parts of the market are shrinking.’ ‘It’s important to note that the console manufacturers also considered going ‘disc-less’ for this generation but determined the market wasn’t ready yet - so the removal of the disc drive is not necessarily indicative of a decline in the console market but rather a likely inevitable transition down the road,’ Inoyue continued. ‘When you factor in download speeds, data caps, and limited storage space, the timing wasn’t right for disc-less gaming on a wholesale level. ‘It’s also worth noting Sony and Microsoft are helping to explore the opportunities with cloud gaming.' Smith explained console obituaries are premature for three reasons: ‘Firstly, a large enough gaming enthusiast segment remain devoted to console gaming. 'Secondly, while smartphone and tablets have taken market share they have exposed more people to gaming than ever before - a small but significant proportion of ‘mobile first’ gamers graduate to dedicated handheld or home consoles, sustaining the market. ‘Thirdly, the companies are deeply committed to investing in the perpetuation of the console model. Aside from games, it’s a key [strategy] into the connected living room for Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo and perhaps others in future such as Amazon and Apple.’ Console sales to date have been strong for Sony and Microsoft, but weak for Nintendo, the Nintendo Wii U pictured, and this is contributing to overall lower numbers for the 8th generation of consoles . Around 28 million consoles were shipped globally in 2013, half the volume shipped five years ago. However, shipments are expected to jump 14 per cent in 2014 to 32 million units. ‘It will take years before the consoles fully transition to digital downloads and that will remove some of the buying friction,’ continued Blau. ‘There is a very loyal console and PC user base, and those types of gamers drive a significant portion of the game market.’ Console sales to date have been strong for Sony and Microsoft, but weak for Nintendo and this is contributing to overall lower numbers for the 8th generation of consoles. Analyst Eric Smith said: 'Humans have always played games. Given the breadth of innovation set to hit the market over the next few years - whether its the Oculus Rift VR, pictured, or the lively Android-based micro-console scene - there has never been a better time to love playing video games' Smith claimed there should be enough interest to sustain ‘at least two high-end games consoles for another hardware generation after the current one.’ Experts predict spending on disc-based games to peak in 2016, but further growth depends on more value-oriented plays from Android micro-consoles such as Ouya, nVidia’s Shield and Huawei’s Tron. ‘Humans have always played games, it’s up to the industry to provide the outlets which best match contemporary habits. ‘Given the breadth of innovation set to hit the market over the next few years – whether its the Oculus Rift VR, Steamboxen or the lively Android-based micro-console scene - there has never been a better time to love playing video games.’","Experts predict only $4 in every $10 in 2014 will come from console games .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . As if snowboarding wasn’t enough of a rush, one British thrillseeker has decided to do the sport using electric jet thrusters. Jamie Barrow, the UK’s fastest snowboarder, set a world record earlier this year using electric engines at the St Moritz resort in Switzerland. The Swiss-born sportsman was able to reach a speed of 50.1mph (80.63 kph) on a flat stretch using nothing but the electric thrusters to propel him. Scroll down for video… . Jamie Barrow (pictured), the UK's fastest snowboarder, set a world record earlier this year using the electric engines at the St Moritz resort in Switzerland . ‘It might sound a bit crazy to begin with - ""Oh yeah, I'm going to be propelled along by electric jet engines"", said the University of Bath graduate. ‘But in reality, it's not as bad as it sounds. You're not going to take off and fly somewhere.’ The jet engine record attempt began when Mr Barrow was contacted by Adam Contoret from Staffordshire-based DreamScience. Mr Contoret came up with the idea for the device after he tried his hand at paramotoring and found he didn't like the experience of strapping a huge engine on his back. The jet engine record attempt began when Mr Barrow (pictured) was contacted by Adam Contoret from Staffordshire-based DreamScience . Dreamscience said recent advances in lithium polymer battery technology have made it  possible to power four eight-kW motors. These each turn spin fan blades at speeds of up to 30,000 rpm. To use the device, the rider holds onto the central bar and controls thrust with either a thumb throttle or bite control. Adam Contoret, the inventor of the device, hopes the the thrusters will also be used to improve jump height and push riders up hills. 'It's like a jet on a runway,’ he said. ‘It seems slow at first and before you know it you're just going like a rocket.' He decided to develop his own thrust system that could be used by skiers, windsurfers, skater and snowboarders . ‘The thruster is a very powerful motor driving a fan, about 30,000 rpm,’ Mr Contoret told Gizmag.com. ‘A modern jet engine has a turbojet propulser module at the core of the engine and this drives a large fan at the front of the engine that generates most of the thrust. ‘Electric motor technology has recently progressed to the level where the turbojet core can be replaced with a high power electric motor.’ Dreamscience’s latest prototype uses four 8 kW motor-powered thrusters, along with a lithium-polymer battery pack to power the motors. To use the device, the rider holds onto the central bar and controls thrust with either a thumb throttle or bite control.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The alien world of Jupiter is more than 365 million miles (588 million km) away from what we experience on Earth. But despite this huge distance, astronomers have long believed the gas giant’s gravity is so strong it deflects comets and asteroids that would otherwise hit our planet. Now a new study has shed light on how this strong gravitational pull may have influenced Earth's climate and, in turn, created the conditions needed for life to thrive on our planet billions of years ago. Astronomers have long believed Jupiter’s gravity helps deflect comet and asteroids that would otherwise hit our planet.  Now a new study has shed light on how Jupiter may have helped create the conditions for life to thrive on Earth billions of years ago . Jupiter’s gravity, which is 2.5 times stronger than that of Earth's, is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own. This means that, depending on how Jupiter interacts with Earth, our planet's orbit - and therefore its climate - could vary significantly. For example, if our planet is pulled closer to the sun, our climate would change as a result. Equally, if Jupiter's orbit caused Earth to move further away. The study, by the University of New South Wales and Royal Holloway University of London, ran various computer models of our solar system, according to a report by Elizabeth Howell in Astrobiology Magazine. With each iteration, the planets in the solar system remained in their place while Jupiter moved around in different obits, ranging from circular to elliptical. Jupiter’s gravity, which is 2.4 times stronger than that of Earth, is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system - including our own.  This means that, depending on how Jupiter interacts with Earth, our planet's orbit could vary significantly, changing how close it is to the sun . The gravity of Jupiter is 2.5 times greater than Earth's. In the 1990s, its force tore apart Comet P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 and pulled the broken pieces into the planet. The gravity of Jupiter affects every planet to some degree. It is strong enough to tear asteroids apart and capture 64 moons. Some scientist think Jupiter destroyed many celestial objects in the ancient past as well as prevented other planets from forming. Astronomers have long believed that the gas giant’s gravity helps deflect comets and asteroids that would otherwise hit our planet . The scientists also moved the entire orbit of Jupiter inwards and outwards to test what would have happened if the planet had formed closer to the sun, or further away. Each simulation was taken through a million year time frame, recording where Earth would have been every 100 years as a result of Jupiter’s position. ‘The default assumption is this is something that is important,’ said Jonti Horner, an astronomer and astrobiologist at the University of Southern Queensland. ‘There's a lot of flexibility where Jupiter will be, and you would assume that you'd have a very smooth, very gentle variation in how the Earth's orbit behaves over time.’ While Jupiter's locations resulted in little change in Earth's orbit and tilt, the effect on Earth's climate remained unclear. However, a previous study by the same research group found that Jupiter's position has a striking influence on Earth's climate. The team now hope to go back to the earlier work to resolve the discrepancy. By understanding how gas giants affect the climate on other worlds, researchers hope they can better narrow the search for other habitable planets outside the solar system.","Jupiter’s gravity is capable of pulling on other planets in the solar system .

"By . Mark Prigg . Google is to sell its controversial eyewear to the public for the first time on April 15th. The firm will offer the 'explorer edition', the $1500 test version of the eyewear, for general sale for the first time. It is believed the firm wants to increase the number of people people using the hardware - and potentially clear its inventory for the 'real' consumer version. Scroll down for video . Next generation: Google Glass has revealed the new look of its high-tech device . 'Next Tuesday, April 15th at 6am PDT, we’re opening up some spots in the Glass Explorer Program. 'Any adult in the US can become an Explorer by visiting our site and purchasing Glass for $1500 + tax – and it now comes with your favorite shade or frame, thanks to feedback from our current Explorers. 'The number of spots available is limited, so mark your calendar if you want to get in.' Buyers can visit http://google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one to buy glass. source: Google . According to documents obtained by The Verge, only US residents will be eligible to purchase the $1,500 device - which Google later confirmed to MailOnline. 'Whoops. So... we’d planned to post this next week, but it looks like the cat's out of the bag now,' the firm said. 'Over the past several months, we’ve been trying out different ways to expand the Explorer program. 'Our Explorers are moms, bakers, surgeons, rockers, and each new Explorer has brought a new perspective that is making Glass better. 'But every day we get requests from those of you who haven’t found a way into the program yet, and we want your feedback too. 'So in typical Explorer Program fashion, we’re trying something new. ' Next Tuesday, April 15th at 6am PDT, the firm will allow anyone in the US to buy them. 'The number of spots available is limited, so mark your calendar if you want to get in,' the firm said. Google will also include a free sunglass shade or one of its newly-introduced prescription glasses frames along with any purchase. Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device. With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  were able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme. Reaction to the new design was mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky. Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames. The secret document obtained by The Verge that reveals the plan . Stylish: The frames will be available in a range of colors and will work with prescription glasses . However, the updates were welcomed by those who have a first-generation device, with comments on its Google + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience. One owner, Dawn Martin, commented: 'My glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because I can't hear it well enough ... yay for updates/upgrades!' Improved: The slightly bulkier design comes with a detachable ear piece to improve commands . Upgrade: Big Bang Theory's Kunal Nayyar wearing the Google Glass at the Emmys in September. Those with the earlier design will be able to swap their old device for the new one . Another fan of the device, Jeremiah Townsend, commented: 'Can't wait ... now that we'll be able to use them with prescription glasses, they'll be glued to my face.'﻿ . Others however complained that the device was still not widely available. Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much. The guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year. 'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!' However, the Google Explorer program has been praised for using a clever marketing model where people buy a product at its developmental stage so they can contribute to shaping its design. 'In essence Google has crowdfunded Glass and has shown big business how crowdfunding can be done. In essence it is a giant kickstarter campaign in all but name,' according to Forbes. It estimated that Google would have earned about $50 million during the development phase as well as enhancing the desirability of the product.","Search giant preparing to offer 'explorer version' of Glass for 24 hours .

"By . Mark Prigg . Astronomers have spotted a rare picture of a nebula that looks uncannily like an engagement ring. Captured using using ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile spotted planetary nebula PN A66 33 was created when an aging star blew off its outer layers. The bubble is, by chance, aligned with a foreground star, and bears an uncanny resemblance to a diamond engagement ring. 'This cosmic gem is unusually symmetric, appearing to be almost circular on the sky,' said the European Space Agency, which revealed the image. Scroll down for video . This image, captured by ESO¿s Very Large Telescope (VLT), shows the remarkably round planetary nebula Abell 33, located roughly 2500 light-years from Earth. Being perfectly round is uncommon for these objects, say astronomers, usually something disturbs the symmetry and causes the planetary nebula to display irregular shapes. Most stars with masses similar to that of our Sun will end their lives as white dwarfs — small, very dense, and hot bodies that slowly cool down over billions of years. On the way to this final phase of their lives the stars throw their atmospheres out into the space and create planetary nebulae, colourful glowing clouds of gas surrounding the small, bright stellar relics.

'The strikingly bright star located along the rim of the nebula creates a beautiful illusion,' said Esa. 'This is just a chance alignment — the star, named HD 83535, lies in the foreground of the nebula, between Earth and Abell 33, in just the right place to make this view even more beautiful.

The remnant of Abell 33’s progenitor star, on its way to becoming a white dwarf, can be seen just slightly off-centre inside the nebula, visible as a tiny white pearl. This wide-field view shows the sky around the planetary nebula Abell 33, which appears as the ghostly blue circle near the centre of the picture. The bright orange star at the top is Iota Hydri, which is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. It is still bright — more luminous than our own Sun — and emits enough ultraviolet radiation to make the bubble of expelled atmosphere glow. Abell 33 is just one of the 86 objects included in astronomer George Abell's 1966 Abell Catalogue of Planetary Nebulae. Abell also scoured the skies for galaxy clusters, compiling the Abell Catalogue of over 4000 of these clusters in both the northern and southern hemispheres of the sky.","ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile captured nebula with star in front of it .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Dark matter is one of the holy grails of astrophysics - for decades scientists have been trying to work out exactly what this invisible matter is. It’s thought to make up the majority of the universe yet experts still do not understand what it is. A new study, however, using public data from Nasa’s Fermi space telescope might finally provide some answers. This false-colour image of the centre of our Milky Way reveals excess gamma ray emissions that could be the result of dark matter particles colliding . Assistant Professor Dan Hooper and his colleagues at the Fermi National Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, have been studying a signal at the heart of our Milky Way galaxy since 2009. Consisting of a haze of gamma rays - extremely high energy radiation - the scientists are now convinced that the signal was produced by dark matter particles crashing into each other. As they destroy one another, these release gamma rays into space, giving rise to a perceivable glow at the centre of the Milky Way. Similar detections in nearby dwarf galaxies, those smaller than our own, could further suggest the theory may be correct. Dark matter surrounds galaxies across the universe, and is invisible because it does not reflect light. It . cannot be seen directly with telescopes, but astronomers know it to be . out there because of the gravitational effects it has on the matter we . can see. The European Space Agency says: 'Shine a torch in a completely dark room, and you will see only what the torch illuminates. 'That does not mean that the room around you does not exist. 'Similarly we know dark matter exists but have never observed it directly.' Scientists are fairly sure it exists and . is crucial to the universe, but they do not know what it looks like or . where to find it. ‘This is the most compelling signal we’ve had for dark matter particles – ever,’ Hooper told New Scientist. To confirm their finding, the scientists had to rule out other possibilities for the signal, including the gamma rays being produced by a distant pulsar or rapidly spinning star. They found the gamma rays produced a sphere nearly 10,000 light-years wide around the galactic centre, ruling out the possibility of pulsars being the source. ‘That doesn’t rule out things that no one’s thought of yet,’ Hooper added. ‘But we’ve tried pretty hard to think of something without success.’ If their findings turn out to be correct, it poses some tough questions about dark matter. Previously, scientists had thought dark matter was made of a hypothetical particle known as a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). If dark matter is being produced and colliding at the centre of our galaxy, however, then it is much more likely to be a heavier particle. This would cast doubt on some of the previous evidence for dark matter we have from experiments on Earth. If the detection found by Professor Hooper and his team is shown to match similar signals at the heart of other galaxies, it will more strongly suggest their findings are correct. Hooper and his team used data from Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST), in orbit since 2008, to make their discovery . If other galaxies are found to have similar signals at their centres it could could confirm the findings .","Nasa’s Fermi telescope suggests dark matter may be at heart of Milky Way .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The submarine cable network is a complex structure that stretches for more than half a million miles beneath our oceans. Current maps of the network are complicated and hard to follow, so to simplify this behemoth, designers transformed it into a line and node graph that looks remarkably like London's iconic tube map. Using data taken from Cablemap.info, each country is plotted as a station, and the connecting lines are colour-coded based on which consortium owns that stretch of cable. Hover your mouse over the map below to explore the network . The Internet Tube Map, pictured, uses data taken from Cablemap.info and was created by the Oxford Internet Institute. Each station, or node, on the map represents a country, and all nodes within in the same country are combined into a single node . A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land-based stations. It is laid by specially designed ships that can carry thousands of miles of coiled cable in . their holds and can lay it as it travels across the ocean.

Traditionally the cables were owned by service providers, yet websites . have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks including Google and Facebook. The network carries almost 95 per cent of the internet we use every day. Any stations within the same country have been combined into a single node, and many short links were deliberately excluded to make the visualisation simpler.

A key on the right-hand side of the map reveals what the icons and colours mean. The centrality of each station was calculated using PageRank algorithm - an algorithm search engines use to highlight how authoritative a website is, for example. On the Internet Tube Map, this authority translates to regions where the network is most influenced by governments, or susceptible to weakness and disruption. In creating the map, researchers Mark Graham and Stefano De Sabata from the Oxford Internet Institute discovered the U.S. is the most connected country in the world, with cable landing at points along both coasts. The connecting lines are colour-coded based on which consortium owns that stretch of cable.

The city of Fortaleza in Brazil, and the town of Bude in Cornwall, are the most central single points in Latin America and Europe respectively, while Accra in Ghana dominates the Sub-Saharan African list. 'The importance of being central in the submarine fibre-optic cable network is twofold,' explained the researchers. 'On the one hand, internet users in central countries tend to have faster and cheaper connections to the Internet - there are no countries with low-cost Internet access that aren’t also relatively well-connected. 'But we’ve also seen how certain central countries in the network have a history of engaging in surveillance of onternet traffic: as revealed by Edward Snowden and described by the Guardian and the Washington Post, for both internal and foreign surveillance.'

"By . Associated Press . and Ellie Zolfagharifard . At London's Royal Free hospital, scientists are growing noses, ears and blood vessels in the laboratory in a bold attempt to make body parts using stem cells. It is among several labs around the world, including in the U.S., that are working on the futuristic idea of growing custom-made organs in the lab. Only a handful of patients have received the British lab-made organs so far - including tear ducts, blood vessels and windpipes. But researchers hope they will soon be able to transplant more types of body parts into patients, including what would be the world's first nose made partly from stem cells. Scroll down for video . Last year Professor Alexander Seifalian (pictured) made a nose for a man who lost his to cancer. Scientists added a solution to the mould of the nose to mimic the sponge-like texture of the real thing. Stem cells were taken from the patient's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks before being used to cover the scaffold . 'It's like making a cake,' said Professor Alexander Seifalian at University College London, the scientist leading the effort. 'We just use a different kind of oven.' During a recent visit to his lab, Professor Seifalian showed off a sophisticated machine used to make moulds from a polymer material for various organs. Last year, he and his team made a nose for a British man who lost his to cancer. Scientists added a salt and sugar solution to the mould of the nose to mimic the somewhat sponge-like texture of the real thing. Stem cells were taken from the patient's fat and grown in the lab for two weeks before being used to cover the nose scaffold. Later, the nose was implanted into the man's forearm so that skin would grow to cover it. Dr Michelle Griffin (pictured) said ears are harder to make than noses because you have to get all the contours right and the skin is pulled tight so you see its entire structure. She is a plastic surgeon who has made dozens of ears and noses in Professor Seifalian's lab . Professor Seifalian said he and his team are waiting for approval from regulatory authorities to transfer the nose onto the patient's face but couldn't say when that might happen. The potential applications of lab-made organs appear so promising even the City of London is getting involved: Professor Seifalian's work is being showcased on Tuesday as Mayor Boris Johnson announces a new initiative to attract investment to Britain's health and science sectors. A British businessman who lost his nose to cancer is growing a new one – in his arm. If all goes well it will eventually be removed and sewn on to his face, with experts at University College London hoping he will have feeling and a sense of smell. The new nose, the first in the world to be grown from scratch, will also look just like the 56-year-old man’s old one – slightly crooked. UCL scientist Professor Alexander Seifalian, who is behind the pioneering treatment, said: ‘His nose was a little bit bent to the left and we asked if he wanted it straight but he said no, he wanted it exactly the same.’ The new nose began as a glass mould, based on the original, which was sprayed with a synthetic honeycomb-like material to create a framework for stem cells to cling to. The mould was then removed and the honey- comb covered with millions of these ‘blank cells’ which, with the right nutrients, can turn into the cartilage of the nose – a process which took place at UCL in a rotating jar called a bioreactor. Meanwhile, the skin on the man’s arm was gradually stretched by a small balloon placed under the surface and inflated until it was loose enough to accommodate the nose. Professor Alex Seifalian hopes to eventually grow a whole face in the lab and says procedure could help car crash victims and wounded soldiers. A synthetic polymer nose, left, and ear are shown at a research facility in the Royal Free Hospital in London . The polymer material used for his organ scaffolds has been patented and Professor Seifalian has also applied for patents for their blood vessels, tear ducts and windpipe. He and his team are creating other organs including coronary arteries and ears. Later this year, a trial is scheduled to start in India and London to test lab-made ears for people born without them. 'Ears are harder to make than noses because you have to get all the contours right and the skin is pulled tight so you see its entire structure,' said Dr Michelle Griffin, a plastic surgeon who has made dozens of ears and noses in Professor Seifalian's lab. Dr Michelle Griffin, a plastic research fellow, demonstrates seeding stem cells onto a synthetic polymer ear . Professor Alexander Seifalian described the process by saying: 'It's like making a cake. We just use a different kind of oven.' here he is pictured with the advanced 'oven' with an artificial windpipe inside it . The . new body part begins as a glass mould, based on the original, which is . sprayed with a synthetic honeycomb-like material to create a framework . for stem cells to cling to. The . mould is then removed and the honey- comb covered with millions of ‘blank cells’ which, with the right nutrients, can turn into the . cartilage of the organ. Meanwhile, . the skin on another area of the body is gradually stretched by a small balloon . placed under the surface and inflated until it is loose enough to . accommodate the organ. After several months, the body part is taken out from under the skin and sewn into the right place. 'At the moment, children who need new ears have to go through a really invasive procedure involving taking cartilage from their ribs,' Dr Griffin said. She added that taking fat cells from patients' abdomens to add to a lab-made ear scaffold would be far easier than the multiple procedures often necessary to carve an ear from their ribs. Dr Griffin said they plan to eventually create an entirely synthetic face but must first prove their polymer scaffolds won't accidentally burst out of the skin. 'Scientists have to get things like noses and ears right before we can move onto something like a kidney, lungs or a liver, which is much more complicated,' said Eileen Gentleman, a stem cell expert at King's College London, who is not involved in Seifalian's research. Professor Alexander Seifalian in his office at his research facility in the Royal Free Hospital in north London . 'Where Seifalian has led is in showing us maybe we don't need to have the absolutely perfect tissue for a (lab-made) organ to work,' she said. 'What he has created is the correct structure and the fact that it's good enough for his patients to have a functional (windpipe), tear duct, etc. is pretty amazing.' Some scientists predicted certain lab-made organs will soon cease to be experimental. 'I'm convinced engineered organs are going to be on the market soon,' said Suchitra Sumitran-Holgersson, a professor of transplantation biology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. She has transferred lab-made blood vessels into a handful of patients and plans to offer them more widely by 2016, pending regulatory approval. Still, she acknowledged doctors will have to watch closely for any long-term side effects, including the possibility of a higher cancer risk. Professor Seifalian estimated about £10 million ($16 million) has gone into his research since 2005 but said he hoped lab-made organs would one day be available for a few hundred dollars. 'If people are not that fussy, we could manufacture different sizes of noses so the surgeon could choose a size and tailor it for patients before implanting it,' he said. 'People think your nose is very individual and personal but this is something that we could mass produce like in a factory one day.'","London's Royal Free hospital is among several in the .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Many scientific discoveries  - especially those made in relation to our vast universe - are immediately heralded as amazing. But two astronomers have admitted they find the universe 'disappointing' after discovering it is smoother and flatter than first thought and have even compared it to an underwhelming holiday. Nonetheless, their research challenges the widely accepted cosmological model of the universe and could lead to a rethink of what it is made of and how it evolved into the stars and galaxies we see today. Two astronomers have admitted they find the universe disappointing after discovering it is smoother and flatter than first thought. They studied distribution of hot gas associated with galaxy clusters in two supercomputer simulations with different cosmological models (pictured) Astronomers Professor Chris Collins and Dr Ian McCarthy from Liverpool John Moores University were comparing recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation and galaxy clusters in two independent studies when they found the universe is flatter and smoother than previously thought. Professor Collins said: ‘Have you ever booked a holiday to Switzerland expecting to trek the Alpine mountain ranges only to be disappointed  by ending up walking the flat countryside of Holland? ‘Similar disappointment was felt when Dr McCarthy and I conducted an experiment to measure the number of large massive clumps in the Universe, called clusters of galaxies.’ He explained that in some ways the findings were ‘a discouragement’ but they persevered anyway. ‘Science is at its most interesting when prediction and experiment disagree and so although our cosmic landscape is smoother than we thought, this may mean we need to re-think bits of our cosmological theory and such progress is good for science in the long run. ‘Although the perceived wisdom was that we would find lots of big clusters, in fact, when we looked, the Universe did not live up to our expectation and we found far fewer of these really huge structures than expected.’ Sorry Switzerland! Professor Collins compared the discovery to an underwhelming holiday in the Swiss Alps (pictured). 'Similar disappointment was felt when Dr McCarthy and I conducted an experiment to measure the number of large massive clumps in the Universe, called clusters of galaxies,' he said . Cosmic background radiation is at the heart of the Big Bang theory of how the Universe was formed. In 1965 scientists discovered the electro-magnetic waves that bombard the Earth continuously from all directions at harmless microwave frequencies. The radiation that arrives at our planet has been cooled to only 2.7°C above absolute zero as it traverses deep space as the universe expands, meaning that in the distant past the temperature would have been much hotter. This led scientists to conclude that the universe had a hot origin – the so-called Big Bang – nearly 14 billion years ago. To measure the temperature variations in the cosmic background radiation, the Planck Surveyor satellite was launched in 2009 by the European Space Agency (Esa). It found that the tiny fluctuations in temperature slowly grow over time, eventually forming the stars and galaxies we see today. Cosmic background radiation is at the heart of the Big Bang theory of how the Universe was formed . Because the radiation began its journey when the universe was only 380,000 years old, these measurements provide vital information about its composition. The cosmic census provided by Planck is remarkably precise, giving scientists accurate estimates of the age of the universe – which is thought to be 13.82 billion years old - and the amount of dark matter and dark energy. The universe is thought to be almost 32 per cent dark matter and 68 per cent dark energy. Interestingly, it has been found that Planck is also sensitive to the largest gravitationally bound structures called clusters, which contain thousands of individual galaxies and large amounts of dark matter. And it has found fewer clusters than predicted based on the cosmic background radiation cosmological analysis. Professor Collins and Dr McCarthy’s studies confirm the ‘Planck-cluster problem’ which says that there are many fewer massive clusters in the universe than expected. ‘We already knew that the number of clusters found by the satellite was lower than expected and we have now tested this by analysing a new carefully constructed independent survey of some 1,000 clusters over a large area of the sky using X-rays rather than microwave radiation,’ Professor Collins explained. ‘Our findings confirm that the number of clusters is about a factor of two below the prediction based on the Planck cosmic background radiation analysis.’ In a separate study, Dr McCarthy and his PhD student Amandine Le Brun examined the detailed statistical properties of the cosmic background radiation and arrived at the same conclusion.

Dr McCarthy said: ‘We’ve taken a completely different approach to previous studies, by comparing the predictions of state-of-the-art supercomputer simulations with the results of sophisticated statistical analyses of the cosmic background radiation. ‘The comparison itself is quite straightforward and avoids any potential issues having to do with identifying clusters and measuring their masses.’ The discrepancy in the predicted and observed number of massive clusters strongly suggests that either the detailed survey by Planck is not correct, or else that the model itself is flawed in some way. If the model is flawed, one exciting possibility is that the deficit of galaxy clusters is pointing to an important contribution to the energy budget – or composition - of the Universe by massive neutrinos, which are ghostly particles that weakly interact with normal matter. Particle physicists have long argued that neutrinos may have non-zero mass, but laboratory experiments have only managed to place relatively weak bounds on what the size of the mass is. Dr McCarthy plans on carrying out large-scale simulations that include the effects of massive neutrinos on cluster formation.","Astronomers studied the distribution of hot gas associated with galaxy clusters to come to their conclusion .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . Cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C. hit peak bloom on Thursday - serving as a clear sign of spring after a dreary winter. The flowers were photographed in peak bloom near monuments in the city's Tidal Basin, including both the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial. The National Park Service said that the flowers reached peak bloom on Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Peak bloom, the wire service says, is when 'at least 70 percent of the trees around the Tidal Basin are blossoming with pink and white flowers.' It adds that the timing coincided with the National Cherry Blossom Festival. The festival, held every spring, is used as a reminder of when 3,000 cherry trees were given to the United States by Japan in 1912 as a gesture of friendship, according to its website. Washington, D.C. was extremely crowded over the weekend, WJLA notes, going by the number of rides taken through the city's Capital Bikeshare program.  The channel says 11,551 rides were taken on Friday and 15, 746 riders were taken on Saturday, when the Cherry Blossom Parade took place. On Sunday, D.C. resident Michelle Zador told WJLA she thought it was the most crowded she's seen the city in 25 years. 'The lines have been long, it's been frantic here, we had to walk about half a mile just to find a place to get water,' she said. Scroll down for video .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . For centuries the Church has largely depicted the crucifixion of Christ with his arms outstretched horizontally on a cross. But scientists believe that death by crucifixion may have been even crueller, and that a victim’s arms were probably nailed above their head. An international team studying the Shroud of Turin, which appears to depict a man who was put to death by crucifixion, said that no matter who created it, the artefact suggests that the practice involved a victim who was suspended in a Y-shape. Scroll down for video . Unshrouded? An international team of scientists studying the Shroud of Turin (pictured), which appears to depict a man who was put to death by crucifixion, said that whoever created it suggests that the practice involved a victim being suspended in a Y-shape. They came to this conclusion after studying lines of 'blood' down the arms, which can be seen in this image . The Shroud is a 14ft (4.3 metre) long piece of linen that appears to show the faint imprint of a man bearing wounds consistent with crucifixion. Some people believe it shows the image of Jesus of Nazareth, while others think it is a medieval forgery of cloth wrapped around a body after crucifixion. The Shroud is the most studied artefact in human history but its age remains in dispute. Radiocarbon dating of the cloth carried out by the University of Oxford in 1998 found it was only 728 years old. But a recent study claims that an earthquake in Jerusalem in 33AD that could have created the image and skewed dating results. Professor Alberto Carpinteri, from the Politecnico di Torino, said: 'We believe it is possible that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image formation on the Shroud's linen fibres, through thermal neutron capture on nitrogen nuclei, and could also have caused a wrong radiocarbon dating,' The Telegraph reported. The Shroud has attracted widespread interest ever since Secondo Pia took the first photograph of it in 1898 which showed details which could not be seen by the naked eye. The Vatican has never said whether it believes the shroud to be authentic. The Shroud of Turin is the most studied artefact in history and opinion is divided as to whether it was created in medieval times as a kind of hoax or whether it really shows the face of Jesus of Nazareth, as some believe. Whatever the case, the linen cloth, which is imprinted with the faint image of a naked man, seems to show lines of blood that have streamed down his arms as well as other wounds. Regardless of whether the Shroud is Biblical or medieval, Matteo Borrini at Liverpool John Moores University told New Scientist that ‘it’s a very interesting piece of art and human ingenuity’. He set out to find whether the ‘bloodstains’ on the left arm matched up with the flow of blood from a crucified person. To investigate, another researcher from . the University of Pavia, Italy, assumed different crucifixion poses . while donated blood trickled down his arm from a place where the shroud . shows a nail was hammered through the hand. The duo found that the ‘blood’ marks on . the shroud correspond to a crucifixion – but only if a person was nailed . onto a cross in a ‘Y’ position instead of a ‘T’ position, as depicted . in most Christian art. The scientists set out to find whether the 'bloodstains' on the Turin Shroud flow of blood from a crucified person.  By safely simulating different positions of crucifixion they worked out that the man wrapped in the legendary cloth must have been crucified in a Y-shape position, pictured right . The majority of Christian art shows Jesus stretched into a T-shaped position on the cross, such as this famous painting by Andrea Mantegna, which is housed in Musee du Louvre, Paris . Some artists have chosen to represent Jesus on the cross with his hands nailed above his head, such Jacob Jordaens' Crucificon scene (pictured left)  which was painted in the 17th Century, with other artists choosing to show Christ's arms in a shallow V-shape, like Diego Velazquez's image painted at around the same time . Dr Borrini said: ‘This would have been a very painful position and one which would have created difficulty breathing.’ It is thought that someone crucified in a ‘Y’ position would have died from asphyxiation. The imprint on the Shroud does not correspond with many traditional artistic images of crucifixion but Peter Paul Reubens - a 16th century Flemish painter - shows Jesus crucified in a Y-shape. His painting, 'Descent from the Cross' is pictured . He explained to a February meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in Seattle that similar positions were used in medieval torture, where victims were suspended from a beam from their wrists, which were tied with rope. So if the Shroud is indeed a medieval forgery, it may be an interpretation of contemporary practice, rather than that of Biblical times. The results of the experiment back up earlier work by a Massachusetts-based doctor called Gilbert Lavoie who suggested that the person depicted in the shroud was crucified in a Y-shape. In his study, Dr Lavoie said: ‘The blood-flow is absolutely consistent with what you see on the Shroud.' Danish doctor Niels Svensson, who has studied the Shroud, said: ‘The imprint on the Shroud does not correspond with many traditional artistic images of crucifixion.’ While the majority of Christian art shows Jesus stretched into a T-shaped position on the cross, some painters, including Peter Paul Rubens, depicted Christ with his arms above his head on the cross. Dr Borrini believes that the person who made the shroud must have been a skilled forger (if it is not 'real') to show the correct blood spatter for a crucifixion – or they stumbled across it by chance. ‘It could be that the artist just decided to draw the rivulets of blood parallel to the arms for artistic reasons,’ he said. In Roman times there was a common way to put people on the cross, Matteo Borrini told MailOnline. ‘The vertical stake was fixed to the soil in an area usually devoted to capital punishments, while the horizontal branch, called the patibulum, was carried on by the person who was to be crucified.’ ‘Theoretically this was the rule, but Roman historian Josephus (Giuseppe Flavio) reported how in  the war against Gerusalem  in 70 AD,Roman soldiers enjoyed crucifying prisoners on trees in the most painful and strange positions.’ Dr Borrini explained that there are only short passages of writing from ancient authors about crucifixion, probably because the technique was a well-known way to sentence someone to death – ‘but it was also a very infamous way to die.’ Dr Frederick Zugibe conducted ‘extensive suspension studies’ that explained the higher the upper limbs are, more painful the ‘Y’ position is. Dr Borrini said: ‘We can imagine that it became more difficult for the subject to breath, but this problem could be avoided or partially reduced allowing the prisoner to have a rest thanks to the sedile - a small step behind his pelvis - that could be used as a sort of chair. ‘We have some reports of cruciarii (victim of crucifixion) that stayed on the cross for some days and this could be related to the use of the sedile,’ he said. The reason for the procedure was likely not merciful but designed to prolong the pain of the victim and their exposure to the sun, as well as their humiliation ‘partially starving him but also creating muscular pain to him due to the uncomfortable position of upper and lower limbs’. If authorities wanted the victim’s death to be quicker, they might have positioned them in a high ‘Y’ position and broken their legs, which would have increased breathing difficulty and accelerated death, Dr Borrini explained. Dr Zugibe said in his research that this approach was a way to create a fatal shock in the prisoner. Brutal: In the experiment, a researcher from the University of Pavia, Italy, assumed different crucifixion poses while donated blood trickled down his arm from a place where the Shroud shows a nail was hammered through the man's hand (pictured)","The Shroud of Turin, which appears to show crucified man, suggests that the victim was suspended from a cross in a Y-shape, scientists claim .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It’s long been known that carbon dioxide is absorbed by the land and oceans. However, the rate at which the gas is absorbed is thought to be much lower than what humans pump into the atmosphere. Now a 10-year study suggests the figure may be slightly higher than previously thought – but it is still not enough to save us from disaster, experts claim. Deserts could absorb CO2 at a faster rate in the future but it will not be enough to save us from climate change, according to a new study . The findings are the result of an experiment performed in the Mojave Desert in southern Nevada. In the study, nine separate desert plots were exposed to different levels of carbon dioxide over a decade. Three received no extra air, three were pumped with the modern level of carbon dioxide - 380 parts per million - and three received concentrations of the level expected in 2050, 550 parts per million. Perhaps somewhat expectedly, the plots that were exposed to more carbon dioxide accumulated it at a faster rate than the plots that were not. While the findings indicate that arid ecosystems can serve as sinks for carbon dioxide, the ramifications of the findings do not alter the need to tackle climate change. ‘It is definitely not going to stop it,’ lead author of the study Dave Evans from Washington State University told NBC News. ‘Just now we are understanding the processes that are going on. ‘But we are still seeing huge amounts of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere.’ A recent report by the IPCC suggests the future effects of climate change could be catastrophic . Analysis of the data suggests that deserts could account for 15 to 28 per cent of carbon absorbed by land surfaces. But this would still be only four to eight per cent of total carbon dioxide emissions in the future. Christopher Field, lead author of a new Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC), said it was not entirely clear how to interpret the results. ‘It is worth noting that, although the sink in this experiment is significant, it is about a hundredfold less than typical sinks in young forested ecoysystems,’ he says. ‘The bottom line is that deserts will not save us from climate change.’ Food shortages are expected to get worse . The report claims that increases in crop yields have slowed over the last 40 years. Some studies now point to dramatic declines in some crops over the next 50 years – especially wheat and corn. Violent conflict may be triggered as a result . Climate . change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, . such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees. Fights over resources, like water and energy, hunger and extreme weather will all go into the mix to destabilise the world. The gap between the rich and the poor could widen . Poor people are going to bear an unfair burden of climate change, the report said. Climate . change is going to exacerbate existing inequalities, and it is going to . make it harder for people to fight their way out of poverty. Everyone will be affected . This, the report claims, is because there are limits to how far society can adapt to climate change. The . only way to cut emissions is to act now and at the same time make plans . to keep people out of harms' way when extreme weather strikes. Mitigating climate change is tough but achievable . The report notes that research on the effects of climate change has doubled since the last report in 2007. The understanding about what needs to done to protect people from severe consequences has also improved dramatically.","Scientists have completed a 10-year CO2 study in the Mojave Desert .

"By . Emma Glanfield . The UK’s only female giant panda has been artificially inseminated after she and her intended partner failed to mate naturally. Edinburgh Zoo bosses were hopeful that Tian Tian would mate with male Yang Guang this year, but moved on to artificial insemination after her hormone levels started to fall quickly. The procedure was carried out on Sunday using samples from Yang Guang. Scroll down for video . Edinburgh Zoo bosses were hopeful that Tian Tian, pictured, would mate with male Yang Guang this year, but moved on to artificial insemination after her hormone levels started to fall quickly . Experts will not know for certain whether Tian Tian is pregnant until she gives birth, which could be in August or September . Experts said they will not know for certain whether Tian Tian is pregnant until she gives birth, which could be in August or September. Their hopes of a pregnancy follow last year’s disappointment when the pair did not mate. Although Tian Tian was artificially inseminated, she lost her foetus at late term. Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), said: ‘From the start, when the pandas started to show breeding behaviour early this spring, both were showing very positive signs. ‘We were hopeful natural mating would occur this year, but in the end Tian Tian’s hormones started to fall quickly, which meant her breeding window could be much shorter. ‘Although our Chinese expert Dr Wang Chengdong, from the China Conservation and Research Centre for Giant Pandas (CCRCGP), was confident the pair would mate naturally, after the first unsuccessful introduction attempt, time restrictions meant we needed to move quickly to artificial insemination. Zoo bosses' hopes of a pregnancy follow last year's disappointment when the pair did not mate. Although Tian Tian was artificially inseminated, she lost her foetus at late term . The zoo said both pandas recovered well from the artificial insemination and were up and about soon afterwards, with Yang Guang enjoying honey and bamboo 15 minutes later . ‘The artificial insemination procedure was undertaken by reproduction specialists Professor Dr Thomas Hildebrandt, Dr Frank Goeritz and Dr Robert Hermes, from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) in Berlin, along with RZSS’s veterinary and panda teams.’ Experts at Edinburgh Zoo monitored Tian Tian’s hormones to establish when she would enter her brief fertile period. They also watched her behaviour closely to gauge when her 36-hour breeding window would begin. The zoo said both pandas recovered well from the artificial insemination and were up and about soon afterwards, with Yang Guang enjoying honey and bamboo 15 minutes later. Mr Valentine said: ‘The panda enclosure will remain closed to the public until Wednesday, but both pandas have been out and about, are eating well and are in good health. ‘As giant pandas experience pseudo pregnancies and delayed implantation, it is very likely we will not 100% know if Tian Tian is pregnant until she gives birth. This is usually August to September but can continue much later, as we saw last year.’ Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland said: 'The panda enclosure will remain closed to the public until Wednesday, but both pandas have been out and about, are eating well and are in good health' The pandas, now both aged 10, arrived on loan from China in December 2011 and will remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade . Tian Tian, also known as Sweetie, and Yang Guang, also called Sunshine, are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years. The pair, now both aged 10, arrived on loan from China in December 2011 and will remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade. The zoo said the panda breeding programme can play an important role in conservation.Chris West, chief executive of the RZSS, said: ‘As a conservation organisation, we believe giant pandas are too important a species to be allowed to become extinct. ‘Although the breeding window is incredibly brief, pandas are in actual fact not poor breeders. They existed on the planet for many millennia before man intervened and deforestation caused the increasing fragmentation of populations. ‘As a result of a partnership with the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA), a non-profit national organisation dedicated to giant panda conservation and the largest conservation organisation in China, we are bringing our skills in genetics and animal husbandry to ensure a genetically healthy and diverse population exists ex-situ, as well as in the wild.’ He added: ‘If we can successfully assist Tian Tian and Yang Guang to breed, we will be adding to the total number of pandas in zoos around the world and in breeding centres in China. The artificially insemination procedure was carried out on Tian Tian on Sunday at the zoo using samples from Yang Guang, pictured . Hopes of a pregnancy follow last year's disappointment when the pair did not mate. Although Tian Tian was artificially inseminated, she lost her foetus at late term . ‘The more there are, the greater and more diverse the gene pool is from which pandas can be selected for re-introduction.’ The panda gestation period is typically five months and one or two cubs will be born. They enter the world blind, hairless and unable to move - making them entirely dependent on their mother for survival for their first weeks.

"By . Mark Prigg . The solar powered plane that is set to try and fly around the world without using fuel next year has been unveiled. Pilots Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg said the Solar Impulse 2 improves dramatically upon the single-seater prototype that first took flight five years ago. They say the technology has advanced so much the new design could remain in the air indefinitely. Scroll down for video . t 72 meters (236 feets) its wingspan is eight meters longer than the first prototype - longer even than the wings of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet - but still only weights 2.3 metric tons (2.54 tons), about as much as a large car . 72 meters (236 feets) wingspan . Eight meters longer than the first prototype and longer even than the wings of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet . Weighs 2.3 metric tons (2.54 tons), about as much as a large car . 7,200 solar cells that cover its massive wings . During the day, they charge batteries, allowing the plane to fly through the night . The updated plane presented to the world at the Payerne Air Force Base in Switzerland has better batteries for storing energy soaked up from the sun by the 7,200 solar cells that cover its massive wings. The Swiss team planning to complete the first round-the-world solar flight next year have already demonstrated that a solar-powered plane can fly through the night, between two continents and across the United States. At 72 meters (236 feets) its wingspan is eight meters longer than the first prototype - longer even than the wings of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet - but still only weights 2.3 metric tons (2.54 tons), about as much as a large car. The materials in the updated plane are also lighter than before, it has more efficient electric motors, and a 'good business class seat,' Borschberg said. Because while the journey will be broken up into several stages, the aircraft's slow speed means it will have to stay in the air for several days in a row during the long transoceanic legs. 80 companies contributed cutting-edge technologies to the plane, which is meant to showcase the possibility of using cleaner energy sources. Borschberg said the trip next year would take about 20 flying days, spread over several months. How it works: The developers worked with over 80 hi-tech firms to develop the craft . Solar Impulse is the product of an alliance between two men to fulfill a project deemed impossible by industry experts. While Bertrand Piccard, a psychiatrist and explorer, sourced partners to finance the project and promoted the cause for clean technologies (subsequently endorsed by many political authorities), engineer and entrepreneur André Borschberg brought together and led a technical team of 80. It has taken 12 years of calculations, simulations, construction and testing to arrive at today’s launch of Solar Impulse 2 – the most revolutionary aircraft of out of time, set to fly around the world. The round the world trip, planned for next year would take about 20 flying days, spread over several months. The attempt to make the first round-the-world solar-powered flight is scheduled to start in March 2015 from Gulf area. Solar Impulse will fly, in order, over the Arabian Sea, India, Burma, China, the Pacific Ocean, the United States, the Atlantic Ocean and Southern Europe or North Africa before closing the loop by returning to the departure point. Landings will be made every few days to change pilots and organize public events for governments, schools and universities. 'A vision counts for nothing unless it is backed up by action,' said Bertrand Piccard, founder and Chairman of Solar Impulse. 'With 8 world records for Solar Impulse 1, the first solar aircraft capable of flying during the night, crossing two continents and flying over the United States, we have shown that clean technologies and renewable energies can accomplish the impossible,' 'Now we need to go even further,' added André Borschberg, co-founder and CEO. 'Solar Impulse 2 will have virtually unlimited autonomy, and now we need to make sure the pilot is as sustainable as his aircraft. 'This is why the round-the-world flight will be as much a human as a technological feat.' To complete the round-the-world flight, Solar Impulse 2 will have to accomplish what no other aircraft has achieved before: flying without fuel with only one pilot for 5 consecutive days and nights over oceans from one continent to another. This is the challenge for which the aircraft has been built. There is a 3.8 m3 cockpit, every detail of which has been designed for a pilot to live there for a week. H . However, for the sake of maximum energy efficiency, the cabin is not pressurized or heated – a further endurance challenge for the pilot. Test flights are due to take place in May, followed by training flights over Switzerland. People look at the second Solar Impulse experimental solar-powered plane, the HB-SIB, to be used for a round-the-world voyage next year, during its presentation in Payerne on April 9, 2014. The pilots admitted on improvement since the prototypes was a 'business class' seat for the pilots. The huge aircraft carries just two people, but has a larger wingspan than a Boeing 747 .","7,200 solar cells cover its massive wings .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Mexican authorities are investigating the death of at least 300 stingrays found on a beach of the Gulf coast state of Veracruz. Residents and visitors first spotted the dead rays on Tuesday on the Chachalacas beach in the town of Ursulo Galvan and posted photos on social media. Ursulo Galvan Mayor Martin Verdejo says it's possible the stingrays could have been abandoned by fishermen after being trapped in their nets. Stranded: Up to 300 stingrays have been found washed up on a beach in Mexico in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz . Beached: Stingray carcasses litter the shore of the Chachalacas beach near the town of Ursulo Galvan on Mexico's Gulf Coast . Upon realizing they were unlikely make much profit from their sale, they simply emptied their nets along the beach. Others say the dead came rays were washed ashore by the waves at sunrise. Beachgoers say it appears that many of the rays fins were cut and it is believed that fishermen sold the parts of the fish they were able to sell and then simply left the remnants. Food vendor Adriana Loredo says she was at the beach when she saw fishermen dumping the rays from their nets. Chopped stingray wings are commonly served as snacks in Veracruz restaurants. Delicacy: Chopped stingray wings are commonly served as snacks in Veracruz restaurants . Mystery: Beachgoers say that fisherman dumped the carcasses overnight whilst others say they simply washed ashore. Although dead, the can still pose a hazard to those walking barefoot as their stings are extremely painful if stepped upon . Whilst the stingrays remain on the beach, they remain a danger to tourists, as although they are dead, their stings remain potent, which although not poisonous, are extremely painful. This is not the first time large numbers of rays are found stranded, even though this one appears to have an explanation. In February this year, a reported 220 Mobula Rays were mysteriously washed up on the beach in Gaza City, Palestine. The Mobula Ray  are of a similar appearance to the more well-known Manta Rays, which are in the same family, and can reach a width of up to 17ft and can weigh more than 12 stone. According to Bob Rubin, one of the world's leading expert on Rays of Santa Rosa Junior College in California, the  mass stranding could have been caused by large underwater noises or electrical signals which may have caused some state of disorientation .","The stingrays were found on a beach in Veracruz, Mexico .

"By . James Chapman . and Tamara Cohen . The historic Special Relationship between the UK and the US is under ‘some strain’ following last night’s Government defeat, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned. If the US goes ahead with planned strikes on Damascus, it will have to turn to France and other allies for support - even though David Cameron has been instrumental in persuading Barack Obama to act. For months, the Prime Minister and other senior members of the Government have been putting pressure on the US administration to do more over Syria.

Blast: People inspect the damage at a site hit by what activists say was a car bomb in Raqqa province, Syria . Mr Cameron told President Obama he was ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with the US when the two spoke last weekend.

Serious concern: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he did not expect the US to change its plans to go ahead with strikes . Mr Hammond said he did not expect the US to change its plans to go ahead with strikes. He also expressed serious concern about what the vote would mean for Britain on the world stage. He said: ‘I do have a concern about what this says, what we are saying about ourselves. ‘We have to ask ourselves the question “do we want to be the type of nation to properly act to uphold the international system, the rule of international law, the system that benefits us as an open, democratic, trading nation, or will we turn our backs and leave that to others?”.

And a diplomat said: ‘The Americans are livid with us’, adding that Mr Cameron appeared to have made an ‘enormous miscalculation’. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell also expressed concern, saying US lawmakers would be less sympathetic to upholding aspects of the Special Relationship such as intelligence sharing, missile sharing and free trade. He said: ‘If you’re a congressman in the United States asked to be sympathetic towards these things, in the light of tonight’s decision what do you think your reaction would be?’ Washington analysts also said last night’s vote could damage the Special Relationship.

Robin Wright, of the US Institute for Peace called losing British support a ‘terrible setback’, adding: ‘This has bigger implications about the nature of the relationship between the United States and its biggest ally.’ The Government is now under pressure to confirm that the US would not be allowed to use British air bases to launch attacks on Syria as compensation for our failure to be involved directly.","US will need support from other allies if going ahead with planned strikes .

"By . Helen Pow . A great-grandmother from Kips Bay tragically died after Hurricane Sandy cut power to her oxygen machine and her backup tank sprang a leak. Herminia St. John, 75, survived a dangerous storm decades ago in her native Panama when she was hit in the leg by a piece of flying metal, but on Monday evening she wasn't so lucky. The woman, who family and friends described as having a 'backbone of iron', was bedridden and on oxygen in the 33-story apartment building at East 26th Street and 2nd Avenue when the storm struck. Rescue efforts: Elsa St. John, right, with a photograph of her mother Herminia, who she tried frantically to save on Monday evening . After the electricity cut out, her daughter Elsa St. John, 54, and her live-in aide turned on a backup oxygen tank but that soon sprung a leak, according to DNA Info, and the women, in the darkness, couldn't find the source to fix it. 'She called on me. She gave me a hug, a kiss,' said Elsa St. John told the news website, adding that she asked to be turned towards the window. 'She said her goodbyes, and she went,' Elsa said. Before she passed, her family frantically fought to save her but were unable to get through to 911 despite calling repeatedly. Panicked, her grandson Claudio St. John, 31, ran down 22 flights of stairs to nearby Bellevue Hospital searching for help. Great-grandmother: Herminia St. John left behind seven children, 14 great-grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, some of whom are pictured . He managed to convince two EMS workers at the hospital, already overwhelmed because of the hurricane, to follow him to his ailing grandmother's bedside. But when they arrived the staff did not have an oxygen tank and had to rush outside to get one. By the time they returned, at 10.30pm, they found Ms St John had died. 'It’s devastating to lose her with all the fighting,' neighbour Joann Davis, 57, told DNA Info. 'It’s totally unjust.' Still without power: Ms St. John died after power was cut off in her 33-story building during Hurricane Sandy. The building is still without power . St. John had moved to New York in the . 1960s as a young mother to take up a job as a housekeeper, enduring a . long separation from her seven young children. She later worked as a . cook, and slowly, as she earned enough money, she would bring out one . child at a time from Panama to join her in the U.S. until the entire . family were finally together. Over the years, the woman suffered diabetes, lung and heart problems and a stroke but always devoted herself to her growing family. 'She was one of those people with a backbone of iron,' family friend Marilyn Eiss, 47, who Ms St. John referred to as her 'white daughter' told DNA Info. Mourning: Family friends and relatives Bradley Blake, 58, left, Elsa St. John, 54, Cleopatra St. John, 24, mourn their beloved Herminia . 'Just like they always say, If you work hard you can achieve anything. And that’s what she did.'The family and friends sat around a red candle in Ms St. John's still pitch-black apartment on Wednesday, paying tribute to the woman they loved, while still 'shell-shocked' by her death. 'If I could have only got 911. If they could have only got here a little bit earlier,' Elsa St. John said.

"The number of adults and children using food banks has exceeded 900,000 for the first time according to new research. The Trussell Trust said that 913,000 people received at least three-days' emergency help over the past twelve months. Researchers claimed the 163 percent jump in people seeking assistance is due to rising living costs combined with low pay and problems over welfare payments. Scroll down for video . A volunteer prepares a vital food shipment for a needy family visiting a food bank for urgent supplies . Trussell Trust chairman Chris Mould said the numbers of people seeking help has almost tripled in twelve months . The Department of Work and Pensions said it spends £94 billion on working age benefits a year . The Trussell Trust said they now had more than 400 food banks across the UK with a further two opening every week . The Trussell Trust's chairman, Chris Mould, said: 'That 900,000 people have received three days' food from a food bank - close to triple the numbers helped last year - is shocking in 21st-century Britain. 'But, perhaps most worrying of all, this figure is just the tip of the iceberg of UK food poverty. It doesn't include those helped by other emergency food providers, those living in towns where there is no food bank, people who are too ashamed to seek help or the large number of people who are only just coping by eating less and buying cheap food. 'In the last year we've seen things get worse, rather than better, for many people on low incomes. It's been extremely tough for a lot of people, with parents not eating properly in order to feed their children and more people than ever experiencing seemingly unfair and harsh benefits sanctions. Campaigners claims that three new food banks are opening every week to cope with the number of people facing food shortages . He said: 'Unless there is determined policy action to ensure that the benefits of national economic recovery reach people on low incomes, we won't see life get better for the poorest any time soon. 'A more thoughtful approach to the administration of the benefits regime and sanctions in particular, increasing the minimum wage, introducing the living wage and looking at other measures such as social tariffs for essentials like energy would help to address the problem of UK hunger.' The trust said its food banks were now offering welfare advice and providing essentials such as washing powder, nappies and hygiene products to families at 'breaking point'. A letter signed by 36 Anglican bishops and more than 600 church leaders from all major dominations calls for urgent Government action to tackle food poverty. Campaigners claim the government is breaching the human rights of the poor by not giving them enough to eat and forcing them to rely on food banks (pictured) According to the report eight out of ten food banks claimed many of those using the service had faced sanctions over benefit payments which left them unable to afford food. The government introduced tougher rules aimed at benefit claimants last October including raising the minimum sanction for violations from one to four weeks. More than 20 charities, including the Trussell Trust have written to the government accusing them of violating people's basic right to food. According to the letter: 'We call on the Government to take immediate action to ensure that no one in the UK is denied their most basic right to sufficient and adequate food.' The Department of Work and Pensions said it was the growth in the number of food banks which was driving demand rather than new benefit rules . The Department of Work and Pensions said it was the growth in the number of food banks which has increased demand rather than new benefit regulations. A spokesperson said: 'We're spending £94 billion a year on working age benefits so that the welfare system provides a safety net to millions of people who are on low incomes or unemployed so they can meet their basic needs. 'Even the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development say there are fewer people struggling with their food bills compared with a few years ago, benefit processing times are improving, and even the Trussell Trust's own research recognises the effect their marketing activity has on the growth of their business. 'The employment rate is the highest it's been for five years and our reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families by promoting work and helping people lift themselves out of poverty.'

"By . Tim Shipman . and Tamara Cohen . and Matt Chorley . Unrepentant: Mr Bloom, his wife Katryna and their terrier chippy yesterday . The UKIP politician who complained about Britain sending aid to 'Bongo Bongo land' stormed out of a TV interview after being repeatedly challenged over whether he is racist. MEP Godfrey Bloom declared last night that sending aid to Africa was ‘treason’ and said he had no idea why he can’t refer to the continent as ‘Bongo Bongo land’. Repeatedly quizzed on whether he is a . racist, Mr Bloom told Channel 4 News interviewer Krishnan Guru-Murthy: . ‘Move on, there’s a good fellow. If you’re not going to move on to . serious issues, I’m not going to continue – I can’t be bothered with . it.’ He then tore off his earpiece and stormed off. It . was an abrupt ending to a day of Whitehall farce as Mr Bloom engaged in . a whirlwind tour of radio and television studios, repeatedly defending . himself and making the case against overseas aid. A fresh storm erupted over comments he made opposing women quotas on boards of top City firms, arguing men and women were very different. 'Most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man, most men can reverse a car better than a woman,' Mr Bloom suggested. He has previously suggested that he wanted to deal with women's issues because: 'I just don't think they clean behind the fridge enough.' A former economist, he was elected as an . MEP in 2004 and has been making headlines ever since with his views on . women, climate change and Germans. But he was slapped on the wrist by party leaders after he was secretly recorded making what critics immediately branded racist comments. He told supporters in the Midlands that foreign leaders who received aid spent the money on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it’. In the recording, the MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber says: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month when we’re in this sort of debt to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage ordered Mr Bloom to stop using the term and the under-fire MEP issued a carefully-worded statement apologising if he had caused ‘genuine offence’. David Cameron weighed into the row today, branding Mr Bloom's remarks 'offensive' and defending the use of British taxpayers' money for overseas aid. He said: 'I think it is an offensive . remark anyway, but what I think is wrong is this sort of ""stop the . world, I want to get off"" approach just doesn't work. 'Britain is a very open international . country. The problems elsewhere come and visit us. So it makes sense I . think to have an overseas aid programme that helps solve these problems . at source,' he told BBC Breakfast. Going: Mr Bloom starts to get annoyed during interview with Channel 4 News... Going: The MEP whips off his earpiece... Gone: And waves goodbye to interviewer . Men are from Mars and women are from Venus. Or in Godfrey Bloom's case, men are better at reversing cars while women can find condiments in the pantry and fret about wet towels left on beds. The bowler-hat wearing 63-year-old as gained a reputation for his outspoken views. His latest musings on the differences between the sexes emerged in an article railing against setting quotes for the number of women on the boards of FTSE 100 companies. Mr Bloom argued that women have a 'genetic predisposition' to prioritise family over working hard. 'Most women can find the mustard in the pantry quicker than a man, most men can reverse a car better than a woman,' he said in an article. 'Men and women care about different things on a micro-scale. Leaving the lavatory seat up, wet towels on the bed and the top left off the toothpaste will drive a wife mad. 'A man simply cannot understand what the problem is. Most wives do not regard putting petrol in the car as any part of their responsibility. 'Men cannot see the point in making the bed if you are going to get back in it tonight.' He also boasted of being 'just about as Alpha' as a man can be. 'I am not a 'new man', would not be caught dead at the birth of a baby and [would be] happy to punch the first man who tries to steal my beer,' he said in the article last month. He also lashed out at modern feminism 'spawned in the bra burning 1970s by rather shrill, bored, middleclass women of a certain physical genre'. He said they represented few women but are now supported by 'the slightly effete politically correct chaps who get sand kicked in their face on the beach'. But Mr Bloom has refused to say sorry . and insisted he had not done anything wrong. ‘What I’m not doing is . apologising,’ he said. Last night an unrepentant Mr Bloom said he did not understand why Mr Farage had censored him. He added: ‘I didn’t feel I had done anything wrong, I mean, I’m 63 years old, that’s the sort of phraseology we used years ago. ‘He’s a younger man than me and I don’t see it that way but if he tells me it’s so, it must be so.’ Asked by the BBC where ‘Bongo Bongo land’ was, Mr Bloom said: ‘I don’t know where Ruritania is either – there is no such place of course is there? Like the Third World. Where is the Third World?’ Later he conceded: ‘It might have been misconstrued by President Bongo of the Gambon, he may have thought I was talking about him. ‘If he is offended, I shall write to his excellency in short order and say, “I’m very sorry I wasn’t talking about you”. Ali Bongo is president of Gabon, not Gambon. In another interview, Mr Bloom said the Government was committing treason by sending taxpayers’ money abroad while things were so tight at home. He said: ‘If you’re fed up with £1billion a month going abroad with no audit trail when we’re cutting our police and hospitals, vote for me. If you don’t believe that’s treason – treason, I use the word advisedly – that’s how I feel.’ The original recording was leaked to . the The Guardian newspaper, and a bullish Mr Bloom declared: ‘Look, my . job is to upset the Guardian and the BBC – I love it, I love it. I don’t . do political correctness.’ He . added: ‘When a country has a trillion pounds of debt and we’re cutting . our hospitals, our police force and we’re destroying our defence . services, that money should stay at home. ‘People . who want to give money to worthwhile charities, that is for the . individual citizens. It’s not for the likes of David Cameron to pick our . pockets and send money to charities of his choice.’ He . added: ‘There are people in this country who can’t get treatment for . cancer. There are people who are waiting in a queue for dialysis . machines. Money should stay at home. Charity begins at home. 'I’m . standing up for ordinary people at the pub, the cricket club, the rugby . club, the sort of people who remain completely unrepresented under the . political system that we have.’ The . son of a Second World War fighter pilot, Mr Bloom – known to friends as . ‘Godders’ – grew up in London and spent 40 years working as an . economist in the City. He has been married to Katryna, a . physiotherapist who hails from Poland, for nearly 30 years. Mr Bloom . drifted into politics after being asked to write a research note on the . single currency in the mid-1990s. ‘I gave it ten years before it started to inwardly collapse,’ he recalls. ‘I’ve been proved right in spades.’ Mr Farage, then a City colleague and drinking companion, persuaded him to join the party. He was elected as an MEP in 2004. Laura Pidcock, from campaign group Show Racism The Red Card, said Mr Bloom’s comments were ‘incredibly damaging’. She added: ‘It is highly offensive and what he meant by it isn’t important – it’s the outcome that’s important.’ Shadow international development secretary Rushanara Ali said: ‘These are an offensive and narrow-minded set of remarks.’ Mr Farage tweeted: ‘Godfrey 100 per cent right over foreign aid budget but pleased he’s apologised over the wrong language he used.’ But within two hours, Mr Bloom was back on the television declaring that he had no idea why ‘Bongo Bongo land’ was considered racist. ‘I was describing corrupt despots across the globe who have no audit facilities at all, who either spend the money we give them on arms or they misdirect it,’ he said.","Godfrey Bloom confused why 'Bongo Bongo land' might be seen as racist .

"By . Anthony Bond . The nuclear accident at Fukushima in Japan last year was a 'man-made disaster' and not completely caused by the devastating tsunami, a new report has said. The Japanese parliamentary panel today submitted its final report on the catastrophe. The  probe is the third of its kind in Japan since the world's worst nuclear crisis in a generation. In a damning report,  the Diet's Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission said: . 'The TEPCO Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident was the result of collusion between the government, the regulators and TEPCO, and the lack of governance by said parties.' Damning: The nuclear accident at Fukushima last year was a 'man-made disaster' and not completely because of the tsunami, a report said earlier this month . Reactor meltdown: The damning indictment was delivered by the Japanese parliamentary panel . Disaster: Smoke is pictured ascending from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant's Unit 3 in Okumamachi in Fukushima Prefecture on March 14 last year . 'They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents. Therefore, we conclude that the accident was clearly 'man-made'. 'We believe that the root causes were the organisational and regulatory systems that supported faulty rationales for decisions and actions, rather than issues relating to the competency of any specific individual.' The nuclear disaster followed a 9.0 magnitute . earthquake off the coast of Japan in March last year -  the most . powerful ever known to hit the country. It led to a massive tsunami which devastated many towns and villages and led to almost 20,000 deaths. Normal: The Fukushima plant is pictured before the disaster in 2008 . Damaged: This picture 8 days after the explosion shows the crippled plant. The operator of the plant Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) was criticised in today's report . An earlier report by plant operator . Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) had all but cleared the huge utility, . saying the size of the earthquake and tsunami was beyond all . expectations and could not reasonably have been foreseen. But . an independent group of scholars and journalists, who reported their . findings in February, said TEPCO could and should have done more. It also said that had the company had its way, its staff would have been evacuated from the crippled plant and the catastrophe could have spiralled even further out of control. The findings published on Thursday call . for further investigation into the impact of the 9.0 magnitude . earthquake - as opposed to the towering tsunami - on the reactors at . Fukushima. Wrecked: Waves swallow a seaside village on March 11 after an earthquake leads to a massive tsunami in Japan. An explosion at Fukushima occured the following day . Horrific: Local residents walk among destroyed houses and debris in the tsunami-damaged city of Rikuzentakata, in Iwate prefecture . 'As for direct cause of the accident, . the commission reached the conclusion that we cannot definitely say any . devices that were important for safety were not damaged by the . earthquake,' it said. 'We . cannot rule out the possibility that a small-scale LOCA (loss-of-coolant . accident) occurred at the reactor No. 1 in particular.' Although many scientists and activists have questioned the dominant narrative that cooling systems were knocked out by the rising waters, the government and TEPCO have been unwilling to say the reactors could have been damaged by the initial earthquake. Tectonically-volatile Japan has a network of nuclear reactors that, until Fukushima, had supplied around a third of the nation's electricity. 2011 .

Supplies of liquefied natural gas are being diverted east after the tsunami shut its nuclear power reactors. It could push the wholesale price of gas up by as much as 28 per cent, energy market analysts claimed. In March, it emerged one of the . crippled nuclear reactors still has fatally high radiation levels and . much less water to cool it than officials had thought. The news renewed doubts about the . plant's stability and provoked fears the other two reactors that had . meltdowns could be in even worse shape.

"By . James  Nye . and Ryan Gorman . It is a quintessential New York City story. While . hundreds of thousands of oblivious commuters flit their way back and . forth across the mighty steel frame of the Manhattan Bridge - homeless . people are quietly burrowing into the girders and making it their home. At least two squatters have managed to build 'coffin-sized living spaces' below the upper deck's car lanes, adjacent to the subway and above bike lanes. They are near to the entrance of the bridge, but far enough up the bike path to make accessing them precarious. Dwelling: This is 'Joey's home - seen in daylight in the Manhattan Bridge . Each of the cramped homes are around ten feet-by-one-and-a-half feet and seem to be protected with bike locks. The tiny, narrow dwellings are just big enough for one person to lie down, but they provide shelter for people who otherwise have to brave the elements. They do not provide much more. The MailOnline attempted to contact either of the bridge-dwellers, . but they did not respond. The living spaces provide little silence as loud subway trains rumble by on four different tracks, 24 hours a day. Cars and trucks also scream across the bridge almost non-stop, wind howls over the span - the city that never sleeps does it's best to keep the squatters awake. Though hidden in plain sight, most people riding their bikes across the iconic span had idea the homes were there. Not a single person asked by MailOnline knew of the micro living spaces when asked if they could spot them. Several expressed shock over their existence. Precarious: The homes are perched in a narrow space between girders . Secret: His home is accessed by climbing over the steel railings to seen in the image and up and inside the girders . Not bothering anyone: Some enterprising vagrants are turning New York's Manhattan Bridge into a rent-free residence using only plywood and ingenuity . The spot they are located in is a rather dangerous, and is at a point in the bike path that is poorly lit and well-trafficked. Bikers sped down the narrow pathway because people don't usually walk on it - there is a pedestrian walkway on the opposite side of the span. It is not meant to be walked. The squatters likely picked this spot because it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof. There is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway. Not only is climbing the fence to the homes dangerous, but walking to them is putting one's life at risk, especially after the sun goes down. The New York Post reports that one . bridge-dweller, a middle-aged Chinese man, locks his plywood 'door' with . a bicycle lock each morning and returns for the evening to sleep. To reach the dwelling, which is built into the bridge frame on the Manhattan side of the bridge, he climbs a chain-link fence. Poorly lit: There is no lighting in the homes, and there is also no silence . Metropolis: Hundreds of thousands of people commute by the makeshift home each day without realizing what is going on above their heads . Prime real estate: The dwellings are built into the upper deck of the bridge, below car traffic but above the subway . Last Sunday a cyclst saw the man climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending suicide. He was yanked off the fence by police and questioned, finally managing to convey in his limited English that he wasn't trying to jump, but was merely returning home. The NYPD declined to comment to MailOnline regarding the dwellings, and the Department of Transportation has yet to return a message left seeking comment. 'People are really desperate for places to stay. I say, if he’s not bothering anybody, he’s not bothering me. Leave him alone,' Marcha Johnson, a passerby riding her bike near the shantytown told the Post. Desperate and clever.","Homeless people are constructing dwellings in the Manhattan Bridge .

An Oklahoma man was arrested on Thursday for allegedly raping a woman that was caught on a cell phone video. Willie Donnell Jackson, 20, was arrested for first-degree rape and rape by instrumentation complaints, according to a report by TulsaWorld. He is held in lieu of $75,000 bail. The victim reportedly went to her boyfriend's apartment last week, where she drank alcohol and smoked marijuana with both him and his roommate before passing out. Police contacted the woman after they received a video that showed the victim 'obviously unconscious and unresponsive' while Jackson had sex with her, the site says. The victim was 'visibly upset and shaken' when she watched the video, the site says, and told police she did not remember Jackson being at the apartment nor agree to have sex with him. The men were also seen in the cell phone video moving the victim's body 'like a rag doll' and  posing for pictures with her, according to TulsaWorld. The victim believes that the marijuana she smoked may have been 'laced,' according to Newson6, because 'she did not remember a thing' on the cell phone video.

"By . Daniel Bates In Cleveland, Ohio . Penny pincher: Ariel Castro, pictured in his latest mugshot, so tight with money he would split McDonald's burgers in half with his own family . The House of Horrors suspect was so tight with money he would split McDonald's burgers in half with his own family rather than let them eat a whole one, MailOnline can reveal. Ariel Castro would cut the bun in two with a knife and serve it to his wife as he thought the meal - which costs as little as $1 - was too expensive. When he dined alone, he would eat half of a burger and then lie to McDonald's workers, saying there was a hair in it just so he could get a new one. Relatives said that Castro was 'greedy' all the time and would never let anything go - even a 25-cent trinket at a yard sale. Castro's tight-fistedness was all too apparent in the state of his Cleveland, Ohio home which police have described as 'abysmal at best.' He is accused of using it to keep victims Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight captive for a decade during which time he repeatedly had sex with them. Castro, 52, starved the women for days on end and when he eventually fed them it would be fast food meals from the McDonald’s a few blocks away, neighbors have said. His former brother-in-law Frank Caraballo said that it all fit the profile of a man who was 'obsessed' with controlling other people. He said: ‘He was greedy, he didn't like to spend any money. He had money but he watched how he spent everything. 'He used to take us McDonald's and we would buy a hamburger and he would split it up. He was that greedy.

'He would go in there, buy a cheeseburger, eat half and say there as a hair in there just to get another one.' Mr Caraballo said that Castro could ‘talk people down’ and was very persuasive. He said: ‘Somebody is selling a car for a dollar, he could talk them down to half price. 'I don't know how he'd do it. We would go to yard sales and there would be something for a quarter. We would be thinking, oh, it's just a quarter. 'Ariel would ask: are you taking ten cents for that? Anything he bought he always has to get a deal out of it. Odd behavior: Frank Caraballo, pictured left with his wife Elida, says his ex-brother-in-law was very persuasive and would always 'talk people down' Music man: Ariel Castro is pictured in a 1998 newspaper clipping with members of the band he was in at the time.

'Ariel could be a really good guy and that next day this guy he would be such an a**hole. 'I'd think: I'd like to beat his a**.' Castro is being held in jail on $8million bail under a suicide watch, charged with rape and kidnapping. Prosecutors said they plan to bring additional counts, possibly including murder charges punishable by death for allegedly forcing at least one of his pregnant captives to miscarry over and over again by punching her in the stomach.

"By . Dan Bloom . A girl who was left disfigured after a raccoon savagely mauled her in her crib will finally be given a right ear today - almost 12 years after the attack. Charlotte Ponce was three months old when the animal chewed off most of her face in 2002, making headlines around the world. She was adopted by her great aunt and spent years in and out of hospital, including for a procedure two years ago which gave her a new nose. Brave: Charlotte Ponce was just three months old when a raccoon chewed off her nose, ear and lips . Adopted: Charlotte's parents lost custody of her and she was taken in by her great-uncle Tim, pictured . Tragic: Now 11, Charlotte has been in and out of hospital but it is hoped today's procedure will be the last . Now 11, she will go back under the knife for up to eight hours in what could be her last operation. But it will be the most complex yet, as it is claimed it has only been performed twice before. Dr. Kongkrit Chaiyasate will take cartilage from Charlotte's ribs and carve it into the shape of . an ear using a computer-generated template. He admitted the procedure is not easy and he will only have one chance to get it right, so he has been practicing on a potato. Dr Chaiyasate, of Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, told WBIV: . 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit - . what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her. 'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.' Mauled: Charlotte Ponce as a baby before and after the attack. Her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl . Surgery: The same doctor who gave Charlotte a new nose, pictured, will mould a right ear out of cartilage from her ribcage and 'grow' it in her forearm for around two months before transplanting it onto her face . Ready to go: Charlotte packs her bags yesterday at her home in Spring Lake as she prepares to leave for hospital . He will implant the basic structure of the ear under the skin of Charlotte's forearm, where it will take several weeks to mould into a fully-formed ear before it can be transplanted again. Dr Chaiyasate, who will perform the initial procedure today and finish the work in June, was the same doctor who built Charlotte a new nose and repaired her lip and cheek. He said he could not guarantee success, but would try his best. Charlotte's adopted mother Sharon Ponce said people from as far as Britain and Australia had contacted the family to tell them what an inspiration the girl has been. Heart-wrending photos show Charlotte, her skin remarkably well-repaired since her last run of surgery, packing her suitcase yesterday to return for her last big trip to the hospital. She was just a newborn when her 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the pet. Change: Charlotte's adopted family have more gentle pets. Here she plays with one of her guinea pigs . Good spirits: Remarkably Charlotte retained the hearing in her right ear despite the catastrophic damage . Playing: The whole procedure, which has almost never been done before, will take around two months . The raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked. Her great-aunt Sharon and great-uncle Tim only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night's news bulletin. They gained custody of Charlotte and her brother Marshall, who was then 15 months old, and they and their friends raised more than $10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital. Sharon had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after Charlotte after doctors said she would need full time care. Although ears have been made out of ribs before, the method of 'growing' the ear inside the forearm is extremely rare. Remarkable: Charlotte with her adopted mother Sharon and Dr Kongkrit Chaiyasate after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation. He said today's surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done . Attack: It has been a slow recovery for Charlotte, who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose . Intact: Charlotte as a baby with her brother Marshall before she was attacked in late 2002 . Happy family: Charlotte now lives with (from left) her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall . It has to be done because Charlotte's ear was so badly damaged that the foundations of an ear structure no longer exist inside her head. Charlotte previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable. Yet despite the enormous damage, there is one miracle. Even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life, Charlotte's hearing has been largely unaffected.","Charlotte Ponce from Spring Lake, Michigan, left disfigured by 2002 attack .

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Ministers are to risk a major row over immigration by scrapping the ten-yearly National Census after more than 200 years. An announcement axing the survey is expected this month, together with moves to find cheaper ways of counting the population. But the Government faces accusations of trying to hide the truth about immigration. Ten-yearly National Census that counts the number of people living in UK will be scrapped after 200 years . The future of the census has been in question since the disastrous 2001 survey led to bureaucratic chaos and a final population figure at least a million short of the reality. The Office for National Statistics has been exploring replacements based on ‘administrative data’, which could include NHS and tax and benefit records and the electoral roll. However, officials also want to use the vast databases run by private sector organisations to supplement publicly-held information. The ONS has canvassed the idea of tapping into information held by internet search engines such as Google and the databases of corporations such as Tesco and the energy supply giants. The results of the consultation will be made public later this month. Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch UK think-tank warned that the proposals ‘need to be examined very closely’. ‘There must be no question of burying the truth about the scale of immigration,’ he said. Critics of the proposal to scrap the census (pictured in 2011) say it is the most accurate measure of population . Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at Sheffield University, called the idea ‘stupid’. In an article for the journal Radical . Statistics, he said the 2011 census had confounded analysts who believed . that the ONS had been over-estimating the population because it has . been better at counting immigrants than emigrants. Sir Andrew Green of Migration Watch said getting rid of the census could be to 'bury the truth about the scale of immigration' ‘The 2011 census told us that the opposite had in fact occurred,’ said Professor Dorling. ‘ONS had been under-estimating the population and there were far more people living in the UK than they thought.’ 'The 2011 census showed us that the population of the UK was rising, still slowly, but faster than the ONS had thought, and faster than almost anywhere else in Europe. ‘Without knowing that fact we could not speculate in a sensible way as to why that might be happening.’ The 2011 census showed that there were 56.1million people in England and Wales, 3.7million up in a decade, and half a million more than official estimates. The ONS acknowledged that almost all the half-million were eastern European immigrants who were not detected by regular Government surveys. The first census was taken in 1801 amid fears that a rising population would bring starvation and revolution. It has been held every ten years since – apart from 1941 – but has become a costly exercise. The 2011 headcount cost £500million. Professor Dorling said that a reason for scrapping the census could be to stop embarrassing social studies, such as those finding that the poor are becoming increasingly less healthy than the well off. ‘One of the reasons you might choose not to have a census is if you wanted the kinds of studies that relied on census data not to be undertaken,’ he said. He said it was wrong to replace the census with inadequate surveys, saying ‘the politically devious way to cut something is to cut it, but claim that it is continuing.’","Announcement on axing the National Census is expected this month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A judge has said he wants a white man he convicted in 1999 of killing a black man to be freed because he found him guilty due to his own reverse racism. Frank Barbaro, a retired Brooklyn Supreme Court judge, said he convicted Donald Kagan, now 39, of shooting Wavell Wint, 22, because he saw the man as 'a bigot'. He said that he had denied Kagan a fair trial because of his own civil rights activist opinions. 'Mistake': Retired Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Frank Barbaro, pictured, said a white man he convicted of murdering a black man in 1999 should be freed because he was biased by his civil rights activist views . 'Mr. Kagan had no intent to kill that . man,' Barbaro, 86, told Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice ShawnDya Simpson in court, the New York Post reported. 'I believe now that I was seeing this young white fellow as a . bigot, as someone who assassinated an African-American.' He said his work during the civil-rights movement caused his bias in the case. Convicted: Donald Kagan, now 39, was convicted of second-degree murder in 1999 . 'The question of discrimination against African-American people became part of my fiber - my very fiber,' he said in court. Barbaro, who also served 23 years in the state Assembly, said that because of his views he didn't consider a justification defense by Kagan in the trial, which had no jury. But ever since, he has been able to . stop thinking about it and when he read about people who were mistakenly . sent to jail and later exonerated, he would think of Kagan, he said. 'I . was prejudiced during the trial,' he admitted to the court. 'I realized . I made a terrible mistake and there was a man in jail because of my . mistake.' Barbaro contacted . defense attorney Jeff Adler, who filed a motion in 2011 to overturn . Kagan’s conviction, the Post reported, and the case will now be . revisited. The Supreme Court Justice will either present an acquittal, a retrial or a plea deal for time served. Kagan . was convicted of shooting Wint after they struggled over Kagan's chain . outside a movie theater in New York in 1998.

"By . Daniel Bates In Cleveland, Ohio . and Rachel Quigley . Amanda Berry gave birth to her six-year-old daughter in a small inflatable swimming pool while she was being held in captivity at the house of Ariel Castro, it emerged today. Police sources confirmed today that chains, ropes and other bondage devices were found in the house on Seymour Avenue and that at least one of the girls was chained to the wall 'like a trophy'. It also emerged today that Castro would sometimes sneak the women out of the house in disguises and multiple sources confirmed that Berry's daughter Jocelyn was taken out often to visit her 'grandma' and be home schooled. A source with access to a police report told The Plain Dealer that while the women were chained and locked inside different rooms in the home, holes were cut in the doors to slide things like food in and out. Scroll down for video . Scene: The women were helped out of this home on Seymour Avenue that belongs to Ariel Castro . Escape route: The front door of a house where the women escaped after a neighbor helped them . Relief: Amanda Berry (center) has returned to the home of her sister Beth (left) with her daughter Jocelyn (right) Another . police source told a local news station that what they found in the . house confirms that the victims endured a decade of torture at the hands . of Castro. Windows and doors of the house were . boarded up and the back yard - where the girls were reportedly forced to . walk on all fours on leashes like dogs - was covered with an . eight-foot-tall fence made out of chicken wire and blue tarpaulin. It was also revealed that Castro . would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run away by . pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried to run . free. This is said to be just one of the . manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house . for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging . from the ceiling. Reporters . from local station WOIO spoke to law enforcement sources who said that . he would 'play this little dangerous game that he would tell the women . he was about to leave the home, and then he would wait and if one of . them tried to open that door, he would go in and attack them.' 'That was one of the ways he was able to keep them there,' reporter Dan Deroos told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The . trick clearly contributed to the young women's captivity, as Berry . stressed the fact that she feared his quick return during her frantic . 911 call. The hanging chains were also reportedly used during the first few years of captivity, along with frequent beatings. 'They were bound and gagged several times throughout the course of being held in that home,' WOIO reports. Another . psychological tactic that he used to keep the women in constant fear . was the constant threat of violence, and threats to their childrens' lives. In hindsight, there were signs of a . darker side to Ariel Castro. Divorced years ago and never seen in the . company of women, he suddenly started showing up in the largely . Latino, working-class neighborhood with a little girl. It was his girlfriend's child, he told neighbors. The 52-year-old was believed to have . lived alone, yet on his lunch break would bring home enough bags of fast . food and beverages for several people. Investigation: FBI agents remove evidence from . the house where three women who had disappeared as teenagers . approximately ten years ago, were found alive on Monday . The back of the home of Ariel Castro on Seymour Ave: One neighbor says she once saw a little girl looking out of the house's attic window . Locked in: Castro used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in . Ariel Castro, 52 . Pedro Castro, 54 . Onil Castro, 50 . He was a school bus driver given . mostly 'excellent' marks on his performance appraisals, but was . repeatedly disciplined, including for one incident when he was accused . of calling a young student a 'bitch' and leaving a child alone on a bus. He was fired last November. Castro was arrested in 1993 after a domestic violence complaint, though a grand jury decided not to indict him. Another complaint in 2005 filed by . his ex-wife, who died last year at age 48, accused him of twice breaking . her nose and attempting to abduct their daughters and keep them from . her mother. 'Knocked out tooth. Dislocated . shoulder (twice - one each side); threatened to kill petitioner and . daughters 3/4 times just this year,' the petition, signed by Figueroa . and her lawyer, said. For years, Castro's neighbors on . Seymour Avenue saw him as a friendly but private person, an accomplished . musician who played bass in Latin bands such as Borin Plena and Grupo . Fuego. He liked motor-bikes and showed up at . neighborhood barbecues in a vacant lot on Seymour Avenue. He was a . self-taught mechanic who loved to talk about cars. He owned an unremarkable, two-story . house in a somewhat dilapidated part of Cleveland. Built in 1890, the . home was valued at a mere $13,200 in 2011, according to property . records. Its windows were covered to block views from the outside. One childhood friend said a music session with Castro, who was born in Puerto Rico, suddenly turned bizarre. 'Ariel was in my garage probably five . or six years ago. We were recording a song, an idea we had - a little . hard rock with some Latin,' said Joe Popow, 45, a father of six who said . he has known the Castro brothers since childhood. 'And - you're going to laugh - he . said he was in the CIA. And I don't know if he was joking or not, but . it's the way he said it, how serious he said it. 'I didn't know what he was capable of. That just put me on defense, and I just started stepping away,' Popow said. Signs: In a photograph taken in 2001, suspect .

While Berry is . said to have birthed her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn during her . captivity, police are reportedly looking for the bodies of other . children who were miscarried or died due to malnutrition. 'Numerous . times throughout this 10-year period, that some of the women became . pregnant and that they would be beaten, forcibly hit in the stomach to . force a miscarriage, if you can imagine that,' WOIO reporter Deroos told . CNN. Jocelyn, like her mother, was . said to be dehydrated and malnourished, but eventually given the . all-clear by a local hospital following their rescue. Other . children are thought to have suffered a different fate, as cadaver dogs . were brought to the house by investigators searching for the bodies of . any other children. The . ongoing investigation of the house has led investigators to believe . that while the girls were kept on the property by the boarded windows, . padlocked doors, and chicken wire-laden fence, they may have been able . to access multiple rooms inside the home. Neighbors . of Ariel Castro said that when police raided the three-storey property, . they went straight upstairs and hauled the girls out. At . the top of the property at the back is a smashed window - thought to be . the attic - which could have been broken in an attempt to attract . attention to themselves or wriggle out to freedom. MailOnline can also reveal that Ariel . Castro, who owned the house and has been arrested along with his two . brothers, turned it into a 'fortress' by setting up a stockade round the . back. He used chicken wire and blue . tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes . go overgrown so nobody could see in. The . house is now the center of an FBI investigation after Berry, 27, . DeJesus, 23 and Knight, 30, were all found there after being missing for . around ten years. Neighbors . said that Ariel Castro used to be seen very often at the property but . in recent years had only been there a few times a week, to the extent . that it was thought the property was vacant and that he was using it as . an investment. Meanwhile, . Cleveland police allege, the three girls remained trapped inside, . meaning they could have had to wait for days at a time to eat. The . back windows of the house are either boarded up or have the curtains . drawn and even the large garage style building in the back garden has . its windows covered.","Suspected captor Arial Castro used chains hanging from the ceiling to keep the girls inside the Cleveland home for the first few years .

"By . Graeme Yorke . Two men have been jailed after former England and Manchester United star Andrew Cole was racially abused during a flight. 42-year-old Cole was travelling on an Aer Arran service from Dublin to Manchester when he was subjected to the abuse, which included being called ‘Mr Blackman’. Drunk passengers Gregory Horan, 26, and Lee Byrne, 28, had begun drinking before boarding the 9.30am flight in December last year. Lee Byrne, left, and Gregory Horan, right,  pictured arriving at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court where they were both jailed after former Manchester United footballer Andy Cole was racially abused on a flight . Hurt: Andy Cole was travelling on an Aer Arran service from Dublin to Manchester when he was subjected to the abuse, which included being called 'Mr Blackman' Judge Mushtaq Khokar handed Byrne a . 20-week sentence and Horan a ten-week sentence and they were each . ordered to pay a £80 victim surcharge. He . said their actions could have ‘jeopardised the safety of everyone on . the plane’ and that Byrne’s words would have been ‘equally harmful’ to . Cole whether he’d said them when he was drunk or sober. Minshull Street Crown Court, in Manchester, heard how they were asked by cabin crew if the wished to disembark before the plane took off. But they opted to stay on board, where their drunken behaviour immediately caused problems for other passengers and cabin crew. The pair had smuggled a bottle of rum on board and swore at cabin crew when they were asked to hand it over. They also ‘hassled’ and kicked the chairs of two female passengers who were sat in front on them.Rachel Faux, prosecuting, said cabin crew had felt ‘threatened’ by the men and they were grateful it was only a short flight. Byrne began pestering Cole, who was sat nearby, calling him ‘Mr Blackman’. ‘Where I’m from it’s a politically correct to address you as Mr Blackman,’ he told the former player. Lee Byrne, right, and Gregory Horan, wearing a blonde wig - left, leaving Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester where they were handed jail sentences for the incident on a Dublin to Manchester flight . Cole told Byrne to ‘just leave it’ but the abuse continued with Byrne calling him a ‘spook’- a racist term. Ms Faux told the court that Cole had felt ‘angry and upset’ by this stage and he was forced to change seats. She said that the former striker had felt ‘extremely humiliated and degraded’ and she read out a statement from him which said: ‘I’ve done a lot of work in sport and football around racism. ‘I’ve been the victim of racism before and will not tolerate this abuse in any capacity. ‘I am worried if nothing happens or changes the next generation of young people, including my own children, will suffer the same discrimination and that is unacceptable to me.’ Horan and Byrne were arrested by police when the plane touched down and later charged. Prolific: Cole is second on the list of all-time Premier Leagues all-time scorers with 189 goals . Everywhere: The former United man also played for Arsenal, Newcastle, Blackburn, Fulham and Man City . Cole took to Twitter after the incident - on December 29, last year - to thank his followers for their backing. He tweeted: ‘Can I just say thank you for the tweets and the support.’ Unemployed Byrne, of Blanchardstown, Dublin, pleaded guilty to a racially aggravated public order offence and being drunk on an aircraft at Trafford Magistrates’ Court in December. Horan, of Castleknock, Dublin, who is on a Job Care scheme, admitted being drunk on an aircraft. The court heard how both men had shown remorse for their actions. Corrine Ransom, defending Byrne who had several previous convictions for drink-related offences and threatening behaviour, described his actions as ‘wreckless’, adding that he didn’t hold ‘entrenched racist views’. David Bentley, defending Horan, said he had a history of drug and alcohol problems and he acknowledged his behaviour had been ‘dangerous’ on board an aircraft. The court heard how both men had since moved to temporary addresses in Leeds. In a statement read out in court, Mr Cole said: ‘I’ve been the victim of racism before and will not tolerate this abuse in any capacity' Cole took to Twitter after the incident on December 29 last year to thank his followers for their backing . Speaking after today's sentencing, Cole said: 'I'm very happy with the verdict, however this behaviour cannot be tolerated and needs to be stamped out. 'This verdict sends a message to others that this type of behaviour/attitude is not acceptable. 'We need to set a precedent for the up and coming youth of today in order for positive progress.' Cole, who’s now an ambassador for Manchester United, spent eight successful seasons with the Old Trafford club, winning five Premier League titles, two FA Cups and one Champions League trophy. The striker also had spells at Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City. He suffered racial abuse during his career and is involved with the Kick It Out anti-racism campaign alongside other prominent black footballers. The campaign is supported and funded by the game’s governing bodies, including founding body the Professional Footballers Association (PFA), the Premier League and The Football Association. Speaking in 2011, Cole said he’d been discouraged from pursuing a career in football coaching and management because of the dearth of opportunities for black ex-players. He said English football was facing a ‘lost’ generation of potential managers because black former players would ‘walk away’ from the game.","Andy Cole was subjected to racial abuse on Dublin to Manchester flight .

"By . Martin Robinson . Anger: Bob Bellew was given a 15-month suspended sentence in April for abusing young girls, but High Court judges refused to increase it today . A renowned gymnastics coach who abused students as young as six over 40 years has avoided jail for the second time. Robert 'Bob' Bellew, 66, admitted attacking girls at schools and gyms across the country, but was . given a 15-month suspended prison sentence in April after a judge said . he had shown remorse. The pensioner, who served on a committee . planning London 2012, admitted seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual activity . with a child. His victims were outraged and the Crown Prosecution Service then appealed to try to get him thrown in jail. But three senior judges at London's Appeal Court have now rejected a bid by the . Solicitor General, Oliver Heald QC, to jail Bellew at the second time . of asking and to increase his sentence, because they believed his 15-month suspended term 'was not unduly lenient.' Speaking after the hearing, one of Bellew's victims and her family . slammed the courts for 'favouring' the abuser over those he had 'scarred . for the rest of their lives'. During the Appeal Court hearing Lady Justice Rafferty, who was among the three judges considering the CPS's application, said Bellew's shining reputation was . 'shattered' after it emerged he had molested seven girls between the . early 1970s and 2010, often using coaching sessions as a cover for his . abuse. The appeal judge said the former Community Coach of the Year lifted . the leotards of some girls, rubbing and touching their genitals, . grabbing one's bottom and molesting another while she performed a . handstand. Lady Justice Rafferty said one of Bellew's first victims said she was . terrified of telling anyone of his unwanted advances 'because he was . her coach and others trusted him.' Bellew, of New Cross, in south-east London, made one gymnast sit on . his lap and rubbed her groin, saying 'these were the muscles which she . needed to work on', before patting her bottom, the appeal judge said. Referring to statements made by his victims, Lady Justice Rafferty . said: 'Some endure difficulties still in trusting men and, in general, . each victim feels that her personal relationships have been affected by . what she has had to endure.' Decision: Judges at the high Court (pictured) said the sentence was not 'unduly lenient', to the fury of the gymnastic teacher's victims . When sentencing him April, Judge Joanna Korner spared Bellew jail, . suspending his sentence for two years after saying his case called for . 'mercy' from the court. Duncan Atkinson, for the Solicitor General, argued that the judge . ought to have imposed a term above two years - which would have excluded . the possibility of a suspension. He said: 'Bellew was entrusted to be with these young girls by their . families to benefit them through gymnastics training. It was, as the . sentencing judge recognised, a gross breach of trust and this was not . reflected in the sentence imposed.' Mr Atkinson said Bellew had since received a caution for witness . intimidation after writing a letter to one of his victims after . proceeedings. But while Mr Barry Kogan, for Bellew, accepted the sentence was short, he denied it was excessively soft. He said: 'A total of 15 months was arguably somewhat on the lenient side . but not unduly so. Further, there was indeed sufficient mitigation . before the judge to justify her decision to make the suspended sentence . order she did.' Backing: Lady Justice Rafferty agreed with the first judge, Judge Joanna Korner, and said: 'We are not inclined to disturb the 15 months on which this judge settled' The barrister said Bellew suffered from a heart condition and . psychological problems as a result of the proceedings and argued his . mitigation 'outweighed' the aggravating factors of the case. 'He is a broken man and I don't think he will ever recover. He has lost . his life's work and, as the sentencing judge accepted quite openly, . that, in some sense, was a severe sentence in itself,' Mr Kogan added. Application: The Solicitor General,  Oliver Heald QC, failed in the attempt to have Bellew's sentenced increased . Lady Justice Rafferty, sitting with Mr Justice Keith and Judge Jeremy . Goss QC, rejected claims that the length of sentence was simply too . short. 'Whilst some judges might well have imposed a term of more than 15 . months, we are not inclined to disturb the 15 months on which this judge . settled,' she added. The appeal judge admitted the court had 'struggled' to decide whether . Bellew should have been caged but ultimately rejected the solicitor . general's challenge against the suspension. 'After significant anxiety, we have concluded that the term of 15 months . suspended for two years was not unduly lenient,' she concluded. Speaking after the hearing, one of Bellew's victims said she felt let . down by the justice system after watching the paedophile twice walk free. She said: 'I don't think I would come forward and complain again. 'It is nothing to do with what the police have done, but the judges - . they favour the abusers rather than the people who have been abused.' Her mother slammed the decision, saying she felt furious that Bellew was . free to walk the streets after inflicting so much pain and suffering on . his victims. She said: 'This is going to affect others who want to come forward. They . are going to reference this case and refuse to come forward and another . paedophile is going to get away with it again. 'We could have taken this into our own hands. If my husband had done . that, he would have gone to prison. We have tried to do the right thing . and this is what happens.' The victim's father added: 'I feel sorry for the police trying to catch . these people and bring them to court. They have got Bellew bang to . rights and then he gets away with it. These girls have been scarred for . life.'","Bob Bellew admitted eight child sex offences in schools and gyms .

"By . Graham Smith . No damage has been found on a Shell oil drilling ship that lost its mooring and drifted into an Alaska harbour on Saturday, the Coast Guard has said. Video captured by divers who examined the hull of the  571ft-long rig Noble Discoverer shows no signs of grounding, it is claimed. The ship slipped its anchorage on Saturday in winds up to 35mph, drifting extremely close to shore in Dutch Harbor. Just how close is still a subject of hot debate - one local captain disputed initial reports that said the Discoverer came within 100 years of shore. Kristjan Laxfoss took photos that he claims show the vessel came much closer to land and prove it was not moving and grounded. Grounded? Shell oil drilling rig the Noble Discoverer lies in Alaska's Dutch Harbor after losing its mooring on Saturday. Local harbour captain Kristjan Laxfoss claims this photo shows the vessel clearly ran aground . Port: The ship slipped its anchorage on Saturday in winds up to 35 mph, drifting extremely close to shore in Dutch Harbor (pictured) He said: 'There's no question it hit the beach. That ship was not coming any closer. It was on the beach.' But Coast Guard investigators say otherwise. Lt Jim Fothergill said: 'We are still reviewing the video. However, what I can tell you is that there is no physical evidence that suggests that they hit bottom. 'We believe if they did ground, it was a very soft grounding.' Earlier footage taken by a remotely operated vehicle also shows no damage, he said. There have also been no reports of injury or pollution. The Discoverer, owned by Noble Corp, is among a Shell fleet to soon head north for planned exploratory drilling in the Arctic waters of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. The ship is now anchored 750yards from land after it was towed offshore following the mishap. Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said about 120 crew members were on board when the Discoverer dragged anchor. They remain on board gearing up to begin the journey to the Arctic in late July. Mr Smith said the trip will take four or five days, and the company aims to begin drilling in early August. Battling evil: Actress Lucy Lawless as Xena (left) and taking part in a Greenpeace protest aboard the Discoverer in February (right) True believer: The environmentalist waves a placard aboard the drilling ship . Noble Discoverer in an attempt to stop it from sailing to Alaska . Drilling in Arctic waters is bitterly opposed by environmental groups and some Alaska residents. Their . lawsuits and permit appeals have prevented Shell from drilling in the . Chukchi Sea, where the subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell spent $2.1billion . on leases in 2008. Shell also holds older leases in the Beaufort Sea . and hopes to drill exploratory wells this summer in both locations. Environmentalists . say the anchorage problem is yet another reason to question Shell's . Arctic plan, particularly after the same vessel ran into a mooring . problem in a severe storm in New Zealand waters last year. The Discoverer had been drilling an exploratory well off the South Taranaki coast. New . Zealand officials say three of eight anchor cables broke after the crew . had already disconnected from the oil well when alerted to bad weather . approaching. Soon after the . incident, Shell officials said there were no injuries or harm to the . environment or the well, and that the vessel sustained minor damage and . was repaired. The incident was investigated by New Zealand officials, who said no further action was warranted. Mr . Smith said Shell has been excited about the Arctic project for a long . time, but that the Discoverer incident temporarily damped that . excitement. He said: 'Anytime something like this happens operationally, you have to take it extremely seriously. 'Our goal is always flawless execution, and when that doesn't happen - either in port or offshore - it's unacceptable.'","Noble Discoverer drifted into Dutch Harbor in 35mph winds on Saturday .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Backing: David Cameron's private secretary used a memo to officials to raise the prospect of opening up state schools to foreign pupils . Foreign pupils would be charged thousands of pounds to attend British state schools under a controversial plan backed by David Cameron. Despite warnings of a growing shortage of school places, a leaked Downing Street memo reveals a plan is being hatched to open up the education system to more children from overseas. The letter orders universities minister David Willetts to work with the Department for Education on ways of ‘allowing international students to access places at academies’. However the plan is set to spark a furious government row, with the Liberal Democrats vowing to block any attempt to part-privatise spaces in the classrooms of state schools. The four-page letter, marked restricted, was sent by Mr Cameron’s private secretary to Holly White, a senior adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. It sets out ‘suggestions for you to develop and agree’ including allowing the parents of foreign pupils to buy their way into British state education system. It states: ‘We have some of the most successful and innovative publicly-funded schools in the world and an internationally renowned independent sector. ‘We would ask you to work with the Department for Education on increasing the place of schools in the [education exports industrial] strategy. ‘This is meant to be a long-term strategy and while the Academies / Free Schools programme should focus on consolidating domestic progress over the next couple of year, we should look at export potential too. ‘This should include consideration of allowing international students to access places at academies.’ According to The Times, which obtained the letter, Whitehall insiders have made clear that the Prime Minister would not allow any plan to put further pressure on UK taxpayers. A source told the newspaper: ‘This week the government has launched a blitz to stop foreigners getting free access to the NHS. ‘Therefore the idea that international pupils would attend British state schools for free is a non starter.’ Places: Opening up state schools to paying foreign pupils could put increased pressure on class sizes . Stephen Twigg, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: ‘Parents will have serious questions for the Prime Minister about opening up schools to overseas pupils. ‘Will overseas pupils be able to bypass the admissions rules for local children? Would this cost the UK taxpayer, or would schools become reliant on funding from overseas pupils? David Cameron needs to explain what on earth he’s up to.’ The shortage of school places dominated Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday. Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed that the country will need 240,000 extra primary school places by 2014. He added: ‘Class sizes are rising. When the Labour Government came to office, the number of infants being taught in class sizes of over 30 was a quarter. When we left office, it was just 1.8 per cent. ‘It has doubled on the Prime Minister’s watch - that is the reality for lots of parents.’ But Mr Cameron insisted that the government has promised additional money for 500,000 extra school places, ‘so we should be able to provide those school places without seeing an increase in classes’. ‘We have made education a priority. That is why the amount of money going into our schools is going up and not down. ‘That is why we are funding half a million extra school places. That is why this Government have built 200 new school buildings since taking office.’","Downing St memo reveals plan to open up academies to foreign children .

"By . Lydia Warren . San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has branded a story that he is being investigated for a possible sexual assault 'completely wrong'. The football player, 26, spoke out in a series of Twitter messages on Friday, a day after it emerged he was being investigated because he was named in a police report earlier this month. The report, filed by an ex, said Kaepernick kissed and undressed her during a night of drinking and smoking marijuana before she woke up in hospital without any memories of what had happened. While she was in hospital the following morning, a rape kit was administered, TMZ reported, but the results have not been shared. While no charges have been filed and the report did not alleged any specific crimes, a news story by TMZ said police sources said the sports star was being investigated for possible sexual assault. Anger: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, pictured in 2010, says stories have been 'made up' about him being under investigation for a possible sexual assault . 'The charges made in the TMZ story and . other stories Iâ€™ve seen are completely wrong,' Kaepernick said on his . Twitter account. 'They make things up about me that never happened. 'I take great pride in who I am and what I do, but  I guess sometimes you have to deal with someone who makes things up. 'I want to thank all of the people who have shared their encouraging sentiments. I assure you that your faith is not misplaced.' But on Friday, TMZ refused to back down, saying that a 'well placed official' said that the investigation is 'sexual in nature'. On Thursday it emerged that Miami police are looking into the 'suspicious incident' after an unnamed woman said she kissed Kaepernick and undressed after a night drinking and smoking marijuana with him and two other 49ers. She later woke up in hospital without any memory. Speaking out: Kaepernick responded to the reports in a series of tweets posted on Friday morning . Named: It comes after Kaepernick was named in a police report filed in Miami by an ex earlier this month . The report notes that she had a 'sexual relationship with Mr. Kaepernick in the past'. The . woman said she visited Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Ricardo Lockette, . 27, at an apartment in the Viceroy, a luxury hotel that has rooms and . residences, and he was there with Kaepernick and 49ers wide receiver . Quinton Patton, 23, according to a police report. After . mixing some drinks for the men and giving them shots, they allegedly . told her that for them to take the shots, she had to smoke marijuana. They . all started watching a basketball game but the woman said that she went . to a bedroom to lie down after feeling 'light headed', according to the . report. Kaepernick . then came into the bedroom and kissed her and undressed her, leaving her . naked - before walking out and saying he would return. Investigation: Quinton Patton, pictured right with Kaepernick, was also named in the police report . Friends: Ricardo Lockette, right with Kaepernick left, was also at the hotel the night of the incident . She was waiting in bed naked when the two other players peeked inside the room, the report said. 'What are you doing?' she shouted at them, according to the report. 'Where is Colin? Get out!' The men then left - and she cannot remember what happened after that, she said. But . she woke up in a hospital bed in the middle of the night and 'doesn't . remember how she got there or who transported her to the hospital', the . report said. 'There's no evidence of a crime or a sexual assault,' a police spokesperson said of the report. 'This report is simply an incident report taken at the woman's request.' According to Kapernick's Instagram . account, he is in Miami to train and has been to the Viceroy Hotel as . recently as April 5, where he was pictured hanging out with a wedding . party by the pool.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . It's long been known that America's school kids haven't measured well compared with their international peers, but now there's a new twist: its adults don't either. In math, reading and problem-solving using technology, American adults scored below the international average on a global test, according to results released on Tuesday. Adults in Japan, Canada, Australia, Finland and multiple other countries scored significantly higher than the U.S. in all three areas. The findings were equally grim for many European countries. Must do better: U.S. adults were outperformed by their counterparts in multiple countries in reading, math and problem solving . Beyond basic reading and math, respondents were tested on activities such as calculating mileage reimbursement due to a salesman, sorting email and comparing food expiration dates on grocery store tags. All the skills tested are considered critical for global competitiveness and economic strength. Not only did Americans score poorly compared to many international competitors, the findings reinforced just how large the gap is between the nation's high- and low-skilled workers and how hard it is to move ahead when your parents haven't. In both reading and math, for example, those with college educated parents did better than those whose parents did not complete high school. The study, called the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies, found that it was easier on average to overcome this and other barriers to literacy overseas than in the U.S. Researchers tested about 157,000 people ages 16 to 65 in more than 20 countries and subnational regions. Confusion: The international study tested adults in over 20 countries on everyday problem solving . It was developed and released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which is made up of mostly industrialized member countries. The Education Department's Center for Education Statistics participated. In Europe, Italy and Spain, among the hardest hit by the recession and debt crisis, ranked at the bottom across generations. Unemployment is well over 25 percent in Spain and over 12 percent in Italy. Spain has drastically cut education spending, drawing student street protests. But in the northern European countries that have fared better, the picture was brighter - and the study credits continuing education. In Finland, Denmark, and the Netherlands, more than 60 percent of adults took part is either job training or continuing education. In Italy, by contrast, the rate was half that. As the American economy sputters along and many people live paycheck-to-paycheck, economists say a highly-skilled workforce is key to economic recovery. The median hourly wage of workers scoring on the highest level in literacy on the test is more than 60 percent higher than for workers scoring at the lowest level, and those with low literacy skills were more than twice as likely to be unemployed. Test: How do you do with this sample question? 'It's not just the kids who require more and more preparation to get access to the economy, it's more and more the adults don't have the skills to stay in it,' said Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a statement the nation needs to find ways to reach more adults to upgrade their skills. Otherwise, he said, 'no matter how hard they work, these adults will be stuck, unable to support their families and contribute fully to our country. 'Among the other findings: . - Americans scored toward the bottom in the category of problem solving in a technology rich environment. The top five scores in the areas were from Japan, Finland, Australia, Sweden and Norway, while the U.S. score was on par with England, Estonia, Ireland and Poland. In nearly all countries, at least 10 percent of adults lacked the most basic of computer skills such as using a mouse. - Japanese and Dutch adults who were ages 25 to 34 and only completed high school easily outperformed Italian or Spanish university graduates of the same age. - In England, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the United States, social background has a big impact on literacy skills, meaning the children of parents with low levels of education have lower reading skills. America's school kids have historically scored low on international assessment tests compared to other countries, which is often blamed on the diversity of the population and the high number of immigrants. Lagging behind: The U.S. was below average in literacy proficency . Also, achievement tests have long shown that a large chunk of the U.S. student population lacks basic reading and math skills - most pronounced among low-income and minority students. This test could suggest students leaving high school without certain basic skills aren't obtaining them later on the job or in an education program. The United States will have a tough time catching up because money at the state and local level, a major source of education funding, has been slashed in recent years, said Jacob Kirkegaard, an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'There is a race between man and machine here. The question here is always: Are you a worker for whom technology makes it possible to do a better job or are you a worker that the technology can replace?' he said. For those without the most basic skills, he said, the answer will be merciless and has the potential to extend into future generations. Learning is highly correlated with parents' education level. 'If you want to avoid having an underclass - a large group of people who are basically unemployable - this educational system is absolutely key,' Kirkegaard said. Dolores Perin, professor of psychology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University, said the report provides a 'good basis for an argument there should be more resources to support adults with low literacy.' Adults can learn new skills at any age and there are adult-geared programs around the country, Perin said. But, she said, the challenge is ensuring the programs have quality teaching and that adults regularly attend classes. 'If you find reading and writing hard, you've been working hard all day at two jobs, you've got a young child, are you actually going to go to class? It's challenging,' Perin said. Everyday problems: The study surveyed 157,000 people aged 16 to 65 in more than 20 countries . Some economists say that large skills gap in the United States could matter even more in the future. America's economic competitors like China and India are simply larger than competitors of the past like Japan, Carnevale said. Even while America's top 10 percent of students can compete globally, Carnevale said, that doesn't cut it. China and India did not participate in this assessment. 'The skills in the middle are required and we're not producing them,' Carnevale said. Respondents were selected as part of a nationally represented sample. The test was primarily taken at home using a computer, but some respondents used a printed test booklet. Also among the findings: . - Japan, Finland, Canada, Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Flanders-Belgium, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, and Korea all scored significantly higher than the United States in all three areas on the test. - The average scores in literacy range from 250 in Italy to 296 in Japan. The U.S. average score was 270. (500 was the highest score in all three areas.) Average scores in 12 countries were higher than the average U.S. score. - The average scores in math range from 246 in Spain to 288 in Japan. The U.S. average score was 253, below 18 other countries. - The average scores on problem solving in technology-rich environments scale for adult ranged from 275 in Poland to 294 in Japan. The U.S. average score was 277, below 14 other countries.","United States scored lower than Japan, Canada, Australia and Finland in all three areas .

"By . Daniel Bates In Cleveland, Ohio . and Meghan Keneally . Manipulative: Ariel Castro would reportedly test the kidnapped women to see if they would run when they thought he had left, and then beat them if they did . Local police sources have revealed that suspected kidnapper Ariel Castro would use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried to run free. This is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling. Ariel Castro, the 52-year-old man who lived in the west Cleveland house, was the first of three brothers to be arrested in connection to the case of the three kidnapped young women- Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight- who were rescued on Monday. Reporters from local station WOIO spoke to law enforcement sources who said that he would 'play this little dangerous game that he would tell the women he was about to leave the home, and then he would wait and if one of them tried to open that door, he would go in and attack them.' 'That was one of the ways he was able to keep them there,' reporter Dan Deroos told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The trick clearly contributed to the young womens' captivity, as Berry stressed the fact that she feared his quick return during her frantic 911 call. The hanging chains were also reportedly used during the first few years of captivity, along with frequent beatings. Scene: The women were helped out of this home on Seymour Avenue that belongs to Ariel Castro . Escape route: The front door of a house where the women escaped after a neighbor helped them . 'They were bound and gagged several times throughout the course of being held in that home,' WOIO reports. Another psychological tactic that he used to keep the women in constant fear was the constant threat of violence, and threats to their childrens' lives. While Berry is said to have birthed her six-year-old daughter Jocelyn during her captivity, police are reportedly looking for the bodies of other children who were miscarried or died due to malnutrition. 'Numerous times throughout this 10-year period, that some of the women became pregnant and that they would be beaten, forcibly hit in the stomach to force a miscarriage, if you can imagine that,' WOIO reporter Deroos told CNN. Reunited: Amanda Berry (centre) at the Cleveland . Hospital alongside her emotional sister (left) and the daughter that . she gave birth to during the 10 years she was held against her will . Jocelyn, like her mother, was said to be dehydrated and malnourished, but eventually given the all-clear by a local hospital following their rescue. Other children are thought to have suffered a different fate, as cadaver dogs were brought to the house by investigators searching for the bodies of any other children. The ongoing investigation of the house has led investigators to believe that while the girls were kept on the property by the boarded windows, padlocked doors, and chicken wire-laden fence, they may have been able to access multiple rooms inside the home. Neighbors of Ariel Castro said that when police raided the three-storey property, they went straight upstairs and hauled the girls out. At the top of the property at the back is a smashed window - thought to be the attic - which could have been broken in an attempt to attract attention to themselves or wriggle out to freedom. Investigation: FBI agents remove evidence from . the house where three women who had disappeared as teenagers . approximately ten years ago, were found alive on Monday . The back of the home of Ariel Castro on Seymour Ave: One neighbor says she once saw a little girl looking out of the house's attic window . Locked in: Castro used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in . Ariel Castro, 52 . Pedro Castro, 54 . Onil Castro, 50 . It now appears the girls were not just held in the basement as had previously been thought, but could have had their own room in the four-bedroom house. Newsnet5 reported they could even have been untied at different times rather than being on constant lockdown. MailOnline can also reveal that Ariel Castro, who owned the house and has been arrested along with his two brothers, turned it into a 'fortress' by setting up a stockade round the back. He used chicken wire and blue tarpaulin to make an eight-foot high fence and let the trees and bushes go overgrown so nobody could see in. The house is now the center of an FBI investigation after Berry, 27, DeJesus, 23 and Knight, 30, were all found there after being missing for around ten years. Neighbors said that Ariel Castro used to be seen very often at the property but in recent years had only been there a few times a week, to the extent that it was thought the property was vacant and that he was using it as an investment. Meanwhile, Cleveland police allege, the three girls remained trapped inside, meaning they could have had to wait for days at a time to eat. The back windows of the house are either boarded up or have the curtains drawn and even the large garage style building in the back garden has its windows covered. Found: Amanda Berry (left) and Gina DeJesus (right) were found alive in Cleveland on Monday afternoon . Map: The girls had been held captive in a home less than four miles from where they went missing ten years ago . Israel Lugo, 39, who lives three . houses down from Ariel Castro's home, said that he was just arriving . home yesterday when neighbor Charles Ramsay heard the cries from Amanda . Berry. He said: 'Amanda . Berry was at the front door banging on it and screaming so Chuck . (Charles) pulled it open from the bottom, there was a bit sticking out. 'He . was about to go back in for the other two when the police arrived and . went straight upstairs. She told them that's where the girls were. 'Inside the house there is a staircase up when you go in, and behind it there is one going down. 'On the second floor there are four bedrooms, and then there's the attic at the top. 'The other two girls came right out. Amanda had a kid with her. From what I gather they were being held in separate rooms, not just the basement.' Mr Lugo said that Ariel Castro was 'hiding in plain sight' all these years and that only last Sunday he was in the park with the same child, a girl of six. He said: 'Ariel was acting all happy families, like it was his own daughter. They played with my son's girl and he bought her a pastry at the bakery. 'It was like they were a family. I can't believe it'.","Suspected captor Arial Castro used chains hanging from the ceiling to keep the girls inside the Cleveland home for the first few years .

"By . Daniel Bates In Cleveland, Ohio . and Michael Zennie In Columbus, Ohio . One of the daughters of the man who allegedly kidnapped three girls for 10 years - including her best friend - has called for him to be given the death penalty, MailOnline can reveal. Arlene Castro said that her father Ariel should be executed for what he did to the women. The revelations of her father's alleged involvement in Gina DeJesus' disappearance were particularly devastating, as Arlene and Gina were classmates and close friends before she vanished. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Ariel Castro's daughter Arlene pictured during a Good Morning America interview on Thursday, has called on her father to receive the death penalty . Best of friends: Arlene Castro (right) was the . last person to see Gina DeJesus (left) before she vanished in 2004. Arlene's father Ariel . has been charged in her abduction . Overwhelmed: She said she had no idea that her father was keeping three women locked up in his home . She feels that only the death penalty can make him 'suffer the consequences' for allegedly keeping Gina, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight in captivity for a decade. MailOnline can also reveal that Ariel's five children have vowed never to visit him in prison because they are so disgusted by him. They also look away from the TV whenever he comes on because they are outraged that he 'used' them to find his prey. That the call for Ariel to face the death penalty comes from Arlene is a clear sign of the rage she feels towards her father - but also the guilt at being an unwitting part of his twisted scheme. Family torn apart: Grimilda's sister Elida . Caraballo, pictured right, says her sister, left, would be alive today . if it wasn't for Ariel Castro . Arlene was walking home from school with Gina in 2004 just before she disappeared. Police . say Ariel then offered Gina a ride home but instead took him to his . house in Cleveland, Ohio where she became his slave for the next 10 . years. Arlene was one of . four children born to Ariel and first wife Grimilda Figueroa, who died . last year after years of beatings from him. Ariel and Grimilda Figueroa lived in . an apartment in the second floor of Grimilda’s parents’ house for five . years beginning about 1986.

Both are horrified at their father's alleged crimes . One of the doors that Ariel shut to . keep Grimilda away from her parents remained locked for years after they . left because Ariel took the only key with him, Nancy Figueroa, . Grimilda’s sister-in-law, said. Ariel and Grimilda, nicknamed, . 'Nilda,' moved out in 1992 when Ariel bought the house on Seymour Street . - where he later allegedly held three women against their will for a . decade. Mugshot: Ariel Castro, pictured in his latest booking photo, has been charged with kidnapping and rape offenses . Ismael Figueroa said he confronted . Ariel shortly after he moved in with his daughter because he could hear . the new couple was fighting constantly, but was always locked out from . checking on his own daughter. 'He abused her, hit her. He was not a good man,’ 75-year-old Mr Figueroa said. Mr Figueroa said that Ariel worked to separate his daughter from her family almost as soon as they started dating. Even though she was living in her parents’ house, he said, Ariel would prevent her from seeing her brothers and sisters. In 1993, Grimilda filed a police report, accusing him of savagely beating her while she was recovering from brain cancer. She finally took her four children and left him in 1996. Grimilda died of brain cancer in . April of last year. Ariel and his two brothers, Pedro and Unil, insisted . on attending her funeral. Mr Figueroa was furious. 'He did so much to her. It's disrespectful. And they wouldn’t even take off their hats,' he said. Grimilda’s sister Elida Caraballo remained close with the children and said that they were unable to comprehend what he had done. Family worries: Grimilda (seen wearing red on the far left beside some of her siblings) is Arlene's mother and was reportedly fearful that if she left Castro he would find and kill her . Ties: Elida Carballo, Grimilda's sister, is . pictured right with her daughter Cristina, center and husband Frank, . left in Cleveland . Elida said: 'He used his kids to get to their friends. They feel like they were used just to get to their girls. They're disgusted by it. 'I've spoken to Angie [another of the daughters]. She's traumatized that her dad did this. She's like: 'We're eating dinner and you have those girls in that house? 'You have two faces on. She's like, how could he do that? How? How do you do this? How. Words can't explain how she's feeling. 'Angie says he needs to rot in hell in jail. Rosie [the family name for Arlene] is the one that says death.' Elida's husband Frank said that Arlene might just be angry at the moment and that they might ‘change their way of thinking’ in the weeks to come, but Elida disagreed. She said: ‘My niece [Angie] wants him to rot in jail. She wants him to suffer the consequences of what he's done. Angie says that. Rosie says death. Anguish: Angie Gregg's aunt says that her niece has not yet come to terms with what her father is accused of . 'Angie hasn't come to terms with it.

Just like me, I wake up in the morning and I'm like: 'Oh my god, did this really happen?' And I turn on the TV and it really did. 'It was a shock, it's a shock. 'They're never going to see him, they're never going to see him in there [prison]. If they see him on TV they just turn around. They don't want to see him.' Arlene has already appeared on TV and apologized to the DeJesus family and said that she really wants to see Gina again. In a tearful interview on Good Morning America, she said she was ‘embarrassed’ by her father and appalled at his actions. Angie told CNN's Piers Morgan on Thursday night: 'Everything's making sense now. It's all adding up. And I'm disgusted.' Castro's son, who is also named Ariel but now goes by Anthony, told MailOnline earlier this week that his father 'doesn't deserve to have his own life anymore. Suspicion: Angie Gregg told Piers Morgan that 'it's all adding up' in relation to her father's behavior . Torment: Anthony Castro says that his father 'deserves to be behind bars for the rest of his life' 'He deserves to be behind bars for the rest of his life. I'm just thankful they're alive.' On Wednesday, the mother of Ariel Castro, who was today formally charged with imprisoning three women for a decade, has tearfully apologized for his actions and said she is 'in a lot of pain.' Lillian Rodriguez spoke to reporters from the window of her car as she left her home, which she shares with her son Pedro, who was also arrested in connection with the kidnappings but who has not been charged. 'I am a mother in a lot of pain,' she said in Spanish. 'I am sorry for what my son has done.' She added that she is sorry for the mothers of the three women who were allegedly held captive by her son for 10 years. Apology: Ariel Castro's mother Lillian Rodriguez told reporters on Wednesday that she's sorry for her son's alleged actions . Locked up: Three missing women were found at this home, owned by Castro, in Cleveland on Monday . Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she . vanished in 2004, while another alleged victim Amanda Berry, right, was . 16 when she went missing in 2003. Both women were found on Monday . Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing . Ariel has been charged on kidnapping and rape offenses but according to Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty he could face murder charges if he's implicated in the deaths of the victims' unborn children. These would open up the possibility he will face the death penalty. Ariel was charged on Thursday with kidnapping and raping Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight after the three were found this week inside his house on Cleveland’s West side after there were kidnapped nearly a decade ago. He is being held on $8million bail and prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty if they can prove that he forced his captives to have miscarriages.","Arlene Castro, who was close friends with victim Gina DeJesus, says her father Ariel Castro deserves the death penalty .

"By . Laura Collins In Steubenville, Ohio . The family of the 16-year-old victim in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case says they are 'proud' of  tennis star Serena Williams' apology after she made remarks to Rolling Stone indicating that the girl had invited the assault. 'We just read Serena's updated comments and we're proud of her for correcting and clarifying her prior statements,' the family said, according to a statement issued on their behalf by attorney Bob . Fitzsimmons. 'We are sure Serena has and will continue to use her God-given talents to advance women's equality and send the message that rape is never acceptable under any circumstance. 'We are fans of Serena and will continue rooting for many more championships but more importantly watching her advance the cause of rape victims who are never to blame.' In the Rolling Stone article, Williams was quoted defending the two boys who were found guilty of raping the 16-year-old. Apology: Serena Williams had sparked an intense backlash after she appeared to make an astonishing indictment of the victim in the Steubenville rape case . Outrage: Serena Williams, pictured on Tuesday at Burberry Menswear Spring/Summer 2014 fashion show in London, has sparked outrage with her controversial comments . 'Do you think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know,' she told the magazine. 'I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk . like that, your parents should teach you—don't take drinks from other . people.' 'She's 16, why . was she that drunk where she doesn't remember? It could have been much . worse,' WIlliams added. 'She's lucky. Obviously I don't know, maybe she wasn't a virgin, . but she shouldn't have put herself in that position, unless they slipped . her something, then that's different.' Williams claimed on Wednesday that Rolling Stone misquoted her. 'I . am currently reaching out to the girl's family to let her know that I . am deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article,' she . said. 'What was written - what I supposedly said - is insensitive and . hurtful, and I by no means would say or insinuate that she was at all to . blame.' High school football players Trent . Mays and Ma'Lik Richmond were found guilty and sentenced to juvenile . detention for raping the intoxicated teen. Mays, who was sentenced to a . minimum of two years in juvenile detention, was also found guilty of . disseminating nude images of a minor. The two friends were . caught after other students who watched the assault laughed and joked . about the horrific crime in an online video. Fitzsimmons told MailOnline earlier Wednesday that he was disappointed by Williams' comments in the Rolling Stone article. ‘I don’t know what world Miss Williams is living in but she’s just plain wrong,' Fitzsimmons said of Williams. ‘She did what many people have done for . years which is to turn the blame of rape back on the victim. Rape is . never acceptable under any circumstances. Period.’ ‘I’m actually a bit embarrassed for her for what she has said,' he added. ‘Miss Williams could be an ideal candidate to stand up for women’s rights instead she’s giving this antiquated idea.’ Shocking: Williams said the 16-year-old victim, pictured, 'shouldn't have put herself in that position' Sentenced: Trent Mays, left, and Ma'lik Richmond were sentenced to juvenile detention in March . Addressing Williams' comments about the responsibility of the teen's parents, Fitzsimmons conceded, 'People do have responsibility. But in this particular case... She didn’t get examined until a day and . a half after [the assault] by which time things could have been excreted and the . doctors didn’t test for drugs. ‘The way she became unconscious raised some legitimate questions about how she got to that state, he added. ‘But regardless of whatever occurred there is no reason to allow someone a pass on a rape.’ The assault was made even worse by the fact that it was broadcast on social media, he said. ‘What happened to her was terrible and . afterwards it was compounded by demeaning and degrading her on social . media. It was despicable what those young men did,' he said. He added: ‘I hope Miss Williams reconsiders her views.’ In her statement issued Wednesday, Williams said, 'What happened in Steubenville was a real shock for me. I was deeply saddened. For someone to be raped, and at only sixteen, is such a horrible tragedy! For both families involved - that of the rape victim and of the accused.' She added: 'I have fought all of my career for women's equality, women's equal rights, respect in their fields - anything I could do to support women I have done. My prayers and support always goes out to the rape victim. In this case, most especially, to an innocent sixteen year old child.' Williams released the statement after her remarks to Rolling Stone prompted a wave of criticism on Twitter on Tuesday. One user, Jamil Smith, tweeted: 'Pro tip for @serenawilliams or others discussing rape: if ""I'm not blaming the girl, but…"" exits your mouth, stop there. There is no ""but.""' Huffington Post reporter Sabrina Siddiqui wrote, 'Disappointing that powerful woman like Serena Williams, who many young girls look up to, blames the victim.' Another user ‏tweeted: 'Seems Serena Williams needs a muzzle. Or compassion for a teenage rape victim? Either or...' and a user called JB wrote: 'Hopefully Serena Williams realizes her mess & fixes it. So many women look up to her.' The tennis superstar, who recently won the French Open, put her foot in her mouth in the past. At the 2011 U.S. Open, she was fined for verbally abusing a lineswoman. More recently, the younger Williams sister had a verbal tit for tat with American tennis player Sloane Stephens after the up-and-coming player denied Williams was her mentor, adding that she had never reached out to her. In response, Williams tweeted 'I made you' to Stephens. She was also slammed for doing a Crip Walk synonymous with a dangerous gang in California after she won the Olympic gold in London.","Attorney Bob Fitzsimmons told MailOnline that Williams is turning the 'blame of rape back on the victim'

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A photography series has captured one family's struggle to come to terms with a beloved grandfather's Alzheimer's disease. Called 'Life with Pito,' the photos were taken by Ginger Unzueta, a Central-Florida based photographer. Unzueta felt compelled to begin the project as she saw her father-in-law, nicknamed Pito, struggle with Alzheimer's disease. 'I felt God pushing me to capture him through the lens,' Unzueta writes on her website. 'I wanted to be able to capture moments of him now - not always pretty moments, but his life as it is,' she added. 'I feel our family needs these memories. These memories are a part of his story, just as much as his childhood memories are.' The photos show Pito hugging and embracing loved ones, as well as being guided to help with daily tasks. Unzueta first learned of Pito's diagnosis in 2007, when her husband was overseas in Iraq. During a satellite call to relatives, Unzueta's brother-in-law broke the news, she writes. Unzueta says Pito's case is made worse by the fact that 'his mind was his life.' A doctor, Pito reportedly specialized in pediatrics and sought stimulation, including reading up on medicine playing tennis. Pito's conditon is now so severe, Unzueta says, that he has trouble recognizing his own family. 'Sadly, he has progressed to the point where he mostly doesn't recognize his wife of over 40 years and his four sons,' she writes. 'He now just sits around the house, talking to himself and to the photos on the walls.' Unzueta credits her mother-in-law with the strength to take care of her husband, as well as offer to support other family members with meals and helping take care of children. 'She has good and bad days with Pito, but she says that she would rather have him like this than not at all,' she writes. 'Even through the heartbreak of Pito not recognizing her, the woman he courted as a nurse in the hospital where he worked after graduating from medical school, she still manages to love and serve him.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Banned: Keighley Harris, 21, hurled a flower pot at a window and attacked a police officer in her shoplifting spree . A 21-year-old shoplifter has been banned from every major store in her town after a five-week crime spree. Keighley Harris targeted five different shops, taking a range of items including perfume, hairdryers, saucepans, alcohol and children’s clothes. On one occasion she even hid stolen goods in a wheelchair as she was pushing a male friend – who was only  pretending to be disabled – around a  garden centre. When the pair were challenged by staff Harris threatened to attack them. On another occasion Harris racially abused a police officer who arrested her from her home following a drunken disturbance. Harris, of Worcester, has now been handed a CRASBO for the offences in January this year, banning her from entering two retail parks, two garden centres and two supermarkets in Warndon, a small parish town. She is also banned from using foul abusive or racist language or gestures or being threatening, intimidating or aggressive towards anyone not of the same household as herself. Worcester Magistrates Court heard that on January 4 Harris stole a bottle of whiskey from Tesco in the town. Eight days later on January 12 she stole three hairdryers from Argos. In January 20 she attempted to steal perfume from Asda and three days later she stole saucepans from Homesense. On February 10 she and her male accomplice, Christopher Smith, 32, struck Bessingham garden centre in the town. She has now been handed a CRASBO barring her from two retail parks, two garden centres and two supermarkets . Harris targeted a number of shops in just five weeks, attempting to steal anything from saucepans to perfume . Smith posed as a disabled shopper and was pushed around the store in a wheelchair by Harris. A West Mercia Police spokesman said: 'She had pushed a male accomplice, who was feigning a disability, around in a wheelchair. 'They selected three items of children’s clothing which he [Smith] concealed by sitting on. When challenged she threatened to assault a member of staff.' One another occasion she threw a flower pot at a relative’s window and threatened to burn down another family member’s house. In one incident during the spree this year, she pushed a male accomplice in a wheelchair pretending he was disabled as they spun around the shop trying to hide items in the chair . On April 4 she was handed the CRASBO as well as a 12-month community order, a drug rehabilitation order, a supervision order. She was also handed a 12-week curfew order banning her from going out at night. If Harris breaches the CRASBO she can be jailed for up to five years. Meanwhile Smith, of Worcester, was jailed for four weeks after he admitted three counts of theft, one for the incident with Harris and one of a camera from PC World and another a TV from Sainsburys. He also admitted one count of attempted theft and one of commissioning an offense while serving a suspended sentence.","Keighley Harris, 21, threatened staff, attacked police and threatened arson .

"By . Sean Poulter . On guard: BT claims its new handset, the BT6500, can block 80 per cent of nuisance calls . Families have been handed a new weapon to block unwanted phone calls. BT has launched the BT6500 telephone which, the company claims, will stop the menace of silent calls, withheld numbers, and overseas marketing scams. Users can also programme specific numbers that they want blocked. Rogue firms, many of them based in India, are responsible for a very large proportion of the nuisance calls to consumers. They target individuals with bogus promises of refunds on the mis-selling of payment protection insurance or compensation for accidents. The aim is to create a lucrative list of names and contact details that can be sold on to claims management companies who then take up the cases and charge huge fees. The BT6500 will give users the power to block up to 80 per cent of unwanted calls, according to the company. Frustrated customers are making more than 50,000 calls to its Nuisance Calls Advice Line each month. At the same time the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, has revealed it is getting around 3,400 complaints a month about silent calls, which are particularly disturbing. These are caused by call centre computers which automatically dial thousands of numbers at once. Of those who receive silent calls, 57 per cent receive five or more a month, causing annoyance and, in many cases, distress and anxiety. Peace: The new phone from BT helps households block unwanted calls from international and unwanted callers, like those from PPI claims firms . Ofcom has revealed that just over seven in ten people have received live marketing calls on their fixed-line phone in the past six months. Older people are more likely to have been affected, with four in five aged 65-74 receiving these types of calls. The BT6500 allows users to choose to block calls from numbers without a caller ID, plus so-called withheld numbers and those from overseas. The handset also allows users to block up to ten specific numbers. It also has a ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode, which switches off the ringer and can either be operated manually or set by a timer. Important calls from friends and family can still get through if they are saved to a list of VIP contacts. The BT6500 is also equipped with parental controls which can stop outgoing calls to selected numbers, such as premium, mobile and international numbers. John Petter, managing director of BT’s consumer division, said: ‘When people feel as though they are being harassed in their own homes they need to be able to take action. We believe this phone gives customers the peace of mind that when the phone rings it should be someone they want to speak to.’ The BT6500 costs £44.99 for a single phone, £69.99 for two, £89.99 for three and £109.99 for four.","Company claims BT6500 will block silent calls, withheld numbers and scams .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . Pupils in England are among the worst-behaved in the developed world, research has found. The Government and Ofsted ‘seriously underestimate’ the scale of classroom indiscipline, which affects nearly all schools, says a study. Even many institutions which are popular and over-subscribed are plagued by bad behaviour. The worst schools suffer disruption every day, getting in the way of learning. Picture posed by models . Schools with the worst problems face serious disruption every day – pupils screaming obscenities, threatening staff, swearing, spitting and refusing to behave when asked. Poor parenting and pressure on schools to avoid expelling troublemakers are thought to be fuelling the crisis. But the Department for Education and Ofsted seem unaware of the extent of classroom disruption – claiming that behaviour in 99.7 per cent of schools is satisfactory. Professor Terry Haydn, an education expert at the University of East Anglia, cited international evidence that teachers in England face more difficult pupil behaviour than in many rival nations. His research highlighted findings from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which administers the world’s biggest education survey, known as PISA. OECD members include most of the world’s wealthy nations. ‘Some data from PISA research …  suggests that teachers in England may be teaching in more difficult contexts than their counterparts elsewhere,’ his report says. England, for example, slumped to 32nd place out of 38 for the proportion of students who reported that ‘their teachers never or rarely have to wait long for them to quieten down’. Behaviour problems could explain Britain's falling test scores, experts claim. Picture posed by models . A further PISA report found that in England, 31 per cent of pupils report that ‘in most or all lessons there is noise and disorder’. Professor Haydn suggests the poor behaviour may partly explain the superior performance of countries such as China and Japan in international school tests. Many lessons in England are simply designed to keep control and involve ‘defensive’ strategies such as using textbooks and worksheets or showing the pupils a television programme, he says. Testimonies from teachers paint a disturbing picture of behaviour in some schools . His paper, published today in the journal Review of Education, is based on four studies conducted over ten years. Three focused on teacher perspectives of behaviour while the fourth surveyed 700 secondary school pupils. Testimonies from teachers paint a disturbing picture of behaviour in some schools. One said: ‘It is a condition of working at this school that you have to face serious disruption on a daily basis, pupils screaming obscenities, refusing to comply with requests to stop appalling behaviour, threatening, spitting, swearing. ‘You feel wretched for the poor kids who would like to learn.’ Study blames poor parenting and refusal to expel problem pupils. Picture posed by models . Professor Haydn’s study found that ‘at least to some extent, behaviour was an issue which affected most schools’. It added: ‘One of the most striking aspects of the teacher testimony was the number of teachers who had obtained posts in popular, over-subscribed schools, but nonetheless admitted to having to work hard to get complete control of some of their classes.’ It also exploded the myth that poor behaviour is mainly a problem in inner-city schools. ‘Small semi-rural schools also encountered significant problems with poor pupil behaviour,’ it said. Professor Haydn said Department for Education claims – based on Ofsted findings – that behaviour in 99.7 per cent of schools was satisfactory, and good or better in 92 per cent, were misleading.","Government and Ofsted underestimate lack of discipline, says study .

"By . Associated Press . Bail has been set at $6million for Megan Huntsman, a mother in Utah who was arrested Sunday after  police found the bodies of her six babies she has admitted to killing. Huntsman, 39, told police she either strangled or suffocated six of her babies immediately after they were born. She wrapped their bodies in a towel or a shirt, put them in plastic bags and then packed them inside boxes in the garage of her home south of Salt Lake City. The body of a seventh child was found in . garage but it appears to have been stillborn, so she is not being . charged in that death. Huntsman was seen wearing a blue prison-issued jumpsuit during a closed circuit court appearance on Monday and alternated between covering her eyes and blinking, emotionless. Emotionless: Megan Huntsman, seen here in her Sunday mugshot, answered quickly during a closed-circuit feed with a judge at the bail hearing on Monday . The Salt Lake Tribune reported that . she starred blankly at Judge Steven Hansen when he told her that she was . going to have her bail set at $6million because she is a 'flight risk . and because of this heinous, horrible crime'. 'That's fine,' she said. 'This is a little shocking because of the number of babies that were killed,' Judge Buhman added. While . she has reportedly admitted that she gave birth and then killed the . babies herself over the course of 10 years, she has not gone into any . detail about why she did so. According to a probable cause statement released by police Monday, Huntsman said she gave birth to at least seven babies between 1996 and 2006 at her former home in Pleasant Grove, a leafy, sleepy town about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City. All but one of them was born alive, she said. Hiding: Several people, including this person in sweat pants, were seen taking bags of items from the home where the grisly discovery was made on Sunday . Connections: Megan Huntsman is in jail but she and her estranged husband have three teenage and adult daughters, though the young woman seen leaving the home has not been identified . Getting out of the house: A friend was seen helping the person in sweats get bags out of the home on Monday . Her estranged husband, Darren West, made the discovery Saturday morning while cleaning out the garage of the house, which is owned by his parents. He called Huntsman, who admitted to him it was her baby, according to court documents. West called police, who then found the bodies in the garage. Investigators believe Huntsman is the mother of them all based on what she has told them but have ordered DNA tests to make sure that's the case. Huntsman's three daughters — one teenager and two young adults — also lived in the house. It could take weeks to get the results, Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman said. Questions: Huntsman's youngest daughter, who is in junior high, was born during the same time period when she murdered her other babies and it is not clear why she was spared (an unidentified person pictured above at the family home on Monday) 'How can you have a baby and not have . evidence and other people know?' asked neighbor SanDee Wall. 'You can't . plan when a baby is going to come. Just the thought of somebody putting a . baby into a box is a heartbreaker.' Investigators believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born, but don't believe he was aware of the killings. Buhman said Huntsman is the principle suspect, but didn't rule out more arrests as the investigation continues. Police declined to discuss whether West or the three daughters have been interviewed. Under investigation: Police were called to the house on Sunday after her estranged husband found one of the dead babies after following a 'pungent' smell in their garage . Breaking it down: Many of the contents of the house were seen strewn across the front lawn on Monday (pictured) as police continue to investigate the case . Heartbreaking: Huntsman and her estranged husband had three daughters together and some items from their childhood were seen on the family's lawn as the investigation continued Monday . West pleaded guilty in federal court in 2005 to two counts of possessing chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine, according to court records. In August 2006, he was sentenced to 9 years in prison, but appealed three times. As he maintained his innocence, Huntsman wrote a letter asking a federal judge to consider leniency at sentencing. 'Darren is a remarkable man, husband, brother, son, son-in-law, friend and father of our three beautiful daughters,' she wrote, continuing, . 'Please we need this guy to keep our family together.' Neighbor Sharon Chipman said the couple married young, and Huntsman never worked except for a short stint at a grocery store. Horrible job: An unidentified man was seen going in and out of the Pleasant Grove house on Monday . The three daughters who were living in the house were good young women who have turned out remarkably well considering their father has been in prison, Chipman and Wall said. West's parents have played an influential role in their upbringing, especially the youngest, who is still in junior high. Wall said she's puzzled about why Huntsman would have killed the babies, especially considering her youngest daughter, now a young teen, was born during the decade Huntsman told authorities she killed the other babies. 'Why was one of them saved?' Wall said. Most women who kill their children do so by neglect and or on purpose, such as Andrea Yates, the Texas woman who drowned her five children in her bathtub in 2001, said Cheryl Meyer, a psychology professor at Ohio's Wright State University. Meyer said another common category is the 'concealer' — a woman who hides or denies her pregnancy and then seeks to dispose of the baby after it's born. Thin: Huntsman, seen in this 2010 photo with two unidentified individuals, has reportedly admitted to giving birth and strangling or suffocating all of the children between 1996 and 2006 . What she did: Huntsman has been charged with six counts of murder, but it is unclear why she has not been charged with seven since that many bodies were found . Meyer said the concealer is typically a teenager who does not repeat the act. 'These are usually girls who are 17, get pregnant, become scared to death and don't want to tell their parents,' said Meyer, who has written about mothers who kill their children. 'They're not 30-year-old women who can go have an abortion.' To combat this, all states, including Utah, have safe haven laws that allow women to drop off unwanted newborns to authorities with no questions asked. The mother can remain anonymous as long as the child has not been subject to abuse or neglect. In coming days, defense attorneys for Huntsman are likely to closely examine her background to search for any evidence of mental illness or a family history that would help explain the alleged killings, said George Parnham, who represented Yates at her criminal trial. Defense attorneys also will try to determine whether Huntsman sought an abortion and if she told anyone about her pregnancies — all in hopes of understanding actions that otherwise appear incomprehensible, Parnham said. 'You start off with the very nature of what happened. Is there a rational motive?' he said.","Megan Huntsman was emotionless when she appeared via video link of her bail hearing on Monday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Angry: Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, pictured, has launched a $56 million lawsuit after his plans to build a basketball and barn on his sprawling property in the Hamptons were rejected . Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick has launched a $56 million lawsuit after his plans to build a basketball court and barn on his sprawling property in the Hamptons were rejected. The billionaire is furious after the zoning, planning, and farming advisory boards refused to allow the development on the 40-acre Bridgehampton property he bought in 2003 for $15 million. To display the extent of his wrath for the Southampton Town municipal boards, he's launched two separate federal lawsuits against not only the boards but their individual members, according to The New York Post. 'He's basically saying this is war - he's had enough,' one of the sued parties told The Post. 'When you own a property like that you don't like to be told what you can or can't do on it.' The source described the unusual act of going after board members as 'intimidation. Plain and simple.' It's not unusal for the boards to be sued as a whole when rich Hampton homeowners don't get their way when it comes to zoning. The finance boss filed a $36 million suit against the zoning board last week in Eastern District federal court for the basketball rejection specifically. He claims in the suit that his purchase of the land gives him the land rights to a single-family home and 'recreational' uses. But the zoning board said no. 'It is our position that a basketball . court is not a compatible recreational use of an agriculturally . protected area,' Devitt Spellman Barrett attorney David Arntsen told The . Post. The billionaire is furious after the zoning, planning, and farming advisory boards refused to allow the development on the 40-acre Bridgehampton property he bought in 2003 for $15 million . The multimillion dollar suit came on the back of a $20 million one Lutnick filed against the Southampton Town planning board and farming advisory board earlier this year, taking aim at the rejection of a sizable barn. The boards claimed a proposed 11,200 square-foot barn was too big and would only be approved if it was reduced to just 2,400 square-foot. According to the New York Daily News, Lutnick did downsize the structure and offered to move it to a different location on the estate. Lutnick's lawyer David Neufeld told the Daily News the officials were being 'unbelievable.' 'If you're offended by a basketball court 40 acres away, there aren't many places on Suffolk County that you could live,' Neufeld said. 'It's pretty unbelievable what they (Southampton officials) can do.' The mansion on the property includes a swimming pool, spa and tennis court. The banking boss also wanted to build a 3-acre apple orchard, and a vineyard.","Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick has launched two lawsuits worth $56 million over his 40-acre property in Bridgehampton .

"By . Jenny Awford . and Maureen Sugden . A teenage girl has died and four other people were in hospital last night amid fears that they took illegal party drug mephedrone. Helen Henderson, 19, fell ill at a house on Sunday night and died a short time later. Her death comes as a global drug survey shows that Britain is the legal highs capital of the world, with more than one in ten people having tried dangerous new substances. Helen Henderson who died at a house party in Renfrew near Glasgow after taking mephedrone and ketamine . Her death comes as a global drug survey shows that Britain is the legal highs capital of the world, with more than one in ten people having tried dangerous new substances . The study also found that people in the UK take more drugs of any kind – both illegal and legal – than any other country in the world. Last night, as Police Scotland issued a warning that people are risking their lives by taking illicit substances, family and friends paid tribute to Miss Henderson. On Facebook, her father, Alex, said: ‘Well family and friends my oldest daughter sadly passed away last night, now she is with the family and the angels. ‘You will be sadly missed by your family, love you so much, I hope you knew that, love Dad. Until we meet again sweetheart.’ Her stepmother, Sharon Newton, wrote: ‘Well to everyone we know, we sadly lost Alex daughter and my stepdaughter, taken away too young. G.B.N.F [Gone but not forgotten]. Miss you loads xxx.’ Her sister ChelseaLee Henderson added on Facebook: ‘Times like this family means everything, thanks for the nice messages everyone, such nice day today. Rest in peace Helen Louise Henderson my angel.’ Miss Henderson fell ill at around 10.15pm on Sunday at an address in Paisley Road, Renfrew. She died in the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley a short time later. wo other women, aged 18 and 19, and two men, 24 and 31, were taken to hospital, where they are being treated for the effects of drug . Two other women at the house, aged 18 and 19, and two men, aged 24 and 31, were taken to hospital and are being treated after showing symptoms consistent with drug misuse, police said. Officers believe they may have taken the lethal drug mephedrone – which has the street names MCAT, meow meow or bubble. The teenager’s death comes two months after schoolgirl Regane MacColl, 17, of Clydebank, Dunbartonshire, died after taking a Mortal Kombat ecstasy tablet in the Arches nightclub,  Glasgow. In March, teenager Jack Blades, of Airdrie, Lanarkshire, was left fighting for his life after apparently taking a Mortal Kombat pill at a house party. The 16-year-old has since made a full recovery. Earlier this month, father of two Paul Stokes, 39, was left fighting for his life in hospital after swallowing ecstasy tablets outside the Arches. He has since recovered. Police Scotland yesterday warned revellers that ‘no one can predict the risks involved’ in drugtaking. Chief Inspector Arlene Smith said: ‘Extensive inquiries are continuing into the circumstances of the woman’s death and, although unconfirmed, one of the lines of inquiry is that prior to her taking unwell she may have taken an illegal substance. ‘Given that other people have also fallen ill and are currently in hospital, Police Scotland has taken the decision to issue a warning. ‘At this time, it may be that the drug involved is MCAT. However, witnesses believe that the woman may have also taken ketamine. Campaigners blame more than 50 deaths a year on legal highs, including Adam Hunt, 18, of Southampton, and Hester Stewart, 21, of Brighton. Ministers have already introduced bans on some legal highs, including mephedrone — known as meow meow — NBOMe and Benzofury. A ban on synthetic stimulant mephedrone came into force across the UK in 2010. The drug is now a Class B substance, along with its associated compounds. Earlier this year the Mail revealed that there had been a huge surge in the number of deaths from other legal highs. Ninety seven people were found dead with the substances in their system in 2012, up from 12 in 2009. It means the toll has risen by eight times in three years.In around two-thirds of cases, the post-mortem examination established that the legal high was the direct cause of death. A Home Office-appointed review is expected to report in late spring. ‘MCAT is the street name for mephedrone. This is a class B drug which is sold in the form of white powder or capsules. Police Scotland is issuing a warning to anyone who has obtained or taken this or similar substances. Do not take illicit drugs and stay away from any unknown substances. No one can predict the risks involved or the serious consequences.’ Officers also appealed for anyone with information to come forward. Police Scotland said a post- mortem will be carried out and that Miss Henderson’s death is being treated as unexplained. A neighbour at the flat in Paisley Road, Marie Stuart, 39, said she was shocked by the death. She added: ‘I saw all the police cars and ambulances but I had no idea that someone died. ‘Helen was such a lovely girl, this really is tragic. It must have been a bad batch of drugs. I hope everyone else involved is all right.’ Another neighbour, Angela Liu, 35, said: ‘There was absolute chaos on Sunday night, at least six police cars and four ambulances. ‘I think it must have been quite a party house. I could always hear loud music and see lots of people going round. This is very upsetting, especially as she was so young.’ The Global Drug Survey, released yesterday, found that nearly a quarter of people in Britain asked said they had bought drugs over the internet, compared to only 14 per cent in the US and 4 per cent of people in New Zealand. Dr Adam Winstock, an addiction specialist who founded the Global Drug Survey, said: ‘The fact that 44 per cent who bought drugs online said they’d done it for the first time recently says to me there is growing recruitment. ‘It is currently a minority way to get drugs, but it really mimics the growth in e-commerce. We buy things online because it is convenient, cheap, and there is a better product range. ‘We come out as some of the largest drug takers, taking a broader range of drugs that are reasonably cheap.’","Helen Henderson, 19, fell ill at house on Sunday night and died shortly later .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Two stars of popular new reality series Southern Charm whose pregnancy false alarm became a major story arc really did have a baby. Thomas Ravenel, 51, and much younger girlfriend Kathryn Dennis, 22, became parents despite an  episode in which Dennis' pregnancy test came back negative that aired on Bravo, TMZ is reporting. The two reportedly kept their reality TV tryst going after cameras stopped rolling and began shacking up in Palm Beach, Florida. On March 24, the South Carolina celebutante gave birth to a healthy baby girl named Kensington. Scroll down for video... May-December: 50-year-old Ravenel's relationship with the 22-year-old local celebutante immediately raised eyebrows at garden parties across Charleston, South Carolina. Now they'll be raising a child . A recent multi-episode arc of their . southern-gentry-on-the-rocks docuseries showcased Dennis' pregnancy . scare, though it remained unclear if it was Ravenel who was the . potential father or fellow star and self-proclaimed rascally raconteur . Shep Rose. Lucky for everyone, except perhaps the show's rabid fans, Dennis did not end up being pregnant. At least not at the time. The high-drama duo stole away to Florida, where they continue to live as a couple, where the baby was presumably conceived. While Ravenel seemed extremely relieved when his gal pal's test came back negative, he told BravoTV's The Dish that he felt the opposite when he met his bouncing baby girl. 'It's really a blessing,' he said. 'It's one of the greatest creations one could ever hope to be apart of!' In fact, it was the scare itself that showed Ravenel just how much having a baby with Dennis would mean to him. Happy family: The happy couple say their families are happy with the new addition, despite both being from conservative southern families. Her family, who live in this large but well-worn South Carolina home, were especially happy and visited the baby the day it was born . Rags to riches? The millionaire former politician met Dennis' family, who live two miles out a dirt road, not long after her original pregnancy scare . Faithful: A recent episode of Southern Charm introduced viewers to Dennis's faithful family, including her grandmother (center) and mother and father . Welcome to the family! The grandmother's advice when she learned of Dennis' relationship with a rich older man: Start taking pre-natal vitamins . 'I'm getting on in my age and I wanted a child,' he said. 'And after we had wrapped up shooting in Charleston, we had both decided we wanted to have a baby for real. We both love each other and care about each other.' The new mom is doing well, too, Ravenel said. 'She has tremendous motherly instincts,' he said. 'She's been constantly reading books about babies and doing her homework. She is all over her new responsibilities. 'She has the energy and the mindset to make sure the baby is well taken care of. I've really grown to respect and admire her.' So will the happy couple be getting married any time soon? 'We've been talking about it,' he said. 'Eventually I'd like to get married. All I can say is stay tuned.' For now, they're just focused on learning to be parents. 'Kensington is starting to make her needs known—I need ear plugs,' he said. 'But everyone's healthy and happy and we're just blessed.' It's worth noting that the season finale of Southern Charm is slated to document the Charleston, South Carolina gang's July 4 exploits, which would have been right around the time the new parents would have finally gotten their positive pregnancy results. It airs April 21 at 10/9c. Fertile for ground for drama: Dennis and Ravenel have a knack for having fun both separately and together. Here, the recent episode that showed the couple in a doctor's office as they anxiously awaited Dennis' pregnancy test results . Meanwhile, . and despite not actually being a main cast member, Dennis' presence on . the show is fertile ground for cultivating the canniest of drama, . intrigue and southern seduction. When the local celebutante, political . scion and model was hauled into Berkeley County jail for underage . drinking and disorderly conduct in 2012, authorities snapped the sexy . mugshot of the century. For fans wondering how Dennis gets to . join the soapy series' main cast members in their drunken antics: the . 5-foot-11 redhead turned 21 by the time she showed up to heighten the . show's already impossibly high drama. New parents: Ravenel once served months in prison on felony cocaine charges and recently pleaded guilty to a DUI. Dennis has had some issues with the law, herself. This 2012 mugshot was snapped after she was hauled in for underage alcohol possession and disorderly conduct . Dennis . may just be the perfect match for millionaire former real estate . developer turned felon Ravenel, even with the 30-year age gap. Like Dennis, Ravenel also has a history of booze-fueled lawbreaking. He pleaded guilty just last March to driving drunk while summering in East Hampton, New York last July. The . former Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign chairman had his license . suspended for six months and was fined $1,400, according to the Post and . Courier. While clearly a lot of fun while apart, Ravenel and Dennis know how to have a good time while together, as well. Not the father: Another Southern Hospitality cast member, self-proclaimed rascally raconteur Shep Rose was also worried he was the father of Dennis' baby, but she wasn't actually pregnant at the time . Like gentlemen: In an encounter unrelated to the pregnancy, Ravenel invited fellow cast member Whitney Sudler-Smith to 'take it outside,' where he accused the show's resident southern dandy of sleeping with Dennis . Dramatic turn: Dennis and Ravenel's romance has also created a stir outside the various love triangles . Talking trash: The pair drew snickers and sideways glances upon their arrival at a friend's party . THOMAS RAVENEL: THE ONCE AND FUTURE SOUTH CAROLINA POLITICAL POWER PLAYER? Thomas Ravenel . Ravenel, who's 48 according to his BravoTV bio but 51 if you prefer to believe news outlets such as the Associated Press, was once a major up-and-coming force in Palmetto State politics. The millionaire former real estate developer held the state-wide elected office of South Carolina Treasurer and had served as chairman for Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign in the state before he was brought down hard in a cocaine scandal. Ravenel was indicted on federal drug charges in 2007 for buying less than 500 grams of cocaine to share with other people in late 2005. He was sentenced in 2008 to 10 months after his felony conviction. And what about now? Besides the Bravo gig, or perhaps because of it, Ravenel is reportedly eying a dive back into politics. The Republican ex-con told Andy Cohen early this month that he likely intends to run for U.S. Senate. 'And should the current U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham be the nominee, I’m going to throw my hat into the ring as a candidate because I think the voters need the opportunity to have a choice,' he said on Watch What Happens Live. Kathryn Dennis . KATHRYN CALHOUN DENNIS: POLITICAL SCION, MODEL, CELEBUTANTE, SEDUCTRESS . Kathryn Dennis raised the eyebrows of Charleston, South Carolina's garden-partying elite when she dropped onto the scene as Ravenel's girlfriend, but it's not her first lap around the disgraced politician dating pool. The 22-year-old was once involved with Thad Viers, a former state representative who resigned his office in disgrace in 2012 after he was arrested for harassing an ex-girlfriend. Her politico predilections may stem from her background as the daughter of two prominent political families. Dennis' grandfather was celebrated state politician Rembert C. Dennis and she claims to be a descendant of America's seventh vice president John C. Calhoun (hence the middle name).","Former South Carolina Treasurer Thomas Ravenel welcomed a baby girl with Kathryn Dennis welcomed Kensington Calhoun Ravenel March 24 .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Six years after his daughter was adopted without his knowledge or consent, Robert Manzanares is getting to spend spring break with her. Mr Manzanares has been fighting for custody of his daughter since before she born, but despite a Utah court dismissing the adoption two years ago, the case is still not over. When the case went back to a Colorado court however, the judge ruled that Mr Manzanares should share custody with his daughter's adoptive parents. Legal fight: Robert Manzanares is pushing for full custody of his daughter after her adoption was dismissed but a judge ruled she should remain with the couple she was given to . 'Basically, I've got out-of-state father visitation,' he told Mail Online. 'I was hoping for sole custody. It was a little shocking that they ruled for joint. 'The danger is they're ignoring my constitutional rights to my daughter,' he added. 'It's like what they are saying is if a case is in court long enough, the child will probably stay in the new home. 'One of the problems, through all this . fraud and lies is they are given primary care and no attention is paid to . how she got [to be with the adopted family]. It has tainted her relationship with me, her father.' The court in Colorado who ruled for joint custody stated that Kaia's adoptive family were her 'psychological parents' because theirs is the only home she has known. The process in which Kaia came to be given away despite Mr Manzanares' requests for custody before she was born, led Utah to dismiss the adoption because of fraud. The ruling means that Mr Manzanares has been forced to appeal the decision, leaving him and his daughter in a legal limbo that keeps them apart. Currently he has shared parental rights, meaning he is involved with decisions about her life and education, but Kaia remains living with her adoptive family. The confusing case and Mr Manzanares fight for the right to bring up his daughter, began when his partner told him she was pregnant and that she wanted to give the baby away. Even after they separated during her pregnancy, Mr Manzanares tried to remain as involved as possible and helped financially. Questions: Robert Manzanares says as his daughter, Kaia, gets older it gets harder to explain why she isn't living with her father . But, on the same day he filed a paternity petition in a Colorado court, his ex-girlfriend was signing adoption papers for their daughter in Utah. He only discovered his baby had been born prematurely when a friend called to say his ex-girlfriend had returned to work and was no longer pregnant. On the advice of her Bishop, his ex had been told if she let the little girl be adopted by a Mormon family she would be accepted back into the church. Kaia was adopted by the woman's brother - a situation that makes the custody battle even more confusing for the child. 'It's very hard on her and had to try to explain who her real family is. We tell her we all love her and want to be part of her life,' Mr Manzanares, who is not Mormon, said. 'It gets harder and harder as she gets smarter and smarter. It will be hard on her to read the public records.' He added that the details of the protracted custody battle are all easily available, meaning that as his daughter grows up she will easily be able to find them. What will also be hard for her to come to terms with is that her biological mother, who she knows as an aunt, had another child after Kaia was born, and decided to keep that baby. For Mr Manzanares however, all that matters is spending as much time as possible with Kaia, and working to get full custody of her. The latest - and hopefully final - appeal has been filed, and supporters of the family are able to make donations to a Go Fund Me page to help towards the legal costs. He is also suing the state of Utah and his ex-girlfriend and her family for allowing the adoption to go ahead despite him making it clear that he wanted to raise his own daughter.","Mother secretly gave baby away despite father wanting to care for her .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A high school cheerleader whose dad secretly filmed her in her bedroom and the bathroom has revealed that she has forgiven him - and even encouraged her mother not to file for a divorce. Michaela Smith, from Pell City, Alabama, was just 15 when she saw a red flashing light between her trophies in her bedroom in April 2011 and realized it was a camera. Investigations revealed that her father, Michael Smith, had filmed her on four separate occasions and stashed the images on his computer. He was jailed for a year. Now Michaela, who is 18, has spoken out as she receives the Bryant-Jordan Student-Athlete Achievement Award, which honors student-athletes who have overcome hardship, on Monday. Ordeal: Michaela Smith, a high school cheerleader in Alabama, has said she forgives her father for recording her in her bedroom and in the bathroom - a crime that saw him locked up for a year . Even though she was initially distraught that her father had recorded her, she said she has since learned to forgive him because the experience has allowed her to help other victims. 'I lost my innocence that day,' Michaela, who does not believe in sex before marriage, told AL.com. 'I realize it was horrible but it was a necessary price . in order to help my father and to use this experience to help others. That sacrifice has created positive changes in so many other people.' Now that he has been in prison, he realizes what he has done wrong, she said. 'Sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom . for us to make a change and that is what happened to my father,' she . said. 'I am so thankful for the year he spent in prison because it truly . saved his life.' Michaela also described her horror when she changed from her church clothes into a more comfortable t-shirt - and saw the camera flashing. Her mother was also in the room and said she immediately feared the worst, but tried to cover up her bad thoughts, for Michaela's sake. Support: Her mother Rhonda, left, walked out on her father when they discovered he had been filming Michaela, but she has not divorced him and they still attend the same church . 'I said something like I put it up there while I was cleaning and didn't know how to shut it off,' Rhonda said. 'I didn't want to worry her.' But she told her other daughter, Janet, who asked a friend adept at computer forensics for help and pictures of Michaela were later found on her father's computer. He was arrested in April 2011 and indicted the following November. 'This man was supposed to protect me from all the bad in the world,' Michaela said. 'He put that camera in my room and had been using it to look at me for months. I've never felt so destroyed.' Ahead of the incident - when her mother was struggling to cope with her father's drinking - Michaela had told her mother that she didn't want her to get a divorce. 'Families are supposed to stick together,' she said. 'Marriages are not easy. A man and wife should stay together. They made a promise to God. There is always counseling and help if things get bad.' But her mother wishes she had stayed with her gut instinct and divorced him. Still, she remains married to him and they attend the same church. Forgiving: Michaela said that she realizes her father had hit rock bottom and is aware of how much he hurt their family. She said she is thankful for the incident because it has allowed her to help other victims . Moving on: Michaela, pictured with fellow cheerleaders, missed a lot of school amid the stress of the case but has maintained a solid GPA and now hopes to attend Auburn following her senior year . Michaela said she never blamed her mother for staying with her father, calling her 'the best thing in my world'. As the case dragged on, Michaela struggled to eat or sleep and rarely attended school. Her father had been bailed out by wealthy relatives, and she lived in fear she would see him. After her father was sentenced, she started therapy and realized that she could take her bad experiences and use them to help others at church groups, youth groups and after school. Her father was released from prison last March but if he tries to speak with her, he will be sent back. This arrangement could change with Michaela's consent - but she said she is not ready yet. He told AL.com that he had long struggled with an addicted to pornography and regretted how it had destroyed his family. He said he had not watched it since his wife and daughter left him three years ago. His daughter said she is now looking forward to attending Auburn and perhaps studying social work.","Michaela Smith was just 15 when she spotted a camera recording her after she undressed in her bedroom .

"By . Joel Christie . An Ivy League lawyer convicted of beating and strangling his girlfriend to death in their Queens apartment has been sentenced to life without parole, a judge ruled Tuesday. Jason Bohn, 35, was found guilty last month of first-degree murder in the brutal June 2012 slaying of Danielle Thomas, a financial analyst for Weight Watchers who was killed in the Astoria home she shared with Bohn. She died of neck compression and blunt-force trauma, had lacerations on her face, mouth and chest and was found lying in a bath full of ice. Before the sentence was handed down, the court heard from Thomas' family, with the words of her grandmother, Juanita Hardgrove, causing Bohn to break down in tears, The New York Post reported. Scroll down for video . Life without parole: Jason Bohn (left), was found guilty of strangling his girlfriend Danielle Thomas (right) and will be behind bars for the rest of his life . Sentenced: Jason Bohn, pictured, was emotional in court on Tuesday . Guilty: Bohn apologized before he was sentenced, saying 'I don't know what to say. I don't know how this happened' Emotional: Bohn is seen tearing up in court in this photograph as he apologizes to the family of slain girlfriend Danielle Thomas . 'I’m a cancer survivor, and I thought that hearing I had cancer would be the worse news until I got that call that you murdered my precious Dani,' Hardgrove said. 'Only a bully and coward would do this to such a beautiful woman. 'We couldn’t even see her face in the casket to say goodbye because of what you did to her body but her spirit will last with us always.' Thomas' mother, Jaime Thomas-Bright, said that despite being a victim of constant abuse at the hands of Bohn, her daughter still wanted to marry the man she loved. 'I once asked Danielle three weeks before you killed her if you’d propose what she’d say,' Thomas-Bright said in a victim’s impact statement . 'And she smiled and said ''yes''.' Thomas' grandmother Juanita Hardgrov, pictured, said in court 'Only a bully and coward would do this to such a beautiful woman' Heartbreaking: Jamie Thomas-Bright, Thomas' mother, said 'Life will never be good for me ever again' 'Life will never be good for me ever again. 'I’ll never get to be a grandmother and, Judge Aloise, I think I would have been a great grandma. I dread getting old.' Bohn tearfully apologized before he was sentenced, saying, through tears: 'I don't know what to say. I don't know how this happened.' What made the murder of Thomas even more harrowing was how close she came to escaping her dangerous partner. Weeks prior to her death, Thomas told police Bohn had beaten her a month earlier, leaving her on crutches and with two black eyes, NBC New York reported. He called her cellphone while she was at the police station and Thomas put it on speaker, allowing detectives to hear Bohn threaten to bash her skull in and 'hunt her down like a dog'. Weeks prior to her death, Thomas told police Bohn had beaten her a month earlier . Convicted: Bohn reportedly broke an order of protection when he killed girlfriend Danielle Thomas in 2012 . Bohn and his defense team claimed it was manslaughter, but the jury did not believe them . Captured: Bohn is brought into Queens Supreme Court in handcuffs on July 23, 2012 after the body of his girlfriend was found. He has been sentenced to life without parole for her murder . Brutal death: Danielle Thomas had moved from Florida to New York to be with her boyfriend in Queens . Bohn was arrested that day and Thomas was granted an order of protection. Charges of assault and aggravated harassment were pending against him when she died. Prosecutors revealed in Janaury that, on the night she died, Thomas had returned home to protect her dog, Schnoozer, even though a friend had offered to take her to a hotel. Prosecutor Patrick O'Connor told the jury panel that Bohn had threatened to kill the black-and-white pooch in the past, and Thomas rushed home in a bid to save her pet. ‘It was for the love of her dog,’ the prosecutor said. ‘She was afraid for her dog.’ One of the most compelling pieces of evidence an unintentional voicemail, wherein Thomas could be heard saying 'I can't breathe' as Bohn strangled her. Loss: Bohn blamed Thomas' lying, stress, . alcohol and his own abusive past for the murder; in court, the . prosecution said the 27-year-old rushed home to protect her dog, . Schnoozer (right), from Bohn . On the chilling recording, a man . believed to be Bohn relentlessly questions why Thomas made a phone call . to a number with a 508 area code. Bohn is then heard strangling the 27-year-old before letting go as she pleads with him and tries to answer his questions, DNAinfo New York reported. She struggles to breath as she answers over and over: 'I don't know... Jason, I love you.' He then replies: 'You have five seconds and then...and then I'm going to kill you. He continues: 'I'm going to let you up and then you need to answer quickly or else you die... Danielle, why did you call that number? 'Danielle you are so stupid. You think I'm going to stop, I won't stop.' It is unclear whether the voicemail came from the victim or alleged killer's cellphone. Missed: Bohn, right, had been violent in the . past and Miss Thomas (pictured left with a relative) had a protection . order against him at the time of her death . Neighbors called police to check on Thomas after hearing a fight and her dead body was found in the ice-filled bathtub. Beside it were two handwritten notes written by Bohn. One pledged his love for her, while the other said: 'It was an accident. It was an accident.' Bohn had fled the couple's apartment in Queens with his girlfriend's phone, which he used to assure her family she was fine. He was eventually tracked down at a restaurant in White Plains. Bohn's attorney, Todd Greenberg, . previously said his client had been suffering from emotional . disturbances, but wouldn't say whether his client had a history of . mental illness. They had . tried to convince the jury toward a lesser charge of manslaughter, using . stories of childhood abuse, but it failed to sway the jury. Bohn is now expected to die in prison.

"By . James King . A three-story, professionally built treehouse is impressive even without a cool backstory. But the story of how one came to be at a summer camp in Wisconsin is as heartwarming as it is impressive. Camp Wandawega is about two hours outside of Chicago and was the childhood getaway of David Hernandez. In 2004, Hernandez and wife Tereasa Surratt bought the property, which previously Latvian Church Camp. Fancy: Tereasa Surratt turned a sick tree into a touching memorial to hear father . Touching: Surratt's father hung a rope swing on an elm tree on the camp his daughter bought to christen the previously Christian summer camp . Surratt's father died shortly after she bought the camp - then the tree where he'd hung the swing fell ill . When the couple bought the property, Surratt's father was ill, but he christened his daughter's new camp by installing a rope swing on a giant Elm tree in the middle of the camp. Sadly, Surratt's father died 18 months later. Then the young couple got some more bad news. 'Almost immediately after, we found out the tree had Dutch elm disease,' Surratt tells Chicagomag.com. 'I was devastated. I couldn’t cut that tree down.' Luckily, the trunk of the tree was still strong even as the branches began dying. In an effort to keep the tree - and preserve the memory of Surratt's father - they decided to someday build a treehouse around the remaining trunk. The couple went about cleaning up the rest of the camp, and put the treehouse plan on the back-burner for a while. Not your average tree house: To preserve the tree - and the swing - Surratt decided to turn build a tree house . One day, Surratt and friend  Angela Finney-Hoffman were talking about the camp and talked about turning it into an art camp for adults. They also talked about building the treehouse - and decided it was time to make it happen. Surratt recruited Shaun Owens-Agase and Tyler Peterson to help build it. 'Of course they chose a big healthy tree with a gorgeous green canopy,' Surratt told the magazine.. Surratt, however, had other plans, and when she told the designers the story of her father's elm, they agreed that was the tree for the treehouse. The designers wanted to go a bit bigger than Surratt initially had planned, but that was fine with her. 'Everyone had a radically different idea, and everyone was thinking 100 . times bigger and more elaborate than I was,' she says. 'I was . imagining a little kid’s house. The things they were coming up with were . like castles in the sky.' Go big or go home: Designers Shaun Owens-Agase and Tyler Peterson had big plans for the treehouse . The impressive abode is three stories high and includes a wood-burning stove and an upstairs bedroom - and, of course, a swing . The design they went with was a three-level cottage that has more bells and whistles than your average treehouse. Of course, Surratt's father's swing remained on the tree - and she is grateful for the help she received. 'It’s rare to find folks so selfless that they would literally build you a cabin in the sky and ask for nothing in return,' she says. 'And these folks aren’t your average builders, but amazing, visionary designers. It’s humbling beyond words.'","Tereasa Surratt and her husband bought Camp Wandawega in 2004 .

"By . Belinda Robinson . It is the size of a small cat and enough to strike fear into anyone who sees it – but it could become a common sight in cities around the country. A giant rat was caught in Liverpool and measured two feet long from its nose to its tail. The menacing super rat was caught on an industrial estate by a pest controller from Whelan Services, one of the country's largest independent pest prevention companies. Huge rats are being caught across Britain (file picture) Whelan Services has offices in London, Liverpool and Hampshire and all locations report a rise in the number of super rats spotted. Pest control experts today warned that . similar rats are likely to become more common in the UK as more . households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish, and . discard left-over fast food. They also warn that the rodents are becoming increasingly resistant to poison. Experts say the conventional blood-thinning poison used to kill the rats is not working as it used to. Now pest controllers are calling on the government to tighten up its response to the monster-size vermin and asking the EU to approve stronger ‘third generation poison’ to kill them. Merseyside pest controller Sean Whelan from Whelan Services told Mail Online: ‘We’re seeing an upsurge in rat call-outs, it’s gone up significantly by about 15 per cent over the past year. ‘It’s been very good for us. But I’m not entirely sure what’s causing it, it could be the weather, it’s been very cold and it’s been very wet. ‘They’re twice as large as they once were. It’s definitely not uncommon to see rats the size of a cat. Growing problem: Cities throughout the UK are seeing more super rats as the rodents gorge on food left out in bins . ‘The problem is that they’re feeding more than they used to. They’re feeding off leftover junk food that we throw away. ‘If there is vermin, 99.9 per cent of the time it’s our fault. We’re basically feeding them and they get used to it. So they keep coming around us to get more food,' he added. Mr Whelan said: ‘The rats that we’re seeing in the city used to be the ones roaming round  the countryside, in agriculture, out on farms, but they’ve migrated to towns – now they live in the city. We found you: This huge rodent had to be removed by hand from the ceiling after the trap failed to work due to its size in Dublin . Mr Whelan said the 'monster rats' are in every town throughout the country but there has been an increase in sightings in Liverpool, Birmingham and London. During the 1960s onwards, rat poison . was based on the blood-thinning agent warfarin. It worked by draining . the blood from the rat and killing it. Today, pest controllers use bromadiolone, but both are proving to be ineffective on some monster vermin. ‘We find that the rats are becoming resistant to poison,' Mr whelan said. 'We used to use Warafin when I first started out 23 years ago. It was the first generation of rat poisoning and used to work but doesn't do much now. 'We need new, stronger poisons as they've grown used to what we use.' The pest controller explained that in an area between Winchester and Salisbury the poisons simply do not work at all, while rats in London have also developed a higher immunity. Mr Whelan is calling on the government to create a 'rat tsar' to tackle the problem. He . also wants the EU to approve the third generation of rat poison to help . tackle the problem, but plans for stronger poison face stiff opposition . from campaigners amid fears that it could be harmful to humans. Wildlife campaigners have also raised concerns that it could wreak havoc on animal and birds. However, pest control experts warn that there will be even more monster rats found if they are allowed to feast on food near junk food shops, restaurants and household bin areas outside blocks of flats. Big rodent: The giant monster rat was found in a family residence in Kingswood, south Dublin last week . Rats thrive in damp and soggy weather - of which the UK has seen plenty during the wettest year on record. Vermin are also swapping rural areas for the big city. The government’s austerity measures have been blamed for making the problem far worse – after cuts to the budget for pest control. And rats can carry illnesses which can be passed to humans, including Weil’s disease, which has flu-like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice and kidney failure. Across the country, councils have reported a rise in the number of rats being reported. Birmingham has the highest number of call-outs with 5,100 in the past year. Liverpool council has also reported a recent rise in the number of reports of rats – 2,008 last year compared with 1,860 in 2012. In Birmingham the rat hotspots include Ladywood, Hodge Hill and Perry Barr. City pest control officer Colin Watts said that one of the biggest he’s seen was 14 or 15 inches long but that was just the body, without the tail. He claimed that it would have been over 2 foot with its tail and compared it to the size of a small cat. And the problem is not just confined to Britain. Other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in Stockholm and Dublin, where one rat was trapped by . pest control after terrorising an Irish family in south Dublin. The Dublin-based 'monster vermin' had been terrorising Grace and Ian Walters’ home . in Kingswood shortly after they moved into their new flat. One for supper: Jack Russell Max, owned by Royal Tunbridge Wells resident Mark Willmott, caught one of the large rats whose numbers are increasing around the country .","Pest controllers are seeing rats the 'size of small cats' cropping up in cities across the UK .

"By . Damien Gayle . Tenant from hell: Rose Chimuka arriving at Croydon Crown Court . An asylum seeker has been jailed for four years after ripping off landlords in a housing scam that netted her £100,000. Zimbabwe-born Rose Chimuka took leases on family homes across south London then illegally divided them into bedsits and sublet them to dozens of desperate tenants. The 32-year-old packed up to 15 people into each house, pocketing the rents and giving the real landlords nothing. Each time she was found out, Chimuka would disappear and start again elsewhere. The fraudster used fake IDs to convince landlords she was a respectable mother with a well-paid husband. Once she took possession of properties she changed all the locks to keep their real owners out and put beds in every room to maximise the rental value. After being packed with so many tenants, houses were left filthy, smelly and stripped of appliances and valuables. Lost rent and the cost of repairs cost owners up to £86,000 each, The Sun reported. Arriving to check on his property, the owner of one house in Brockley found it stuffed with tenants who thought Chimuka was the real landlady. She even reported another homeowner to police when he tried to gain access to his house. After being convicted of 11 counts of fraud, Chimuka was jailed at Croydon Crown Court. She will be deported after she completes her sentence. The 32-year-old Chimuka packed up to 15 people into each house, pocketing the rents and giving the real landlords nothing .

"A married couple from Washington state have been charged with criminal mistreatment and Medicaid fraud after police say they horribly neglected a special-needs girl while collecting money from the state for her care. When investigators responded to April and Jeffrey Henderson’s home in North Bend, Washington, in October 2012, they were shocked to discover the 19-year-old girl naked except for a dirty diaper sitting in a filthy room permeated with stench. April Henderson, 33 - who described herself as a ‘chauffeur, chef, housekeeping, nurse, companion' on her Facebook page - had been the girl's full-time caretaker, while her husband, Jeffrey Henderson, 34, had been her legal guardian. Morally repugnant: April Henderson (left) and her husband and father of her four children, Jeffrey (right) are accused of mistreating a blind, special-needs girl who has been in their care since 2004 . The teenager, who suffers from cerebral palsy and is visually impaired, weighted just 67lbs and appeared 'skeletal,' and she had 23 rotten teeth. A King County Sheriff’s Office detective described the room where the girl lived as the worst she has ever seen, with soiled clothes scattered about, piles of refuse and dried vomit. The special-needs girl was sitting in her waste-covered wheelchair and crying for help, according to court documents obtained by Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ‘The only way to describe her moaning was that of a wounded animal,’ Detective Belinda Paredes-Garrett was quoted as saying. The rest of the Hendersons’ home was filled with all the trappings of middle-class prosperity, including two flat screen televisions, laptops, iPhones, an iPad, and even a large reptile menagerie. The couple's ward was orphaned at age 7 and was left in their care. In 2004, Jeffrey Henderson became her legal guardian, and the couple spent the next eight years collecting $4,100 a month in Medicaid funds intended for the girl. Instead, officials say the husband and wife pocketed all the money, which was their only source of income since neither one of them had a job. The sheriff's office and the Department of Social and Health Services were asked to check up on the special-needs patient in the Hendersons’ care in October 2012 by staffers at Children's Hospital, who became concerned about her health. Accused swindlers: Officials say the Hendersons relied on the $4,100 a month in Medicaid and Social Security payments intended for their ward's care because neither of them had a job . When detectives and a case worker knocked on the family’s door, April Henderson initially tried to prevent them from entering the residence, according to court documents. Once inside, the investigators were 'taken aback' by the foul smell hanging in the air. Three of the couple's children were home at the time. When questioned by police, Mrs Henderson explained that they had caught them on a 'bad day.' According to the charging papers, Mrs Henderson claimed to have spent 350 hours a month looking after the young woman in her care. In return, she was paid $3,500 a month through a government program and another $600 in Social Security benefits. However, the self-proclaimed nurse could not tell officers how the girl in her care was being fed. After the emaciated, severely neglected cerebral palsy patient was taken away from the couple, the wife filed for unemployment and received a total of nearly $20,000. Torture chamber: Officers who entered the family's home in rural North Bend were 'taken aback 'by the stench in the orphan's room, which was strewn with trash and soiled clothes . Following her rescue from the couple's home, the neglected teen was placed in the care of a court-appointed guardian; she has since put on more than 30lbs and got 19 root canals to repair her damaged teeth. The Hendersons, who have been married for more than 13 years, have three sons and a daughter. The family have since moved from North Bend to St Augusta, Florida, where Jeffrey Henderson took a job at a local gym. The couple's children were taken away from them for a time in 2012, but based on their Facebook pages, the family have since been reunited. Neither April nor Jeffrey have been jailed.","April and Jeffrey Henderson charged with criminal mistreatment and Medicaid fraud .

Dhawanwas was arrested and charged with murder in January after police were called to the family home in Frisco on her husband's return from overseas business and discovered the body of Arnav lying in a bathtub, surrounded by ice and covered with a sheet. 'I want to make it perfectly clear to the world that: I did not hurt Arnav. I did not kill Arnav. I did not murder Arnav. I did not drown or smother Arnav. I did not poison Arnav,' the affidavit states according to NBCDFW. 'I did not fail to render aid to Arnav at any time.' Police charged Pallavi in late January when her husband phoned police after becoming worried that his wife was not at home to greet him on his return from business after three weeks out of the country. Arrest: Pallavi Dhawanwas was taken into custody after her husband called police to their Frisco, Texas home in late January after he couldn't find his wife or his son . He had also received emails from his sons school stating he had not attended classes for several days. In their report, officers said they arrived and witnessed Pallavi have a heated conversation with her husband when she came home. Sumeet then became furious and called officers to a locked bathroom door - which they broke down. Officers found the boy's body in the tub at his home, wrapped in cloth up to his neck surrounded by ice. 'Officers asked Mrs. Dhawan if the child was in the room, and she nodded her head `yes.' Officers asked her if she killed the child, and Mrs. Dhawan nodded her head `yes,' said police Sgt. Brad Merritt in January. Despite these statements from the police, Pallavi has denied admitting to killing the child. In her affidavit, she said that her son, Arnav, had been diagnosed with microcephaly and had special needs and she found the boy 'cold,' 'stiff,' and 'completely unresponsive' in his bed after trying to wake him up for school. She attempted CPR, but this was to no avail. Tragedy: Dhawan said her son, Arnav, had been diagnosed with microcephaly and had special needs which led to his death . According to the affidavit, Pallavi then said she kept her son's body on ice for 'four or five' days using ice cubes from the refrigerator. She said this was to follow Hindu rituals for dead children - and that she read the scriptures over his body and was waiting for her husband to return home to properly lay her son to rest. 'Being in the state of shock with such a sudden demise of Arnav, I continued to try and follow the Hindu customs to the best of my knowledge as exhibited by the father's Sumeet Dhawan family in the past, including preserving the body on ice,' she said in the affidavit. In March, Sumeet said that the charges are a result of a cultural misunderstanding. The Dhawan family is Hindu and after death bodies are preserved on ice while waiting for family to pay respects and for last rites to be issued. 'Nothing is going to get our son back and I hope that what has happened to us doesn't happen to anybody and cultural differences played a big part in this,' said Sumeet Dhawan. The Collin County medical examiner ruled the boy's cause of death as 'undetermined,' but 'natural disease is most likely.'","Pallavi Dhawanwas was charged with the murder of her 10-year-old son in January after police in Frisco, Texas, discovered his body .

Showing perfect patience and poise, the three-year-old dog can balance a range of every day items on his face. In a series of pictures posted on Reddit by his San Franciscan owners Nicole Lee and her boyfriend Trey, Jack is pictured balancing everything from a football to a frying pan on his head. Talent: Jack the Australian cattle dog looks perfectly poised as he balances a pile of four biscuits on his nose . Balancing act: Jack is pictured balancing a football on his head, left, and a frying pan on the end of his nose, right . The talented animal, who was adopted by Nicole and Trey as a puppy, happily poses for the pictures in return for praise and treats. The couple say they noticed the dog was particularly clever from a young age and began training him to balance items on his head while playing with him at home. Biologist Nicole, 27, said: 'He is an Australian cattle dog and is probably mixed with something, but we don't know. 'From an early age we noticed he was very smart, so we taught him many tricks, this being one of them. Good boy: Jack demonstrates his skill by balancing a bottle of shampoo, left, and a lemon on his head, right . Well trained: Jack was taught how to balance a range of items after his owners spotted that he was intelligent from a young age . 'He learned how to play fetch when he was 8 weeks old. 'The balancing act started when we tried balancing a kernel of popcorn on his nose one night while watching a movie at home. 'We quickly learned he was patient enough to allow us to stack really anything on his head, as long as it's not too heavy. Practice makes perfect: Nicole and Trey realised that Jack could balance things on his head while messing around with the animal while watching a film . Perfectly poised: The San Francisco couple have now started to teach Jack more elaborate tricks . 'We train him by positively reinforcing good behaviours and ignoring the ""wrong"" ones; basically just a lot of cheering him on. 'He responds really well to praise, so we use that as a reward as well as the ball.' Nicole and Trey say that they've continued to try and teach their dog more elaborate tricks. The latest stunt was teaching the dog to close all the kitchen cupboards and open the fridge door by himself.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Cockroach companion: Kyle Kandilian, a 20-year-old student at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, raises some 200,000 cockroaches at his parent's home . If you thought you summer cockroach infestation was bad, you'll never believe how many creepy-crawlers Kyle Kandilian deals with. The 20-year-old Dearborn, Michigan native has about 200,000 cockroaches living in his house - on purpose! Kandilian has been raising cockroaches for almost eight years, and even started a business selling some as food and the more exotic species as pets. Money raised from his roach business goes to pay for college at the University of Michigan-Dearborn where he's studying for a career in either forestry, pest management or nature-insect education. Kandilian first developed his passion for cockroachery when he visited the University of Detroit Mercy, he told the Detroit Free Press. The university had a 10-gallon fish tank filled with Madagascar hissing cockroaches and Kandilian found them captivating. He was allowed to hold one of the roaches and remarked on how docile they were. When he got home he immediately asked his mom if he could get one. 'Kyle? You are never bringing cockroaches into this house,' she said. 'And the rest is history,' Kandilian laughs. His parents eventually gave into his cockroach obsession, and a few pets turned into a thriving business: Roachcrossing.com. Kandilian sells his roaches to reptile and amphibian owners for food for as little as a dime a dozen. The rarer species, like the macropanesthia rhinoceros which live up to 10 or 15 years, can go for $150 to $200. Scroll down for video . Roach crossing: Kandilian, left, with a variety of his cockroach species . And while he loves his roaches, living with 200,000 of them does present it's problems - especially for his parents. One morning at about 4 or 5am, Kandilian was woken up by his mother who took him to the bathroom. 'Kyle, we need to stop this,' she said as she pointed to the hissing cockroach relaxing on the toilet paper roll. But the problem of escaping cockroaches was solved when Kandilian did a high school project on bug barriers, designed to keep his pets from escaping. For that project, Kandilian even won a scholarship. While many people squirm at the sign of cockroaches, Kandilian seems perfectly comfortable handling them - letting them even walk on his shirt. He says it's his life mission to change the stigmas associated with cockroaches. Entrepreneur: Kandilian runs roachcrossing.com -  a website he uses to sell his cockroaches either as food or as pets . Academic: Kandilian won a scholarship for a project he did on more effective bug barriers to keep cockroaches from escaping their enclosures . World of roaches: A giant Madagascar hissing cockroach - the first roach Kandilian ever handled and what started his passion for the insects . 'There are maybe a dozen cockroaches that are pests worldwide, out of the 4,000 species,' he said. 'And they give the rest a really bad rap.' There's a lot that people don't know about the other, non-pest cockroaches: like the fact that some give birth just like humans. 'I've read books that there's a very intimate association between the cockroach egg inside certain female cockroaches,' he said, 'as there is to humans and human birth.' After almost eight years raising roaches, he is still awed by all the variety in the species. 'The body shape in almost every roach is the same, but the way that Mother Nature has tinted and changed each individual species to look slightly different just is very enthralling to me,' he said.","College student Kyle Kandilian, 20, keeps 200,000 cockroaches at the house he shares with his parents .

"By . Joshua Gardner . The Internal Revenue Service is considering a bold move to label perks like free lunch given to workers by companies as taxable. The agency wonders if freebies like haircuts and gym memberships are a way to compensate the highly skilled rather than just a way to jumpstart productivity. Companies say it would be a step too far that needlessly chips away most notably at the fruitfulness of industries in Silicon Valley that have become a driving force behind the American economy. Free lunch? The IRS is debating whether or not it should tax the free lunches given out to workers at firms like Facebook and Google as a form of compensation . 'I clearly think it ought to be taxable income,' University of Florida tax law professor Martin J. McMahon, Jr. told the Wall Street Journal. After all, argue proponents of such a tax, workers at Silicon Valley firms like Google and Facebook receive free meals from famously fancy in-house eateries every day. Some companies even go a step further by offering freebies like haircuts, car services, and child care. Typical workaday folks can expect to pay for all these using their fully taxed wages, an argument at the heart of the agency's reason for pondering the added tax.'I buy my lunch with after-tax dollars,' McMahon told the WSJ. 'And I have to pay taxes to support free meals for those Google employees.' Google reportedly serves 50,000 meals per day in its 120 cafes worlwide. On the flip side, and in addition to arguments that the tax agency is already hopelessly burdened, are complanies' claims that the perks aren't perks at all: they're incentives. In the eye of the law, free meals are permissable, for instance, if they are 'noncompensatory' and a 'convenience to the employer.' Perk or incentive? Google doles out an estimated 50,000 meals per day at its 120 cafes worldwide. Firms with freebie policies tend to consider them a means of incentivizing their workers rather than a perk . 'There are real benefits for knowledge workers in having unplanned, face to face interaction,' tax law prof from the University of Colorado Victor Flescher told the WSJ. In Silicon Valley, where collaboration is the key to innovation, employers say they facilitate by putting workers lunch rooms where the munch free gourmet food. It's also an environment where the less time employees are away from their desks, the more time they're working on projects that benefit the company. And according to at least one Silicon Valley tech start-up founder, those projects benefit Americans as a whole. 'Our customers win [because] they get a higher quality product and then our shareholders win because they see our momentum in the market,' Andy Byrne of CEO of Clari, a cloud computing company, told Fox News. 'If the IRS wanted to stop the productivity of Silicon Valley and of the economic growth engine that this place is,' he said, 'then they can have at it.' As the government grapples with whether or not they should tax the recipients for their free meals--or whether it's even got the manpower to add the task to its ever-growing list of to-dos--Silicon Valley companies already know how they'll respond. Legal experts largely agree that tech companies eager to keep programmers and the like well-fed and hacking away will probably just report the meals as taxable income and pay workers more to make up the difference.","The huge move would largely affect Silicon Valley firms where workers are accustomed to freebies like lunch .
The IRS wonders if these perks are compensation but companies argue it's an incentive to work harder ."
"By . Nina Golgowski . Correction officials have unmasked a once-respected owner of a California drug rehab center as a parolee convicted of murder who eluded capture under a fake identity for more than three decades. Richard Bradford had spent the last 32 years living a double life under the name of James Edward Heard while owning several properties in the Pasadena area including an upscale rehab facility endorsed by the mayor, according to authorities. Bradford was sentenced to life for first-degree murder in 1971, was paroled in 1978, but skipped out on his parole supervision in 1980, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement on Wednesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Found: Richard Bradford, seen outside his Pasadena drug treatment center, had been living for decades under the false name of James Edward Heard after skipping out on his parole supervision in 1980 . Agents arrested Bradford this week, more than 32 years after he had disappeared, the statement said. A false birth certificate with Heard's name was created in Alameda County in 1977, and a Social Security card was issued to him in 1978, both while he was still in prison, officials said. By the early 1980s Bradford began using the new name, and the name Richard Bradford disappeared on paper by 1992. A parole apprehension team began an investigation into his disappearance in 2010, and about a year later learned he might be the same person as Heard. Bradford's prison fingerprints were found to be a match with Heard's from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Bradford's attorney contacted corrections officials at about the same time saying he knew he was being sought and would like some time to turn himself in, but he never did. New life: Bradford, who was sentenced to life for murder, ran the Eaton Canyon Treatment Center, an upscale rehab facility endorsed by the mayor, seen here . It took investigators two years to . find Bradford, who had been keeping a low profile in the Pasadena area, . with his businesses controlled by a trust and his credit cards and . vehicles in the name of his treatment center, the Eaton Canyon Treatment Center. On Sunday while conducting surveillance, agents saw Bradford and his wife leave their home and followed them to the Home Depot just east of Pasadena in Monrovia, where they arrested Bradford and his wife. She was taken into custody for being a felon in possession of pepper spray. Her name was not released. Speaking to KCAL from inside the treatment center his wife called the charges against her husband fictitious. Method: After obtaining a fake birth certificate and social security number under his new name Bradford additionally put his credit cards and vehicles in the name of his treatment center as well, pictured . A search of the house turned up evidence for both of Bradford's names, the statement said. Corrections officials did not provide the name of Bradford's attorney, and no other contact information to seek comment from a lawyer or family member could be found. One of Bradford’s neighbors expressed her shock of his true identity calling it 'horrifying' while describing him as a generally angry man. 'He would flick neighbors off who were walking by that he knew were against the group home,' the woman who didn't want to be named told KCAL. 'The thought that that's who that person was, and we were in the same room with him, and in meetings with him, is, it tells you that you really don't know who you're talking to always,' she said.

"By . Mark Prigg . The first pictures of Amazon's much rumoured 3D handset have been revealed - and show off the four cameras used to create a 'floating screen' effect. Set to be unveiled in June, the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.' The latest images also reveal a relatively thin handset - although covered in a case to shield its true design. Scroll down for Video . Set to be unveiled in June, the device will use retina-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to 'float above the screen like a hologram and appear three-dimensional at all angles.' The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen. These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display. This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses. 'Finally, we have obtained exclusive photos of a prototype of the unreleased device, giving the world its first look at Amazon’s hotly anticipated phone, web site BGR said. 'As can be seen in the images, the device is covered by a protective shell intended to prevent people without authorization from seeing the physical design of the phone.' The handset will be revealed in June and launched in September, the report claims. It is expected to have a 4.7inch screen. This would pit it directly against Apple's upcoming iPhone 6, which is also expected to go on sale in September. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes the firm will launch a phone. 'We predict Amazon (US) will launch its own brand smartphone in 3-6 months, using the same hardware strategy as used for its e-reader and tablet,' he recently wrote. 'The supply chain will start stocking up materials in Q2 2014 for production.' It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console. The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40. The handset is shown in a special protective case to shield its final design. However, the four cameras are clearly visible in each corner . The handset look almost like Nokia's Windows Phone with its large, rounded shell - although that is believed to be simply to hide the final design . Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2. Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently. Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box. 'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said. The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September . 'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO. The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus. The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast. Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen . The firm said it plans to add more services in the future. Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US. Speculation about Amazon smartphones began in 2011.","Phone rumoured to show images that 'float above the screen like holograms'

"By . Fiona Macrae . One of the secrets of creating new life has been discovered by scientists – bringing hope of better treatment for childless women. British researchers have shown that the egg’s surface is studded with a protein that is essential for fertility. Christened Juno, after the Roman goddess of marriage and fertility, it ‘mates’ with a partner protein on sperm, at the moment of conception. Hope: British researchers have discovered a protein on the surface of a woman's egg that is essential for fertility. Called Juno, it 'mates' with a partner protein on sperm, at the moment of conception . Without Juno, the sperm and egg cannot fuse to create new life. Researcher Gavin Wright, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, said: ‘We have solved a long-standing mystery in biology by identifying the molecules displayed on all sperm and egg that must bind each other at the moment we were conceived. ‘Without this essential interaction, fertilisation just cannot happen. We may be able to use this discovery to improve fertility treatments and develop new contraceptives.’ Since 2005, when an essential protein was found sitting on head of sperm, the search has been on for its female counterpart. The Sanger Institute team created an artificial version of the sperm protein and the used it to hunt out its egg version. Moving forward: Scientists now hope the discovery of the new protein could help improve fertility treatments such as IVF . On finding Juno, they did a series of tests that proved it to be necessary for fertilisation. Importantly, mice that were unable to make Juno seemed perfectly healthy but were infertile. Although they made eggs, sperm were unable to bind to them, the journal Nature reports. The experiments also revealed that Juno is quickly removed from the surface of an egg after fertilisation occurs. Protection: The protein may also play a role in developing contraceptives of the future . This ensures only sperm binds with the egg and increases the odds of a successful pregnancy. It is thought that a similar protein is found on women’s eggs – and that flaws in it could explain why some couples can’t have children. If this is the case, women found to have a faulty Juno protein could be treated with ICSI, a special type of IVF, in which the sperm is injected directly into the egg. This would bypass the flawed Juno protein on the surface and could allow them to achieve their dream of motherhood. Researcher Dr Erin Bianchi said: ‘Infertility is becoming an increasing problem, especially in Western countries, and it is remarkable that 20 per cent of infertility cases have an unexplained cause. ‘We are now testing whether Juno is involved in these cases.’ Dr Allan Pacey, a Sheffield University fertility expert, said: ‘The identification of the Juno protein opens up many exciting prospects. ‘Perhaps the most obvious biomedical application of this finding is whether screening for this protein could be used as a test of fertility.’ However, he questioned how many couples would benefit. The discovery could also lead to new contraceptives.  As they wouldn’t be based on hormones, they should be free of the mood-swings, acne and other unwelcome side-effects of existing drugs. Contraceptive jabs could also be used to control badgers, deer and other populations, rather than resorting to culling.","The egg’s surface is studded with a protein that is essential for fertility .

"By . Jill Reilly . The Philippines financial capital has banned disposable plastic shopping bags and Styrofoam food containers from today. The move comes as part of escalating efforts across the nation's capital to curb rubbish blamed for deadly flooding. Just hours after the ban was introduced, members of Makati City's Plastic Monitoring Task Force were out on the streets looking for vendors that were ignoring the new rules. A 25ft-high tidal wave of rubbish:   The Philippines financial capital banned disposable plastic shopping bags and styrofoam food containers as part of escalating efforts across the nation's capital to curb rubbish that exacerbates deadly flooding . Cause: Men play basketball near the dump site - the project officer of Makati's environmental services department, said cutting down on plastic was vital to stop the clogging of the city's waterways, which is widely blamed for contributing to floods . Food wrapped in plastic is still . available, but Makati, one of 17 cities or districts that make up Metro . Manila, has gone ahead with banning plastic bags. Prexy Macana, project officer of Makati's environmental services department, told AFP that scaling back the use of plastic bags was essential to halt the clogging of the city's waterways, which is widely blamed for contributing to floods. 'During our bi-monthly wastewater clean-ups, we found most of the garbage is plastics,' she said. Flooding is common in Manlia - last August the Philippine capital was brought to a near standstill by flooding after almost 24 hours of continuous rain - it left nine dead and scores homeless. The previous year flash floods in the Philippines left a death toll of 1000. Nature ruined: Fishermen sit on a rubbish-filled riverbank at a dump site in Manila. Consumers are now being given the option of paper alternatives or not using a bag at all . Making a living: A man arranges used plastic bottles on a truck to be sold at a shop in Manila . All change: A man uses a cloth bag while buying meat at a wet market in Manila's financial district, Makati City . Binned: Employees of a fast food store put the prohibited plastic cups into a trash bag at Manila's financial district . Watchful eye: Members of Makati City's Plastic Monitoring Task Force (PMTF), look for prohibited plastic used used by vendors at a wet market . The ban in . Makati - the ninth out of the 17 areas to issue the plastics ban - means . 6.7 million of Metro Manila's population of 13 million people are . covered by the restrictions, reported AFP. The campaign to ban plastic bags is . gathering momentum - in May 2003, South Africa set the pace by banning . thinner plastic bags as well as imposing levies on thicker ones - Rwanda and Somalia have now banned bags completely. China, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and Bangladesh have all banned very thin plastic bags - the latter for the same reason as Manila. All plastic bags except . oxo-biodegradables are banned in the The . United Arab Emirates after concerns about the risk to camels. Last . year Los Angeles became the biggest city in the United States to ban . plastic bags from supermarket check-outs following bans in San Jose, San . Francisco and Long Beach. In . 2009, the United States International Trade Commission reported that . 102 billion plastic bags are used annually in the United States alone . Last month Britain's decision not to back a European law banning plastic bags caused friction with Italy and stunned environmental campaigners. Italy's Environment Minister has criticised Britain's lack of support for the law, describing it as 'astounding' particularly for a seafaring nation. Environmental campaigners have also been left flabbergasted by Britain's move earlier this month, especially given the Coalition government's support for reducing the environmental impact of bags on the landscape and wildlife. Manila is prone to flooding, as seen in this . photo taken last year so authorities are doing everything possible to . clear drainage system - including banning plastic bags . The . average EU citizen gets through about 500 plastic carrier bags a year – . with most of them used once, according to Brussels. The total volume . produced in Europe in 2008 was 3.4million tons, but only 6 per cent were . recycled. Despite . their widespread use, research suggests most Europeans want to see a . clampdown on carrier bags, with two thirds of people surveyed by the . Commission saying they favoured an outright ban. Last year, Italy became the first . European country to ban non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags. Across the globe, Somalia, Rwanda and Tanzania have done the same. In Britain, the first big high street chain to make customers pay for carrier bags was Marks & Spencer, in 2008. The 5p charge led to a fall of 80 per cent in bag usage in the first few months. The Republic of Ireland introduced a 12p levy on each bag in 2002, which led to a 95 per cent reduction in plastic bag litter. Last October, Wales imposed a 5p charge. Shops that continue to provide free carrier bags face a fine of up to £5,000. But . some retailers, including Sainsbury’s and Boots, have resisted a bag . charge, with Sainsbury’s saying that free plastic bags were ‘critical’ to its customers.","The move comes as part of escalating efforts across the nation's capital to curb rubbish blamed for deadly flooding .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Yemeni faction of al-Qaeda may be planning on attacking western targets, including the United States, a recent video indicates. The video allegedly shows a gathering of hundreds of al-Qaeda members, filmed during a celebration of a mass jailbreak of fighters in Sana'a, Yemen. During the 15-minute clip, which was reportedly shot last month and just emerged, the leader of  Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) speaks of 'removing America'. Scroll down for video . Threat: The 15 minute video was filmed as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula celebrated a mass breakout from a prison in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, and surfaced on several YouTube channels . The video was posted on several YouTube channels, including terrorism and political violence watchdog TRAC - Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium - and is dated March 2014. It shows masked men waving al Qaeda's black flag and celebrating the arrival of members who were freed from the main prison in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen. The jailbreak in February saw attackers mount a bomb, grenade and gun assault on the . prison, freeing 29 inmates, including 19 jailed for . terrorism-related crimes. At the centre of the film is Nasser al-Wuhaishi, a man who has been named the 'crown prince' of AQAP. 'We have to remember that we are always fighting the biggest enemy,’ says al-Wuhaishi. ‘We have to remove the cross, (and) the bearer of the cross, America.' Terrorism acts: Al-Qaeda leader Nasser al-Wuhaishi, a man who has been named the 'crown prince' of AQAP, speaks during the video, saying the terrorist organisation needs to 'remove the bearer of the cross, America' Although the authenticity of the video has not yet been independently verified, U.S. officials told CNN they believe it to be real. Security experts have criticized American intelligence for allowing such a meeting to take place without their knowledge. 'The U.S. intelligence community should be surprised that such a large group of al-Qaeda assembled together, including the leadership, and somehow they didn't notice,' Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst said. Abdulrazzaq al-Jamal, a journalist who has interviewed members of AQAP, said it was the largest known gathering of al Qaeda in Yemen. ‘It included about 400 people, and these are not all the members of the group. This gathering is a confirmation that al Qaeda is gaining strength and influence,’ he said. Did U.S. know? Security experts have criticized American intelligence for allowing a meeting of hundreds of AQAP members to take place without their knowledge . Formed in 2009, AQAP has attacked military targets, tourists and diplomats in Yemen and taken over territory for long periods. U.S. drone attacks have killed several suspected AQAP figures, including Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born Islamist cleric accused of links to a plot to bomb a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 and U.S. cargo planes in 2010. ‘Al Qaeda will gain strength as there continues to be division and weakness in security performance,’ said Ali al-Sarari, political adviser to Prime Minister Mohammed Salem Basindwa. ‘The last appearance (the video) shows that Yemen is confronting a dangerous challenge. And if the security performance continues in this manner, then Yemen will face an even bigger failure than what it has faced in the past.’","Video filmed hundreds of Al-Qaeda members meeting in Yemen in March .

"By . Associated Press . and Joshua Gardner . An Oregon man who claims he was seduced by an IRS agent and just as quickly abandoned during an audit that left him owning $69,000 wants to sue the U.S. government. Vincent Burroughs has already had one case against agent Dora Abrahamson and the federal government dropped. Now he's appealing and says the IRS must be held accountable for his feeling 'like a cheap wh***.' Racy: Vincent Burroughs (right) claims IRS agent Dora Abrahamson seduced him after contacting him about an audit and realizing she knew him from his amateur motorcycle races . Burroughs alleges Abrahamson contacted him about an audit in August 2011. The amateur motorcycle racer and professional contractor says he'd fallen about $20,000 behind on taxes after his once steady work dried up during the recession. Abrahamson allegedly told Burroughs she was a fan of his racing and 'knew who he was, and that it was lucky for him that this was the case, and that they should meet.' A series of text messages were exchanged. Some on Abrahamson's end were allegedly lurid and Burroughs claims she sent him a racy photo. Burroughs initially ignored the woman's advances, according to the lawsuit, but he surrendered after a 'provocatively attired' Abrahamson arrived at his home in September 2011, the lawsuit states. 'She told (Burroughs) that she could . be a bitch, or that she could be nice,' states the suit, which Burroughs . and his attorney David Moule recently revealed was dismissed. 'She . said that she could impose no penalty, or a 40 percent penalty, and . that if he would give her what she wanted, she would give him what he . needed,' it alleged. 'Don't you race motorcycles?': Burroughs claims he didn't recognize the agent but that she started to send racy text messages before showing up to his home in September 2011 to help him do his 'paperwork' 'I feel like a cheap wh***': Burroughs said the two had sex and that days later Abrahamson dropped his case because of a conflict of interest. He says the agent who took his case then said he owed far more than he believes he owes and wants the government to pay for Abrahamson's 'sexual coercion' and for ruining his relationship with this longtime girlfriend . 'She just pushed me back, and I kind of went back, and I landed...and she immediately came over, got on top of me, started kissing on me,' he told 20/20 last year. The two of them had sex. Days later, Abrahamson contacted him to say she would no longer be handling the case due to the conflict of interest. After another agent did the audit, Burroughs was told he owed $69,000. The lawsuit claims that Abrahamson's conduct caused the plaintiff distress and a rift in his relationship with a 'significant other' and Burroughs reiterated as much in a tearful 2013 interview with 20/20. The suit alleged that the government was liable for damages because IRS officials provided inadequate supervision. However, the case--which was asking the government pay out $100,000, has since been dismissed. 'The government (said) that it was immune from lawsuit because it had never waived its immunity for intentional acts of its employees that were committed outside the scope of their employment,' said the attorney Moule. The plaintiff had already removed Abrahamson's name from the suit by the time it was dismissed because she lacked assets for them to go after. Abrahamson has never publicly commented on her role in the case but denied Burroughs' allegations in court papers.","Oregon man Vincent Burroughs says IRS agent Dora Abrahamson showed up at his door in 2011 to 'help him with his paperwork' after he was audited .

"By . James Gordon . In the battle for supremacy between technology titans Apple and Samsung, the VP of sales for Samsung's mobile division saw the reaction to the death of Steve Jobs as the perfect time strike back at Apple. In a document revealed this week as part of the current court battle between Apple and Samsung, Michael Pennington, head of national sales for Samsung offered his views as part of an ongoing email chain in 2011. Samsung execs reportedly feared that Steve Jobs' death in 2011 could take attention away from the impending launch of its Galaxy S II. Now is the time: When Steve Jobs passed away in 2011 Apple fans around the world mourned his loss, but Samsung, one of the company's biggest rivals tried to take advantage of the situation . Attack! Samsung executives wanted to come up with a campaign to attack Apple's iPhone 4S just as it was about to launch his holiday Samsung Galaxy II . Samsungs head of sales, Michael Pennington wrote in an email: 'Sorry to continue to push this issue, but I have seen this far too long and I know this is our best opportunity to attack iPhone' 'We need to take advantage of this chance,' wrote Dale Sohn, then the president and chief executive of Samsung Telecommunications America, according to AppleInsider. Mr Pennington, who was irked by the coverage the iPhone 4S had received in the wake of Steve Jobs' death, replied stating how he wanted to generate some sort of reaction from Samsung. In a message dated October 7th, two days after Jobs passed away: . 'Unfortunately, Steve Job's [sic] passing has led to a huge wave of press coverage of Apple's and iPhone's 'superiority,' all created by the 'passionate, tireless, perfectionist...' The point here is that there is an unintended benefit for Apple, since the external messages by 3rd parties are all highlighting and/or supporting the consumer perception that Apple products are superior, since Jobs' [sic] was such a visionary and perfectionist. What consumer wouldn't feel great about purchasing a device developed by such a person. 'Sorry to continue to push this issue, but I have seen this far too long and I know this is our best opportunity to attack iPhone. If there is no consensus on the approach I initially proposed, I will stop pushing, but I would like to better understand our strategy so I can align with that,' he concluded. Our way of thinking: In a recently released email, a Samsung executive believed the death of Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was the perfect time to attack the iPhone . What a thought: The email, from Samsung's Vice President of Sales Operations Michael Pennington, was revealed during the ongoing patent battle between Apple and Samsung . At one point, Mr Pennington considered asking Google if they might be able to launch a campaign against Apple: . 'If it continues to be Samsung’s position to avoid attacking Apple due to their status as a large customer, can we go to Google and ask them to launch a campaign against Apple, based on the many better Android options available in the market for Q4 [2011],' he wrote. Pennington however appeared not to be sure whether Ice Cream Sandwich (the latest version of the Android platform), which was to be released on October 19, could face iOS 5. 'Seems Google should be asked to carry their own weight in the battle,' he said. 'However, we could arrange a co-op arrangement for them if they use [our] device prominently in their marketing campaign. Is Ice Cream Sandwich strong enough to go head to head with iOS 5?' The exec concluded his email saying that he believed the campaign was long overdue. Todd Pendleton, Samsung Telecommunications America’s chief marketing officer, then replied that Samsung will execute the plan. 'Hey Michael, we are going to execute what you are recommending in our holiday [Galaxy S2] campaign, and go head to head with iPhone 4S,' he said. 'We are working on a very aggressive strategy touting our advantages in hardware and software. In the process we will demystify the perceived Apple advantage (ecosystem/services) by showing how consumers can easily switch to Android and have more personalization/more choice by being part of the Samsung ecosystem. More to come soon… Best TP,' Pendleton said. Dirty tricks: Samsung called for an attack against the iPhone just a few days after Steve Jobs died . Ready for battle: Execs at Samsung knew that after Jobs died, there was going to be a lot of positive press for Apple and Jobs which would spill over to the iPhone. Samsung wanted to blunt the impact of all that positive press by pointing out why its phone was better than the iPhone . Samsung started attacking the iPhone that winter with their 'Next Big Thing' ad campaign in 2012, which mocked people for standing in line to buy Apple products. The ads were extremely effective. While reviews praised the Galaxy S2, Samsung continued to escalate its anti-Apple marketing campaign in following years. The most effective anti-iPhone campaigns followed in 2012, with Samsung launching its 'Next Big Thing' attack that became viral online. An internal email exchange from Apple revealed earlier during the trial, showed that Apple was quite affected by this particular Samsung campaign, and even considered changing ad agencies to freshen up iPhone advertising. Apple and Samsung have been waging their latest patent war in a trial that started March 31. The two companies have accused each other of copying certain patented features for their own mobile devices. Pennington is one of at least five high-ranking executives from Samsung's US mobile business who have left the company or given notice over the past two months. Neither Apple nor Samsung immediately responded to a request for comment.","Samsung decided to start campaign attacking Apple two days after Steve Jobs died .

"By . Associated Press . The man arrested near the Boston Marathon finish line carrying a backpack containing a rice cooker on the anniversary of the bombings has been sent to a state psychiatric facility for an evaluation Wednesday following his initial court appearance. Kevin 'Kayvon' Edson was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital and ordered held on $100,000 bail after an appearance in Boston Municipal Court on charges of threatening battery, possession of a hoax explosive device, threats to commit a crime, disturbing the peace, disturbing a public assembly and disorderly conduct. The 25-year-old's next court date was scheduled for May 7. According to a police report read aloud in court, after Edson was read his rights, he told an officer: 'I knew what I was doing, it was conceived in my head. It's symbolism, come on. The performance got the best of me.' Scroll down for video . Color coordination: 'Kayvon' Edson's face was painted yellow and blue, the traditional colors of the marathon, when he was arrested Tuesday night after dropping off a backpack with a rice cooker filled with confetti at the finish line on the one-year anniversary of the bombings . Edson's arrest occurred hours after ceremonies to mark last year's Boston Marathon bombings, in which two pressure cooker bombs hidden in backpacks exploded, killing three people near the finish line and injuring more than 260 others. Edson, with addresses in Boston and Wakefield, was stopped late Tuesday after passers-by told an officer they saw him yelling, walking barefoot down the middle of a street, veiled in black, in pouring rain. His face was painted yellow and blue, the traditional colors of the marathon, police said. The street was open to pedestrians at the time, and police said his presence was not a security breach. Man behind the stunt: Edson told police that he 'got caught up in the performance' when he went through with the bomb scare . Mental problems: Edson's mother said that the former art school student, seen in court on Wednesday, has bipolar disorder . The backpack was destroyed in a controlled explosion by police, who later determined that the contents were not explosive. Edson's mother, Joie Edson, said her son has bipolar disorder. Parsons The New School for Design and the Fashion Institute of Technology, both in New York City, confirmed that Edson had taken classes at their schools but never graduated. The Massachusetts College of Art and Design posted a statement on its website saying that an undergraduate student had been arrested by police and the school was cooperating with authorities, but it did not mention Edson by name. The stunt : Witnesses spotted the first bag being dropped off by a . barefoot man- later identified as Edson- dressed in all black with a black veil who was 'acting . strangely' and yelling 'Boston Strong!' What remained: A member of the bomb squad inspects the bag after a controlled detonation at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in Boston, Tuesday, April 15, 2014 . A second suspicious backpack also was found Tuesday. Officers determined it had been left behind by a media outlet and was not dangerous, but it too was destroyed. The backpacks rattled nerves days ahead of this year's marathon. Police kept people away from the finish line area for about three hours Tuesday and trains bypassed the nearby Copley Square station. 'With the marathon coming, our officers are taking it seriously,' police Superintendent Randall Halstead said. 'The safety of the public is utmost.'","Kevin 'Kayvon' Edson was arrested Tuesday after dropping a backpack with a rice cooker filled with confetti at the Boston Marathon finish line .

"By . James Gordon . A 20-year-old man convicted of shooting a state trooper dead during a routine traffic stop has been declared brain dead after attempting to kill himself, just a week after being sentenced to life in prison without parole. Eric Knysz  was found in his prison cell, hanging by a bed sheet and is now on a ventilator at a Jackson hospital in Michigan, while doctors conduct tests to see if his organs can be donated. He was given a whole life tariff last week after being found guilty of murdering 43-year-old Paul Butterfield II when the police officer pulled over his pickup truck in Mason County, Michigan last September. Michigan State Police officials, who are investigating Knysz's suicide attempt, have referred questions about Knysz to the corrections department. Jailed: Eric Knysz was given the whole life tariff after being found guilty of murdering 43-year-old Paul Butterfield II when the officer pulled over his pickup truck in Mason County, Michigan last September . Cut short: State Trooper Butterfield was newly engaged to Jennifer Sielski when he was shot dead . Knysz was under suicide watch while he was being held at the Mason County Jail, sources said, but that he never displayed any suicidal behavior. Officer Butterfield was shot in the head during a routine traffic stop on September 9, 2013 and died in surgery later the same day. Knysz was arrested along with his wife Sarah in Manistee County shortly after the shooting. According to testimony at his trial, his motive was fear of going to prison because he was driving on a suspended license and had guns concealed in the pickup truck he was driving. The result of his action was a life sentence to prison, and ultimately his suicide attempt. Slain: Trooper Paul Butterfield II was shot dead by Eric Knysz during a routine traffic stop in September . As well as first degree murder, Knysz was also found guilty of vehicle theft, carrying a concealed weapon, felony firearm and being an habitual offender. Speaking at Knysz’s sentencing last week, Butterfield’s fiancee Jennifer Sielski said: 'I felt like . the luckiest woman in the world just to be a part of Paul’s life... He was . my friend, my inspiration, my hero, my soulmate.' Mr Butterfield's father also spoke at the sentencing, addressing Knysz directly. 'At the age of 19 years old you have . effectively ended the life of freedom for yourself... At 19, Paul was a . high school graduate, a state class A cross-country champion and . enrolled at the University of Tennessee for track and country. He ran . marathons world-wide and participated in several triathalons… what have . you accomplished by the age of 19?' he said. 'I . do not know if you’re planning on giving a statement to the court but . if you say how sorry you are for what happened it’ll be for one reason . and one reason only and as that is you got caught,' Mr Butterfield added. Officials say Eric Knysz tried to hang himself Monday using a bedsheet . As well as first degree murder, Knysz was also found guilty of vehicle theft, carrying a concealed weapon, felony firearm and being an habitual offender . Paul Butterfield's father (left) spoke at the sentencing. He addressed Knysz directly, comparing his murdered son's many achievements by the age of 19 with the little Eric Knysz has accomplished . During sentencing Knysz did apologise to the Butterfield family 'for everything I’ve done and the pain I’ve put them through'. 'I’m sorry, I never meant to take the life of your son. I never meant for any of this to happen,' he added. In his closing arguments during the trial, defense . attorney David Glancy noted that the only witness who could place Knysz . in the pickup that day was his wife, Sarah, who testified against him. Glancy . said she benefited from a plea deal with prosecutors that brought her a . sentence of two to five years in prison as an accessory after the fact.

Sarah Knysz, . who was in the car at the time of the shooting, had told the court it . was out of fear for her life and that of her unborn child that she . protected her husband after the shooting. 'There wasn’t anything that I thought I could have done that day,' she said. 'He . had a gun and he shot the trooper, and if he did that, what was he . going to do to a witness that was going to tell on him and was going to . turn him in?

"By . James Gordon . An Florida high school teacher was arrested on a DUI charge for the second time in a year as she drove to work on Monday morning. Nancy Vaughn who is the reading teacher at Estero High School in Naples, was three times over the legal drink drive limit according to a Lee County Sheriff’s Office arrest report. Deputies said Vaughn, 57, of Bonita Springs, was swerving across lanes at 20 mph about a mile from Estero High School, when a Florida deputy stopped her at about 7 a.m. Bad teacher: A Florida teacher was arrested Monday morning charged with driving under the influence. 56-year-old Estero High School reading teacher Nancy Vaughn was taken into custody . She told cops she hadn’t consumed alcohol or taken any prescription drugs. Vaughan said she believed she had been driving at 45 mph as she made her way to work. She continued for about a half-mile after a deputy flashed their lights, commanding her to pull over. Once out of her car, Vaughn told the deputy she was driving to work at about 45 mph, denying she was under the influence of alcohol or prescription drugs. Lee County sheriff’s deputies were alerted to Vaughn at about 6:50 a.m. Monday, 10 minutes before Estero High School’s first bell, . Estero High School : Nancy Vaughn, was pulled over by deputies less than a mile from the school. She was charged with DUI. The district removed her from the classroom pending the outcome of the investigation . Vaughn will be now placed on administrative assignment, which means she will be placed outside of school, pending an internal investigation. Vaughn has been in jail for the past couple of days because she was already on probation relating to a May 2013 DUI to which she pleaded no contest. She was given a years probation and also had her license revoked, however she was allowed to drive to and from work. Teachers have to notify the district within 48 hours if there's an incident involving a substance. Discipline is then determined on a case by case basis, Chandler said, adding there was no disciplinary action against Vaughn for the previous incident . Students spoken to by FOX 4 News can't believe one of their own teachers is accused of driving to school drunk . 'There are some kids that are already going down that path and it doesn't look good and it doesn't help knowing that teachers are doing it too,' Vaughn's former student, Chris Argiro, said. Hard habit to break: This is the second time within in ayear year Nancy Vaughn has been pulled over for DUI . 'It is pretty scary, you're in class and you don't really know if she's been drunk. When I had her she might have been drunk while teaching me.' 'It sets a really bad example for the kids and people look up to their teachers and it makes the school look bad,' student Julia Brancato said. Vaughn's former students said they don't know if she should be trusted to teach. In the May 2013 arrest, deputies were called to Vaughn's home when a resident noticed her car up on a curb as she tried to pass through a gate. She drove home swerving and driving slowly along the road, ignoring the flashing lights on a deputy's vehicle. In the driveway, Vaughn rambled incoherently and told a deputy she 'partied a little too hard' on the last day of school, the report said. 'She then began to cry and say that she knew that she had drank too much and knew that she should not have been driving,' a sheriff's deputy wrote in his report. 'Vaughn continued by trying to justify that she had not hurt anyone and that she had made it to her driveway.'","Nancy Vaughn, 57, told cops she hadn’t consumed alcohol or taken any prescription drugs .

"By . Associated Press . and Francesca Chambers . In an interview with the Today Show on Wednesday, Second Lady of the United State Jill Biden opened up about why she fell for then-Senator Joe Biden more than 30 years ago. 'Was it his humor? What was it?' asked Today's Tamron Hall. 'Oh, no,' replied Jill. 'I loved his two sons - our two sons - Bo and Hunter. So I always say that I fell in love with the boys first.' Scroll down for videos . Wednesday morning, Jill Biden joined Tamron Hall on Today to mark the third anniversary of Joining Forces, a national initiative to support America's service members and military families . Jill Biden takes questions from twitter on Wednesday's Today Show about her personal life. A viewer asked what Biden reads for fun, and Today's Tamron Hall said she hoped Biden wasn't reading Fifty Shades of Grey, which elicited laughter from both women . It's no secret that Second Lady of the . United States Jill Biden did not fall in love with Vice President Joe . Biden at first sight. The VP has noted in an interview with Rachel Ray . last month that he proposed to Jill five times before she said, 'yes.' 'The fifth time, I said to her, ""Jill, . my Irish pride has gotten a hold of me. This is the last time I'm gonna . ask you,"" ' I said. ' ""You don't have to tell me when you will marry me, . just if you'll marry me."" ' 'She said, ""yes."" ' 'Everybody knows I love Jill more than she loves me,' he said, joking, later in interview. On Today, Jill Biden also gave viewers a taste of a day in her life. 'There really is no typical day. You know, I'm a teacher, I teach full time. I wake up before 6 a.m., then I go out to teach some days,' she said. Biden said there is one activity that she does try to do consistently, though: working out. 'I'm a runner. I try to exercise every day, so I run a couple times a week and I take barre class a couple times a week.' Biden answered personal questions during her visit to the show Wednesday, but the purpose of her appearance was to promote a new website . that makes it easier for service members, veterans, their spouses and . dependents to calculate their Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits at thousands of . schools and job training programs. 'In just a couple easy steps they can figure everything out,' Biden told The Associated Press before the show. Using the GI Bill comparison tool, . service members can estimate tuition and fees, housing allowances and . book stipends for each school. They also can find data on graduation . rates, loan default rates, median borrowing levels and other indicators. Before . the website was created, service members had to consult multiple . sources to find the same information, said Biden, a military mom. Her . stepson Beau serves in the Delaware National Guard. Loving embrace: Joe and Jill Biden (pictured after a 2012 debate), have quite a love story, as was outlined by Bidens in recent interviews . The website launched in February, but the vice president's wife is highlighting its existence as she and first lady Michelle Obama mark the third anniversary this month of Joining Forces, their nationwide support program for service members, veterans and their families. Biden said on Today that she and Mrs. Obama started the site 'to encourage all Americans to support and honor our military families.' Last week at the White House, both women recognized the millions of caregivers of sick or wounded service members and veterans. The website was created under an executive order President Barack Obama signed two years ago to make sure GI Bill beneficiaries have the information they need to compare options and make the best choices about their education benefits. Congress created the Post-9/11 GI Bill in 2008. Service members and veterans who have spent at least 90 days on active duty since Sept. 10, 2001, are eligible. The Veterans Affairs Department says it has distributed more than $30 billion in tuition and other education-related payments under the bill to more than 1 million veterans, service members and their families, and to the universities, colleges and trade schools they attend.","Jill Biden joined the Today Show on Wednesday .

"By . Lydia Warren . Chilling home surveillance footage has revealed the moment a teenage trespasser broke into a home and then watched a baby boy in his crib as his parents slept. The would-be burglar can be seen pointing a flashlight towards the two-year-old boy after coming across his crib in the home in Flint Hill Drive in Katy, near Houston, Texas on the morning of April 5. After briefly pausing while looking down at the little boy, the suspect then turned away and continued looking through the home for items, eventually leaving with a laptop. The Le family were stunned when they learned just how close the alleged burglar came to their son. Scroll down for video . Frightening: A teen trespasser approaches a toddler's crib after breaking into a Houston-area home . Chilling: He can be seen pausing to look over the sleeping boy and pointing a flash light in his direction . 'As soon as I knew we'd been broken into, I went upstairs and checked him right away and I kissed him so hard,' the boy's relieved father Thinh Lee told KTRK. The suspect, who has still not been caught, climbed into the family's home through a first-story window that had been left unlocked. Le said he believes the teenager knew he was being filmed because he sometimes looked towards the cameras but continued anyway. He is recorded walking from room to room in the house for about five minutes before entering the toddler's bedroom. His parents did not wake during the break-in. Relief: The teen, who has not been caught, turns his back to the crib and continues through the house . 'Theft': He finds the homeowners' laptop computer, which was later found on a neighbor's lawn . 'I was infuriated when I saw him walking . back and forth in my baby's room,' Le told KHOU. 'My stomach was turning. He's my world. I love him.' Le said he thinks his son stirred but fell back to sleep, perhaps thinking the man was his father. He said it didn't bear thinking about what could have happened if the little boy had cried, sending his parents upstairs to check on him. The burglar left the home before moving onto another house in the area, which also had an unlocked window. Resident Crystal Cox said she and her boyfriend were stirred when they heard her dog bark differently than usual. Her boyfriend shined a laser pointer downstairs and the teenager fled. He left his loot - including Cox's purse, a laptop bag and Le's laptop bag - on her front lawn. Cox found Le's address inside his laptop bag and contacted him - and they began piecing the attempted stealing spree together.

"By . Jill Reilly . CCTV may have captured the elusive artist Banksy as he was installing his latest creation in Bristol. Cameras - ironically set up to deter graffiti artists - filmed two people dressed as workmen unloading kit from the back of a white van in the early hours of Sunday morning. The video belongs to Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project - they removed the artwork hours after it was put up, sparking a row over theft - and even leading to the leader receiving death threats. Scroll down for video . CCTV may have captured the elusive artist Banksy as he was installing his latest creation in Bristol. Cameras - ironically set up to deter graffiti artists - filmed two people unloading kit from the back of a white van in the early hours of Sunday morning . The elusive artist's work depicts a couple embracing while looking at their mobile phones - he posted it on his website on Monday. It was quickly spotted on a boarded-up doorway in a wall on a rundown street on the edge of Bristol city centre. But just hours later it was removed from the wall using a crow bar by members of the nearby Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project who are now charging people to come and see it. The elusive artist's work depicts a couple embracing while looking at their mobile phones - he posted it on his website on Monday . The financially struggling youth group - who insist Banksy wanted them to have it - plan to sell the work to fund the future of the club, and hope to bring in £100,000. Leader of the youth club Dennis Stinchcombe MBE, 58, said he has now received death threats after taking around 40 phone calls from angry street art fanatics. He said: 'People have been calling up and telling us we have no right to take it down, that it is public and we are stealing. 'People have even said they are going to come down here and sort us out. 'They said they are going to do all sorts of nasty things to us. We have even had death threats.' 'He has given it to the club. He couldn't give it to us directly as the gates were locked so he put it as close as he could. 'He has done it to help the right people. I was approached by somebody who knows Banksy very well. He's an artist himself and he said 'you need to take that Dennis, get it into that club - it's what it is meant for.

A notice where Mobile Lovers once stood, directs people to the youth group if they want to view the work for a small donation . 'Banksy never does his street art on pieces of wood - they are always on walls so they can't be taken away. 'We need £120,000 to keep going and our fundraising appeal has so far only brought a few thousand pounds. 'Now we've ended up with a Banksy on our doorstep. It is a dream come true. I'm absolutely buzzing. 'We have taken it off the wall carefully, it isn't damaged at all. If anyone wants to see it they can come in here and put a donation in the box if they feel like it. 'Somebody was saying it is worth £40,000 but I am hoping for £100,000. It has been authenticated on his website but I am going to try to get it officially done as well. 'We will let people come and see it in here for a while then get it to Bonhams for valuation. 'The money will allow us to do everything we could dream of. It will stand us in good stead for the next 120 years.' A screen print of Mobile Lovers has been pasted on top of the boarded up doorway in place of the original . The Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project defended the decision to remove the Banksy and sell it. Left the gate seen in the CCTV and right the artwork on the wall . Visitors today were advised they did not need to donate to the club but many insisted it was what they wanted to do . Bristol City Council said they were not '100 per cent sure of the ownership' of the wall the artwork was attached to. But today all that was left where it stood was a sign which said: 'The new Banksy piece is being held in our club to prevent any vandalism or damage being done. 'You are free to come and view but a small donation will be asked of you. Thanks.' Teenagers at Broad Plain and Riverside Youth Project defended the decision to remove the Banksy and sell it. Jordan Pawell, 19, has been attending the project for 11 years - the last two as a youth worker. The teenager, who helped remove the art work, said: 'It is a really good atmosphere here, with lots of activities to do and loads of people to speak to. 'If we hadn't brought it in it would have been taken by someone else and sold privately and then nobody would have seen it then.' Visitors today were advised they did not need to donate to the club but many insisted it was what they wanted to do. Engineer Paul Messenger, 52, of Bristol said: 'I don't mind at all, I think it was a sensible thing to do.'It can make money for a good cause. I would suggest it was the right thing to do.' Mr Messenger's mother, Dorothy Messenger, 90, agreed. 'I enjoyed seeing it, it was very good,' she added. Alison Bevan, director of the Royal West of England Academy, the first art gallery in Bristol, described the piece as 'brilliant'. 'I think that the fact it was screwed on to a wall makes it extremely portable and would have increased the likelihood of someone taking it. 'From my point of view, the fact it has come to an organisation like this, that is supporting the local community is better than it going straight to some wealthy collector.' Mr Stinchcombe added that Bristol City Council, who he believes own the wall, do not like graffiti and would probably have painted over the piece. A spokeswoman for Avon & Somerset Police said officers were not investigating the removal of the artwork. The Banksy that appeared on the side of a house on Sunday in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire . 'We have not received any reports of a criminal offence,' she said. However, a police officer and a PCSO visited the centre today and advised the youth club to seek legal advice before selling the piece. This latest artwork in Clement Street comes just days after a mother-of-five woke up to find a Banksy mural on the side of her rented house on Sunday. Stunned Karen Smith, 48, heard voices outside in the early hours but thought nothing of it until she spotted men loading huge screens into a van. She watched them zoom off before finding a painting of three 1950s-style spies on the side of her £300,000 three-bed semi in Cheltenham, Glos. The men in the picture are carrying listening devices and crowded around a real phone box outside her home. Mystery man: Banksy appears in his 2011 film Exit Through The Gift Shop . He's the Scarlet Pimpernel of modern art and his true identity remains a jealously guarded secret. A network of myths has grown up around him. That his real name is Robin Banks. That he used to be a butcher. That his parents don't know what he does, believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator. Then there's the suggestion that Banksy is actually a collective of artists and doesn't exist at all. Banksy's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism. However by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation. He has been photographed in the past but always wearing a mask or hood. In 2008 he was reportedly 'unmasked' as Robin Gunningham, a former public schoolboy from Bristol with a passion for art. At the time Banksy's agent refused to confirm or deny the story. Banksy then wrote on his website:'I am unable to comment on who may or may not be Banksy, but anyone described as being 'good at drawing' doesn't sound like Banksy to me.' Fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film Exit Through The Gift Shop - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated. This photograph apparently shows reclusive graffiti artist Banksy in LA in 2011 . Past 'Banky sightings' include: .","Created Mobile Lovers at the weekend on the edge of Bristol city centre .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Distinctive looinkg: Johnathan Schmidt, 29, cut another man with a knife . A man who is known to be the founder of a racist, neo-Nazi, skinhead gang has been arrested by police for cutting a man with a knife. Police in California had no identifying 29-year-old Jonathan Schmidt. After a fight occurred at a bar on Sunday night in Riverside County when before they finally tracked down the distinctive-looking Schmidt. According to the Riverside County Sheriff's office,Schmidt, 29, cut another man with a knife. It happened after the victim was attempting to stop a fight involving others. After Schmidt fled the area in a dark green Ford Explorer, officers had no trouble tracking him down and pulling him over. Police officers determined that Schmidt had attacked the victim and several others at the establishment. Schmidt was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon and battery. This is not the first time Schmidt has been in trouble with the law. In January he was accused of stomping on a man's face in which the victim suffered a broken skull and lost several teeth but a jury found him not guilty. It is known that Schmidt is part of Die Auserwählten, a little-known racist skinhead gang making a name for itself in mayhem and murder. Schmidt is the founder of Die Auserwählten, which is also known as Crew 41. Its German name translates, more or less, as 'the chosen' or 'the favored few.' Schmidt, whose face is a mask of tattoos displaying his hate and his sorrow, lives in south-central Nebraska. Schmidt has an exceedingly distinctive facial appearance. His face is covered in tattoos, including '5150,' police code for someone involuntarily committed to a mental institution, 'FYL' for “f*** your life,' “RIP Donny Boi,' a tribute to a skinhead tattoo artist killed by California police during a shootout earlier in July, and runes, or medieval Germanic letters, on his left eyebrow that spell out 'Hate.'","Jonathan Schmidt is a well known member of Die Auserwählten, a little-known racist skinhead gang .

"By . James  Nye . Cocaine with a street value of $300 million has been recovered by US and Canadian coast guards in two separate drug seizures in the Caribbean Sea. More than 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilos) of the highly addictive drug in 127 bales were paraded for the media on Tuesday in Miami by the US Coast Guard. The narcotics would have an estimated wholesale value of $110 million, but that would be expected to rise three times when the drugs are distributed through dealers in the United States. Scroll down for video . Huge haul: The drugs the US Coast Guard recovered are paraded in Miami on Tuesday . 'We can safely assume that these drugs probably would have ended up here,' said U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Junior Grade Meaghan Gies to The Miami Herald. The first seizure was managed by Her Majesty's Canadian Ship Glace Bay on March 15 when they boarded a suspect fishing boat on fire containing three Colombians, two Venezuelans and one Panamanian, the Coast Guard said. When the coast guard turned to drop the men off in Jamaica they found 97 bales dumped and floating in the water nearby. 'We were able to recover the drugs but cannot prosecute the case,' said Marilyn Fajardo, the deputy public affairs officer for the US Coast Guard. Recovery: The drugs have a street value of $300 million and are represent one of the largest hauls in recent memory for the US Coast Guard . Pride: U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Junior Grade Meaghan Gies talks to the media about the huge drugs bust . The second bust took place in the waters between Colombia and Honduras on March 19. The US Coast Guard fired warning shots at a boat when they spotted members of its crew throwing bales of cocaine into the water. They managed to recover most of it, arrested five Colombian nationals and transported them back to Colombia for prosecution. 'It is one of the larger hauls the Coast Guard has brought in, in recent memory,' said Lt. J.G. Meaghan Gies at a press conference in Miami Beach. Impressive: Wearing protective gloves and masks, members of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Legare carried 127 bales of cocaine with a street value of about $350 million off the ship in March . 'The main goal of the Coast Guard is to stop this bulk contraband, this cocaine, from contributing to the crime and violence of South Florida.' The drug busts were part of Operation Martillo, an international effort launched in January 2012 to keep drugs from landing on American and international soil. 'This seizure is just another successful example of our cooperation with our partners to maintain a forward presence in the Caribbean Sea,' said Marilyn Fajardo . 'About 80 percent of the cocaine comes in through water,' Gies said. 'The idea is to stop it before it is broken up into smaller parts and distributed.' Grab: The drugs were recovered and the five Colombians found aboard were turned over to Colombian authorities for prosecution, the Coast Guard said . In January $37 million worth of cocaine was brought into Miami Beach after a joint British and American operation in the Caribbean. And according to Fajardo, 14,000 kilos of cocaine has been seized since October 1, 2013. 'We hope with these drug offloads that we are sending a clear message that the Coast Guard means business,' Fajardo said. 'Our crews are out there every day risking their lives to protect our U.S. borders.'","Operation Martillo, an international effort recovered the narcotics in two separate busts in March .

Homicide: The death of Tiona Rodriguez's infant son death was ruled a homicide by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner Tuesday - months after his October, 2013 passing. She is shown in October at a court hearing for shoplifting charges . 'No idea': The teen, pictured in October, told the Daily News Tuesday that she had 'no idea' about the homicide ruling. It's not clear if she will now face murder charges . Homicide prosecutors had been probing the case since the teen was arrested. She wasn't initially charged over the macabre find. The . then-17-year-old, was released without bail after she pleaded not . guilty to petty larceny and possession of stolen property charges. However . at the time, authorities said they couldn't bring charges over the dead . baby until forensic tests determined exactly how the full-term newborn . died. Preliminary . reports from detectives suggested the fetus was born alive and may have been asphyxiated. 'I . don’t want to ignore the elephant in the room, but we are only . arraigning the shoplifts,' Assistant District Attorney Robert . Hettleman told the court at the October hearing, according to New York Daily News. The court released Rodriguez' friend . Francis Estevez without bail and soon after more than a dozen uniformed . police officers and . detectives had descended on her Queens home with a crime scene unit . truck, a neighbor said.

The friends were arrested on October 17 in a . Victoria's Secret shop on 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan. The grisly discovery was made when the two girls were stopped by a . security guard as they left the store in Herald Square on suspicion of . shoplifting. But as well as . allegedly finding stolen goods inside the . bags, the guard noticed there was a strong odor inside and found a tiny . body under the loot. Rodriguez . told detectives she had delivered a day earlier and didn't know what to . do, authorities said. 'Shoplifting with a . baby in her bag the entire time certainly suggests a little bit of . difficulty following society's rules,' Hettleman said at the hearing, adding that the matter was still under investigation. Found: Investigators remove evidence bags containing the male fetus from the scene on Thursday . 'The . NYPD, my office and the office of the Chief Medical Examiner are going . to continue to vigorously and thoroughly investigate the matter relating . to the baby,' he told the Post at the time. An initial autopsy of the dead baby was . inconclusive, and more tests were needed to determine how the child died, according to the city medical examiner's office. But New York Police Department spokesman, . John McCarthy, said that the case was still being investigated and that . police were awaiting the medical examiners' determination of the cause . of death. After Rodriguez was arrested on Thursday she was taken to Bellevue Hospital and both girls were arrested on petit larceny charges. On her Facebook page late on . Wednesday night, Rodriguez had complained about period cramps, and . added that she was excited about an upcoming job interview at Chipotle. One of Rodriguez's neighbors said she was shocked to hear the teenager had been pregnant. Health problems: Tiona had complained of period pains the day before she was stopped in Victoria's Secret . Teen mom: Tiona, who has a two-year-old son, told police she had a miscarriage the day before . Shocking discovery: A police officer outside the Victoria's Secret branch where a fetus was found in a bag . Zami . Ford, 17, said: 'I've known her since she was little. She was probably . nervous and didn't know what to do. She would never hurt anyone.' She said she was unaware of the teen's pregnancy and was stunned by the allegations. 'She's a good girl.

John Jay Barrett IV was born over the weekend and weighed a healthy 6lbs 15oz. He is Mrs Barrett's second child with husband of 11 years, John, a pilot with New Jersey National Guard, following three-year-old daughter Avery. Scroll down for video . Happy ending: Fox news anchor Kerry Barrett (left) welcomed little John Jay Barrett IV (right) into the world over the weekend, weighing in at 6lbs 15oz, following several tragic miscarriages . Last November, after much anguish, Mrs . Barrett broke her silence on the evening news and spoke of suffering . repeated miscarriages - four of which she detailed. 'For most of the last year and a half - I've been pregnant, and miscarried every single time,' she revealed to Fox News. Her second miscarriage started just half an hour before she was due to go on air for the 10 'o clock news, and none of her colleagues knew she was pregnant, so stoically, Mrs Barrett went on with the show. She lost the baby at home later that night. Now there are four! Husband John Barrett (left) and Mrs Barrett (right) now have a son to join their three-year-old daughter Avery (center) 'You have the first and then the second . and now we are in phase where maybe we aren't able to have [more] kids,' her husband admitted at the time. The couple, heartbroken but determined not to give up, sought help from Dr Scott Edwards, a fertility specialist at Pennsylvania Hospital. No abnormalities were detected and both parents were found to be healthy and normal, news Mrs Barrett found 'difficult to wrap her head around'. The hopeful mother was put on a course of drugs to hyper-stimulate her ovaries, and immediately fell pregnant again - this time with twins. Heartbreak: Mrs Barrett went public with her struggles last November on an evening news special, speaking of her repeated miscarriages over the space of a year and a half . Raw: The new mother started having her second miscarriage just before going on air for her 10 'o clock news segment, which she finished, before losing her baby at home later that night . When the first ultrasound found the . embryos to be on the small side, Mrs Barrett admitted that she felt . somehow responsible. Hypothesizing it was because she hadn't been eating . enough, she drastically upped her food intake. 'I stuffed myself thinking it was my fault that the babies weren't growing,' she revealed. 'And then when we went back the next week, they hadn't grown anymore and the heartbeats had stopped.' This time, she had to have the fetuses surgically removed, and subsequent tests showed the babies had a relatively common chromosomal abnormality called Triosomy 18. Marriage strain: Mrs Benett admitted there were times during this awful period where she and her husband were having 'the worst fights' they had ever had . Happy family: The couple describe little Avery (pictured as a toddler) as 'our most exciting adventure, our biggest teacher and our greatest accomplishment' Months of spending 'far too much money' on various supplements and forms of acupuncture followed, and hours . spent in the middle of the night crawling the internet for more answers. She admits that the repeated the blows put an enormous strain on her marriage, recalling some of the 'worst fights' they had ever had; Mr Barrett finding it hard to watch his wife in so much pain, and Mrs Barrett feeling completely out of control of her body. Dr Edwards assured them that even following several miscarriages, there can still be a '50, 60, 70 per cent' chance of success in the future - and he was right. In August of last year, Mrs Barrett got pregnant again and this time carried the baby to full term.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . If tucking into chunk of brie or a creamy cappuccino is your idea of heaven, and you’re fed up of counting calories, you could just let cows do the dieting for you. Scientists have discovered that feeding cows rapeseed makes for a healthier milk. In a three-year experiment, groups of dairy cows were fed rapeseed supplements, which reduced the saturated fat content of their milk by more than a 25 per cent. Moo-ve over red-top milk: Scientists claim that feeding cows oilseed makes for healthier milk. Their results showed that their healthy diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis-monounsaturated fats and trans fats in the milk produced . The experiment was conducted among 22 dairy farms in south west England for over a month. After this period the saturated fat content of milk fat decreased by an average of five per cent, without altering the overall fat content of the milk. At the same time, monounsaturated fats were increased by an average of nine per cent. A further experiment showed that adding an oil-based supplement to a cow’s diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis-monounsaturated fats and transfats. Milk and dairy are vital components of our diet, providing about a quarter of our daily protein needs and up to 60 per cent of vital nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus. But they can also contain a saturated fat. Cardiovascular disease is the UK's single biggest killer, responsible for more than 88,000 deaths each year. The change in diet also increased both monounsaturated fats and natural trans fats, which are both thought to have health benefits. Scientists from the University of Reading claim that the milk tastes just as good as the less healthy alternative. This is because mono-unsaturated fats fill the gap where saturated fats have been reduced, which could be helpful for people eating a dairy-rich diet who might be at an increased risk of heart attacks. Cardiovascular disease is the UK's single biggest killer, responsible for more than 88,000 deaths each year and a key government recommendation in tackling heart disease is to reduce the amount of saturated fat in our diets. Milk and dairy foods are the largest single source of saturated fat in the UK diet, but also provide essential nutrients, so reducing the amount of milk we drink may be counter-productive. Milk is rich in calcium as well as  phosphorous, magnesium and protein which are all essential for healthy bones. Milking it? The scientists claim that the milk tastes as good as the less healthy alternative, but this will be put to the test when they conduct a further experiment to see if their healthier dairy products (a stock image is pictured) are appealing to other people and if they could reduce the risk of heart disease . Saturated fat is largely found in cream, cheese, butter and fatty meats as well as prepared food like pizza and sausage. Consuming high amounts of saturated fats can increase people's risk of heart disease. Monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil are typically liquid at room temperature. They provide nutrients to main the body's cells and are high in antioxidant vitamin E. Eaten in moderation they have health benefits and can help reduce bad cholesterol levels in the blood and lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. Monounsaturated fats include: rapeseed oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil and sesame oil as well as avocados, nuts and seeds. A total of 22 dairy farms in the south west of England were fed rapeseed supplements for over a month. After this period, the saturated fat content of milk fat decreased by an average of five per cent, without altering the overall fat content of the milk. At the same time, monounsaturated fats were increased by an average of nine per cent. The second study took place at the University of Reading's farm and looked in detail at the effect of different fats in the diet of the dairy cow. Results showed that adding an oil-based supplement to a cow’s diet cut saturated fat by 27 per cent and increased both cis-monounsaturated fats and transfats. Professor Ian Givens, project leader of the experiment at the University of Reading, said: ‘Adult milk consumption in the UK has dropped from about three litres per week in the 1970s to less than one litre. This is a big concern. A total of 22 dairy farms in the south west of England were fed rapeseed supplements for over a month. After this period, the saturated fat content of milk fat decreased by an average of five per cent, without altering the overall fat content of the milk. A field of rapeseed is pictured . ‘Milk and dairy are vital components of our diet, providing about a quarter of our daily protein needs and up to 60 per cent of vital nutrients such as calcium and phosphorus. Consumers need to regain faith in milk. ‘There is evidence that replacing a proportion of the saturated fats in milk with mono or polyunsaturated fats improves human cholesterol levels once consumed. Both our studies showed adding oilseed to a cow’s diet could be the answer.’ To build on the study, the researchers will examine whether their healthier milk and dairy could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Professor Julie Lovegrove who is leading the forthcoming Medical Research Council-backed study said: ‘After producing SFA-reduced milk at our farm, we will then make cheese and butter from this milk in our Food Processing Plant. ‘The effects of consuming these SFA-reduced dairy foods compared with normal products will then be carried out at our Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition.’","Feeding cows oilseed can significantly reduce the harmful saturated fat found in its milk  without compromising its nutritional benefits .

Long recovery: A dog badly burned when its owner reportedly set it on fire is continuing her recovery at the BluePearl Veterinary specialty and emergency hospital in Tampa . Doctors are concerned about Hopes eyes. Her corneas nearly melted after being set on fire . Face of evil: Larry Wallace, 66, is accused of setting his Shar-Pei mix, Hope, on fire . Police say Wallace chained her to a shed and set her on fire. Police initially responded to Wallace's home on March 20th after reports that the dog had been set on fire. A child told investigators he saw Wallace throw water on the dog to stop the flames.

It is the latest development in a bitter feud between the two politicians. Victor Ponta has moved out of his office because he believes the country's president has bugged his phone . The president and prime minister have in the past accused each other of corruption and dislike for each other. Mr Ponta is expected to run against a candidate appointed by Mr Basescu, who is stepping down after two terms in office. According to The Telegraph: 'Since this morning I have moved office. I asked the defence minister if I could have an office in the ministry,' Mr Ponta said on Wednesday. ' As it's a military facility, everybody who comes in is registered,' he added. Mr Ponta believes an alleged phone call made from his office was cited in a corruption investigation involving a party colleague. Romanian President Traian Basescu has been accused of tapping the prime minister's phone . The prime minister has claimed the investigation is a 'set up'. Elections will take place in November. Critics of the prime minister have accused him of making the allegation up in the run-up to the political battle. Mr Ponta recently described the president as a 'corrupt communist' who 'will end up in jail'.","Victor Ponta cleared his desk in an office in the defence ministry .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A judge has ruled that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can be visited by his relatives without an FBI agent present. The Boston Marathon bombing suspect had previously been watched during the visits, but his defense attorneys argued that there was no clear threat and the agent's presence prevented the family from speaking freely. 'This case is very much a story about a family and the relationships between them,' defense attorney David Bruck said in a court hearing on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Family ties: Defense attorneys for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) argued that he did not need an agent present when he met with his sister in prison and they are trying to understand the relationship he had with his older, now-deceased brother Tamerlan (left) The judge agreed with the defense's point, pushing past the prosecution's suggestion that the minder was needed for security. 'I donâ€™t think the safety, security issue looms very large,' US district judge George A. O'Toole Jr ruled. The Boston Globe reported that the decision will not be final until the US Bureau of Prisons weighs in, and that is expected to take about two weeks. The agent's presence is not only a question of security but could also have a role in the trial as it was earlier reported that during one of these visits, the agent allegedly heard Dzohkhar say something controversial in a heated exchange with his sister. 'Tsarnaev, despite the presence of an FBI agent and an employee of the federal public defender, was unable to temper his remarks and made a statement to his detriment which was overheard by the agent,' a late February court hearing stated. Under a spell: The denfense s planning on describing how Dzhokhar was under his brother's control when he participated in the dual bombing at the Boston Marathon in 2013 (pictured: then-19-year-old Dzhokhar being captured) Prosecutors later said that the remark was 'the driving force' behind Tsarnaev's defense team's decision to push for a change in the visitation procedure. The strategy also suggests that the defense team is preparing to paint Dzhokhar, who was 19 at the time of last year's bombings, as under the mental control of his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan who was killed in a shoot out with police. On Wednesday, the prosecutors also said that Tsarnaev's defense team will not have access to the growing file on a triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts in 2011 that Tamerlan was apparently involved in. Police were looking into the connection and interviewing a friend of Tamerlan's named Ibragim Todashev in Florida when Todashev attacked the investigating agents and was shot dead. Paying respects: The court decisions come just one day after the anniversary of the bombings (the Boylston Street finish line pictured on Tuesday during a memorial ceremony) The prosecution in Dzhokhar's case admitted that it does not appear that the suspect had any knowledge of his brother's involvement in the 2011 case so there is no reason to connect it to the Boston Marathon case. They also said that by releasing the case file on the 2011 triple slaying could be potentially detrimental to the renewed investigation into that case. This is an important week in the case, if not necessarily for the ongoing federal trial process but because Tuesday marked the one-year anniversary of the double bombing at the finish line that left three spectators dead and more than more than 260 injured.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev previously had to be supervised during his visits with his sisters but a judge ruled that he should be allowed privacy .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Conservationists have launched a fresh attack on the killing of sharks cull off Western Australia after a tiger shark was shot three times and took 15 minutes to die. According to environmental group Sea Shepherd, the three-metre long creature was caught about 1km off Mullaloo Beach, north of Perth, on Monday. A hook pierced its head and the creature sustained further injuries as it thrashed around and tried to free itself. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Department of Fisheries Western Australia authorities haul up a 3m tiger shark that had been killed as part of a cull - sparking debate from conservation groups . When found by Western Australian Fisheries, the department reportedly used its boat, bearing the slogan slogan fish for the future, to drag the distressed animal. Following this, three fatal shots were then fired into the shark's head before it was hauled onto the boat and then later dumped out to sea. Sea Shepherd Australia managing director Jeff Hanson said it took the shark up to 15 minutes to die. 'The reason they killed it its part of the fisheries' policy that any shark more than thee metres will be killed,' he said of the cull's conditions. 'We won't accept the Japanese whaling fleets doing that. They're (the fisheries) killing a protecting species.' Mr Hanson alleged the Western Australia Fisheries authorities have used tactics such as running the Sea Shepherd's boats out of fuel and dumping sharks in exclusion zones to prevent them seeing the full extent of the cull. The drum line program was introduced in January after seven fatal shark attacks in Western Australia waters in the last three years . Sea Shepherd crew member Tim Watters he struggled to comprehend the treatment of the shark. 'I have now seen first hand the barbaric, senseless, cruel and tragedy of the Western Australia shark cull,' he said. Drum lines: The animal shot dead was found 1km off Mullaloo Beach, north of Perth, in an attempt to stop attacks on humans . 'I have seen today a beautiful female 3m plus tiger shark in such a stressed state, thrashing around for her life, before being pulled alongside and shot three times. Mr Watters said it was likely the shark was pregnant at its time of death, given the time of year. 'I have just returned from defending the whales in the Antarctic Southern Ocean whale sanctuary and can not believe what I am seeing right off our Western Australia coast, it rivals that of any cruelty and insanity of the Japanese whale poachers. A Department of Premier and Cabinet spokesperson said as of March 16, 110 tiger sharks had been killed. 'It's not an unusual occurrence,' he said of killing the shark and added that the rifles used were the most humane way of doing so. The spokesman confirmed sharks under three metres are released alive as soon as possible, while those more than three metres of the bull, tiger or white species are killed humanely after being caught. 'Sharks under three metres are released if they are alive and OK. But we do pull up some dead sharks,' he said. With sharks being killed daily as part of the cull, the spokesman said the aim was to make beaches safer. Earlier on Monday, the non-profit conservation organisation saw an injured 2.7m tiger shark caught on a drum line 1km off Scarborough Beach, north of Perth, be released by Western Australia Fisheries, despite its injuries. With the animal believed to have been hooked during the night, the fisheries officers inspected the caught animal. Despite the animal's wounds, after pulling the shark on board, it was released into the water near its original capture still bleeding. Sea Shepherd Captain Mike Dicks said with the possibility of the shark being hooked over night, it would have been unable to swim and get vital oxygen to its organs. This causes the animal to go into a tonic state of immobility. Tiger shark: The animal can grow up to 5 metres and is regarded as one of the most dangerous species of shark - making up a large number of the attacks on humans . Mr Dicks said the contrary to the cull protecting the public from sharks, it was doing the opposite. 'It makes public safety worse with sharks being drawn closer to our beaches stimulated by bait,' he said. Mr Hanson said despite the shark's release, it could have died or been attacked by other animals. 'We don't know - it's hard to say,' he said. 'It really wasn't in a good state.' Both of the the incidents were caught on video by the Sea Shepherd organisation, watching from a nearby boat. Mr Hanson said the cull was not about sharks being more important that humans, but wanted to see alternatives used to killing the animals. 'Healthy oceans give humanity oxygen and oceans need sharks,' he said. Mr Hanson added in a time of animal conservation including sharks, the Westrern Australia government was using 1950s solutions for the issue. He cited the protection of the great white shark, which is also being killed as part of the government's cull. Alternatives include eco-barriers and relying on a shark spotters program, where surfers and swimmers collect data on sharks to asses the level of shark danger. The Australian Federal Government approved the cull, which ends in three years, but the Western Australia Government is seeking to extending these until 2019. Sea Shepherd Australia aims to stop the destruction of habitat and killing of ocean wildlife and recently failed to secure a Supreme Court injunction to force the WA government to suspend the cull. The trial of the cull runs until April 30.","Sea Shepherd Australia members have witnessed brutal treatment of tiger sharks caught in drum lines .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . We may feel like we are in our peak in our twenties – but scientists believe our brains start going downhill after the age of 24. Researchers used computer games as a way of testing our ability to process ­information and react to it – known as ­‘cognitive motor skills’. The study involved more than 3,300 people aged 16 to 44 playing a space battle and ­trading game called StarCraft II. According to new research, the human brain may start to decline at the age of just 24 . In the game, players can buy and sell spaceships, upgrade their weapons and trade with or wage war on fellow players. The study revealed a link between age and being slower at the game. Researchers said that those over the age of 24 tended to ­perform less well. Lead author Joe ­Thompson, a PhD student from Simon Fraser University in Canada, said: ‘After around 24 years of age, players show slowing in a measure of cognitive speed that is known to be important for performance. Although older players are less able to react quickly, researchers say cognitive motor capacities change throughout adulthood . ‘This cognitive performance decline is present even at higher levels of skill.’ Although older players are less able to react quickly, they do have some advantages on their younger competitors. ‘Our research tells a new story about human development,’ said Mr Thompson. ‘Older players, though slower, seem to ­compensate by employing simpler strategies and using the game’s interface more ­efficiently than younger players, enabling them to retain their skill, despite cognitive motor-speed loss.’ He said older players, for example, are ­better at using keyboard shortcuts to help them make up for declining speed. And there is some hope for those of us over the age of 24 as Mr Thompson said that our cognitive motor capacities change throughout adulthood. ‘They are constantly in flux and our day-to-day performance is a result of the constant interplay between change and adaptation,’ he added. The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.","Researchers in Canada used computer games to test cognitive motor skills .

"By . Sara Malm . A Norwegian TV show, broadcast by the country's equivalent to the BBC, follows local celebrities as they plan their own funeral. The Coffin sees presenter Namra Saleem speak to six famous names about how they would like to see their (hypothetical) final hurrah go down. Ms Saleem visits celebrities with a blank wooden coffin which the guest is the allowed to decorate while the pair discuss death and funerals. Viking fun: TV show The Coffin sees presenter Namra Saleem speak to six famous Norwegians about how they would like to see their funeral go down . Producer Gelting Andresen describes The Coffin as ‘a feel-good programme about death’, each episode ending with the celebrity guest watching their decorated coffin being cremated. ‘People will hopefully feel that they are better acquainted with the guests and discover aspects of them they had not known,’ Andresen said. The first programme, set to premiere on government-funded channel NRK next week, features Bjarne Brondbo, the lead singer of Norwegian rock band D.D.E. Mr Brodbo is filmed being driven around by Ms Saleem as they discuss his funeral, before he decorates the coffin he would like to be cremated in. ‘It is very strange to see the coffin here,’ he says. ‘At the age of almost 50 years, you do start to think a little that life has an end.’ ‘According to my wife, I think I'm immortal. Actually, I'm terrified of dying, and that's why I try to live.’ 'Feel-good funeral': Celebrities such as musician Bjarne Brøndbo are invited to decorate their coffin before a cremation ceremony in a show which has been described as 'feel-good' by the producer . Another guests on the show is  bassist and main songwriter in the band Turbonegro, Thomas Seltzer . The singer decorates his coffin with the inscription ‘Rai Rai’, a reference to D.D.E.’s first album, as well as the names of several members of his family, including his mother. ‘My wish is that people should not be so very sad at my funeral,’ he says. ‘Afterwards, I hope that people meet to share stories over dinner, wine, coffee and brandy.’ NRK has developed an international reputation for its series of 'Slow TV' programmes, starting in 2009 with centenary of the Bergen railway line. Rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line, NRK instead decided to stick a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven-hour trip from Oslo to Bergen, interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme. Remarkably, it was a roaring success, with 1.2 million viewers, nearly a quarter of the population of Norway, tuning in for at least part of the trip. Since then, the network has broadcast a cruise journey, a fire being slowly built and burned, and more recently, the knitting of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came.","TV show The Coffin follows celebrities as they plan their funeral .

"By . Dan Bloom . North Korea has opened a firing range where families can shoot live pheasants and chickens and take home the carcasses to cook for dinner. In a country where observers say thousands of people are starving to death, the Meari shooting gallery re-opened last month in the capital Pyongyang after a major revamp. It boasts a 25-metre pistol range, a 50-metre rifle range and even an archery ground in Pyongyang's 'new sports district'.

A recent UN report warned of mass starvation in the totalitarian regime, which is headed by supreme leader Kim Jong Un . North Korea's state media outlet also claims the gallery has a shooting range for ray guns, which exist chiefly in science fiction films. Grandmothers and young children were pictured today donning goggles and honing their skills at the state-of-the-art facility - which includes an outdoor range with live birds in a large cage. Shooters are handed high marks when they do well, while children are given target practice by using electronic guns at a centre which also claims to have tennis, badminton and volleyball courts. The shooting gallery is even publicised by several Western tour agencies, one of which charges $2,695 for a heavily-chaperoned seven day trip around the autocratic state. Another claims rifle and revolver practice costs 50 U.S. cents per bullet or 25 cents per arrow - with a 20 Euro charge for those who want to take a pheasant carcass home. The state-run Korean Central News . Agency last month publicised the bizarre attraction with several quotes . from visitors apparently singing the praises of supreme leader Kim Jong . Un. Pak . Nam Song, a student of the Hanggu Senior Secondary School in Hanggu . District, Nampho City, was quoted as claiming he felt like a master shot when aiming at wild animals displayed on screen. 'I will study harder in the future to repay the loving care shown by the respected Marshal Kim Jong Un,' he added.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Colorado's marijuana enthusiasts are in for a treat. While similar consoles do already exist for registered dispensaries in states where the drug is approved for medical use, never before has a machine been aimed at the recreational user; enabling customers to purchase marijuana directly, rather than over the counter as it were. The appropriately emerald-hued ZaZZZ machine, manufactured by American Green, was unveiled on Saturday in Avon, Colorado, stocked with Herbal Elements marijuana. And while the console won't be available to the general public quite yet, its first outing certainly generated excitement. Revolutionary: The green-stocked ZaZZZ machine was unveiled at a private event in Avon, Colorado on Saturday . Stephen Shearin, CEO of the machine's parent company, Tranzbyte, who spoke to The Cannabist, describes the weed-purveying robot as: 'An automated, age-verifying, climate-controlled marijuana dispensing machine.' And while it does appear to take the convenience of buying marijuana to new levels of easy, the company claims it has covered its bases in terms of security. Nifty: The dispenser (pictured) is aimed at recreational marijuana users in the future, but is still only available for medical-use license holders . '[The user] would swipe their driver's license at which point multiple cameras . would allow us to use some advanced biometrics to make absolutely . certain that the person who swiped the card is the owner of that card,' Mr Shearin explained to 9News while speaking at the launch. 'I'm a father of a 12-year-old daughter and I wouldn't want her having . access to it, so we paid close attention to that.' For those who do meet the right criteria however, it's a simple case of: 'Swipe ID and get verified. Select products and pay. Retrieve products and depart using appropriate bagging solution.' Hopes for a greener future: California-based Medbox (left) currently caters for the medical-use only niche but ZaZZZ (right) hopes that it can capitalize on Colorado's legalization of marijuana for recreational use too . The machine is currently housed at Herbal Elements, an Avon medical dispensary; so will still not yet be available for recreational users 'at this point' - essentially until the company feels it’s ready. Only last year, Bruce Bedrick, CEO of Medbox, a California-based weed vending machine for medical use only, predicted that the transition from machines such as his, to those available to the general public such as the ZaZZZ model, was 'a couple of years down the road'. Some . people want to see this free-flowing marijuana. They want to go from . federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody . 'Some . people want to see this free-flowing marijuana. They want to go from . federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody,' Mr Bedrick - also known as 'the Steve Jobs of medical marijuana dispensing' - said to The Huffington Post. 'We . don't believe that can happen. In order to gain respect and trust, it's . better to go through gradual, medical adoption.' However, since both Colorado and Washington State recently legalized the drugs recreational use, it's likely that a whole wash of ambitious companies will be hot on the heels of ZaZZZ's business model, and sooner than many predicted.","Machines already exist on the market in Californian medical dispensaries, but the ZaZZZ machine will focus on the recreational user ."

"By . Ashley Collman . Laughter heals all wounds, but it seems even a funny video wont be enough to get the public to forgive Lance Armstrong for his years of cheating and lying. The disgraced former cycler appears in a video posted to Outside magazine's website Tuesday, showing bike enthusiasts how to change a flat tire. At the beginning of the video, Armstrong introduces himself as a seven-time winner of the Tour de France. But when that title appears on the . screen, a big asterisk flashes up, noting that Armstrong was stripped of . the seven titles for doping. 'Hey, I didn't write the script,' Armstrong shrugs. Scroll down for video . Infamous athlete: Lance Armstrong appears in a new video on Outside magazine's website, in which he explains how to change a flat bike tire . Too soon: Armstrong makes light of his cycling scandal in the video, but many in the biking community did not find the joke funny . Armstrong goes on to explain how to change a tire, removing the punctured tube and replacing it with a new one, all the while acting the part of a likeable blue-collar guy. While Armstrong seems friendly enough in the video, some in the biking community aren't buying it and are still far away from forgiving Armstrong for his years of cheating. 'Don't watch Lance Armstrong's How to fix a flat video - he's an attention seeing ex-doper,' Bike Radar's Sam Dansie wrote. Armstrong has largely been out of the spotlight since fessing up to using performance-enhancing drugs in a interview with Oprah Winfrey more than a year ago. Cheater: Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times, but had all the victories stripped in 2012 after an investigation concluded he used performance-enhancing drugs. Pictured above after his victories in the race in 1999 (left) and 2001 (right) Revelations: The new video comes just a week after documents were released, revealing that Armstrong's coach knew about the doping when he chose him to compete in the 1996 Olympics. Armstrong pictured competing in the 1999 Tour de France . Recently, Armstrong has been in the headlines again after documents were released Wednesday, listing all of the people Armstrong told about his drug use. The most shocking name on the list was former U.S. Olympic team coach Chris Carmichael. Armstrong admitted to authorities that he told Carmichael about his use of PEDs in 1995, and if true that means Carmichael knew Armstrong was cheating when he chose him to compete on the 1996 Olympic team. Carmichael denied knowing about the doping in a statement to the Colorago Springs Gazette last Friday, saying: 'I have never participated in a doping program, not with Lance Armstrong or anyone else. My role as a coach has always been to inspire athletes to be the best they can be by focusing on training, nutrition and innovations in equipment and sports science.'

"By . Jill Reilly . Fans walked out of a UB40 gig because the music was so loud it made their ears bleed. Around 30 people left the performance in Cambridge after complaining about the deafening volume. Anna Webster, 54, left before the reggae band had even finished their first song on Monday night. Fans walked out of a UB40 gig because the music was so loud it made their ears bleed. From left: Duncan Campbell, Martin Meredith, Laurence Parry and Brian Travers perform in London . She said: 'It was just horrendously loud - the bass was vibrating even in the foyer. 'There were so many people walking out because they couldn’t deal with it. 'It was vibrating through your whole body - it was actually altering heart rhythms.' Ms Webster, from Willingham, Cambs., said the noise caused her ear at the Corn Exchange - which already had a perforated drum - to bleed. Fellow fan Angela Paffett, 56, from Alconbury, Cambridgeshire, said deafening renditions of hits including Red, Red Wine and Can’t Help Falling in Love left her in physical pain. Anna Webster, 54, left before the reggae band had even finished their first song on Monday night at the Corn Exchange in Cambridge (pictured) She said: 'The bass crashed into you like a steam train. I had a pain in my chest.' Stella Jackson, 52, from Arlesey, Bedfordshire, also left early and said the gig was a 'waste of money' and gave her a headache. A UB40 spokesman said he spoke to Ms Webster and apologised to her if her evening was 'spoiled'. He said she was happy with the offer of VIP tickets to a gig in Wolverhampton. Birmingham's acclaimed reggae band formed in 1978. The original line-up played together for about 30 years - before Ali Campbell left in January 2008, claiming management disputes . One music fan - who had already had a perforated ear drum (a hole or tear) complained of a bleeding ear due to the noise levels at the concert - this is a symptom of the condition. This is in itself not dangerous and is nature's way of relieving pressure from the build up of pus behind the ear drum. This in turn relieves the pain of the infection and allows it to get better. Repeated perforation should however be avoided if possible because each time the ear drum bursts it leaves a small amount of scar tissue as it heals. Scar tissue is thicker than normal tissue and makes the ear drum less flexible to noise vibration. Repeated perforations may scar the ear drum leading to reduced hearing in that ear. According to the World Health Organisation, the single largest cause of preventable hearing loss is loud noise, such as from heavy industry in work places and loud music. Ways to protect your eats at concerts include: wearing earplugs, standing away from speakers and taking breaks from the room where the noise is playing. He said he believed 'the vast . majority of people were not affected', adding that no-one had complained . about the noise to the band’s sound engineer. A . Cambridge Corn Exchange spokesman said the venue always worked within . 'strict health and safety guidelines' and ear plugs were made available . for people on the night. He said the responsibility for the concert’s sound levels lay with promoter DHP Concerts. Health and safety law at the venue states that the continuous sound level should not exceed 107 dB, with the peak sound pressure level not exceeding 140 dB. Birmingham's acclaimed reggae band formed in 1978 and went on to have 34 top 40 singles and release 18 albums. The original line-up played together for about 30 years - before Ali Campbell left in January 2008, claiming management disputes. Mickey Virtue followed suit and then Astro quit in 2013 - the trio have now reformed as UB40 Reunited. The remaining six members continued to tour and record with Ali Campbell's brother, Duncan, on vocals - it was this group which played at the Corn Exchange on Monday night. The split has proved to be acrimonious - in February UB40 Reunited released a statement saying: 'Anyone going to a concert by the remaining five will be treated to merely a karaoke version of how the band did indeed sound, with a replacement singer who has never recorded a previous UB40 album and is no part of the UB40 history. 'There is only one vocal sound for UB40 and only two genuine vocalists and it is us.'","Around 30 people left the performance at the Corn Exchange in Cambridge .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner has given his unequivocal backing to beleaguered manager Paul Lambert, whose two assistants have been suspended pending an investigation amid allegations of bullying. The American billionaire praised Lambert’s ‘total loyalty and commitment’ to the club and acknowledged that the loss of Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa could have proved difficult for the Glaswegian. But the removal of two people who were intrinsic to Lambert’s success at Norwich City and have formed part of his coaching team for the past eight years, dating back to Wycombe and Colchester, does leave him in a difficult position and desperate for a quick improvement in results. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Lambert speaking after his team's Crystal Palace loss . Supportive: Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner has given his back to boss Paul Lambert after assistants Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended amid allegations of bullying . Lots to think about: Villa lost their fourth Premier League game on the spin at Crystal Palace on Saturday . Suspended: Ian Culverhouse (left) and Gary Karsa have been suspended pending an investigation Aston Villa . As he approaches the end of his second . season in charge at Villa Park, fans are questioning whether progress . has been made. They point to a record 10 home defeats as evidence that . the club have stagnated. Should that become 11 on Saturday when . Southampton visit, then there is likely to be open revolt in the stands. Lambert, . 44, relied on Culverhouse but has now turned to club legend Gordon . Cowans, who has been promoted from development coach, and goalkeeper . Shay Given, who in February stated that Villa ‘want me out of the door’. The 37-year-old Republic of Ireland international has two years left on . his contract but has not played a league game for the club since August . 2012. Culverhouse was said . to have cultivated a ‘poisonous’ atmosphere with his methods during . training. Several players are believed to have grievances, with Fabian . Delph and Gabriel Agbonlahor particularly upset at an incident in the . week preceding the Fulham match. Upset: Fabian Delph was thought to have been affected by an incident during training . Disappointed: Gabriel Agbonlahor was left out against Fulham but returned in the defeat at Palace . The defender started his career at Tottenham in 1982 but is best remembered for his time at Norwich. During nine years at Carrow Road he played 370 times for the club, including in the famous win over Bayern Munich. He is in the Norwich City Hall of Fame. He then moved on to Swindon and Brighton and after a spell youth coaching at various clubs became Paul Lambert's assistant at Colchester in 2008 before following the Scot to Norwich and then to Villa Park. It . is understood allegations of  bullying by Culverhouse and Karsa have . been made by others who work at Villa, forcing chief executive Paul . Faulkner to act. The move . was supported by Lambert, whose relationship with Culverhouse had broken . down beyond repair and came to a head during the 1-0 defeat at Crystal . Palace,  Villa’s fourth consecutive loss. The . players were told about the changes at training on Tuesday and the . following session laid on by Cowans was said to be the ‘best in ages’. Lerner . said: ‘Our manager has been faced with some unexpected issues that . could have very easily set the club back. 'In watching him handle . matters, along with our chief exec, I’ve seen total loyalty and . commitment to Aston Villa, while Gordon, a Villa man through and . through, has repeatedly stepped up to support the club regardless of the . ask. Showdown: Aston Villa chief executive Paul Faulkner (right) met with Paul Lambert at the training ground . Lots to think about: Villa lost their fourth Premier League game on the spin at Crystal Palace on Saturday . Gary Karsa did not have a very distinguised playing career and his first coaching job came at Enfield in 1998, where he was football and community officer. He then moved to Barnet (where he joined up with Ian Culverhouse) but his big break came when he became head of youth at Wycombe in 2006 under Paul Lambert. He followed Lambert to Colchester, where he became football operations manager, and was part of the team that moved to Norwich and then Aston Villa. ‘Shay, too, has been . unhesitating in answering the manager’s call. I couldn’t ask for more . from people who are up for this challenge and the very real obstacles we . have to overcome, as is everyone at the club.’ Villa . lie 14th in the Barclays  Premier League with 34 points, four above the . drop zone, and are fighting relegation for a second season under . Lambert. Fans were promised an exciting brand of football when he replaced Alex McLeish. ‘If . they lose against Southampton, the atmosphere will turn,’ said David . Michael, who runs the MyOldManSaid fan site and is a director at Aston . Villa Supporters’ Trust. ‘This now is almost a trial. I can’t see the . fans standing for him if we end up on anything below 40 points. His . position may become untenable.’ Walking into trrouble?

"By . Dan Bloom . These road safety signs on a remote Himalayan mountain road have driven tourists to hysterics - and may have saved their lives. The signs on the Leh-Manili Highway, a 298-mile road with frequent plunging drops and landslide risks, include 'be gentle on my curves' and 'if you want to donate blood, don't do it on the road'. Winding between the Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh regions in India, it gained traction with drivers by declaring 'speed thrills but often kills' and 'driving faster can cause disaster'. Poetry in motion: The signs are on a mountain pass between the Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh regions . This isn't a car chase! These signs have amused drivers on the 298-mile Leh-Manili Highway in India . Catchy: The signs were built by the Indian army to keep the road safe for the 18 weeks a year it is passable . Beautiful: But the road is a death trap, several thousand feet above sea level inducing altitude sickness . Simple message: Sherap Sherpa (pictured), from Kathmandu, has spent six years photographing the signs . But the light-hearted tone of the signs belies their seriousness. The arid road is thought to be one of the most dangerous in the world and drivers have been killed after experiencing lapses in concentration caused by altitude sickness. Sherap Sherpa, 42, has spent the last six years photographing the unusual road signs. He said: 'A few years ago I saw my first funny road sign. It said, ""after drinking whiskey, driving is risky"". 'I thought it was hilarious so I posted it on my Facebook. Within an hour it was shared by more than 20 friends and liked by more than 100 people. 'This inspired me to continue to photograph and share them.' Blood bank: Drivers on the road have reportedly blacked out after being overcome by altitude sickness . Live longer: The signs all convey a positive message - though they could of course be distracting themselves . Gently does it: Mr Sherpa said his favourite sign after six years was 'drive like hell, you will be there' The Ladakh-Manali highway is only open for 18 weeks during the summer, because snow makes the route impassable for the rest of the year. The comical road signs were erected by the Border Roads Organisation of the Indian Army. Mr Sherpa, from Kathmandu, said his favourite sign reads, 'drive like hell, you will be there.' He said: 'I have many favourites, but I think that one has a strong message.' Mr Sherpa, who documents the bizarre road signs on his website ladakhroadsigns.com, said he doubts the effectiveness of the messages. End of a relationship: One of the amusing - but deadly serious - signs photographed by Sherap Sherpa . Logic: It's impossible to fault the simple thinking behind the signs, along a landslide-threatened blackspot . Driven to hysterics: The photos quickly gained traction on Facebook and have been seen worldwide . Plane and simple: One of the witty signs reminds drivers that 'this is a highway, not a runway' He said: 'I'm not sure if they help with road safety. Most local truck drivers can't read English. Those who can just laugh at the humour in the language.' So far Mr Sherpa, a tour guide, has photographed more than 130 of the humourous road signs. Pankaj Batra, 31, from Gurgaon, India, who has also driven down the road, said: 'These signs are funny yet meaningful. On difficult drives, they ease your pain.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A scorned woman falsely labelled a businessman whom she'd had a brief relationship with as a 'paedophile' and 'charity thief' on social media then called his friends to tell them he had hanged himself. Donna Fraser, 39, of Drumchapel, Glasgow, met Paul Anderson, 41, through a dating website in June 2013 and then asked him to move in with her. But when he had 'doubts' and declined, she then bombarded him with up to 50 text messages a day, Stirling Sheriff Court heard today. Donna Fraser arriving at Stirling Sheriff Court, where she pleaded guilty to stalking a businessman she met through a dating website . She then sent a message that she had set up a Facebook account saying that Mr Anderson was a paedophile. Fraser also admitted she put a picture on Google Plus saying he was a sex predator, a charity thief, and alleging he was 'screwing the social security'. She also phoned two of his friends posing as 'Joanne from Dunfermline' telling them Mr Anderson had hanged himself. Adrian Fraser, prosecuting, said after Mr Anderson told Fraser, on August 5, that he was not moving in, the texts landed day and night, until Mr Anderson changed his number. After a lull she texted him again, accusing him of being a paedophile. Using a sim card she had stolen from him, she sent him pictures from his old mobile phone. The depute fiscal said: 'One of the messages was a photo of a female at an auction, and she threatened to send it to all his contacts saying he was a paedophile. She believed the female was 16, but she was in her late 20s. 'She texted: 'You say you’re not a paedophile - who is this, then, you pervert?' 'She also sent a message saying she had set up a Facebook account saying he was a paedophile. The court was told Fraser was receiving help from her GP and she was made the subject to a two-year non-harassament order . 'Paul Anderson showed Paul Mears and Margaret Johnstone a photo of him on Facebook where she had put ‘Paedophile’. 'In the course of a later interview with police... she denied referring to him as a paedophile but did say he was a sex predator, and also said she put a picture on Google Plus saying he was a sex predator, a charity thief, and was screwing the social security.' The court was also told Fraser said she would contact auctions where Mr Anderson did business, and threatened to ruin him. One of his friends received texts from Fraser saying he 'stole charity tins from pubs' and made the calls to his friends saying he had hanged himself., . She also repeatedly made telephone calls to his neighbours. On September 11 last year, after she phoned an auction house he was attending and said: 'It’s Donna. You better watch your back as  I’m going to get you killed', Mr Anderson contacted police. The fiscal added: 'As a result of the accused’s conduct Mr Anderson lost friends, became concerned about speaking to people he knew, and felt he was being stalked. 'On one occasion he took a panic attack.' The court was told that during Fraser’s campaign of harassment, Mr Anderson’s father, who knew what his son was going though, died. Fraser was eventually arrested on September 17. Mr Fraser added: 'In the course of a later interview she seemed to be angry, upset, and wanted to be in a relationship with the accused. 'She said she was in love with him and he was wrong to have ended it. She denied referring to him as a paedophile but did say he was a sex predator.' Fraser pleaded guilty to engaging in a course of conduct between August 5 and September 17 2013 which caused fear and alarm to Mr Anderson of Buchlyvie, Stirlingshire. At Stirling Sheriff Court (pictured) Sheriff William Gilchrist told Fraser if she break the non-harassment order she will be committing another crime . Virgil Crawford, defending, said that Fraser was receiving help from her GP. She was made the subject to a two-year non-harassament order, banning her from contacting or communicating with Mr Anderson or his friends and neighbours involved in the case, or posting or publishing any information about him or photographs of him. Sheriff William Gilchrist told her: 'If you break the order you’ll be committing another crime.' A spokesman for Sir James Stirling’s Garden Estate at Buchlyvie, where Mr Anderson had a flat, said today: 'He lived here for over 18 months, but he vanished about three months ago. 'He was a very pleasant chap.We liked him because he was as quiet as a mouse. 'Before he left there were lots of police here, so we assumed he’d had some sort of trouble.'","Donna Fraser met Paul Anderson, 41, online and had a brief relationship .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Teachers are calling for GCSEs and A-level exams to be scheduled in the morning to help Muslim students who are fasting during Ramadan, it emerged today. Hundreds of thousands of pupils across Britain could be forced to take 'large entry' tests, such as maths and English, before 12pm under a radical shake-up. School exam boards and universities are considering the move over the next five years, when the religious period of Ramadan progressively clashes with the exam season in June. Radical shake-up: Teachers are calling for GCSEs and A-level exams taken by large numbers of students to be scheduled in the morning to help Muslim pupils who are fasting during Ramadan, it emerged today (file image) The holy period in the Islamic calendar requires Muslims to fast during daylight hours - meaning they will be at their hungriest towards the end of the day. This will inevitably cause students to struggle and lose marks during their summer exams, the Association of Teachers (ATL) annual conference in Manchester heard. Barry Lingard, who is on the ATL executive committee, said the union had been discussing the issue with the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), which represents exam boards, and a number of Muslim organisations. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, during which strict fasting is observed by Muslims in daylight hours. Most also abstain from other physical needs and bad habits - including drinking, smoking and having sex - from sunrise to sunset. Fasting is intended to help teach Muslims self-discipline, humility and patience. It also reminds them of the suffering of the poor and allows them to focus their attention on God. During the holy month, many Muslims will also attend special services in Mosques, during which the Qur'an is read. He said it was 'highly unlikely' that exam boards will change summer timetables - but added: 'JCQ have said that they will work collaboratively on a timetable with Muslim groups to review whether a balance of morning and afternoon slots for large entry exams is more appropriate, or just morning slots.' It is thought that this could mean that schools would be forced to schedule GCSE and A-level exams taken by large numbers of students, including maths and English, in the morning only. Abdul Choudhury, an ATL member from Tower Hamlets, London, said Ramadan will have 'quite an effect on a number of schools across our country' compared to the last time it fell during exams season, around 25 years ago. 'We have quite a significant number of Muslim students and I have no doubt whatsoever that standards will be affected by this,' he said. 'We work so hard as teachers to try and get just that one mark, that two marks, and if kids - 16-year-olds, 18-year-olds, even university students - are going into exams without any water, and food, it will have an effect on their overall results.' Religious: Ramadan requires Muslims to fast during daylight hours - so they will be at their hungriest towards the end of the day. Above, a girl reads from the Koran on the last Friday of the holy period in the Islamic calendar . Delegates passed the resolution, which called on the union to raise awareness of the potential impact of Ramadan on Muslim students' education. Michael Turner, JCQ director, said: 'We are consulting on the exams timetable for 2015 and we will be looking at the impact of Ramadan on that timetable.'","Students across UK may be forced to take 'large entry' tests in morning .

"By . Richard Spillett . The daughter of a mentally-ill Italian woman who was forced to undergo a caesarean section while visiting the UK has been adopted by a couple in Britain, it has emerged. One-year-old Child P was born after social services in Essex applied to the courts to forcibly deliver her because of fears over mother Alessandra Pacchieri's mental health. The shocking case, which was at first shrouded in secrecy, led to the country's top family judge, Sir James Munby, to call for family courts to be more open. Alessandra Pacchieri was forced to undergo a caesarean after coming to the UK for a training course and her daughter was taken into care . The senior judge has now disclosed that he made an adoption order for the child earlier this month, meaning Miss Pacchieri is unlikely to see her daughter until she is 18. Following the forced caesarean, Miss Pacchieri accused the family courts of 'invading my body and stealing my baby'. She added: 'Something very unfair has been done to me. I am fighting to get my daughter back and I never want another innocent mother in your country to suffer as I have.' But in her last message to the court last month, Miss Paccheri, who has not seen her daughter since May 2013, did not challenge the adoption. Sir James Munby, President of the Family Division, said the case demonstrated the 'pressing need for radical changes' in the family courts and Court of Protection . She wrote: 'Me personally, I am . trying to forget this bad experience I had in England. I love my . daughter and I pray to see her one day again.' Child P, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was born in August 2012, two months after Miss Pacchieri was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. The 35-year-old Italian, who suffers from bipolar disorder, is reported to have come to Britain whilst pregnant to attend a training course with an airline at Stansted Airport in Essex but stopped taking medication and was taken into the care of a health trust. The Court of Protection then gave the trust permission for doctors to carry out a caesarean section and the newborn child was taken into care by Essex social services. The following October, Essex County Council was given court permission to place Child P for adoption, and in November 2013 she went to live with a couple, who have now formally adopted her. Sir James said both Miss Pacchieri and the child's father, who has never seen her, were sent written notice and emailed by the county council about the adoption hearing on April 1, but did not attend and were not represented. He referred to a 70-page confidential report which stated Child P has 'a strong and positive bond' with her new adoptive parents and she presented as 'a very happy and content little girl' who is 'very affectionate' towards the couple, called Mr and Mrs X in court. The judge said: 'Mr and Mrs X are good and loving people. They are admirably equipped to meet P's needs now and in the future. P is obviously thriving in their care and doing very well. 'In all the circumstances, P's welfare throughout her life requires - demands - that she be adopted. Nothing else will do.' At an earlier hearing, the judge bemoaned the fact that, at the start of the case, 'none of the relevant information was in the public domain in this country'. Details of the Court of Protection's decision in the case were originally kept secret . He added: 'This case must surely stand as final, stark and irrefutable demonstration of the pressing need for radical changes in the way in which both the family courts and Court of Protection approach what, for shorthand, I shall refer to as transparency.' Since the judge's comments last December, there has been increase in the number of family judgments made available to journalists and the media. Details of the Court of Protection decision to allow a caesarian section remained secret for months, and there was a long delay in the public learning a judge had declared that doctors should be allowed to force Ms Pacchieri to have a caesarian section because a natural delivery risked rupturing her womb. The judge had said there were concerns that if Ms Pacchieri was uncooperative when she went into labour, doctors would be unable to monitor the baby's heartbeat and to see whether Ms Pacchieri's womb might rupture. He authorised 'reasonable restraint' to perform the C-section safely.","Mother came to UK in 2012 but was later sectioned under Mental Health Act .

"By . Leon Watson . Tragic: Robert Berry, 42, collapsed at the finish line of the London Marathon and was later pronounced dead at hospital . The family of a London Marathon runner who died after completing the course have paid tribute to a 'a fun-loving and caring person'. Robert Berry, 42, was given medical attention when he collapsed immediately after finishing the 26.2-mile race, and was pronounced dead at hospital. Since his death on Sunday, well-wishers have flooded his JustGiving page, with donations reaching £63,000. Mr Berry, from Reading, Berkshire, had aimed to raise £1,700 for the National Osteoporosis Society in tribute to his 'inspirational' mother, who was diagnosed with the brittle bone condition at the age of 52. In a statement issued by his family, they thanked the thousands of people who gave their support, words of comfort and donations. They described Mr Berry as 'a keen sportsman' who from an early age joined the Rustington Otters Football team at the age of nine. The statement read: 'He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and work colleagues - a fun-loving and caring person, respected, loyal and very much loved by us all. 'He was a loving husband to Gwen and an amazing father to his two children and will remain forever in their hearts. Rob was a loyal and loving son to Alan and Ann and a fantastic, caring brother to his younger sister Janet who always looked up to him.' The family said they were devastated and shocked by his death and added: '(We) cannot believe that he is no longer with us to share in our lives and laughter... Rob will be a great loss to our family.' But they said they were 'overwhelmed by the heartfelt messages and donations'. Mr Berry, who worked in IT services, ran the Reading half-marathon last month. His family said he had become a keen runner in recent years and 'the marathon was something he wanted to achieve whilst raising money for a cause close to all our hearts. Fundraising: Robert Berry, pictured at the Windsor Half Marathon in September, was running the Marathon to raise funds for the National Osteoporosis Society after his mother was diagnosed with the condition . 'He has left us having completed a world renowned race which makes us so very proud and in our eyes Rob is a hero.' The . keen runner's goal for the marathon was to run it in less than three . hours and 30 minutes. His actual time has not been disclosed. Mr Berry wrote on his blog that he suffered breathing problems in the weeks before the race. He described how breathing during a training run was 'a big struggle' in a post just seven days before Sunday's event. 'I have now used my inhaler three times in the last week whereas I might use it three times in year,' he wrote. According . to his online training results, Mr Berry had been preparing for the . marathon since December and had completed training runs of over 20 . miles. Finish line: Runners at The Mall after competing in the London Marathon . Yesterday, a spokesman for the charity he was raising money for, said: 'We . are really touched by the incredible generosity in tribute to Mr Berry, . who wrote so movingly about why he was raising money to help fight . osteoporosis. 'When the . time is right, we would like to discuss with his family the options . available for how the funds raised in his memory may be used. Mr Berry's wife Gwen saw him collapse at the finishing line before he died, it was revealed today. The 46-year-old had followed the father-of-two along the route by catching Tube trains with her sister Janet, 40. The pair then saw him fall after finishing Sunday's race. Mr Berry, 42, was given medical attention immediately but was pronounced dead at hospital yesterday. Mrs Berry told The Sun he was a 'splendid father'. Mr Berry's father Herbert, 79, said: 'They were at the finish when he crossed. Janet couldn't believe it when he collapsed. Experienced: Mr Berry had run numerous races in preparation for the Marathon and was expected to complete it in under three hours and 20 minutes . 'He was fit and healthy. Janet's devastated, as is the whole family.' IT . worker Mr Berry, of Newbury, Berkshire, was an experienced runner who . hoped to run the route in less than three hours and 20 minutes. But the father-of-two kept a blog which detailed the breathing difficulties he was suffering in the lead-up to the race. On April 6, he described having to use his inhaler three times in a week, when he usually only needed it three times a year. He wrote: 'I have now used my inhaler three times in the last week whereas I might use it three times in year. 'Today . started out very slow and breathing a big struggle but it got much . better as the run went on and I finished 12.5 miles. Feeling strong. Last week before the Marathon.' Earlier that week he had written that his breathing was 'still not too . good'. He wrote: 'Yesterday I did a gentle five miles as my breathing . still not too good and knees a little achy. 'Today . on the other hand my eyes were itching, nose running and breathing a . big struggle, also in the office all day after the gym. 'Was . talking to Nicola from the National Osteoporosis Society via email and . she seems to think this is not hay fever but due to pollution and the . dust from the Sahara. Hope so as I don't want to be running like this . during the Marathon.' Mr . Berry, who leaves behind wife Gwen, daughter Hannah, 12, and son Martin, . 10, was running the race to raise money for the National Osteoporosis . Society after his mother Ann, 72, was diagnosed with osteoporosis 20 . years ago. Mr Berry wrote on his fundraising page: . 'I'm running the London Marathon in support of the National Osteoporosis . Society for the support given to my mother who was diagnosed with . osteoporosis at the age of 52 but whose current condition (we found out . later) was triggered from a lifting incident at the age of 47. 'Because of the stress on her lower back, two sets of bones in her lower spine collapsed.' In . a touching message on his own website, he added: 'This page is . dedicated to my mum, who despite being diagnosed with osteoporosis at . the relatively early age of 52 years, has been an inspiration through . the continued positive outlook she has displayed ever since, despite . some quite clear discomfort.' He had completed a half marathon in . an hour and 30 minutes in September last year and achieved a time of two . hours, 36 minutes and 53 seconds at a 21-mile event in March. Mr Berry also took part in last month’s Reading Half Marathon, with a finishing time of 1:31:18. Tributes and donations began pouring in to his JustGiving page after news of his death broke. The . total amount raised at 7pm on Monday stood at almost £3,000 - with the . number of donations doubling from 65 to 130 in the hour since his death . was announced.

"By . Leon Watson . and Emma Glanfield . Shoppers desperate to snap up a bargain have cleared supermarket shelves of Easter eggs after price wars between the leading chains resulted in some eggs being better value for money than a chocolate bar. With just three days to go until Easter, the giant price war has resulted in many supermarkets having already sold out of several products. Asda has been forced to stop selling Easter eggs on its website altogether due to high demand and Tesco has sold out of several chocolate eggs after shoppers took advantage of slashed prices. Big-brand Easter eggs are so heavily discounted they work out far cheaper price per 100g than buying single bars of chocolate. On a pound-to-weight basis, some Easter eggs, including Cadbury Dairy Milk and Wispa, are working out better value for money . Among the eggs running low are products made by Cadbury – the country's biggest chocolate maker – and Nestle, as well as some Lindt and Mars eggs. A large proportion of the eggs on sale in Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's this year have been discounted or on a promotion. The offers have resulted in many Easter eggs being much better value for money on a pound-to-weight basis than a simple chocolate bar in many stores. In Asda, shoppers can buy a Dairy Milk buttons . egg (162g) for £1 or a pouch of the same chocolate buttons (72g), which . provide less than half the amount of chocolate, for the same price. Tesco recently ran a promotion where . shoppers could purchase two £1.50 Easter eggs and get two free, as well . as two free Crème Eggs – but that offer appears to have been pulled . after demand soared.

Tesco said there would be ‘plenty’ of eggs this year, despite the fact several have already sold out on its website. A spokesman said: 'You won't go in on Good Friday and find only one egg on the shelves. There will be plenty of eggs. 'It's possible we have run out of some of the ranges, in some of the sizes.

Bryan Roberts, analyst at Kantar Retrail, said it was ‘a bit self-defeating’ that Easter eggs have been so heavily-discounted in some supermarkets. He told The Telegraph:  ‘Basic economics would suggest that when demand is at its highest you could chose to price your products as you wish. 'But supermarkets use Easter eggs discounts as something they can talk about in TV adverts, and as a way of driving traffic. It's because retailers and suppliers are over-obsessed with market share.’","Several Easter egg bundles work out cheaper than buying chocolate bar .

"By . Mark Duell . It might not be to everyone's taste, but a retired GP has amassed the largest collection of British surrealist art in the country. Former Conservative councillor Dr Jeffrey Sherwin has a house in Alwoodley, Leeds, full of works by the likes of Roland Penrose and Merlyn Evans. Among his collection is an interesting sculpture of legs in a bucket by artist Richard Niman and a stone-carved face by FE McWilliam. Collection: Former Conservative councillor Dr Jeffrey Sherwin has a house in Alwoodley, Leeds, full of frames with bright colours and odd shapes . In his collection: A 1950 artwork by Conroy Maddox called St Lucy (left) and a 1941 piece by Toni Del Renzio called Paranoiac Regression (right) Also included is a man's head with a false beak on a pole by John Davies - and now the art is going on show at Abbot Hall Gallery in Kendal, Cumbria. Dr Sherwin, 78, who is married to Ruth, 71, told The Guardian: 'I'm just an ordinary bloke buying pictures I could afford. 'Because British surrealism wasn't . particularly highly regarded by the critics, it was never very expensive . and I could afford to buy it.' Dr Sherwin also described his collection of 300 pieces of artwork to BBC News as ‘modest by collectors' standards such as Charles Saatchi’. Surrealism: This 1957 oil on canvis by Desmond Morris, entitled There's No Time Like The Future, is part of the 78-year-old retired doctor's collection . Eerie: Twilight Symphony, a 1954 oil on board artwork by John Banting, forms part of The Sherwin Collection, which has been amassed over 25 years . Some of his artwork has been loaned to the Tate in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and other galleries in Spain, Germany and France. He added: 'I've promised my wife I won't buy anything again. Although every time I say this she smiles.' Dr and Mrs Sherwin first started collecting after visiting a gallery in 1986 marking the 50th anniversary of Britain’s first surrealist exhibition. He said when he was considering spending £1,000 on 1948 print The Chess Players by Merlyn Evans, his ‘fingers perspired' with fear. Amassed: Angel of Mercy, a 1934 creation by Eileen Agar (left), and a piece of art from the following year by Sir John Selby-Bigge called Tyrolean Dreams . Colourful: Unsleeping Beauty, a 1946 oil on canvas by Roland Penrose, which refers to the Arizona landscape seen by the artist . But that became the couple's first purchase - and they soon built up a strong collection, which also includes a painting by pop artist Sir Peter Blake. However he is unable to choose a favourite piece from his collection, telling The Guardian: ‘It would be like choosing a favourite child’. The Abbot Hall Gallery’s description of Dr Sherwin’s exhibition - which runs until June 21 - praises its ‘diversity of styles and imagery’.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Guilty: Emmanuel Kalejaiye stabbed his mother Tolu to death at the Wickford home they shared last September . A cross-dressing killer stabbed his mother to death in a frenzied attack before dressing up in women's clothes to try and fool neighbours into thinking she was still alive, a court has heard. Emmanuel Kalejaiye, 21, inflicted more than 40 stab wounds on his mother Tolu Kalejaiya's upper body, when he turned the knife on her at their Wickford home last September. The prosecution alleged Kalejaiye had planned to commit the 'perfect murder', by killing the 44-year-old before impersonating her to allow himself precious time to dispose of her body. But a jury of seven men and five women found the Essex University student not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility, due to mental health issues. The verdict came following a two-week trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. Judge Christopher Ball QC said: 'The evidence shows the defendant is capable of a very deliberate and calculated act of supreme violence. 'If as a paranoid schizophrenic he is capable of this, he may present a very significant danger to anyone who upsets him for many years to come. 'I am keen to see the extent to which paranoid schizophrenia will underscore the danger he poses to others in the future to assess a proper sentence.' Judge Ball requested a full psychiatric report into the danger Kalejaiye could be to the public ahead of sentencing in June. The court heard Kalejaiye had written out a detailed plan including notes on how to walk in high heels and had receipts for pink Primark women’s clothing. Police found a bloodied pink hoodie and pink trousers, which Kalejaiye had bought from Primark a month earlier, as well as scraps of paper detailing an alleged murder plot. The jury heard how Kalejaiye, who was born in Nigeria but moved to England as a small boy, stabbed his mother to death on the morning of September 26 last year. Receipts found at the house showed the murder weapon came from a knife block bought by Kalejaiye at Lidl just a month before the brutal stabbing. Victim: Kalejaiye inflicted more than 40 stab wounds on his 44-year-old mother's (pictured) body . Mrs Kalejaiye, who worked as an accountant for Camden Council, suffered more than 40 stab wounds to her head, face, neck, upper limbs and hands during the frenzied knife attack. She called boyfriend, Leo Shogunle, on her phone during the attack at around 7.30am - although he only received the message when he awoke later that morning. Kalejaiye sat head in hands as the jury was played a disturbing three-minute voicemail in which the mother-of-two can be heard screaming 'don’t stab me, don’t stab me - you’re a demon', before the message fell chillingly silent. Mr Shogunle raced to the home shortly after 10am on the morning of the attack after hearing the message and let himself in using a spare key. He was confronted by the bloodied body of his lover lying on the kitchen floor and Kalejaiye, who said his mother had been attacked before fleeing the scene. Kalejaiye was later caught on CCTV at around 10.30am calmly buying a can of coke and a pack of Maryland cookies at a local post office before handing himself in to police. During police interview, he signed a confession stating: 'I admit killing my mother this morning by stabbing her. 'I did this because she subjected me to a lifetime of physical and mental abuse. 'She used the Bible to rationalise what she did to me. I believe she manipulated and brainwashed me. 'I have been very depressed for a long time. I have tried to overcome it but I couldn’t take it anymore.' Kalejaiye later changed his story saying a gang of masked men burst into his home, forced him to stab his mum then threatened him with further violence if he told police. He told the court a gang of five white, balaclava-clad men targeted him in a suspected racist attack. The university student went onto claim the mystery men had forced him to dress up in the ‘ill-fitting’ pink clothing and pink flip flops to move his mother’s Mercedes car - a move the prosecution claimed had been an attempt fool neighbours into thinking his mother had driven to work. Evidence from an expert psychiatrist stated Kalejaiye had been suffering from severe depression and paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack. The court heard how fellow students at Essex University, where Kalejaiye had studied biochemistry, found him ‘weird and paranoid’. Mental health issues: A jury convicted the 21-year-old Essex University student of manslaughter, finding him not guilty of murder, on grounds of diminished responsibility. After attacking his mother Kalejaiye dressed up in pink women's clothes to try and fool neighbours into thinking she had gone to work . The case of Emmanuel Kalejaiye echoes that of the ficitional character Norman Bates, the protagonist of the novel Psycho by Robert Bloch. Based on real-life murderer Ed Gein, Bates is a fat, middle-aged drunk who has an unnaturally close relationship with his mother. Bates runs the motel his mother owns. But Mother is insane; and when she suspects her son of desiring an attractive young guest, she sneaks into the girl's room and stabs her to death as she showers. The case of Emmanuel Kalejaiye bears a resemblance to the character Norman Bates from the film Psycho . Norman covers up the murder; but Mother soon kills a private investigator hired to find the girl. During the course of the novel, which was adapted into Aldred Hitchcock's film Psycho in 1960 and again in 2000 starring Christian Bale, the reader learns 'Mother' is in fact Bates himself, who developed a split personality after murdering his real mother and her lover in a fit of jealously. Unable to bear the guilt he adopted her personality to try and convince himself that she was still alive.","Emmanuel Kalejaiye stabbed his mother Tolu more than 40 times .

"By . Sam Webb . and Jill Reilly . Fears are growing that the UK is headed for an epidemic of monstrous rodents as pictures of giant rats continue to emerge. One image, reportedly reportedly taken in Cornwall, shows a giant rat being held up by its tail -  and the man holding it is 6ft 1in, giving a sense of its horrifying scale. It comes as a giant rat was caught in Liverpool, measuring two feet long from its nose to its tail. Ridiculous rodent: This photo shows a huge rat that was caught in Cornwall earlier this year. It measured 50cm from tail to nose . Pest control experts today warned that similar rats are likely to become more common in the UK as more households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish, and discard left-over fast food . Meanwhile a shocking photo of a massive rat in . Gravesend, Kent, has also emerged. The picture, showing the seemingly-dead . vermin on a pink spade, appears to have been taken next to a river. The pictures were tweeted by BBC Radio 2 during a discussion on the Jeremy Vine show about 'giant mutant rats'. River rat: This giant vermin was reportedly found in Gravesend, Kent . The menacing super rat in Liverpool was caught on an industrial estate by a pest controller from Whelan Services, one of the country's largest independent pest prevention companies. Whelan . Services has offices in London, Liverpool and Hampshire and all . locations report a rise in the number of super rats spotted. Pest control experts today warned that . similar rats are likely to become more common in the UK as more . households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish, and . discard left-over fast food. Rob Simpson of pest control registry Basis Prompt said during the Easter break offices need to ensure they are protected from rat infestations which can cause millions of pounds worth of damage in buildings. Once inside, with nobody about to stop them, they can start gnawing desks, furniture and coffee machines, building nests to set up colonies, he said. We found you: This huge rodent had to be removed by hand from the ceiling after the trap failed to work due to its size in Dublin . 'Rats are intelligent creatures able . to adapt and replenish their numbers very quickly, and anywhere that . offers a dry space with little human traffic is ideal,' he said. 'The . potential for an infestation will increase over the holiday period when . there are plenty of idle offices, factories and warehouses. 'Owners must do all they can to keep their premises pest-free while staff are away on holiday and the place is closed down.' 'Business premises are at particular risk over the Easter holiday period as most are not being used. 'If . they manage to get in, the rats can cause a lot of damage to equipment . and electrics as well as valuable stock and they also carry diseases. Experts also warn that the rodents are becoming increasingly resistant to poison. Experts say the conventional blood-thinning poison used to kill the rats is not working as it used to. Now . pest controllers are calling on the government to tighten up its . response to the monster-size vermin and asking the EU to approve . stronger ‘third generation poison’ to kill them. Merseyside . pest controller Sean Whelan from Whelan Services told Mail Online: . ‘We’re seeing an upsurge in rat call-outs, it’s gone up significantly by . about 15 per cent over the past year. ‘It’s . been very good for us. But I’m not entirely sure what’s causing it, it . could be the weather, it’s been very cold and it’s been very wet. ‘They’re twice as large as they once were. It’s definitely not uncommon to see rats the size of a cat. ‘The problem is that they’re feeding more than they used to. They’re feeding off leftover junk food that we throw away. ‘If there is vermin, 99.9 per cent of the time it’s our fault. We’re basically feeding them and they get used to it. So they keep coming around us to get more food,' he added. Mr Whelan said: ‘The rats that we’re seeing in the city used to be the ones roaming round  the countryside, in agriculture, out on farms, but they’ve migrated to towns – now they live in the city.' Growing problem: Cities throughout the UK are seeing more super rats as the rodents gorge on food left out in bins . Mr Whelan said the 'monster rats' are in every town throughout the country but there has been an increase in sightings in Liverpool, Birmingham and London. During the 1960s onwards, rat poison . was based on the blood-thinning agent warfarin. It worked by draining . the blood from the rat and killing it. Today, pest controllers use bromadiolone, but both are proving to be ineffective on some monster vermin. ‘We find that the rats are becoming resistant to poison,' Mr Whelan said. 'We used to use warfarin when I first started out 23 years ago. It was the first generation of rat poisoning and used to work but doesn't do much now. 'We need new, stronger poisons as they've grown used to what we use.' The pest controller explained that in an area between Winchester and Salisbury the poisons simply do not work at all, while rats in London have also developed a higher immunity. Mr Whelan is calling on the government to create a 'rat tsar' to tackle the problem. He . also wants the EU to approve the third generation of rat poison to help . tackle the problem, but plans for stronger poison face stiff opposition . from campaigners amid fears that it could be harmful to humans. Wildlife campaigners have also raised concerns that it could wreak havoc on animal and birds. However, pest control experts warn that there will be even more monster rats found if they are allowed to feast on food near junk food shops, restaurants and household bin areas outside blocks of flats. Big rodent: The giant monster rat was found in a family residence in Kingswood, south Dublin last week . Rats thrive in damp and soggy weather - of which the UK has seen plenty during the wettest year on record. Vermin are also swapping rural areas for the big city. The government’s austerity measures have been blamed for making the problem far worse – after cuts to the budget for pest control. And rats can carry illnesses which can be passed to humans, including Weil’s disease, which has flu-like symptoms initially but can lead to jaundice and kidney failure. Across the country, councils have reported a rise in the number of rats being reported. Birmingham has the highest number of call-outs with 5,100 in the past year. And the problem is not just confined to Britain. Other huge rodents have been caught recently in homes in Stockholm and Dublin, where one rat was trapped by . pest control after terrorising an Irish family in south Dublin. The Dublin-based 'monster vermin' had been terrorising Grace and Ian Walters’ home . in Kingswood shortly after they moved into their new flat. One for supper: Jack Russell Max, owned by Royal Tunbridge Wells resident Mark Willmott, caught one of the large rats whose numbers are increasing around the country .","Pest controllers seeing rats the 'size of small cats' in cities across the UK .

"Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP for South East England, has hit back at United Nations Special Rapporteur Rashida Manjoo, over her claims of a sexist culture in Britain . Do you know in which country women suffer the worst discrimination? You might guess at one of the East African states where female genital mutilation is common, or perhaps one of the Asian nations in which thousands of girls are sold into prostitution. You might say China, where female embryos are disproportionately aborted, or Yemen, where a woman’s testimony is worth half a man’s, or Afghanistan, where honour killings are widespread, or Saudi  Arabia, where women are forbidden to drive. Well, you’d be wrong - wrong, at any rate, according to Rashida Manjoo. The place with the most insidiously sexist culture on the planet, the United Nations Special Rapporteur assures us, is the United Kingdom. ‘Have I seen this level of sexist culture in other countries? It hasn’t been so in-your-face in other countries. I haven’t seen that so pervasively in other countries. I’m sure it exists but it wasn’t so much and so pervasive.’ What form does it take, this pervasive sexism? According to Ms Manjoo, whistling in the street and ‘sexist images of women’. What kind of person could argue, and apparently believe, that wolf-whistles create a more pervasive sexist atmosphere than, say, forced marriages or the exclusion of girls from school? Who could assert, with evident sincerity, that Britain is as bad a place to be female as Somalia? Why, a UN bureaucrat of course. The same sort of bureaucrat as Raquel Rolnik, another UN Special Rapporteur, who last year argued that the Coalition’s decision to stop paying housing benefit for unoccupied rooms amounted to an abuse of human rights. Mrs Rolnik is from Brazil, where 12  million people live in favelas - squalid shantytowns ringing the major cities. Does she honestly imagine that those Brazilians would not gladly swap their slums for a British council house, with or without a spare room subsidy? United Nations Special Rapporteur Rashida Manjoo, pictured addressing journalists in central Londonin April 2014, caused a storm when she said Britain has a 'sexist culture' Then again, the UN has a way of cutting its staff off from reality. Working in a cloistered international environment, enjoying massive tax-free salaries and perks, convinced that their cause is just, they can slip all too easily into self-righteousness. Businesses must answer to their customers and their shareholders. Politicians must answer to their constituents. But international civil servants - accountable to no one - are free to concentrate on making themselves comfortable. The UN was formed in 1945 with the noble ideal after World War II of bringing together 51 member countries to prevent another such conflict. Based mainly in New York and Switzerland, it now employs tens of thousands of bureaucrats and encompasses 193 states - some run by kleptocrats and dictators - which fund it roughly in proportion to their wealth. Britain will pay around 5 per cent of its $5.5 billion budget this year. But, as I said, the UN is not directly accountable  to anyone. Daniel Hannan has hit out at the tens of thousands of 'bureaucrats' working at the UN's headquarters in Switzerland and the US. Pictured is the UN Security Council in New York . It is hardly surprising that such insulation should, over time, have made it flabby, self-serving and corrupt. The UN, in this regard, is no different from the International Olympic Committee, FIFA or, of course, the EU. Human nature being what it is, international bureaucracies can hardly fail to be both smug and sleazy. The UN’s problem is especially severe because it is thought to embody a lofty ideal. As with the mega- charities or the NHS, people are reluctant to criticise it. We would rather fantasise about an idealised UN - a body that brings nations together, stops wars, promotes human rights - than look at the necessarily grubby organisation that has taken form before us. Yet it is precisely our indulgent attitude that licenses its corruption. And, when I say corruption, I am not talking about sloppy accounting or big expense accounts. I am talking about real monstrosities, such as sex-trafficking in former Yugoslavia by UN personnel who spectacularly failed to do the very thing they were supposedly there to do, namely provide safe havens for civilians. According to young prostitutes who’d been trafficked from poverty-stricken places such as Romania and Moldova, six out of the eight ‘clients’ they were forced to sleep with daily were members of the UN ‘blue berets’ peacekeeping forces. I am talking, too, about the UN-run oil-for-food racket which operated in the run-up to the second Iraq war. Rwandan refugees carrying water containers make their way back to their huts at the Benaco Refugee Camp in Tanzania, near the Rwandan border, in May 1994. Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan has accused the UN of 'mindboggling incompetence' ahead of the mass genocide that later occurred in Rwanda . In theory, it allowed Saddam Hussein . to sell oil and buy basic supplies for his sanctions-ravaged people with . the revenue. In practice, UN contractors and Saddam’s party officials . pocketed millions from kickbacks while ordinary Iraqis suffered terrible . privation. I . am talking about the mind-boggling incompetence of the order issued in . 1994 to the commander of the peacekeeping force in Rwanda who had . stumbled upon arms caches, and who intended to seize them before they . could be used to murder civilians. He was told in no uncertain terms to leave the weapons where they were. Eight hundred thousand people died in the ensuing genocide. And I am talking about UN officials selling arms to Congolese militias while at the same time, it is reliably reported, poaching elephants and trading in their tusks. We don’t like to dwell on such failures. We push them from our minds, because we want to give the UN the benefit of the doubt. Yet it is this thinking that encourages the wrongdoing in the first place. How can we take seriously an . organisation whose members voted onto its Commission for Human Rights . such shameless human rights-abusing countries . Only in the U.S., which is especially touchy about its sovereignty and resents interference from the UN, is the body’s malpractice widely reported. Elsewhere, we tend to treat the organisation as the source of ultimate moral sanction. Which is, if you think about it, a very odd thing to do. How can we take seriously an organisation whose members voted onto its Commission for Human Rights such shameless human rights-abusing countries as Sudan and Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe? Why should a vote by the UN General Assembly — in which each member state has its say — mean more than a vote in our own House of Commons? Why should we be influenced by how Uzbekistan, Iran and Cuba cast their ballots? Yet, bizarrely, we are. Every proposed military action — in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria — is now debated largely in terms of whether it has UN authority. What do we mean by ‘UN authority’? We mean, in practice, how France, China and Russia vote on the Security Council. We are, in other words, contracting out our foreign policy to Francois Hollande, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin . Daniel Hannan claims Britain is 'contracting out' our foreign policy to the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, pictured, and French President Francois Hollande . Every time war looms, you can be certain that Anglican bishops will assure us that those three atheists are the final arbiters of whether it is just. It’s not that UN employees are more venal than anyone else. Man is fallen and, in every organisation, you will find people who give in to temptation. It’s simply that, like other global technocracies, the UN doesn’t have to explain itself to anyone. It is powered by its own sense of moral superiority; and the rest of us overlook its peccadilloes on the grounds that it means well. What would I do to reform it? I’d pare back the UN to its most elemental role, namely providing a forum for the arbitration of disputes  among states. I’d scrap — or at least pull out of — the massive associated bureaucracies that lay down the law on every subject from the status of refugees to employment rights, from development aid to drugs, from housing to climate change. Not because these matters are unimportant, but precisely because they are too important to be left to remote officials. Our ancestors fought for centuries to establish the right to hire and fire their lawmakers. Yet, at global as at European level, we seem content to hand power to technocrats who answer only to themselves. Ms Manjoo is, of course, entitled to her view about British sexism, as is Mrs Rolnik to hers about our housing benefit. But if they want to dictate policy, they should take the trouble to get themselves elected first.","UN's Rashida Manjoo has criticised Britain for having 'sexist culture'

Moments later Lewis Evan Wood got lucky when he walked through the front door of an unlocked home and snatched a handbag, wallet and mobile phone as the owners slept. The 24-year-old then fled in the homeowners’ green Ford C Max car - which he later flipped during a 70mph police chase after being spotted at the wheel of the stolen vehicle. Scroll down for video . A brazen burglar was captured on CCTV trying car doors and attempting to walk into houses in a Cardiff street. Lewis Evan Wood walked through the front door of an unlocked home and snatched a handbag, wallet and mobile phone as the owners slept . Wood, from Rumney, Cardiff, is now behind bars for three years and eight months after being rescued from the car and later convicted of offences including burglary and dangerous driving. Wood and an unidentified second man were picked up by a private surveillance camera as they strolled along the road in Roath in the early hours of the morning - oblivious to the fact their every step was being caught on film. The pair even appear to openly urinate in the street as well as attempting to open car doors and wandering up garden pathways in the hunt for unlocked front doors. Wood and an unidentified second man were picked up by a private surveillance camera as they strolled along Trafalgar Road in Roath in the early hours of the morning . They were oblivious to the fact their every step was being caught on film . Lewis Evan Wood enters a front garden during his nighttime raid . Just minutes later Wood - wearing an unzipped hooded jacket over a white T-shirt and jeans - sauntered through an unlocked front door in a neighbouring road and netted a haul worth thousands before driving away in the stolen car after swiping the keys. Lewis Wood is now behind bars for three years and eight months . Just 48 hours later, in the early hours of October 12 last year, officers spotted Wood at the wheel of the stolen car in Trowbridge and pursued him. The chase - which saw Wood reach speeds of 70mph in a 30mph zone - endedwhen the stolen Ford collided with an unattended parked car in Penrhyn Close in Rumney before striking a garden wall and flipping over and landing on its roof. Wood was taken to the University Hospital of Wales, Heath, accompanied by police officers and arrested on suspicion of burglary, driving offences and being under the influence of drink or drugs. The estimated total value of the stolen property and the damage caused byWood topped £6,000. He later appeared at Cardiff Crown Court and was handed a 44-month jail term after he admitted burglary. Wood was also handed a concurrent 16-month prison term and a four-year driving ban after he pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking, while he was given an additional concurrent 16-month jail term after admitting dangerous driving. He also pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol - which saw him given a concurrent three-month jail term - and using a vehicle without insurance, for which his licence was endorsed. Wood was ordered to complete a fresh driving test once his period of disqualification has ended. Detective Chief Inspector Tony Brown from South Wales Police said: 'Members of the public don’t understand how brazen people are and opportunistic they are in trying to gain entry to unsecured premises.' South Wales Police figures show there were 1,359 burglaries recorded in Cardiff in the 2013/14 financial year - down from 1,594 the previous year. Wood - wearing an unzipped hooded jacket over a white T-shirt and jeans - walks along the street . Just minutes later Wood sauntered through an unlocked front door in a neighbouring road and netted a haul worth thousands before driving away in the stolen car after swiping the keys . In 490 cases over the last year - more than a third of burglaries - properties were left unsecured in some way, which could include unlocked doors, windows or side gates. Det Chief Insp Brown said: 'It does happen regularly unfortunately where people are very opportunistic. We know that people will just try doors. 'Whereas people may have a misconception that houses are staked out for some period of time that is not the case. The vast majority of burglaries happen purely through leaving unsecured doors and unsecured windows and a burglar will walk along and see this and try every door to gain entry.'","Lewis Evan Wood, 24, caught on camera trying his luck in a Cardiff street .

"By . Mark Duell . Financial advisor: Stephen Evans, 30, of Warrington, was running a Ponzi scheme to make himself rich . A CROOKED financial adviser dubbed the ‘Wolf of Old Hall Street’ bought a fleet of supercars, invested in a racehorse and even sponsored football clubs with the proceeds of a £4.4million Ponzi scheme. Conman Stephen Evans spent £1.5million snapping up so many top-of-the-range cars a judge said they would fill several episodes of Top Gear. Evans also splashed out £36,000 on yachts and £300,000 on jewellery, and paid £250,000 for a racehorse he renamed ‘Fat Gary’. His case echoes that of 1990s fraudster Jordan Belfort, who conned investors in the US and was the inspiration for The Wolf of Wall Street film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Over three years Evans, 30, enjoyed a luxury lifestyle with other people’s money. He bought an astonishing fleet of 20 luxury cars, including a lime green Lamborghini and a Porsche 911 for his girlfriend as well as BMWs and Mercedes. He ran his empire from Old Hall Street in Liverpool’s business district, but his reach stretched as far as the United Arab Emirates, where he recruited many of his victims. He used more than £250,000 of ill-gotten cash to buy corporate sponsorship deals at Liverpool and Everton football clubs and was even pictured with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. And after spending some £250,000 buying a racehorse called Saphir River, which he renamed Fat Gary, he shelled out £50,000 in stabling fees and handed a further £15,000 to Chester Racecourse to sponsor a race under the Fat Gary banner. Then there was £280,000 on flights, hotels, chauffeurs and other travel expenses, including £90,000 at Hilton hotels, £70,000 on Emirates international flights and £21,000 at The Ritz in London. On top of that, he spent £36,600 on two yachts for a staff trip to the Isle of Wight. He also rented properties at exclusive addresses and dressed himself in designer clothing and handmade bespoke suits. Evans also used other people’s money to give generously to charity, including £59,050 to the Marina Dalglish cancer appeal and £52,000 to the charity of Liverpool celebrity hairdresser Herbert Howe. Purchase: Among the cars Evans bought were a £190,000 Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera (pictured inside) Car collection: The fraudster also bought a Porsche 911 for £75,000, among many other vehicles . Plush accommodation: Evans spent £150,000 over three years renting accommodation at prestigious addreses, including Ye Priory Court in Allerton, Merseyside (pictured) Anfield: He put £45,000 towards sponsoring Liverpool FC and was photographed with player Steven Gerrard . Andrew West, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court: ‘In short, the case against Stephen Evans is that he ran what is commonly known as a Ponzi scheme. ‘Between 2007 and 2010 Evans worked as a stockbroker and financial adviser for Globaleye Investment and One International in the United Arab Emirates. ‘He then set up his own company, Stephen Evans Investments Ltd. During this time he continued living in Dubai and the Isle of Man for tax purposes.’ Welsh interest: Evans spent £10,000 on sponsorship of the Millennium Stadium (pictured) in Cardiff . Sponsorship: He put £15,000 to Chester Racecourse to sponsor a race under the Fat Gary banner. He had paid £250,000 for a race horse called Saphir River which he renamed Fat Gary . Expensive tastes: Evans, who was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court, spent £21,000 visiting The Ritz (pictured) Top class: He also visited Atlantis on the Palm Hotel (pictured), in Dubai, which came in at £19,500 . It was when Evans set up his own . company that the scams started. He persuaded clients to hand over large . amounts of cash which he claimed would be invested but which he simply . spent – and then sought new investors to repay what he owed the old . ones. In total, he took in . around £4.4million, of which £300,000 was paid to his initial investors . to keep the scam going. Later arrivals, including one man who gave him . £3.7million, received nothing back at all. It was, as Judge Denis . Watson, QC, said, ‘doomed to fail’. Life of luxury: The court heard Evans wrongly took around £4.4million by persuading clients to hand over cash he said would be invested into the business . Movie: His scam echoes the exploits of Jordan Belfort who was the inspiration for Oscar-nominated film The Wolf of Wall Street starring Leonardo DiCaprio (pictured) and Jonah Hill . Abroad: An image from Evans's trip to Queenstown, New Zealand. He spent £185,000 travelling to the country and socialising with his brother there . By the end of 2012 Evans was being . tracked by a private detective hired by one of his clients and gave . himself up to police in St Helens. Mr West said: ‘The hounds were at his heels, the game was up.’ Named . after one of the most notorious conmen in US history, the Ponzi scheme . is an elaborate version of the oldest scam of them all - pyramid . selling. In its . classic form, a Ponzi fraudster sets up a fund with a 'fail-safe' business plan. Investors join in their droves, lured by the huge returns . on offer. But the . fraudster will merely pay off old investors with new money that comes . into the fund. Eventually, all Ponzi schemes are doomed to collapse . under the weight of new money flooding in. The . fraud was named after Charles Ponzi, an Italian who emigrated to . America in 1903 with $2.50 in his pocket. After a spell in prison for . fraud, he set up an investment scheme to exploit differences in the . price of postage stamps in Italy and the U.S. At . the height of his success in 1920, Ponzi was making $250,000 a day - a . mammoth sum for the era. When his scheme collapsed, Ponzi pleaded guilty . to fraud and was sentenced to five years in a federal prison. But that didn’t stop Evans lying to detectives, saying the investments had been legitimate business deals gone wrong. He even bought a £21,000 BMW with stolen cash and tried to sell it. He eventually pleaded guilty to ten counts of fraud and one of converting criminal property. Christopher . Stables, defending, said: ‘This was an unreal lifestyle, a Walter Mitty . lifestyle. He was handling extremely large sums of money and was . seduced by that lifestyle. ‘He . was weak and he accepts that. It was a lifestyle that gave him high . living, luxuries and mixing with celebrities. It was almost a drug.’ Judge Watson jailed Evans, of Great Sankey in Cheshire, for five years and three months, telling him: ‘You held yourself out as a financial adviser. 'The reality was you were a very plausible conman. You had superficial charm and amiability to impress would-be clients with the promise of high returns. ‘You demonstrated what can only be described as a flash lifestyle which you concocted to give the impression of success. 'The hospitality and wooing of clients was all done to get them on the hook. ‘The list of expenditures is breathtaking. You spent £300,000 on jewellery, £150,000 on accommodation, at least £50,000 on clothing, £300,000 on travel, £1.5million on cars. ‘You spent £300k on jewellery, £150k on accommodation, at least £50k on clothing, £300k on travel and £1.5million on cars. 'The cars would do justice to several programmes of Top Gear. 'This was relentless greed which knew no bounds.’ Pricey: Evans spent £29,000 on clothing at Selfridges. The Oxford Street store in London is pictured . Sentencing: Evans has been convicted of ten counts of fraud and one of converting criminal property, and received over five years in prison .

"By . Amanda Williams . Michael Green, 84, was dragged from his car and left with a broken hip and needing surgery to a head wound after he was carjacked by a gang of thug . A pensioner was dragged from his 'pride and joy' car and beaten up with a metal weight during a carjacking by a gang of as many as six teenagers outside his local pub. Michael Green, 84, was yanked from his 15-year-old Â£2,000 car outside the Trumpet in Bilston, West Midlands, on Friday evening. He was then beaten around the head with a metal weight by one of the group - who left him in the road with a broken hip and needing serious surgery to his head. As the retired sales rep and musician started his engine the three yobs pulled open his door and grabbed him from the Toyota Avensis, police said. They then sped off in the Â£2,000 vehicle leaving the frightened pensioner lying badly injured in the gutter at around 11.30pm. He was spotted by a passer-by who raised the alarm. The widower was taken to Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital where surgeons operated on the wound and his fractured hip. His daughter Gisella Smith released a shocking photo of her father's injuries and made an emotive plea for information. She said the 15-year-old car had been her father's 'pride and joy' and the callous attack has had a 'massive' effect on him. She added: 'My dad is the most amazing person, when I was two, my mother died and he single-handedly raised three children. 'Throughout my childhood he held down two jobs - by day he was a sales rep and by night he was a semi-professional drummer. 'Music is my dad's life. Going to the Trumpet is his life. He loves going there as they play live music. I'm just hoping that he has got the confidence to go back. 'Over the last few years he has been a bit slower on his feet and now walks with a stick. 'He felt at home at the Trumpet he always parked his car, which was his pride and joy, in the same spot. She added: 'He is the kindest, politest man I know, a real proper old fashioned gentleman and I am proud to call him my dad. The widower was taken to Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital where he needed surgery to a head wound and treatment for a fractured hip. Yesterday his daughter Gisella Smith released a shocking photo of her father's injuries and made an emotive plea for information . 'He had literally just got in the car he hadn't even put his belt on when he was dragged from it. He then suffered a sustained attacked and was repeatedly punched and kicked. 'Luckily a passer-by spotted him and it was them that called the police. People from the pub then came out to help. They have been really upset about it all. 'I have no words really to describe how we feel about the attackers. There was no motive. It's not a fancy car but it was my dad's pride and joy. 'They smashed the windows in front of him before driving off.  I'm just so glad he is alive when you hear the full details -you wouldn't wish it on anyone's dad and grandad.' As a young man as a young musician Mr Green was in the Mike Green Galaxy band -  a regular resident band at the Civic in Wolverhampton - and his music has been played in the Royal Albert Hall. West Midlands Police said the thieves crashed Mr Green's car a short time later  - less than four miles away from the pub. Mr Green was yanked from his car outside the Trumpet in Bilston, West Midlands, on Friday evening, where he had been enjoying live music . His daughter Gisella Smith released a shocking photo of her father's injuries and made an emotive plea for information . She said the 15-year-old car had been her father's 'pride and joy' and the callous attack has had a 'massive' effect on him . A 16-year-old was arrested on suspicion of robbery and was later bailed pending further enquiries. But Det Chief Insp Pete Dunn, the senior investigating officer in the case, said the father-of-two was attacked by youths who may be as young as 15-years-old. He said: 'It is possible there were six teenagers involved. 'This is a significant attack which has resulted in one arrest of a young male so far. 'The lines of inquiry include looking at the vehicle, the CCTV from the pub and CCTV of where the vehicle was left. 'We are looking for six young males aged between 15- 18 and the victim is the only witness at the moment. 'The car was abandoned just one and a half miles from the public house.

Mr Green's daughter said: 'I have no words really to describe how we feel about the attackers. There was no motive. It's not a fancy car but it was my dad's pride and joy'' His car was a Toyota Avensis, similar to the one pictured . 'The attackers used a bag containing a heavy object to hit the victim across the head and dragged him across the floor. 'He was punched and kicked as well before they drove off.' He added: 'We have taken the unusual step to ask the family to help with our appeal. 'This was a motiveless and cowardly attack on a vulnerable and elderly man. 'This pub is a lifeline for Michael and to be attacked in this way is totally unacceptable. 'I will do everything within my power to bring these culprits to justice and I am appealing for the communities help. 'If anyone has any information no matter how insignificant I would urge them to call me or one of my team on 101.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . A new television show from the producers of the controversial Benefits Street could be in the making after a camera crew were spotted filming residents and ‘exploring the subject of immigration’. Film crews approached people in a residential street in Southampton, Hampshire, and told locals they were filming a documentary for a potential new series called ‘Immigration Street’. The show, filmed by Love Productions - . which also made Benefits Street - is set to focus on how people living . in different ethnic groups live in close proximity to each other and . could air on Channel 4 next year. Film crews approached people in a residential street in Southampton, Hampshire, and told locals they were filming a pilot documentary for a potential new series which could be called 'Immigration Street' The show, filmed by Love Productions in Derby Road, Southampton, pictured, is set to focus on how people living in different ethnic groups live in close proximity to each other and could air on Channel 4 next year . Although the programme is only in the development stage at the moment, if it is commissioned for a full series it is set to be filmed over the summer. Film crews have been spending time in the 'vibrant and diverse' Derby Road area of Southampton and have interviewed residents and locals for the show. However, the presence of the cameras has caused alarm to some residents and local figures who fear the road will be portrayed negatively. Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead, who represents the area, said: ‘Derby Road is a very vibrant, diverse and strong working part of Southampton. ‘It is a community which has been there for a very long time, pretty much everyone there was born in Southampton. ‘It seems quite extraordinary that a company wants to come and brand an area with a particular name they have decided in advance.’ The MP fears the show will result in Derby Road being portrayed in the same negative light as James Turner Street, Birmingham, in controversial show Benefits Street. The presence of film cameras has caused alarm to some residents and local figures who fear Derby Road in Southampton will be portrayed negatively . A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'Love Productions are researching a potential new series for Channel 4 looking at life in a community where diverse groups of people live alongside one another' He added: ‘I do fear, with their track record, this is not going to be a show which actually points out all of the good things that are going on the area. ‘Yes, it is a culturally diverse area of the city, but the idea that one particular street is ""an immigrant street"" doesn't seem accurate. ‘We saw this with Benefits Street. Some people on the show had no idea certain things were going to be said or shown on the show. ‘It produced a picture which they did not recognise and it distorted substantially what those people in Birmingham wanted to say.’ After learning about the possibility of the show coming to Southampton, Mr Whitehead wrote a letter to Derby Road's residents. He also said he had heard rumours film crews may have offered enticements for people to appear in the show, something the producers refute. Mr Whitehead added: ‘I have written to everybody who lives in Derby Road and asked them what they think about it all. ‘The way a number of people on the street may have been approached is giving cause for alarm, if it is true. ‘They allegedly approached people and offered to do their washing or take them out for meals, provided they do certain things in certain ways. Southampton Test MP Alan Whitehead fears the show will result in Derby Road being portrayed in the same negative light as James Turner Street, Birmingham, in controversial show Benefits Street . Deirdre Kelly,  known as 'White Dee' has become one of the most famous characters portrayed in Channel 4's Benefits Street . Benefits Street focused on the . residents of James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, where it . was reported that more than 90 per cent of residents lived on benefits. Screened . over five episodes starting in January, it was controversial with . politicians and the police and resulted in hundreds of complaints. It made household names of residents such as White Dee, the self-styled ‘mother’ of the street. Early . episodes featured residents of the street confessing to cameras that . they had fraudulently claimed benefits, and at one point cameras even . followed a man around central Birmingham on a shop-lifting spree. Police . investigations were launched after the footage was aired. The series generated around 960 complaints to Ofcom and another 800 to Channel 4.Benefits Street is the channel’s biggest ratings hit since its coverage of the Paralympics in 2012. Channel . 4 and programme makers Love Productions claim the street is typical of . hundreds of UK communities struggling to cope with economic and social . decline. But some critics labelled it ‘poverty porn’ and said it is paints a false picture of life in modern Britain. Others . praised it for exposing the truth of benefits fraud but said it failed . to condemn crime and also exploits children, exposing them to bullying . and victimisations. Some . residents said the show - which shows children swearing and misbehaving - . has left youngsters to ashamed and embarrassed to go to school. ‘If that were true, and it has come to me second and third hand, it would suggest the programme would be set up in a way to run to a script. ‘Therefore it won't reflect what is happening in the area, and that is very alarming. ‘But this is more serious - this is about a real street, a real community, a real city and things which are really happening. ‘I think there is an absolute responsibility on anybody who is making such a programme to get it right and start off right.’ Producers say they have not yet finalised a name for the new series but admitted 'Immigration Street' has been discussed and is a possibility. A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘Love Productions are researching a potential new series for Channel 4 looking at life in a community where diverse groups of people live alongside one another. ‘The title and location are not yet confirmed and discussions are ongoing with local people. ‘Benefits Street sparked an important debate about the welfare system. ‘It was a fair and balanced observational documentary series and was a sympathetic, humane and objective portrayal of how people are coping with continuing austerity and cuts in benefits. ‘We strongly refute any suggestion that any resident of Derby Road has been offered bribes or gifts on condition of filming them. Khalid Farooq, of the Derby Road-based Pakistan Welfare Association said the TV show was an opportunity to show how multi-cultural the street is . Kieran Smith, creative director at Love Productions, said Derby Road in Southampton was the current focus for the show due to the number of immigrants living there . ‘Any filming the team have done would follow strict protocols in accordance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code.’ Cleaner Delroy Campbell, who flies Jamaican flags from his home in Derby Road, has already been filmed by the crew. The 56-year-old said: ‘I've done a lot of filming with them already, I don't have a problem with it. ‘I'm a hard-working man and I've lived here for three years, I used to live over the road before that. ‘I don't know how it will end up, but I don't think I've put myself in any danger.’ Hasan Hourani, 21, a student living in Derby Road said he finds it offensive that families on the street have been asked to appear in the show. He said: ""’I find it offensive to the families that live here. ‘Maybe it was a bad area ages ago, but now all I see is good and normal people from different countries around the world.’ However Khalid Farooq, of the Derby Road-based Pakistan Welfare Association said it was an opportunity to show how multi-cultural the street is. He said: ‘I think it's good. It shows the multi-cultural environment of people living in Derby Road.‘They should show a positive aspect of the community and show how hard working people are here.’ Councillor . Satvir Kaur, Southampton City Council cabinet member for communities, . said: ‘I do have concerns about a potential programme called Immigration . Street. Southampton residents fear 'Immigration Street' could portray them negatively and attract attention like Benefits Street did to the residents of James Turner Steet in Birmingham, including Dee Roberts, pictured . ‘We have a variety of diverse communities in Southampton and community cohesion is something we should pride ourselves on. ‘My concern is it will not show that, and I am genuinely worried about vulnerable people in that area in Derby Road. ‘Some people could be taken advantage of as they will not realise how the final edit will portray them.’ Kieran Smith, creative director at Love Productions, said . the idea for ‘Immigration Street’ came about during the filming of Benefits . Street. He said: ‘It came about as a result of the second episode of . Benefits Street where we featured one house which changed hands several times . and was mainly occupied my immigrants. ‘It was described as one of the most sensitively-handled pieces on . immigration at the time and we felt it was worth doing a series. ‘The idea of . immigrants being in Britain and how they get by when they’re here and the . effect they have on communities felt like something that was useful for us to . do.’ Mr Smith said the crew were currently meeting people and . looking into various locations although Derby Road was the current focus. Film crews spent 12 months filming residents in James Turner Street, Birmingham, pictured, for the controversial series Benefits Street . He said: ‘It’s an area which we researched and we knew from the Office of National Statistics has large number of immigrants settling there. ‘It felt like a place that was going to be interesting place and had interesting characters living quite diverse lives. ‘Of course you’re going to get some people that say they don’t want to be involved but there’s lots of people who are happy to be filmed. ‘Like all documentary series you have to be respectful because people are naturally nervous. ‘We are run by very strict guidelines on how we operate. We don’t pay people, we don’t bribe people – these things simply don’t happen. We’re not in the business of stitching people up. 'It’s about showing a fair, honest, truthful account of showing what happens in a street over a certain period.’","'Immigration Street' is working title of potential new series for Channel 4 .

"By . Hugo Gye . Police have warned pet owners after two dogs died and three others needed medical treatment when they ate poisoned meat which was found in a park. A mysterious poisoner apparently used the deadly toxin methomyl to poison pieces of meat which they then left to be eaten in Fryent Country Park in Brent, north-west London. Local police have teamed up with the RSPCA in a bid to find the culprit and prevent other animals from suffering the same fate. Poison: Two dogs have died after ingesting a toxic substance in Fryent Country Park in Brent, pictured . RSPCA chief inspector Simon Osborne said: 'This kind of poison is extremely toxic for dogs and other animals if consumed and it is very concerning to hear that this is what caused the recent deaths. 'We urge anyone who knows of any person who has a stock of this particular insecticide at home or in even their shed or garage to talk the police or ourselves in complete confidence, so we can investigate further.' A Natural England spokesman added: 'It's distressing and disturbing to think that somebody could be using such a dangerous toxin so indiscriminately.' Police urged dog owners to be extra vigilant, and advised people to wear gloves if handling any toxic substances. Danger: Pet owners should be vigilant in order to avoid the risk of coming into contact with methomyl . Sergeant Peter Rowntree, of Brent Police, said: 'With better weather and longer hours of daylight the parks will be busier and I am hopeful that any criminal activity is more likely to be seen and phoned through to us.' It is a criminal offence under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 intentionally to give a poison to an animal. No one has yet been arrested over the apparent poisonings, and it is not clear whether or not the toxic meat was in fact deliberately left around Fryent Country Park. Methomyl is a synthetic chemical which is extremely toxic to humans and animals. It is used as a pesticide, but its use is restricted in Europe because of the dangers it poses and it is not widely available in shops. Reports of animal poisoning increased by nearly 10 per cent in the last year, according to the RSPCA, with a total of 1,154 complaints. However, the charity has also warned that many animal lovers are accidentally poisoning their pets by allowing them to come into contact with toxic substances such as chocolate or rhubarb. Chief veterinary officer James Yeates said said: 'Chocolate poisoning is one of the most commonly reported types of animal poisoning, so Easter is the ideal time to remind people of the hazards around their home that could accidentally poison their pets. 'Easter eggs are a tasty treat for many of us, but a hefty vet's bill won't be quite so easy to swallow if your pet ends up wolfing them down before you.'","Meat laced with deadly poison methomyl was left around Fryent Country Park in north-west London .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Walter Doe, 24, from Uckfield, East Sussex, was jailed for 12 weeks and banned from keeping animals for 10 years for the horrific act of cruelty . A man who maimed an eight-week-old puppy by cutting of its tail and leaving it to suffer excruciating pain has been jailed and banned from keeping animals. Walter Doe, 24, sliced off the tail of his pet Jack Russell, called Jack, two inches from its base using a ‘sharp tool’. Unemployed Doe, of Uckfield, East Sussex, was caught last July after a report of concern for the animal’s welfare was made to RSPCA. The charity said workers found the black and white puppy with a bandage around his tail and in obvious pain after Doe maimed it. Jack the puppy was taken to a vet who removed the bandage and found a very raw wound, about two inches from the tail base, with the rest of the tail removed, an RSPCA spokesman said. She added: ‘The vet said it was a very clean-cut wound and must have been made with a sharp tool.’ Doe was jailed at Hastings Magistrates' Court for 12 weeks for causing unnecessary suffering to the puppy and failing to seek veterinary treatment for his open wound. He was also banned from keeping all animals for 10 years. RSPCA Inspector Andrew Kirby said: ‘The prison sentence reflects how seriously the court took the suffering caused to the puppy. ‘We have no proof about what was used to dock Jack's tail but, whether it was a knife or a pair of scissors, he would have been in agony. ‘Cutting through the bone of the tail must have been excruciatingly painful and no attempt at all was made to relieve this pain. ‘Tail docking is such a brutal way to treat a young animal in any case. Walter Doe, 24, sliced off the tail of his eight-month-old Jack Russell, called Jack, two inches from its base using a 'sharp tool'. RSPCA workers said the puppy would have been in agony . ‘As well as the pain it causes, it is just completely unnecessary and deprives the animal of their best means of expression and balance. ‘We urge people to remember that is it is against the law for a reason.’ The court also ordered that Jack, who has been living in foster care while the case was ongoing, is taken from Doe on a permanent basis. Mr Kirby said: ‘Jack was very quiet and subdued when I found him, which is hardly surprising if you think about what he had gone through. Puppy Jack was taken to a vet who removed the bandage and found a very raw wound, about two inches from the tail base, with the rest of the tail removed, an RSPCA spokesman said . ‘But he soon came out of his shell and is such a lovely little dog despite everything - and I really took his case to heart, so much so that I have decided to adopt him myself. ‘I just want to give him a happy forever home so he can forget his tough start in life.’ Anyone with any information about a case of animal cruelty should call the RSPCA on 0300 1234999.","Unemployed Walter Doe, 24, sliced off the puppy's tail using a 'sharp tool'

"By . Sam Webb . Human bones have been discovered buried under a suburban driveway, police have said. The skeletal remains, including what are believed to be part of a skull and femur, were found by workmen on a job in Purley, near Croydon in south London, the Metropolitan Police said. They made the find in Riddlesdown Road yesterday and after they were confirmed as being human the bones were sent to anthropologists to determine how old they are. Remains: The bones (skull, right, and femur, left) that were discovered under the driveway of a home in south London (right). The property is close to a Saxon burial site, police said . Lead investigator Detective Sergeant Kenny Windsor, from Croydon CID, said early indications suggested they had laid under the driveway for many years. He said: 'Any requirement for an investigation will be determined by the age of the bones and we're seeking the assistance of anthropologists to try and establish this, but we may also have to use carbon dating techniques to confirm their age. 'We are carrying out other inquiries in the meantime.' Investigation: Police say they will use carbon dating techniques to confirm the age of the remains . He added: 'It is an unusual discovery, but we're keeping an open mind about whether the bones were originally buried there or indeed moved there for some reason. 'We're also aware that there is an ancient Saxon burial site in the vicinity but at this stage, the direction of our investigation hinges on establishing age of the bones.' No one has been arrested in connection with the find.","The grim find was made in Purley, a quiet area near Croydon, south London .

"By . Hugo Gye . Claims: Nigel Farage has been accused of preventing debate over UKIP's use of expenses money . UKIP today faces new claims that it has blocked questions about its EU expenses, a day after it emerged that Nigel Farage was paid £15,500 a year to run his office. Party insiders said that the UKIP leader had tried to stop other officials from raising concerns about how allowances and donations were being spent. Mr Farage allegedly told one party worker to 'shut up' after she questioned the expenses claimed by UKIP's MEPs. He has denied any wrongdoing after it was claimed that the European Parliament paid him more than £75,000 in office allowances every year even though he spent just £3,000 a year on his constituency office. He claimed that the allegations reported by The Times were a 'political smear' and insisted he had not spent any expenses improperly. Mr Farage has been outspoken in opposing the abuse of expenses by MPs, and last week called for Maria Miller to resign from the Cabinet after she was found to have claimed too much money. However, former UKIP executive Delroy Young claimed that the party leader had previously refused to discuss how expenses and donations were handled. He said that Mr Farage went 'berserk' when confronted with questions from an official about EU expenses and the money raised by donations to a call centre in Kent. 'Farage shouted at her, he said, ""Shut up you stupid woman."" He went berserk,' Mr Young told The Times. Ian Gillman, who formerly sat on UKIP's governing body, said that he was threatened by an official when he raised concerns about the way the party spent its money. 'I never raised my voice, I just persisted with question after question about where our money had gone,' he said. 'The official made threats to take me outside the room and beat me up.' Bruce Lawson, the party's ex-treasurer, apparently wrote to Mr Farage in 2008 calling him for him to resign as leader and expressed worries about MEPs' expenses. He claimed that some MEPs were given £660 a month directly into their pension funds, adding: 'In theory they are then supposed to reimburse this money from their salaries, but everyone relies on the MEPs' honesty. There are no checks that any of them actually do repay this money.' Controversy: Mr Farage claims £15,500 a year to run his constituency office in West Sussex, pictured . Mr Farage acted angrily yesterday after he was accused of being paid more money than he needed to run his constituency office in West Sussex, which was donated rent-free by supporters. The former manager of the office estimated that the building's insurance and council tax cost £150 per month with £100 spent on utilities, bringing the total running cost to £3,000 a year. However, Mr Farage was paid £15,500 a year from the European Parliament's 'general expenditure allowance' - leaving £60,000 unaccounted for since the last European elections in 2009. He told Sky News: 'They are not expenses. We don't actually claim for anything. I have not claimed for an office, I have not claimed this figure of £15,000.' Asked what the money was spent on, Mr Farage said: 'The electricity bill is more than £3,000 a year, we have burglar alarms, we have insurance, we have a massive postbag and a mail bill that is growing by the week as the level of interest and support for our party and our campaign and our cause grows.' Accusation: Former UKIP officials claim that the party is not transparent with its finances . Writing in the Independent today, he added: 'It is not for me to defend this system: after all, I want it abolished. 'Ever since 1999, I have expressly stated that UKIP MEPs will use the wherewithal provided by the EU Parliament to campaign for Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.' Liberal Democrat MEP Chris Davies called for Mr Farage to spell out exactly how he spent his parliamentary allowances. 'I have always ensured that money paid to me for office costs has been used for that purpose,' he told The Times. 'Mr Farage should be able to produce the same evidence if he wants to claim to be different.' MEPs are paid €95,482 (£78,800) a year, and also receive a daily attendance allowance as well as money for staff costs.","UKIP officials have allegedly been stopped from raising concerns about how European Parliament expenses are spent .

"By . Darren Boyle . Mary Harris, 54 (left) was working out in her local gym in Easington, Co Durham when her heart stopped, luckily off-duty paramedic Mark Syson, (right) was also in the gym and began immediate CPR . An off-duty paramedic saved a woman's life after she collapsed while working out on a treadmill at her local gym. Mary Harris, 54, almost died after her heart stopped while exercising at the Inta Fitness Gym in Easington, Co Durham when Mark Syson rushed to her aid. Mrs Harris was described as the luckiest woman alive' after Mr Syson's rapid intervention saved her life. Mrs Harris, who is a civil servant said: ‘I can’t describe in words what his actions have meant for me and my family. ‘He has saved my life. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be here.’ Mr Syson was working out at the same time when he spotted Mrs Harris crumpled over the machine. He raced over to the machine which was still running and immediately set to work. Mr Syson, who is a paramedic with the North East Ambulance Service, called for the receptionist to phone an ambulance. He then began life-saving CPR. Eventually Mrs Harris regained consciousness following the incident in March. She later underwent an operation to replace her aortic valve at the Sunderland Royal Hospital. Her husband, Richard, 56, praised Mr Syson's quick actions. 'He, (Mark) has been playing down his role but all the specialists have said unequivocally Mary would have died if he hadn’t been there.’ Her surgeon, who replaced the aortic valve, described Mrs Harris as 'the luckiest woman alive'. Richard Harris (left) said paramedic Mark Syson (right) was nervous meeting his wife Mary (centre) after he saved her life in the gym . Following the operation in March Mrs Harris has been recovering at home with her husband who is a self-employed financial advisor. Mr Syson later met with the Harris family. He said: 'I was nervous and slightly embarrassed when meeting Mary and her husband Richard for the first time since the incident. ‘As a paramedic we don’t normally meet our patients again or their families after they are taken to hospital. It was lovely to see both of them again and especially Mary who seemed in good spirits regardless of what had happened. ‘It makes you feel very humble and I’m so pleased I was able to help Mary when she needed it.’ Mary Harris suffered from an undiagnosed congenital heart condition and thought a pain in her chest was due to lack of fitness when she collapsed at the Inta Fitness Gym (pictured) Mrs Harris admitted that her family has been blighted by sudden deaths with her father, uncle and grandfather dying aged 49, 55 and 52. Mr Harris said he would be a widow today if it was not for Mr Syson's rapid intervention. He said: ‘There wasn’t a dry eye in the house. Mary was overjoyed to meet up with Mark. ‘He felt strange meeting someone he has “worked on” because usually the patient goes into the hospital and that is that, however, I said to him you must feel good knowing you’ve saved a life and meeting that person again. ‘At this incident there was no resuscitator available, as there would be if he was attending an incident when on duty, it was just his prompt action and effective CPR that revived Mary. ‘The consultant confirmed and my family feel that Mary would have gone the same way as her father, uncle and granddad had Mark not been there on that day at that time. ‘She’s recovering well and very grateful to still be alive.’ Surgeons at the Sunderland Royal Hospital said that without Mr Syson's (right) rapid intervention, Mrs Harris (centre) would have died leaving her husband Richard (left) a widower . Following the incident, Mrs Harris was diagnosed with a rare congenital heart condition which has been corrected as a result of the surgery meaning she should not suffer any related problems in future. She added: '‘I feel incredibly lucky. Only three per cent of people who suffer from cardiac arrest outside of hospital survive. ‘I had felt twinges in my heart, but I just thought I was out of shape as I hadn’t been going to the gym for a while, so I pushed through the pain. ‘That was a big mistake. I am just so grateful to be alive. Not only does this mean the world to me, but also my family, my husband and my daughter.’","Mary Harris was working out at her local gym when her heart stopped .

"By . Martin Robinson . The high pay of BBC stars like Graham Norton, Gary Lineker, Jeremy Paxman, Tess Daly and Fiona Bruce will face fresh scrutiny after concerns salaries have 'got out of hand'. The Corporation will today announce a 'value for money' review into its £200million annual bill for its most expensive on-screen 'talent' - the first for five years. More than 250 staff earn more than £250,000 each year and 14 earn at least £500,000, but the BBC refuses to name them. Scroll down for video . Stars: The pay of presenters like Graham Norton and Susanna Reid - whose salary has been quadrupled by ITV which tempted her to leave - is to be looked at by a new review at the BBC . It is understood that Graham Norton is paid £2.61million, Gary Lineker £1.5million, Jeremy Clarkson and Jeremy Paxman £1million, Fiona Bruce £500,000 and Tess Daly £250,000. But the BBC says it must pay high salaries to keep its staff from leaving, especially after its star presenter Susanna Reid left after ITV reportedly quadrupled her salary, . Reid has apparently secured a £1million deal to present Good Morning Britain - far more than the £250,000 pay packet she was believed to be taking home on BBC Breakfast. The BBC Trust will today announce that consultants will be brought in to decide whether the BBC offers better value for money since 2008 - and if it can find more savings. It will also look into how much broadcasters are paid at rivals. MPs have welcomed the news with Tory Rob Wilson, Parliamentary Private Secretary to George Osbourne, saying: 'Pay at the BBC got completely out of hand, both for senior executives and its talent in recent years. It's about time a review took place'. Many have been critical about pay at the BBC, especially after Jonathan Ross was offered a £6million annual deal before he left for ITV. A BBC Trust spokesman said: 'Since we assessed talent pay five years ago, the BBC has successfully cut the amount it spends on its performers and presenters. But no market stays the same and it is time to look at this again. 'We are always seeking to balance saving money with ensuring the BBC has the range and quality of on-air and on-screen talent that audiences expect. This review will inform our work with the BBC and help ensure we have the right approach in place'. Salaries: Fiona Bruce is said to be paid around £500,000 and Tess Daly £250,000 for their BBC work . Scrutiny: Gary Lineker and Jeremy Paxman are believed to earn £1m or more and consultants will consider whether this offers 'value for money' However, in being asked to find ways to drive down costs, the BBC’s best-paid presenters have been in revolt against plans to axe their tax-saving freelance contracts. The Corporation had promised the Government it would stop paying staff through ‘personal service companies’ that can attract a lower rate of tax. But it may be forced to back down in the face of mounting anger from stars on the deals. Jeremy Paxman, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis are all paid in this way. Those . whose freelance contracts are close to expiry have been asked to end . their off-payroll arrangements to avoid suspicion of tax avoidance. But . by signing on as a staff member – and qualifying for a BBC pension and . other benefits – they would have to accept pay cuts of up to 25 per . cent. Instead of caving in . to the demands, many have refused to sign staff contracts, leaving the . BBC to consider either firing some of its biggest names or to accept . defeat. BBC: Broadcasting House is already in a battle with stars over plans to axe tax-saving freelance contracts . Earlier this year an insider to the . negotiations described the situation as chaos, adding: ‘The BBC is in an . impossible position. Its own staff have it over a barrel. ‘It . has promised to change the way it pays its people, but is powerless to . do anything because they would rather leave than give in and they are . all acting as one.

"By . Martin Robinson . Tesco's profits have fallen for the second year running as its rivals continue to eat into its market share, which is at a ten-year low. Britain's biggest supermarket has today posted a six per cent fall in its pre-tax profits to £3.3billion in the past 12 months, down from £3.45billion a year earlier. Tesco's like-for-like sales also fell three per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013/2014 - the sharpest drop for three years. More people are shopping at budget rivals . like Aldi and Lidl for their weekly shop while also heading to higher . end stores like Waitrose and Marks & Spencer to buy more luxury . items. Scroll down for video . Bad news: Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, has posted a six per cent drop in profit for the past year while like-for-like sales were also down . Tesco is still by far the biggest UK supermarket with 28.6 per of market share, but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago. Asda had 17.4 per cent, Sainsbury's had 16.5 per cent and Morrisons had 11.1 per cent in the year ending March 30. But all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers, with Aldi's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the past 12 months. Waitrose had five per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year, and Lidl also experienced strong growth in a record-breaking month and now accounts for 3.4 per cent of the market. Today's results heap more pressure on Tesco . boss Phil Clarke, amid reports his successors are already . being lined up. Investors are understood to have begun discussing potential replacements, with former Dixons boss John Browett linked to the post. Finance director Laurie McIlwee quit earlier this month, amid reports of disagreements with Clarke over Tesco’s plans to turn round its falling profits. Tesco admitted that it had done worse than expected amid increasingly tough competition, saying: 'Our performance in the year was not where we had planned it to be.' Like-for-like sales for the year in the UK were down 1.4 per cent. The supermarket warned that the challenging environment would continue in the current financial year. Mr Clarke said: 'Our results today reflect the challenges we face in a trading environment which is changing more rapidly than ever before. We are determined to lead the industry in this period of change.' Picture of Britain: Tesco is still the UK's biggest supermarket but its markset has shrunk as Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl took shoppers from the 'Big Four' The results round off another dismal year for Clarke since he succeeded Sir Terry Leahy as Tesco boss in 2011. Clarke is in the midst of a £1billion turnaround plan, which was launched last year after the first fall in profits for nearly two decades. He has seen Tesco’s share of the market slump to 28.6 per cent – its lowest level for nearly ten years – amid fierce competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl. Sales over the crucial Christmas and New Year period fell 2.4 per cent. The chief executive brushed off speculation about his future amid the continuing decline in performance. He said: 'I have got no intention of going anywhere. All my waking hours are spent running Tesco. It's what I love. I'm going to see this thing through.' Under pressure: Tesco's Chief Executive Philip Clarke is under renewed pressure today as shareholders called on him to quit . Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke has today been accused of 'dismantling' the legacy of his predecessor Sir Terry Leahy as shareholders demanded he resigns. One top 20 shareholder said that Mr Clarke, who took over three years ago, 'has got his strategy wrong' as the supermarket giant's profits fell for the second year running. Tesco has invested £1billion revamping stores and cutting prices in a bid to kick-start growth in its domestic market. But it has lost market share, and issued its first profit warning in 20 years, heaping huge pressure on Mr Clarke and his judgment. 'Clarke should go. Sir Terry Leahy was one of the great leaders and his legacy has been undermined. Clarke has shown he is the wrong person for the job. He has got the strategy wrong,' a top 20 investor told the Financial Times. 'Tesco should have realised the threat from the discounters and acted at least 18 months ago. I fear it is now too late. Morrison plans to slash its prices, but Tesco is not cutting its prices on the same scale. That is a mistake. Clarke is simply not of the same calibre as Sir Terry and I can't see him turning things around, which is why it is time for him to go'. Clarke has already hinted that he has only a few more years left at the supermarket himself. Despite his two past predecessors remaining as chief executive for more than a decade each, Clarke said last month: ‘You only have a job like this for a few years.’","Supermarket posts 6% fall to £3.3billion in the last 12 months .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . After its recent time in the spotlight, James Turner Street in Birmingham is not a neighbourhood in need of publicity. But while everyone may recognise the name thanks to the huge success of Channel 4's Benefits Street series, it has done no favours for auctioneers trying to shift a plot of land there. The attraction of neighbours such as 'mother of the street' White Dee, confessed benefits cheats Mark Thomas and Becky Howe or shoplifter Danny Smith, appears to have proved limited in shifting the plot, which is due to be sold for £20,000. Grime location: The £20,000 plot is behind a rusty fence on James Turner Street, Birmingham . Local celebrity: White Dee, one of the stars of notorious Channel 4 series Benefits Street, lives just a few houses from the plot . For sale: The piece of land, behind the gates picture above, currently belongs to Birmingham City Council . Notorious: The goings-on of James Turner Street have been exposed to the world after millions tuned in to Benefits Street . The show sparked anger across the nation with its vivid depiction of life on state handouts. And, despite White Dee emerging from the chaos with a raft of potentially-lucrative media appearances and offers of work, she is still claiming benefits. The self-proclaimed 'mother of the street' has appeared on several TV panel shows, and even has a fledgling rap career and plans to tour the world - but is yet to end her dependence on taxpayer money and free rent on James Turner Street. The nearby piece of land, behind number 74 James Turner Street and protected by a pair of rusty gates, is not suitable for house-building. Instead, it is being advertised to potential buyers as a place to park cars or otherwise store goods. Ron Darlington, a partner at surveyors CPBigwood, said: 'If I factored in the impact of the show it would probably be to the detriment of the value, because of the type of publicity the street hashad.' 'The streets around there have never been that great, but they’ve never been that bad either. 'I watched a little bit of the programme but then gave up on it. They picked on a street and hammered and hammered away at it, and I don’t think it did anyone around here any favours.' Notorious: James Turner Street shot to fame thanks to the series, which focused on the area due to its high proportion of benefits claimants . Storage: It is unlikely that a house could be built on the patch . Adverse publicity: Auctioneers have suggested the recent fame of James Turner Street will not help the sale . Bleak: The patch is currently covered by grass and weeds . Unloved: The plot is strewn with leaves and rubbish . Homes on the street typically sell for around £80,000 - around half the average for houses in Birmingham. The land, currently owned by Birmingham City Council, is one of 15 lots being offloaded by local authorities at an auction next month. The street shot to fame earlier this year when Benefits Street was aired, and the conditions on the street were even raised in Parliament. Early episodes featured residents of the street confessing to cameras that they had fraudulently claimed benefits, and at one point cameras even followed a man around central Birmingham on a shop-lifting spree. Police investigations were launched after the footage was aired. However Channel 4 also came under fire for allegedly bribing resident with fast food and alcohol. Contorversial: TV cameras followed Danny Smith on a shoplifting spree . Confessions: Mark Thomas and Becky Howe confessed to benefit fraud on the show . Fans: Eager tourists have begun making pilgrimages to James Turner Street . Producers were also accused of giving a distorted picture of life on James Turner Street, as residents claimed they were being villified, and that their 'community spirit' had been ignored. Hundreds of fans of the show even began turning up at the doors of its stars, while local community organisers complained that students in nearby schools were being bullied and harassed because of their association with the street. The piece of land, one of 124 lots, will be up for sale on May 1 at Villa Park in Birmingham.","Council-owned plot on James Turner Street, Birmingham, is up for sale .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . You'd think that if your father was a millionaire rock star that money would be the least of your worries. But Ronnie Wood’s son has revealed how he hustled and dealt drugs to earn a few pounds because the Rolling Stone was so ‘tight’ with his cash. Jamie Wood, who is now an art dealer, was expelled from a Somerset boarding school when he was 16 after he was caught selling cannabis to his classmates. Tight: Jamie Wood said his adoptive father Ronnie, who is worth £20million, made him build his own career . Asked if his art career was bankrolled by his father, who is said to be worth £20million, he said: 'Dude, what are you thinking? My old man is tight. I’d say, “Dad, I’m going out”, and he’d give me a tenner. 'That’s why I was always hustling from a young age, so I wouldn’t have to ask him for nothing. 'I was a hustler. That’s what I did. I’m into money and making money.' The gallery owner, now 39, also told how he would challenge Rolling Stones band members to games of pool to make extra cash. Brother in arms: Ronnie brought Jamie up as his own alongside his other sons Jesse and Tyrone Wood . Jamie's mother is Jo Wood, Ronnie's former wife, who met the rocker when her first-born was just a baby . Jamie was adopted in the 1970s as a baby by Ronnie when the musician got together with his mother Jo. His biological father is clothing boss Peter Greene.

"By . Ian Drury . Britain's Prince Harry attends a mission briefing in the British controlled flight-line in Camp Bastion . Blunders by British commanders were ‘devastatingly exploited’ by the Taliban to carry out an attack on Camp Bastion while Prince Harry was deployed in Afghanistan, a damning report says today. Complacency by senior officers meant security was inadequate, allowing heavily-armed insurgents to storm the supposedly impregnable UK base in 2012. The defence select committee was also scathing about the Ministry of Defence, accusing officials of being ‘obstructive and unhelpful’ in the face of the committee’s inquiries to establish what had happened. Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops – eight US and eight British – injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield, setting off explosions which destroyed six Harrier jump jets  and three vehicles. Prince Harry was stationed at Bastion to fly Apache attack helicopters. The committee found more than half of the guard towers were regularly unmanned despite at least 20 breaches of the perimeter fence in two years. Troops were exposed to ‘unnecessary risk’ because UK commanders, who were responsible for security, had not put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure a Taliban attack was foiled. Following a US investigation into the incident, two generals were ordered to quit. Incredibly, no-one from Britain has paid the price for the fiasco. The Mail understands at least four officers involved have been promoted. In a highly critical conclusion, the cross-party committee said: ‘We are concerned that the perimeter security and force protection measures in place at the time of the attack were inadequate. ‘Insufficient attention was given to the fundamental requirement of defending Camp Bastion from external assault. Two US Marines were killed and 16 troops injured when gunmen swarmed through the perimeter fence to assault the airfield . 'We believe this was complacent. Given that the attack took place in the British sector of the camp, British commanders must bear a degree of responsibility for these systemic failures.’ The attack on Camp Bastion, which sprawls over 20 sq miles of Helmand, southern Afghanistan, took place on September 14, 2012. At 10pm, 15 Taliban fighters wearing stolen US military uniforms crept towards the base which was ringed by a 30ft wire fence. Prince Harry (left) is shown the Apache flight-line by a member of his squadron (name not provided) at Camp Bastion . They cut through the wire and destroyed planes, vehicles and equipment. A three-hour gun battle raged involving 50 British troops, some of whom won medals for bravery. As well as the coalition casualties, 14 Taliban were killed. The surviving gunman was captured. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ‘The MoD is not complacent and always seeks to capture and learn lessons from current operations. UK commanders have identified and acted upon all lessons following the attack on Camp Bastion in 2012.’","Complacency by senior officers meant security was inadequate .

"By . Becky Barrow . The average London home ‘earned’ more than its owner last year as prices rose by nearly 18 per cent, official  figures show. A typical full-time worker in the capital earned £35,250 before tax last year – but the average home in the city increased in value by £63,000 tax-free. The Office for National Statistics figures come amid warnings that only the wealthy can afford to buy a home in London, where prices have rocketed by 17.7 per cent in a year. The average home in London increased in value by £63,000, the ONS says. The typical worker earned £35,250 before tax last year . This is the biggest percentage increase since July 2007, a month before the credit crunch began. Chris Walker, of Policy Exchange,  a think-tank favoured by David Cameron, said: ‘Buying in London is increasingly becoming the preserve of the wealthy.’ Housing charity Shelter said the ONS figures provided ‘yet more  evidence that house prices are  spiralling out of control’. Martin Beck, economic adviser to accountants Ernst & Young’s ITEM Club, said: ‘While we remain of the view that UK house prices in general are not yet seeing unsustainable growth, the London market is looking particularly frothy.’ He added: ‘The onus remains firmly on the Bank of England to ensure that the market does not enter bubble territory.’ The average home in London costs a record £458,000, and a mad rush to buy has been forcing people to put in offers far over the asking price, submit sealed bids and gazump rivals. Floating up: Average UK house prices rose 9.1 per cent in the year to February, the ONS said . By comparison, a home in the North East – the cheapest region  of England – has risen in value by just £3,000 over the last 12 months to £146,000. Across the UK, the average house price is £253,000, but that figure drops to £196,000 if London and the South East are excluded. Peter Rollings, chief executive of estate agent Marsh & Parsons, said there was ‘insatiable demand’ from both UK and overseas buyers. A home in London has become ‘an unshakeable pillar of investment’ for many foreigners, he said, with property in the city seen as a safe ‘global reserve currency’. More than a quarter of ‘prime’ homes in London are being sold to people who live abroad, analysis by estate agents Knight Frank shows. The ONS said house prices are ‘increasing strongly across most parts of the UK’, with 9.1 per cent growth over the last 12 months – the biggest annual increase for nearly four years. It represents a huge change from the worst of the recession, when house prices fell every month from July 2008 to October 2009. Widespread: Every region in the UK has seen a rise in average property values . Estate agency Haart said it was having to hold ‘open houses’ – when potential buyers all look round a home on the same day – in order to cope with ‘unprecedented demand and acute stock shortage’. Paul Smith, its chief executive, said ‘unabated demand for homes in London and the South East is spreading across the country’. He warned of a logjam caused by a shortage of properties for sale. As many as 30 clients at each branch of Haart say they would move if they could find a property to move to, he said. Last week, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors announced its members expect house prices to rise by 6 per cent a year for the next five years.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A drugs mule was arrested for smuggling £200,000 of opium into Britain after he complained the case carrying the drugs had got lost. Amir Rahnama, 43, had hidden the drugs in tubs of hair cream which he then stuffed into his suitcase before boarding a flight from Iran. But his luggage was mistakenly left behind during a stop in Dubai and he was dismayed when it failed to arrive at Manchester Airport. Amir Rahnama luggage failed to arrive at Manchester Airport after it was checked in Dubai . On arrival, he reported it missing at the missing luggage desk and filled in the necessary forms asking for it to be forwarded to the UK. It was tracked down in Dubai and flown into Manchester's Terminal One where border police and sniffer dogs detected the opium. They found 15 tubs of hair cream containing nearly 22lbs (10kg) of opium which officers estimated had a street value of £197,000. Unaware he had been rumbled, Rahnama turned up to claim his suitcase, which also bore his name, and used his passport to prove it was his. When officers swooped and arrested him, he said he had bought the opium in Tehran for £1,000 and was planning to sell it for around £9,000. When officers swooped and arrested him, he said he had bought the opium in Tehran for £1,000 and was planning to sell it for around £9,000 . Rahnama sobbed in the dock as an . interpreter told him the judge at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown . Court had sentenced him to six years in jail. The . court heard Rahnama initially told police officers he had been . smuggling the drugs to pay for cancer treatment for his sick wife. But he later changed his story and admitted he had been acting as a courier or 'drug mule' for drug bosses but didn't realise Duncan Wilcock, prosecuting, said: 'He said he knew it was illegal and he was selling it to pay for medical care for his wife in Iran. 'I'm aware the defendant has now amended his statement to say that he was asked to carry the drugs.' Robert Mann, defending, said Rahnama was of Iranian heritage and first came to the UK to claim asylum after being jailed there as a political prisoner. He held a regular job in Bolton and Wigan for a number of years and when the government in Iran changed he returned where he worked in a family business importing televisions. Mr Mann said his client had been genuinely shocked to hear the drugs were worth up to £197,000 and admitted others may not have acted so 'naively' in trying to claim the bag. The court heard Rahnama had claimed that he turned to drug trafficking when his wife got bone cancer while pregnant and he could no longer afford the costly medical treatment. Judge Mushtaq Khokhar observed that while there was no medical evidence to back up the claims, he accepted his crime was designed to raise money to help his wife. But he told Rahnama: 'Drugs always find their way into the larger community. 'They cause considerable damage in society. Those who are addicted to drugs, in order to fund their habit that can't be legitimately funded, commit crimes. If you had not been a mere courier the sentence would have been far longer.'","Amir Rahnama, 43, had hidden the drugs in tubs of hair cream .

"David Miasik, 45, a pub pest who stalked a barmaid Claire Edwards. Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates Court heard how he picked on the wrong woman, because her other job was as a policewoman . A stalker who fabricated a relationship with a barmaid at his local pub picked on the wrong woman it seems - as her other job was as a policewoman. David Miasik, of Cwmdare, near Aberdare, South Wales,  was obsessed with part-time barmaid Claire Edwards, bombarding her with 'disturbing' messages begging her to speak to him. The 45-year-old even told his family they were an item, and when they thought the 'couple' had split up, they contacted her to urge her to get back together with him. But Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' court heard that when she quit her job as a barmaid to concentrate on her career as a CID detective constable she reported him to her police bosses. Magistrates were told that she received Facebook messages from someone calling himself 'Licentious Dave'. Det Con Edwards said she looked up the meaning of licentious as 'promiscuous and unprincipled in sexual matters'. The court heard it was from Miasik telling her that he loved her - and begging her to speak to him. Prosecutor Shelly Hopkins told the court: 'She found the messages to be disturbing. 'He appeared to have a lot of information about her and her life and things of that nature. 'She was very upset at this - she felt vulnerable. 'She thought that if he knew that much information about her he could know her home address.' The court heard she only knew him as 'Dave' - a regular at the Belle View pub, in Cwmdare, South Wales  - who was 'quiet, awkward and a loner'. Mrs Hopkins said: 'She was frustrated, concerned and alarmed at his behaviour and did not know where the fixation with her came from.' Miasik was arrested for harassment after Det Con Edwards reported his behaviour to senior officers. The court heard she only knew him as 'Dave' - a regular at the Belle View pub - who was 'quiet, awkward and a loner' Miasik, of Cwmdare, near Aberdare, South Wales, was given a 12-week suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to harassment by Merthyr Tydfil magistrates .

Titan Aerospace makes unmanned aircraft that run on solar power and can remain airborne for five years at a time. Google claims the technology will provide internet access to remote corners of the world. Scroll down for video . Google has bought a company that develops military-style drones in a £36million deal . But the move has provoked privacy concerns over the internet search giant’s ability to snoop on people from great heights. The drones fly at 65,000ft – almost twice as high as passenger planes. Because the machines are solar-powered and always above the clouds they do not need to land to refuel, so the drones are able to cover up to 3million miles before needing to land for maintenance. However, critics have raised fears over the company’s newly-acquired powers of mass global surveillance. The drones, pictured, are described as 'atmospheric satellites' that could be used for surveillance, to monitor weather and communication . Titan is merely the latest addition to its growing arsenal of robotics firms, and Google is highly secretive about its technological ambitions – all of its projects are run by a closely-guarded division mysteriously called ‘Google X’. Emma Carr, deputy director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The regulation of drones is something that urgently needs addressing. 'Given Google’s track record is littered with overstepping the line and infringing people’s privacy, combining their hunger for data with drone technology is a mind-boggling proposition.’","Google has bought Titan Aerospace, which makes unmanned aircraft .

"By . John Edwards . Follow @@JEAlty . He turns 21 next Thursday, but there’s another number that has been dominating Ben Davies’s every waking moment. With the season nearing a nail-biting finale, all the Swansea left back can think of is reaching the magical 40-point mark and ensuring his home club remain in the Barclays Premier League. A couple of wins and a draw would do it and while the shortfall remains, nothing else matters. Not celebrating his landmark birthday, not wondering which club might eventually win the bidding for his services. There are plenty of contenders. Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal have all followed the Wales defender’s rapid progress closely, and Atletico Madrid are now showing strong interest. All smiles: Swansea left back Ben Davies has had a fine season and attracted interest from Atletico Madrid . Top form: Atletico Madrid currently top La Liga and will face Chelsea in the Champions League semi-finals . Davies was as sceptical as anyone at first mention of the La Liga leaders, but confirmation has since come from Madrid as well as here that Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final opponents are taken with the composed way he has seized his chance at the Liberty Stadium. It brings a brief smile to his face, but the serious business of staying up soon takes precedence for a sporting  all-rounder who had his rugby-mad dad dreaming he might be another Barry John but was snapped up by Swansea at eight years old. ‘The first I knew about Atletico was when a pal texted me the morning the story appeared,’ he said. ‘My phone beeped and there was this message saying, “Have you seen this? Atletico Madrid?!” I went online to see what it was all about. It is nice to hear something like that because it clearly means you must be doing something right. ‘It’s got to be a boost for your confidence but it’s not going to turn my head. I don’t need something like that to make me concentrate on what’s in front of me or suddenly up my game. I’m going to do that anyway, for myself and my club. I am ambitious about playing at the highest level I can but I tend to think that if you put performances in to the best of your ability, things will take care of themselves. ‘For now, all I’m thinking about is staying up. My mum wants to organise a party for my 21st but that can wait. Once we’re safe, maybe, but not before. I’ve told her to hang on for that, then we can have a proper party.’ Focused: Despite the interest from Spain, Davies is committed to keeping the Swans in the Premier League . On hold: Davies' Mum wants to organise a party for his 21st birthday but the left back says it can wait . The range of nationalities in Swansea’s dressing room has been in the news this week, with Sportsmail breaking the story that there had been training-ground punch-ups between the players. But Davies revealed how manager Garry Monk has gone about imbuing the foreign contingent with a sense of local identity. ‘One of the first things Garry did after replacing Michael Laudrup was to bring a pile of DVDs in and hand them out,’ he said. ‘It was the BBC documentary The Fall and Rise of Swansea City, and he told each and every one of us to watch it that night. ‘We chatted about it the next day and you could tell there wasn’t one person who hadn’t watched it right through. The manager wanted us all to appreciate how much Swansea City meant to people who have been through the rough times and seen the club almost go to the wall. The boss: Davies revealed manager Garry Monk has gone about imbuing the foreign contingent at Swansea . Proud of his roots: Local lad Davies says he ill be devastating if Swansea are relegated at the end of the season . ‘You wouldn’t know it now, looking at . the fantastic facilities, but even in my time coming through the ranks, . the Under 18s had to train on the beach. There was nowhere else. ‘Anyway, . it had an immediate effect because we put in a fantastic performance to . beat Cardiff in the next game. We are still in a scrap, no mistake, but . I do think we’ve shown more resilience and spirit since then. ‘We’ve . just got to stay up. I’ll be absolutely devastated if we don’t. I’m . from down the road at Neath and so proud of my Welsh roots. All my . family, right through to grandparents on both sides, speak Welsh, and so . do I. It was how I was brought up and it just seemed natural to speak . English and Welsh fluently. Even at school, junior and secondary, all . lessons were in Welsh. ‘If the club need to do an interview for the Welsh-speaking media, it’s always me. But I’m happy with that because the language seems to be dwindling and I’ll do anything I can to keep it to the fore.’ Patriotic: Davies is happy to do Welsh-speaking interviews and will do anything to stop the language dwindling . Davies was thrown in at the deep end after a serious injury to Neil Taylor but has thrived to such an extent that he has already played well over 60 games since his debut against West Ham in August 2012. Yet it could have been the oval ball that shot him to prominence. ‘My dad is rugby through and through and took me to watch Neath when I was little,’ he said. ‘I played outside half at school and we reached the Wales Cup final two years running. Three professionals came out of that team and went on to play for Ospreys, so we weren’t bad. ‘My dad grew up watching Barry John and Phil Bennett, so I think he liked the idea of me wearing the No 10 jersey. I had a decent rugby brain but I’m not sure I would have made a professional. Rugby mad: Davies' Dad used to take Ben to see Neath and grew up watching Barry John (right) ‘To be fair to Dad, he wanted me to do what I was best at and what I wanted to do, and that was football. Both my parents have been 100 per cent the biggest influence on my development. They taught me good values and are still there for me with advice and help. ‘That was so important when I was trying to make my way as a junior with Swansea. I saw so many lads come and go at the academy who were good players but got caught up in distractions like going out for a drink. I was always dedicated and focused because football was all I ever wanted to do. ‘We trained twice a week and played on a Sunday. For me, it was never a problem staying in on  Saturday night and getting to bed early. I wanted to be at my best the next morning. ‘I hope that doesn’t make me sound too boring because I’m not really. I’m off to Ibiza with a couple of mates in the summer, a real lads’ holiday. I like a beer as much as the next guy. It’s just a question of choosing the right moment, and this summer will be, if we stay up.’ Commitment: Davies says he used to stay in on a Saturday night in order to be at his best for Sunday's matches .","Swansea City defender Ben Davies is being tracked by a number of top European clubs .

"By . Laura Clark . Learning: Parents are being urged to restrict use of tablets because children are struggling with basic motor skills, teachers claim . Children are not developing the dexterity needed to write and build models because they spend too long on computer tablets, teachers warned yesterday. They also struggle to learn lines for school plays and answer pen and paper exams because they are used to calling up information instantly on their computers or smartphones. Parents are being urged to restrict use of tablets and turn off the wi-fi in their homes at night to stop their children going on the internet. Members of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers warned that growing numbers of young children are able to swipe tablet screens but lack the motor skills needed to play with building blocks. They also struggle to socialise with others or concentrate unless their focus is on computer-generated images. Delegates at ATL’s annual conference in Manchester backed calls for medical experts to help produce guidance for parents as well as teachers on avoiding excessive use of tablets. They passed a resolution warning that computer tablet ‘addiction’ was leading to poor performance at school, irritability, furtiveness and loss of interest in other activities. Colin Kinney, representing ATL’s Northern Ireland branch, said some parents were substituting the development of social skills with tablets. ‘I have spoken to a number of nursery teachers who have concerns over the increasing numbers of young pupils who can swipe a screen but have little or no manipulative skills to play with building blocks or the like, or the pupils who cannot socialise with other pupils but whose parents talk proudly of their ability to use a tablet or smartphone,’ he said. ‘Many of us have seen the brilliant computer skills of some pupils outweighed by their deteriorating skills in pen and paper exams because they rely on the instant support of the computer. ‘They are often unable to apply what they should have learned from their textbooks or class notes.’ One teacher said: 'Young pupils can swipe a screen but have little or no manipulative skills to play with building blocks'. File picture . Pupils were turning up to school exhausted because they had night much of the previous night playing computer games, he added. Their attention spans were ‘so limited they may as well not be there’. ‘We do not want to deprive our pupils of access to computer tablets but we do want to protect them from withdrawal, poor performance and loss of educational opportunities,’ he said. Mark Montgomery, a fellow Northern Ireland delegate, said children increasingly wanted to spend hours playing on tablets instead of ‘playing football outside, building models and learning through playing’. ‘During rehearsals for our school play, the producer complained that the children in lead roles had great difficulty in learning all of their lines,’ he added. Sedentary: excessive tablet and smartphone use can also cause weight gain thanks to a 'lack of movement and exercise' ‘This had not been an issue in previous years and would suggest that because information is always instantly available there is less need to learn and to retain knowledge.’ He warned that over-use of tablets was also having detrimental effects on pupils’ health, such as weight gain caused by ‘lack of movement and exercise’ as well as repetitive strain injuries and posture problems. He added: ‘I have three sons. When they were younger I would go to bed and turn off the wi-fi. Parents need to do that. Turn the wi-fi off. ‘There is the ability to restrict the amount of time they are online for, there are apps to download. ‘Children get obsessed with things and find it difficult to say no. If you take a two-year-old’s teddy away or a teenager’s X-Box they will rant and rave. But an adult will go and do something different.’ Mr Montgomery went on: ‘It is our job to make sure that the technology is being used wisely and productively and that pupils are not making backward steps and getting obsessed and exhibiting aggressive and anti-social behaviours.’ The warning follows research from Ofcom last year which found children’s access to tablets at home has more than doubled from 20 per cent in 2012 to 51 per cent. It has also been claimed that the boom in tablet ownership has led to children as young as four are being treated for ‘iPad addiction’. One girl of four reportedly became so obsessed with playing games on a tablet she was enrolled in therapy by her parents who wanted her treated for compulsive behaviour. The pre-school child, from the south east of England, became hooked on a tablet at the age of three and was using it for up to four hours a day, becoming ‘inconsolable’ when it was taken away.","Teachers say basic skills are affected by children's excessive iPad use .

He is yet to score in the cup in four brief appearances but his 19 goals in all other competitions have left Madrid fans convinced he will step up in the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo. So far this season he has delivered without Ronaldo – half of his 14 league goals have been scored when his Portuguese team-mate has not been in the side – but games in Spain don’t come much bigger than Clasico cup finals and Diario AS on Wednesday morning referred to this match as ‘the game of his life’.

Settled in: Bale has lived up to the hype since his world record transfer from Tottenham Hotspur . His worst moment of form and fitness came at the end of last year and he benefited from the Madrid obsession with Ronaldo winning the Ballon d’Or. His blip would have made far more headlines had Ronaldo not been on the brink of being crowned World Player of the Year. Bale is the first galactico spared the intense first season spotlight because it has remained on Ronald, but on Wednesday night the lights will all be on him as Real try to win the Cup for the first time since 2011. Then, it was Ronaldo who got the only goal in an extra-time 1-0 win. Bale has impressed his team-mates this season with some super-human goals. The run from the half-way line against Rayo Vallecano and the perfectly executed first time shot that he squeezed into the corner from 30 yards out against Real Sociedad. But team-mates have also remarked on how detached he remains in the dressing room. It’s a coldness born of not speaking the language; of still adapting to the club that is like no other in the world; but also of a steely determination to succeed. Bale has kept the blinkers on and his team-mates believe that will serve him well as the season heads into the home straight. Line up: Real Madrid defender Alvaro Arbeloa posted this picture of Sami Khedira, himself, chairman Florentino Perez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo . Sidelined: World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo will miss the clash with a left hamstring problem . When others have been affected by the ever-changing moods of the Bernabeu, Bale has remained completely untouched by both the abuse and the adulation. He has gained the reputation of a man moved only by his own numbers – 15 assists and 19 goals is an incredible first season return.

However, a year on and Barnet Council has received no applications for a name change.

But residents have not shown an interest in naming a street after her there . Council leader Richard Cornelius backed the idea of commemorating the nation's first female leader, but now admits a road in one of the borough's new   developments could now be named after Thatcher as an alternative. He told the Hendon and Finchley Press: 'It will come. We will find somewhere, but it may have to be on one of the new developments. 'We are just waiting for an opportunity or a sensible suggestion. 'It may well be that a road would like to volunteer to be renamed Thatcher Way. 'There must be a road full of Tories. We are looking for one to come forward.'

Two giants from American baseball, the New York Yankees and the LA Dodgers, as well as the two giants of Spanish football, Real Madrid and Barcelona, fill out the top five behind City. The top 10 also includes the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA (at No 6), Bayern Munich (No 7), and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA (No 9). The Global Sports Salaries Survey (GSSS), produced for ESPN The Magazine in the USA, has been tracking comparative pay at major sports teams for five years. City players were earning an average of just under £1.5m a year each when Sheik Mansour arrived in 2008 but their pay has more than trebled in the six years of his ownership. Chelsea have also seen their wages and . fortunes soar since Roman Abramovich arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2003 . but foreign sugar-daddy ownership is not restricted to elite European . football. Big hitters: The New York Yankees baseball team ranked second on the earners' list . Coining it in: The Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team are third on the salary list with an average annual pay of £5.1m but they moved down from second place last year . The Brooklyn Nets were bought in 2010 by one of Abramovich’s fellow Russian billionaires, Mikhail Prokhorov. Not only is Prokhorov footing the Nets’ $102m (around £61m) total payroll in 2013-14, or £4.5m per player this year, but he will need to pay an additional $70m (around £42m) or thereabouts in luxury tax for exceeding the NBA’s wage cap. On the list: Chelsea were 10th in the rankings with a £3.9m wage bill and still have a chance of winning the Premier League title this season . Wealth: Roman Abramovich has poured millions into Chelsea since he became owner in 2003 . Close call: Arsenal are just behind Chelsea in the survey. They advanced to the final of the FA Cup at the weekend, beating Wigan on penalties at Wembley . Sneaking in: Liverpool came in 20th in the salary list with an annual spend of £3.4m on wages each year. That could increase if they win their first league title in 24 years next month . Overpaid? Manchester United came in eighth in the list but have fallen short in the Premier League and Champions League this season . The GSSS looks solely at earnings for playing sport, not for endorsements or other extra-curricular activities. The 2014 report considers 294 teams in 15 leagues in 12 countries across seven different sports: football, baseball, basketball, gridiron, cricket, ice hockey and Aussie Rules football. The report looks at numbers from either current or most recently completed seasons, depending on availability of accounts and other information. The NBA is the highest-paying league as a whole, with 441 players at 30 teams in the 2013-14 season earning an average of £2.98m per year each. The Premier League is the best paying football league in the world, with the average annual pay at £2.27m per player.

"By . John Drayton . Snooker legend Stephen Hendry has left his wife of 19 years and their two sons for a children's theatre star 20 years his junior. The 46-year old walked out on his wife Mandy and is now seeing 26-year-old Lauren Thundow - who has starred in a stage production of the TV show Noddy in Toyland. Distraught Mandy, also 46, said she is 'heartbroken' over his decision to leave the family home in Perthshire, Scotland, he shared with his wife and children Blaine, 17 and Carter, nine. Family: Stephen Hendry, pictured celebrating his seventh world championship title in 1999 with his wife Many and eldest son Blaine, has walked out on his family and is now seeing a 26-year-old aspiring actress . The couple married at Muthill Parish Church in Perthshire in 1995 - 11 years after they first met at a Pontin's camp in Wales, when Hendry was just 16. Mandy confronted Hendry last summer when she became suspicious he was having an affair - they tried to save their marriage but split two months ago. Mrs Hendry said: 'Following Stephen's retirement I had been looking forward to spending more time as a family watching our boys growing up together. 'I am heart-broken that Stephen has made the decision to leave the marital home, relocate to England and pursue a new relationship with someone else. New relationship: The former world champion is now seeing 26-year-old aspiring actress Lauren Thundow . Distraught: Many admitted she is heartbroken at Stephen's decision to leave the family, and had hoped to spend more time with him since his retirement . 'This is a very difficult time for myself and my family, however my main priority is the well-being of my children, Blaine & Carter, during this period of transition. 'This is a very trying and emotional time, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation.' Hendry, born in South Queensferry, Edinburgh, is the most successful snooker player in history - earning millions over his 27 year career. The seven time World Champion met Lauren Thundow last July while working on The Snooker Legends Tour. Lauren, who also appeared in Fifi and the Flowertots, lives with her parents near Berkshire's Sandhurst military base. A friend revealed: 'She could not help falling for a married man. There is guilt there, but Stephen told her his marriage was over.' Mandy grew suspicious that Hendry was having an affair after she noticed he was withdrawing from family life. Fears: Mandy, pictured holding the World Snooker trophy, confronted Hendry about the affair last summer after he began withdrawing from family life . Pairing: Thundow is just 26 years old and had a job as an official at some snooker events . She confronted him and he confessed to seeing someone else, he has moved out of the family home in Auchterarder, Perthshire and is believed to be staying in hotels. Upon the discovery, Miss Thundow deleted her Facebook account on the recommendation of Hendry. A friend said: 'It was apparent to Mandy last July that something was wrong with Hendrys demeanour and he seemed out of sorts. Mandy badgered Stephen into eventually making some sort of partial confession that he was seeing someone else. 'The couple tried to make it work it again but it wasn't happening. Hendry and his wife, parents to Blaine, 17 and nine-year-old Carter, overcame tragedy in 2003 when she miscarried over halfway through the pregnancy. The friend added: 'You can understand how hard this has hit Mandy. 'She was a loyal and supportive wife and mother during all those long years when Stephen was travelling the world. 'So she was looking forward to his retirement from the game and the chancefor her and the boys to spend time enjoying a bit of normal family life. 'That's a pretty simple thing to expect after 30 years together. She never saw this coming and is totally devastated. Legend: Hendry, born in South Queensferry, Edinburgh, is the most successful snooker player in history - earning millions over his 27 year career . Wedding day: The pair got married in 1995 after 11 years together . 'But she is picking herself up and is quietly determined to get on with her life and focus on her boys.' Thundow, who lives in an exclusive estate in Sandhurst, played robot Whiz in the anniversary stage show of Noddy in Toyland in August 2009 . She also landed a minor role in the stage version of Fifi and the Flowertots before getting a job as an official at a series of Snooker Legend exhibition games. Before finding love with Hendry it is believed Miss Thundow worked at a Butlins family resort. Spoils: The couple pose in a Ferrari 348 Spider after his record World Championship win . A close friend of Hendry said: 'I honestly never would have guessed Stephen and Mandy would split up. 'He is not the kind of guy who had a different profile in the media to what he's like at home. He has always been a genuine bloke.' Both Hendry and Ms Thundow declined to comment. Hendry became the youngest professional snooker player aged 15, and went on to become the youngest ever World Champion at 21.","Hendry, 46, left his wife Mandy for Lauren Thundo, 20 years his junior .

Aston Villa’s internal investigation into suspended coaches Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa will be centred on allegations of bullying. Their behaviour at the club’s Bodymoor Heath training ground is believed to have led to complaints being made by staff. Culverhouse often takes over training from manager Paul Lambert and several players have grievances about his ‘aggressive’ methods. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Lambert speaking after his team's Crystal Palace loss . Suspended: Ian Culverhouse (left) and Gary Karsa have been suspended pending an investigation Aston Villa . Right back at the start: Norwich defender Culvherhouse challenges Peter Ndlovu in the Premier League's first season . Showdown: Aston Villa chief executive Paul Faulkner (right) met with Paul Lambert at the training ground . Fabian Delph is understood to have . been upset during a session in the week before the Fulham defeat, . although his absence for that 2-1 loss was down to an achilles . injury. Reports also suggest . Gabriel Agbonlahor has been left disappointed but his omission from the . Fulham team was explained by illness. Both returned to the starting . line-up for the 1-0 defeat at Selhurst Park. Despite . the club’s official statement indicating they have only been suspended, . it is understood assistant manager Culverhouse and head of footballing . operations Karsa have no future at the club. They each have a year . remaining on deals but if found guilty of serious misconduct could be . sacked without a pay-off. The . atmosphere at Villa’s training ground has been described as ‘poisonous’ and Culverhouse is said to have fallen out with other members of the . backroom team and senior players. He also exchanged angry words with . fans after the Boxing Day defeat by Palace at Villa Park. Under pressure: Lambert's Aston Villa side have lost seven out of their past 10 Premier League matches . Upset: Fabian Delph was thought to have been affected by an incident during training . Disappointed: Gabriel Agbonlahor was left out against Fulham but returned in the defeat at Palace . The defender started his career at Tottenham in 1982 but is best remembered for his time at Norwich. During nine years at Carrow Road he played 370 times for the club, including in the famous win over Bayern Munich. He is in the Norwich City Hall of Fame. He then moved on to Swindon and Brighton and after a spell youth coaching at various clubs became Paul Lambert's assistant at Colchester in 2008 before following the Scot to Norwich and then to Villa Park. Karsa . is said to have had a turbulent relationship with members of staff at . Villa, too and the pair were suspended by chief executive Paul Faulkner . after Lambert decided the make-up of his coaching team was no longer fit . for purpose. Training this week has been described as having ‘the best atmosphere in ages’ in the duo’s absence. Previously, . some players were said to be confused by an insistence on long-ball . tactics during sessions, while the schedule has been regularly fairly . light. The first team were given both Sunday and Monday off after defeats by Fulham and Crystal Palace. A full staff meeting planned for Thursday should allow for complaints to be aired publicly. Lambert . took the astonishing step of ending his six-year association with . trusted aide Culverhouse on Tuesday after a complete breakdown in the . pair’s relationship. Lots to think about: Villa lost their fourth Premier League game on the spin at Crystal Palace on Saturday . Gary Karsa did not have a very distinguised playing career and his first coaching job came at Enfield in 1998, where he was football and community officer. He then moved to Barnet (where he joined up with Ian Culverhouse) but his big break came when he became head of youth at Wycombe in 2006 under Paul Lambert. He followed Lambert to Colchester, where he became football operations manager, and was part of the team that moved to Norwich and then Aston Villa. Sportsmail . understands the move by Lambert came after a heated exchange in the . dressing room following Saturday’s defeat at Palace. Lambert’s . working relationship with Culverhouse is said to have deteriorated so . much that the pair have hardly spoken in recent weeks, causing . disruption to Villa’s preparation for games. Many . Villa fans have been vocal in their desire to see the manager gone too, . with chants of ‘We want Lambert out’ aired loudly during the loss at . Selhurst Park on Saturday. But the Scot’s position is understood to be . secure and he retains the backing of owner Randy Lerner. However . talks on a new three-year contract have been put on hold until the end . of the season. His current deal expires at the end of next season. Lambert . and Culverhouse first joined forces at Colchester in 2008, before . leaving for Norwich City in 2009 and steering the Canaries into the top . flight. Their success persuaded Villa owner Lerner to appoint them after . sacking Alex McLeish in 2012. Walking into trrouble? Fans have turned on Lambert, increasing the chances he could be leaving . Villa . have promoted former player and crowd favourite Gordon Cowans, 55, and . goalkeeper Shay Given, 37, to assist Lambert while the club carry out . their investigation. It is . quite some turnaround for Given, who has been left out of matchday . squads and admitted in February that ‘Aston Villa want me out of the . door.’ The Republic of Ireland keeper has been taking his . coaching badges and is respected by players. The . club hope the change in key staff will raise morale and ensure a . positive result from the important match against Southampton at Villa Park on . Saturday. Lambert said: . ‘I’m delighted to have Gordon and Shay to assist me in preparing the . team for Saturday (against Southampton), which is what the whole group . is focused on.’ Can we be of any assistance? Gordon Cowans (left) and Shay Given will help Lambert . The . breakdown in relations between Lambert and Culverhouse has coincided . with a dreadful run for the club that has seen them slip closer to the . relegation zone. Villa have picked up just seven points from a possible 30 and are currently on a run of four defeats. European . Cup winner Cowans said: ‘The manager has asked me to step up to assist . him at this time and I’ll do my utmost for the club and the manager in . helping prepare the team for Saturday’s game.’ Given added: ‘As players, it’s important that each and every one of us take responsibility right now and I’m delighted to play my part in helping the manager and the team go and try to win on Saturday.’","Aston Villa have suspended assistant manager Ian Culverhouse and head of footballing operations Gary Karsa, pending an internal investigation .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A young bride managed her first dance at her wedding despite being struck down with a paralysing spinal injury which doctors told her was incurable. Kirsty Brutnell, 24, had been with her partner Adam, 28, for just three months when she woke one morning completely unable to use her legs. Doctors diagnosed her with incurable syringomyelia - a condition which involves cysts growing on the spinal cord. Brave: Kirsty Brutnell managed her first dance at her wedding despite being struck down with a paralysing spinal injury which doctors told her was incurable . Shock: Miss Brutnell, 24, had been with her partner Adam, 28, for just three months when she woke one morning completely unable to use her legs . In Mrs Brutnell’s case, the cysts were growing perilously close to her brain stem, ruling out the possibility of surgery to remove them. Mrs Brutnell, a former mental health nurse of Sturminster Newton, Dorset, said: 'I worried about what the diagnosis meant for me and Adam. 'We hadn’t been together for that long and I thought, ""he hasn’t signed up for this"". 'I actually told him to leave me, even though I loved him. But he was having none of it.' Mrs Brutnell met Adam, a carpenter, through online dating in 2011 and says it was love at first sight. She said: 'Internet dating brought me the man of my dreams. I moved away from West Moors in East Dorset to Parracombe in North Devon where he lived to start a new life together. It was a bit of a whirlwind.' Condition: Doctors diagnosed Mrs Brutnell with incurable syringomyelia - a condition which involves cysts growing on the spinal cord . But then in April 2011, just two weeks after she relocated, she started to experience unsettling weakness in her lower body. She said: 'I collapsed at home. It was completely unexpected - it was as if my leg couldn’t hold me up anymore. I thought I was just tired, and hoped a night in bed would sort me out.' But when she woke the next morning, she couldn’t feel anything below her hips at all. An ambulance rushed her to North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple where doctors diagnosed syringomyelia. Syringomyelia sees a tube-shape cavity form and fill with liquid in the spinal cord. Complications can be far reaching, including problems with pain, numbness, weakness, stiffness, control of bladder or bowel function, and paralysis. Problem: In Mrs Brutnell's case, the cysts were growing perilously close to her brain stem, ruling out the possibility of surgery to remove them . Syringomyelia is a disorder in which a cyst forms within the spinal cord. This cyst, called a syrinx, expands and elongates over time, destroying a portion of the spinal cord from its centre and expanding outward. As a syrinx widens, it compresses and injures nerve fibres that carry information from the brain to the extremities. Damage to the spinal cord often leads to progressive weakness in the arms and legs, stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms, or legs, and chronic, severe pain. Other symptoms may include headaches, a loss of the ability to feel extremes of hot or cold (especially in the hands), and loss of bladder and other functions. Source: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . Cavities can get larger over time, exerting increased pressure, making symptoms worse. However the damage can be halted and sometimes repaired with surgery. But surgery was judged far too risky in Mrs Brutnell’s case because the cyst was so close to her brain-stem. She said: 'The doctors said although I could have physiotherapy to help me move again, I had a long road ahead, and if the cysts got any bigger, my paralysis could be permanent. 'I thought it wasn’t fair on Adam to expect him to be my carer. We’d had loads of plans and it seemed we’d have to give them all up. 'I told him to find someone else who he could live he dreams with and I promised I would understand. 'When he came back to the hospital the next day, I knew he was devoted.' Over the following months Mrs Brutnell . learned to use an electric wheelchair and was able to train herself to . walk short distances on crutches. In September 2013, the couple married. Mrs Brutnell defied . the expectations of doctors by managing to walk down the aisle, holding . onto the arm of her grandfather, Brian, and enjoy her first dance. Joy: Mrs Brutnell defied the expectations of doctors by managing to walk down the aisle and enjoy her first dance . She said: 'Adam and I danced to Tim McGraw and Faith Hill’s song ""It’s Your Love"". For one day I could forget about all our troubles. 'I wanted to do something special for Adam. I built up my strength beforehand to make sure I had the energy to do it. 'Despite all our challenges, I feel lucky. If I’m ever having a down day I can remember our wedding day, and know that I’ll have Adam with me, no matter what.'","Kirsty Brutnell, 24, was diagnosed her with incurable syringomyelia .

"By . Mark Prigg . NASA’s top human exploration chief has revealed to a Senate panel plans for a manned mission Mars in the 2030s are on track. Development of key components of the deep-space rocket, capsule and infrastructure needed to reach Mars are already underway - and today Nasa was given the go-ahead for a mission to land on an asteroid as part of a 'stepping stone' to Mars. A House subcommittee approved an authorization bill that would allow Nasa to redirect an asteroid into the moon’s orbit, land astronauts there and use the asteroid as a testing outpost and way station on the way to Mars. Nasa  Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier told members of a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation subcommittee that the agency remains on target to send a man to Mars in the 2030s . There will be two versions of the SLS rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million poundsand carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. The agency will now have to spell out the cost and details of the mission as part of an exploration 'roadmap' to Mars that Nasa will have to submit to Congress. The approval came as associate Nasa  Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier told members of a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation subcommittee that the agency remains on target to launch an uncrewed mission in 2017 to test the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle that will carry astronauts to Mars. Avionics testing of solid rocket boosters was completed this week at Kennedy Space Center in preparation for a test of the SLS rocket later this year, and acoustic testing is also underway. 'There is real hardware in manufacture for the path to Mars,' Gerstenmaier told senators. 'Our architecture is designed for long-term human exploration of our solar system, including the goal of human missions to Mars.' The hearing, called 'From Here to Mars,' outlined intermediate space missions being planned as steps toward long-duration space travel. 'With the technologies and techniques we develop, we will enable expeditions to multiple destinations, ultimately allowing us to pioneer Mars and other destinations as we lay the  groundwork for permanent human settlements in the solar system,' Gerstenmaier  said. NASA would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft - to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. Exact details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known, but the most recent rendering rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag. The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object. Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loops around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. One planned mission is to a near-Earth asteroid, Gerstenmaier said. 'NASA will employ SLS and Orion for an early human exploration mission to perform pioneering human operations further from the Earth than ever before, rendezvousing with and returning samples from an asteroid redirected to at stable orbit around the Moon by the robotic segment of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM),' he explained. 'We're going to grab a piece of the solar system, we're going to deflect it around the moon and insert it into a distant retrograde orbit around the moon where our crews can go visit,"" he said. 'To think we're moving a piece of the solar system for our use that will allow us to learn skills and techniques that we need to push the human presence into the solar system, that's a pretty awe-inspiring statement.' However, the ambitious Mars mission could be delayed or derailed if funding from a budget-conscious Congress continues to erode, or if other countries’ plans for a lunar mission force the U.S. to change course for security reasons. How it compares: The SLS system  is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the moon in its final configuration .","Deep space rocket already being built .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . When you see a group of women in pretty dresses, you might not immediately think of engineering. But one award-winning engineer has taken part in a modelling campaign to convince women that it is possible to shape skylines and take charge of construction sites, while still being feminine. Roma Agrawal is wearing a floral outfit in Marks and Spencer’s new 'Leading Ladies' campaign alongside famous actresses and pop stars in a bid to change the image of engineering, which she believes is in need of a serious makeover. Scroll down for video . Famous Faces: Engineer Roma Agrawal (second from left) wears a floral outfit in Marks and Spencer's new campaign alongside actresses and pop stars in a bid to change the image of engineering, which she believes is in need of a serious makeover. L-R: Rachel Khoo, Roma Agrawal, Alex Wek, Rita Ora and Lulu Kennedy . The 30-year-old structural engineer has designed bridges, skyscrapers and sculptures with signature architects and spent six years working on The Shard – the tallest building in Western Europe that has radically altered the London skyline. Ms Agrawal, an Associate at consultancy WSP in London started work on the massive skyscraper in 2006 and spent two years preparing the site before the tower could be built. ‘I worked on the foundation design and the spire. We used top-down construction, which means digging downwards and building up at the same time,’ she told MailOnline. ‘The “core” or spine of the building has never been built that way before, but it saves time and helped us get the building up quickly.’ The spire is Ms Agrawal’s favourite part of The Shard, as all the details including every nut and bolt is on show. On top of the world: Ms Agrawal, an Associate at consultancy WSP Group in London (pictured third from the left) started work on The Shard in 2006 and worked on its foundations and spire, which can be seen mid-way through its construction here . ‘You can tell who the engineers are [up the skyscraper] as they are looking up at The Shard and not at the view,’ she said. Ms Agrawal was sad when the massive construction was completed in November 2012 but is now working on an entirely different  project – the refurbishment of a Georgian town house – as well as a residential development in east London that ‘is technically very demanding’ as it is over a railway line. ‘There’s lots of wasted land around railway lines so it’s good to provide housing near them,’ she mused. However it is her role in Marks and Spencer’s latest advertising campaign that is Ms Agrawal’s very latest pursuit. The campaign was shot by photographer Annie Leibovitz and its cast includes Rita Ora, Annie Lennox and Emma Thompson. While Ms Agrawal describes her inclusion in the advert as ‘surreal’ she believes it is ‘an amazing way to showcase engineering to a new audience, especially women’. High gloss tea: Ms Agrawal describes her inclusion in M&S' 'Leading Ladies' advert (pictured) as 'surreal' but she believes it is 'an amazing way to showcase engineering to a new audience, especially women'. She is pictured (second from the right) alongside celebrities such as Rita Ora (second left) Of course floral skirts are sometimes just not practical on a construction site,  but she believes the campaign shows ‘that the profession can be for women who are feminine and into fashion.’ ‘Engineering has an image problem. We need a re-brand of what engineers can look like.' Currently less than 10 per cent of engineers are women, but the situation is improving. The graduate intake at Ms Agrawal’s workplace, WSP group is 30 per cent female. The only way is up: Ms Agrawal (pictured left) thinks that The Shard (right) will not be the last radical change to the capital's skyline as she thinks more high rise residential blocks are needed to provide homes for Londoners. The Shard boasts 30 acres of space on a one acre plot . ‘My pet peeve is construction toys for boys and cupcake and cleaning toys for girls. I’d love to take those images away and we have to keep talking about the benefits of careers in science and engineering in schools,’ she said. As well as trying to persuade more girls to pursue a career in engineering, Ms Agrawal is passionate about London’s housing. She said: ‘The London skyline will change. We need good, well designed skyscrapers to resolve the housing crisis. We can’t have people commuting for hours every day to get to work so we must build good quality, well designed residential housing blocks. ‘And one big positive is they’ll be great views for residents.'","Roma Agrawal stars in the 'Leading Ladies' campaign alongside Rita Ora, Emma Thompson and other famous females .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother-of-one has a painful condition which she says makes her legs look like tree trunks. Cara Jones, 39, has lipoedema – a common but poorly understood condition which causes pain and swelling in the legs. It is often mistaken for obesity as it is caused by abnormal accumulations of fat, or confused with lymphoedema, which has similar symptoms. Cara Jones, 39, has a condition called lipoedema which causes fat to accumulate in her legs . Ms Jones says the condition makes her legs look like tree trunks and that people often think she is obese . As Ms Jones’ condition is incurable, she is encouraging other women with the condition not to suffer in silence. She says lipoedema causes constant, gnawing pains in her legs and arms. And, during her teenage years she was plagued by anxiety about her weight, leading to a prolonged battle with eating disorders. She is now preparing to travel to Germany where she will spend more than £15,000 on a course of private treatment which she hopes will ease her symptoms. She is a co-founder of a dedicated UK lipoedema support group, which has a network of hundreds of British sufferers. She said: ‘I've been aware that I've been different since I was a teenager because my legs were larger. I developed anorexia and bulimia and exercised obsessively because I thought I could shrink my legs. Ms Jones (pictured with son, Alfie) developed the condition when she was a teenager but her legs only became painful when she was pregnant. Since the pregnancy, the pain has continued . Ms Jones says that when she was at school she was bullied because of the size of her legs. At the time, she did not know she had lipoedema so she dieted to try and reduce the size of her legs. Image shows her ankle . ‘When I was 21 my weight fell to just over six stone. I was a size zero on top but a size six on the bottom. I was always worried about fitting my legs into trousers. ‘Today I feel guilty about not being able to be as active as I would like to be with my son because of the pain.’ Lipoedema is the abnormal build-up of fat cells in the legs, thighs and buttocks. It causes the legs to become enlarged from the hips to the ankles but the feet are unaffected. The fat often creates a ring of fatty tissue overlapping the top the feet. The skin often feels cold and bruises easily. It can be very painful and can cause pain in the knees. Lipoedema occurs almost exclusively in women and tends to start during puberty or pregnancy. The accumulation of fat tends to be worse in people who are obese but also affects people who are a healthy weight and dieting does not help. The cause of the condition in unknown but there is often a family history in patients. The only treatment known to work is called tumescent liposuction but this is not available on the NHS. It involves numbing the legs before removing the excess fat. This treatment has been shown to be highly effective and has good long-term results. Source: NHS Choices . At school Ms Jones, a former radio presenter, was taunted by bullies who made fun of the size of her legs. She . said: ‘Walking to school, I was called “tree trunk legs”. I had to give . up dancing because I just couldn't fit into the leggings. ‘I remember my grandmother telling me to get out of her kitchen because I was too fat. It's a shame that the negative comments stick with you, rather than the positive. ‘I just wanted to be like everyone else. I wanted to wear skinny jeans.’ When she became pregnant with Alfie, now three, her son with her partner Ben Smith, 32, she started to experience painful sensations which continue to this day. She said: ‘I became two weeks overdue with Alfie and had been experiencing noticeable pain for a few weeks - a grinding pain, like toothache - in my legs. ‘I experienced terrible bruising. Sometimes I was left looking like a leopard, because I was covered in patches of bruises.’ After several months of GP appointments, Ms Jones was finally diagnosed with lipoedema in April 2011. She said: ‘It was a bitter-sweet experience, being diagnosed. Up to that point, the only advice I'd ever been given was “eat less, exercise more”, which had made absolutely no difference. ‘I was relieved to know what it was, but it was a blow to be told that it was incurable.’ Today, Ms Jones is registered disabled and manages her pain with a pneumatic compression pump and practices simple lymphatic drainage massage at home. She regularly attends a pain clinic near her home in Wrexham, North Wales. When Ms Jones (pictured with her son, Alfie) was a teenager, she became so anxious about her weight that she developed anorexia and bulimia . Ms Jones uses a pneumatic compression pump on her legs (pictured) in a bid to reduce the pain and swelling. She also practices simple lymphatic drainage massage at home . She said: ‘Lipoedema is often mixed-up with lymphoedema which gets a lot more attention because it's more closely associated with cancer. Although millions of women have lipoedema, it's not often talked about. ‘It's passed on genetically. My mother has it, although fortunately she doesn't suffer with pain. ‘I feel sad not to be able to play with Alfie as much. Sometimes I have to cut playtime short and sit him in front of the TV and wait for the pain to subside. ‘I always wanted more children, but I don't think my body will be able to cope with the stress of falling pregnant again, so I don't think it's likely. I feel quite guilty about that.’ Ms Jones (pictured in her early 20s when she had been on a strict diet to try and reduce the size of her legs) is now going to pay £15,000 to have treatment in Germany . When Ms Jones was a child (pictured) she had to give up dancing because of her lipoedema . This autumn, Ms Jones will travel to . Germany for three courses of tumescent liposuction which will remove the . fatty build-up in three stages. Such treatment is not available on the NHS, so she will pay the £15,000 bill to cover the expense herself. She said: ‘I hope the surgery will make a big difference. After I had Alfie I decided that enough was enough. Ms Jones knows her condition is incurable so she now wants to encourage other sufferers to talk about the condition rather than to suffer in silence. Pictures show the swelling in her legs . ‘I am an administrator on a private Facebook page for sufferers which has 400 members and I helped to launch an organisation, Talk Lipodemia which runs a busy forum, which is a good resource for people looking for answers and support. We are currently going through the process of gaining official charity status. ‘For me and for millions of other people, it's more than a matter of simply not being able to fit into skinny jeans. It's a lifelong problem.’ For more information, visit www.talklipoedema.org .","Cara Jones has lipoedema, which causes pain and swelling in her legs .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . Step aside Gwyneth Paltrow, there's a new healthy-eating beauty in town as Britain's sexiest female vegan has been named as Jenna McGuinness. The 24-year-old from Glasgow has won the unusual title after beating competition from around the country to win the contest, organised by animal rights charity PETA. Model Jenna admits it was the film Babe that inspired her to change her eating habits when she was just five-years-old. Victory: Jenna McGuinness has been named the sexiest female vegan of 2014 . Ditched meat and dairy aged five: The 24-year-old was compelled to become a vegan after watching the film Babe . After becoming enamored with the screen pig, she ditched meat, milk and eggs and encouraged her family do to the same. So how did her mother react to her rejecting such foods at such a young age? 'My mum found it easy changing . all of our diets, as she grew up next to a slaughterhouse so didn't . feel comfortable eating meat anyway,' Jenna explains. 'To be honest I think it's weird that people still eat meat at all. There are so many choices out there.' Health benefits: Jenna said being vegan has given her good skin, thicker hair and a slim figure . She added: 'I'm happy with a bowl of mango, . strawberries and figs, but if I want comfort food, I go with salt and . chilli tofu and broccoli stir-fried with garlic.' Blonde Jenna said she entered the competition to prove that vegans are 'normal' but never expected to win. She said: 'I know people have certain ideas about vegans so I hope this competition shows that we are just normal people. I don't actually think I'm that sexy but I thought I'd give it a go. I just can't believe I actually won.' The association of chartered certified accountants employee credits her veganism for her good looks. Sexiest male: Gareth Lloyd took the men's title following a public vote . Compassionate: The former soldier is now a wildlife artist . She said: 'It's mostly ethical reasons I'm a vegan but the health benefits alone would make me stay on this diet. I have much more energy, my skin has improved, my hair is thicker and I've lost weight - although that wasn't really an aim for me.' Meanwhile, the title of sexiest vegan male was awarded to former soldier Gareth Lloyd, 27, who turned vegan after witnessing suffering in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now a wildlife artist, Gareth, from Oxford, posts about animal rights issues on social media. He said: 'Seeing the violence humans inflict upon each other is yet another reason I've chosen to live as peacefully as I can by being vegan. 'The sheer number of animals suffering for our stomachs is far greater than any other cause I've supported, and as such, I feel it deserves the most urgent attention. What could be sexier than a man who puts compassion first?' Competition: Sophia Attwood-Clarke, 23, from Loughborough was a finalist . Better luck next time: Byron Higgins, 29, from Colchester, gunned for extra votes with the cunning use of a cute baby prop . The winner were chosen by a public vote after PETA whittled down the entrants to eight finalists (four men and four women). The . two winners will each receive a night for two and lunch at the Lancrigg . Vegetarian Country House Hotel in Grasmere, Cumbria, plus a vegan . dinner for two at Cumbria's Zeffirellis restaurant. PETA . UK Associate Director Mimi Bekhechi said: 'On average, vegans are . healthier and have more energy than meat-eaters do - and that makes them . sexier, too. 'Congratulations . to our two winners. But in our book, all the entrants are winners. They . are enjoying all the health benefits of vegan food while living . compassionately every day.' The other female entrants were Sophia Attwood-Clarke, 23, from Loughborough, who describes herself as, 'a cat lady, artist, adventurer and soldier in the karma army'. Animal lovers: Lisa-Marie Williams, 24, from Dundee, left, and Kate Laycy, . 33, from Manchester were also in the running for the title . Male runners-ups: Seth Taggart, 40, from Brighton, left, and Matthew Oakes, 26, from Staffordshire . In the Mancunian corner, Kate Laycy, . 33, currently working in London as an actress said: 'I'm an animal . loving, green tea obsessed, bikram gal - and a vegan forever!' Whilst their Dundee Rival, Lisa-Marie Williams, 24, hopes and believes that one day all animals will be treated as equals. For . the men, Gareth took the crown against rivals Byron Higgins, 29, from . Colchester; Seth Taggart, 40, from Brighton; and Matthew Oakes, 26, from . Staffordshire - all proud vegans and animal rights advocates. According to PETA, vegansim is on the up. 'We've had a huge increase in entries this year and there's definitely been more interest in veganism in the UK,' said PETA spokesperson Ben Williamson. 'Bill Clinton, Jared Leto and Al Gore are all vegan, as well as other celebrities, which may have an influence.' 'And this year the first vegan supermarket, currently a success in Germany, will be opening in the UK too.' 'There . are not only ethical but environmental benefits too. The livestock . sector is the highest contributor to greenhouse gases -- even more than . the transport industry. 'So organisations like the U.N. are now encouraging a shift towards veganism.'","Jenna McGuinness, 24, from Glasgow won female title .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Scientists may have found a way to banish flu, after developing a drug that saw mice unaffected by lethal doses of the virus. The drug blocks a molecule called PGE2, and saw mice survive a dose of H1N1 – also known as swine flu - after administration. This could see development of a pill to beat flu in humans, an illness which kills thousands every year. Soon just a memory?: The new discovery means that science is one step closer to developing a pill against flu . It is hoped that the drug which blocked PGE2 in mice could also block the molecule in the human body. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to 49,000 people die from flu-related illnesses every year. In 2009 alone, up to 575,000 people died from swine flu (H1N1). Emerging strains continually threaten to spread to humans and cause even deadlier pandemics. The new finding published in the journal Immunity paves the way for an urgently needed therapy that is highly effective against flu and maybe other viral infections. ‘Drugs that specifically target PGE2 . pathways have already been developed and tested in animals, so our . results have excellent potential for clinical translation, not only for . the treatment of influenza, but other viral respiratory infections that . interact with similar host immune pathways,’ author of study Dr Maziar . Divangahi, of McGill University, Montreal, said. Mice genetically engineered to lack the . PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) molecule were more resistant to flu infections . than others and the vast majority survived after being injected with a . deadly dose of H1N1. Scientists in Montreal, Canada found that by blocking a molecule called PGE2, mice survived lethal doses of H1N1, also known as swine flu . Similarly, mice treated with a compound that blocks PGE2 showed enhanced antiviral immunity and produced better survival rates following infection with the lethal shot compared with untreated animals. In spite of the worldwide use of vaccination and other antiviral interventions, flu remains a persistent threat to human health. By inhibiting a molecule called COX (cyclooxygenase), ibuprofen and other NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs) lower the production of the five prostanoids such as PGE2, immune molecules that contribute to pain and fever. Francois Coulombe, a PhD student in Dr Divangahi’s lab who led the study, said: 'But since these drugs inhibit all prostanoids, each may contribute differently towards the immunity against influenza virus. Understanding their individual role is crucial in developing a new therapy.'","Scientists found that blocking molecule builds resistance against flu .
Mice which had PGE2 blocked were likely to survive deadly dose of H1N1 .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Coffee lovers who want to get the best flavour from their favourite brew should gulp the drink down rather than sip it. Scientists say taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly. They looked at ‘sip volume’ when drinking coffee and found larger sips have a ‘higher aroma release’. Scientists say taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly . The researchers said: ‘The findings could be useful to understand the factors which contribute to attract consumers to the pleasant aroma of coffee.’ However, the advice goes against that for other drinks, such as wine, where people are advised to take small amounts in their mouth to get the maximum flavour and aroma. The researchers from the University of Naples said it was well known that smell and taste are related and that one can have a significant impact on the other. Scientists at the University of Naples in Italy found that different coffee brewing technique appeared to affect aroma release and that the bigger the sip taken, the more fragrance was released . This study, published in the journal Food Research International, studied different sipping amounts and the impact they had on the smell of coffee. It was found that different coffee brewing technique appeared to affect aroma release and that the bigger the sip taken, the more fragrance was released. The researchers said the varying levels of aroma from different size sips or gulps could be explained by the amount of saliva in drinkers’ mouths. They tested four different types of coffee brews - American, Neopolitan, moka and espresso. Espresso coffee - the one type of coffee usually sipped - was identified as giving off the most aroma when bigger rather than smaller sips were taken. Earlier this year, a separate study found that coffee doesn’t just perk you up – but just one mug a day can give your memory a boost too. Researchers at the University of California found that a 200mg caffeine pill – equivalent to a strong mug – taken soon after a learning session improved image recall. The caffeine-induced improvement was not seen with smaller doses of caffeine or when it was given an hour before viewing the images. Smoking spoils the taste of a cup of coffee – even after quitting, according to recent research. The strong, bitter taste of caffeine is usually easily detected, even in tiny amounts – but not for those who light up. It seems their ability to taste is harmed by the toxic chemicals found in tobacco. To find out whether taste is still affected even after people stop smoking, scientists tested how well 451 volunteers could recognise the four basic flavours of sweet, sour, bitter and salty, as well as the intensity of each taste. The study, published in the journal Chemosensory Perception, found that whether the volunteers smoked or not did not affect whether they could recognise salty, sweet or sour tastes – but it did have an effect on the bitter taste of caffeine. One in five smokers and one in four ex-smokers could not correctly recognise the taste. However, a mere 13 per cent of non-smokers failed the taste test. Researchers believe the build-up of tobacco in the body could stop taste buds renewing themselves and so harm a person’s ability to recognise certain tastes, even after they have stopped smoking.","Italian scientists have found that large slurps had a 'higher aroma release’

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Many animals can communicate effectively with one another but humans are unique in our ability to acquire language. Scientists have long questioned how we are able to do this and now a new study suggests that the sound patterns of human languages are the product of an innate biological instinct – much like birdsong. The U.S. research says that babies are born with the basic fundamental knowledge of language, which sheds light on the whether nature or nurture is responsible for speech in humans. Born to talk: New research says that babies are born with the basic fundamental knowledge of language, which sheds light on the whether nature or nurture is responsible for speech in humans . While languages differ from each other in many ways, certain aspects appear to be shared across them and these aspects might stem from linguistic principles that are active in all human brains, according to the study. ‘The results suggest that, the sound patterns of human languages are the product of an inborn biological instinct, very much like birdsong,’ said Professor Iris Berent of Northeastern University in Boston, who co-authored the study with a research team from the International School of Advanced Studies in Italy. Newborns reacted differently to the 'good' and 'bad' types of words in a similar way to adults, the study found . Many languages have similar sound-combinations that occur at the beginning of words, such as ‘bl’, while few languages have words that start with ‘lb’. Linguists have suggested that such patterns occur because human brains are biased to favour syllables such as ‘bla’ over ‘lba’ and past research has shown that adult speakers display such preferences, even if their native language has no words resembling either bla or lba. To understand where this knowledge comes from and whether it is a universal linguistic principle or the sum of experience, the team looked carefully at how young babies perceive different types of words. They used a silent and non-invasive technique called near-infrared spectroscopy to examine how the oxygenation of the brain cortex – the very first centimetres of grey matter just below the scalp – changes in time, to look at the brain reactions of newborn babies who listened to ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sounds such as ‘blif’ and ‘lbif’. The scientists saw that the newborns reacted differently to the two types of words in a similar way to adults. Young infants have not learned any words yet and do not even babble, yet they still share a sense of how words should sound with adults. The researchers believe that this finding shows that we are born with the basic, foundational knowledge about the sound pattern of human languages. The study was published in the journal PNAS. People who can switch between two languages seamlessly have a higher level of mental flexibility than monolinguals, a recent study suggests. Researchers believe bilingualism strengthens the brain's executive functions, such as its working memory and ability to multitask and problem solve. The psychologists think that as fluent bilinguals seem to use both languages at all times but rarely use words unintentionally, they have control of both languages simultaneously. Judith Kroll, professor of psychology, linguistics and women's studies at Penn State University, said: 'Not only is bilingualism not bad for you, it may be really good. 'When you're switching languages all the time it strengthens your mental muscle and your executive function becomes enhanced.' The study, published in Frontiers in Psychology, found fluent bilinguals have both languages 'active' at the same time, whether they are consciously using them or not. Pointing to bilingual people's ability to rarely say a word in the unintended language, the researchers believe they have the ability to control both languages to select the one they want to use without consciously thinking about it.","Certain aspects appear to be shared across languages and might stem from linguistic principles that are active in all human brains, study claims .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . There’s nothing worse than getting a headless pint of beer at the pub. No one wants to be forced to consume a beverage that’s best served with a head of foam. But one company has the solution – they’ve crafted a device that will artificially give your beer the topping it needs for the ultimate refreshment. The Sonic Foamer can give your beer a head at the touch of a button . Called the Sonic Foamer, the device uses ultrasonic waves to create a head on any beer. It uses six AA batteries which, according to manufacturer ThinkGeek’s website, can provide you with ‘3,000 foams.’ They promise their beer rescuer, available for $34.99 (£20.89; €25.37), ‘will not flatten the beer.’ It is believed man first learned to make a basic gruel from barley. Then natural yeast, perhaps supplied by insects, would have fermented the gruel and created a basic type of beer. Beer was actually easier to make than bread. After discovering this, humans would have started cultivating grain, settling to tend the crop. When a button is pressed, vibrations are produced at the bottom of the device. This creates waves that evenly open up the beer as they travel through it. The uniform bubbles then create a head of foam when they reach the surface. This also releases the beer's aromas. But ThinkGeek warn you should ‘remember to leave room for the head or you’ll be mopping.’ Nonetheless, beer lovers everywhere will surely delight at being able to enjoy their drink as intended whenever they want. Before and after: ThinkGeek say one set of batteries can provide 3,000 foams .","ThinkGeek's Sonic Foamer can create a head on any beer .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A British woman is locked in a deadly Catch 22 situation as she is the only person in the world with two rare terminal conditions - and treating one means the other would kill her. Jo Smith, 36, has a unique combination of diseases and doctors say the odds of suffering both is over five billion to one. She needs a heart and lung transplant to have any hope of beating the blood vessel disorder pulmonary hypertension (PH). Catch-22: Jo Smith suffers from pulmonary hypertension and lymphatic cancer. She is thought to be the first person in the world to suffer from these two different rare terminal diseases . But doctors say she can't be put on a waiting list for the lifesaving organs - because she is also  suffering from cancer. Similarly, the radiotherapy that could cure her lymphatic cancer cannot be performed because her weakened lungs and heart would likely fail. Ms Smith said: 'I've always been quite a positive person. I've never let it impact on my life. But it's becoming impossible now - it's starting to effect everything I do. 'It's devastating, but I have to deal with it. I have my little son to take care of. He takes my mind off things. 'I've only recently told him, I've had to tell him so he understands why I can't run after him. Rare: Ms Smith with her friend Sarah. Doctors say the odds of suffering both conditions is over five billion to one . 'He tries to care for me, he's so . sweet. He'll come and give me a little pat on the back and stroke my . hair and asks me when I'll get better.' With two serious illnesses, she says her only hope is a new form of immunotherapy treatment only available in Thailand. Ms . Smith hopes the pioneering therapy can cure her cancer and stop the . advancement of the pulmonary hypertension without leaving her . three-year-old son Rudey without a mother. But with both conditions simultaneously attacking her body, her family and friends have challenged themselves to raise the £30,000 she needs for treatment in just 30 days. Ms Smith, of Exeter, Devon, first noticed she was becoming tired and and drained of energy six months after giving birth to Rudey in October 2010. Hope: Ms Smith says her only hope is a new form of immunotherapy treatment available only in Thailand . She went to her GP complaining that she was suffering stabbing chest pains and was too exhausted to change nappies, walk up stairs or make the bed. She was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, an incurable degenerative disease caused by increased blood pressure that narrows or destroys the pulmonary arteries. In severe cases, it damages the right side of the heart, making it increasingly difficult to pump blood and oxygen, eventually leading to heart failure. Ms Smith was told not to have another child because the stress of pregnancy would likely kill her and the baby. But worse news was to follow in 2011 when a routine scan revealed a huge tumour beside her kidneys. To her horror, she was diagnosed a cancer of the lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that fights infection in the body. Cancer specialists wanted to prescribe her immediate radiotherapy - but the specialists treating her  for pulmonary hypertension vetoed the gruelling treatment because it could kill her. Instead, she was offered an operation to have the tumour removed by surgeons at London's Hammersmith Hospital, a operation which she was given a 50/50 chance of survival. After agonising for a year, she had surgery. But without radiotherapy, she cannot halt the progress of smaller cancers circulating her lymphatic system. Ms Smith said: 'The doctors weren't expecting this, and I wasn't expecting to hear this. We hoped the operation would at least have had some sort of positive impact. 'But if anything, the impact of such a massive operation made it worse. I didn't want to take any more risks, the operation was enough of a risk. 'If it was just me, I may have felt differently, but I'm a mum, I couldn't compromise my survival.' A heart and lung transplant could treat her pulmonary hypertension but that would not be sanctioned by the NHS because she has cancer and would likely die. Plight: Ms Smith's friends have challenged themselves to raise the £30,000 she needs for treatment in just 30 days . She would also have to be cancer-free for five years to qualify for donor organs. Instead, she will seek out the expertise of doctors at the 'The Better Being Hospital' in Bangkok who specialise in alternative 'functional' medicine. Their experts combat chronic illnesses though a combination of conventional medicine as well as nutrition, diet, exercise, supplements and detoxification programs. Ms Smith's treatment would take 45 days with an added 20 days of home therapy. Her best friend Sarah Lacey is teaming up with the singer Adam Isaac, a former quarter-finalist on BBC's The Voice, to put on a music festival called Breathe Fest to raise the funds. Breathe Fest is taking place at in Exeter on Friday, July 11, and Saturday, July 12.

"Jellyfish are thriving as ocean temperatures and acidity levels rise. And while this might sound like good news, gluts of the slimy creatures near coastlines can clog nuclear power plants and sting swimmers, damaging the tourism industry. To combat the problem and create something useful at the same time, a start-up in Israel is making an absorbent material from dead jellyfish called Hydromash. Clever solution: To solve the problem of blooms of jellyfish littering beaches and blocking pipes, a start-up in Israel is making an absorbent material from dead jellyfish that could be used to make nappies and napkins . Hydromash is a new material made from jellyfish that could be used to create absorbent products like napkins and nappies. It claims to be dry, flexible and strong as well as more absorbent than most types of paper towels. Hydromash can hold several times its weight in water and unlike polymers used in nappies at the moment, is fully biodegradable. The material can break down in just 30 days. It is so absorbent because of the structure of jellyfish's bodies, which can absorb and hold high volumes of liquid without disintegrating or dissolving. The material was developed by researchers at Tel Aviv University. The company claims that the ‘dry, flexible, strong material’ is more absorbent than most types of paper towels and could be made into napkins, napkins and medical sponges, The Times of Israel reported. Hydromash can hold several times its weight in water and unlike polymers used in nappies at the moment, are fully biodegradable, breaking down in around one month. The material is so absorbent because of the structure of the jellyfish’s bodies. Ofer Du-Nour, president of Cine’al – the company behind the invention - explained: ‘Jellyfish are marine creatures composed of 90 per cent water and that live in water. Helping clean up: The president of the company behind the jellyfish material believes it could clean up landfills (pictured) and oceans at the same time. If Hydromash is used in nappies alone, the potential environmental benefits could be huge as the materials used in them are not biodegradable . ‘Their bodies are formed from material that can absorb high volume of liquids and hold them without disintegrating or dissolving.’ The product is based on research by Tel Aviv University, where scientists set out to find a biodegradable material as absorbent as synthetic materials such as super absorbing polymers (SAP). Once they had identified jellyfish bodies as a suitable material, the researchers used nano materials - which have special properties because of their size - to convert the jellyfish into Hydromash that can absorb large volumes liquid in seconds. They added nano particles, which means the material can be engineered to be antibacterial, extra flexible, colourful or even scented. Mr Du-Nour said that Hydromash is safe and could clean up landfills and oceans at the same time. If Hydromash is used in nappies alone, the potential environmental benefits could be huge, as a single baby is thought to get though 155lbs (70kg) of nappies in its first year alone, which are made of synthetic materials that are not biodegradable. A useless pest? Jellyfish (pictured) have littered Israeli beaches and coastlines of other countries in recent years, with millions of the gelatinous creatures shooting poison into the water, which prevents locals and tourists swimming . Mr Du-Nour said: ‘There are too many jellyfish in the sea, and too many Pampers in landfills. Cine'al may have the ultimate answer to both those issues.’ He is not concerned about people being put off by the origin of the new material because he thinks consumers take little notice of the constitution of many products with ingredients that come from animals and plants. Jellyfish have littered Israeli beaches and coastlines of other countries in recent years, with millions of the gelatinous creatures shooting poison into the water, which prevents locals and tourists swimming. They are often viewed as dangerous pests with only a handful of species being eaten in the Far East, while a chemical called mucin can be extracted from jellyfish and used in drug delivery systems.","Research at Tel Aviv University has led to the development of the material, which unlike synthetic absorbent materials, is biodegradable .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It’s the place to update friends about your day, share pictures and catch up on the gossip. But in the future, Facebook users could use the site to make electronic payments and save money too. The social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval to offer financial services - including electronic money and remittances - which would, for example, allow foreign workers to easily transfer money back to their families. Not just for status updates? In the future you could also use Facebook to make electronic payments and stash money. The social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Ireland to become an emoney institution . Facebook is seeking regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Ireland, which, if it is granted, would allow people to store money on the social network, transfer it to other users and pay for goods, according to a report by The Financial Times. If . the social network does become an emoney institution, people in Europe . could use the social network as a bank account of kind - to store . virtual money. They could pay for goods and services using emoney. The services could offer remittances, which would let foreign workers securely transfer money to their home country. If . Facebook offers the service to developing markets in the future, it . could hook in millions of new users and make plenty of extra money in . advertising. The service . could prove attractive in areas where accessing and saving money . securely is not as simple as nipping to a local bank. The Central Bank of Ireland told MailOnline 'it is not commenting on the issue at the moment', and Facebook said it does not comment on rumour or speculation. If Facebook becomes an e-money institution, it could issue units of monetary value, stored on its site, against its own worth and this emoney could be used by people throughout Europe. The social network is also rumoured to have approached three London startups – TransferWise, Moni Technologies and Azimo - that already offer international money transfer via smartphone apps. While UK users may be wary of the security implications of storing money on Facebook, a move into remittances would help Facebook gain an even stronger foothold in emerging markets including India and Africa. While Facebook has not commented on the rumours a source, said to be familiar with the details, told The Financial Times: ‘Facebook wants to become a utility in the developing world and remittances are a gateway drug to financial inclusion.’ If those in developing nations flock to Facebook, the company would boost its advertising revenues, and e-money services could become a big attraction - it would be particularly useful to users in areas without easy access to banks. Elizabeth Cobbett, lecturer in International Political Economy at the University of East Anglia (UEA), told MailOnline: 'The materiality of banking and finance is changing rapidly and this change is most visible in emerging markets where they do not have the infrastructure in place. So it is a clean slate for new technology. 'This is clearly evident in Africa. Facebook wants in on the game and the huge potential market.'She explained that there are two-and-a-half billion 'unbanked' adults across the globe and so the potential market is huge. Recent research undertaken by McKinsey found that internet use in Africa is on a par with Brazil and China and therefore emoney 'is not a crazy idea' in emerging economies. Dr Cobbett said: 'Customer branch banking is not only rapidly changing in industrialised economies but is no longer a viable option for the expansion of retail banking and financial services in African countries of large unbanked populations. 'The challenge for bankers and credit providers is to think how financial services can expand without the characteristic physical attributes of bricks-and-mortar branch banks. 'Challenges such as varying levels of literacy, great distances, the widespread absence of formal financial services and infrastructure, lack of official identification documentation, as well as the mobility of populations, make the future of banking in Africa reliant on information technology and digital technology. She added: 'Technology is having a bigger impact in developing world than in the west.' An alternative to cash machines: The service could allow people to store money on Facebook, transfer it to other users and pay for goods . The social network announced last week that it now has more than 100million users in India, making it the company's largest source of users after the U.S.. Facebook is not the only internet giant dipping its toe into banking, however. China’s Tencent and Alibaba are . turning their sites into mobile payment platforms in order to offer . consumers an alternative to using their credit cards. Google is also ramping up its mobile payments and wallet services, which has yet to be widely adopted by consumers. If Facebook is authorised to have a similar arm to its business, it would need to hold €350,000 (£289,687) of capital and separate the same amount of money it issues. It is already allowed to offer some forms of money transfer in the U.S. – but only for developers who charge users for in-app products. The service is already lucrative for Facebook, which made $2.1billion worth of transactions from gaming apps in 2013, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company takes a fee of 30 per cent for the payments, which make up around 10 per cent of its revenues.

"By . Ruth Styles . For June Thomson, 53, from Buckhaven in Fife, May is always the hardest month. For, on a sunny Spring day in 2008, two of her children were brutally murdered by her violent ex-husband. Michelle Thomson, a disabled 25-year-old who needed round-the-clock care was stabbed 12 times while her little brother Ryan, just seven years old, was injured 14 times. Now, almost six years later, Mrs Thomson says she will never get over their deaths and still feels guilty that she wasn't there to protect them. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: June Thomson, 53, says she feels guilty every day for being unable to save her two children . Worse, she says, is living with the knowledge that her killer former spouse could one day be released from prison after being handed a life sentence with a minimum tariff of just 17 years. 'The sentence was disgusting - that made . me sick to my stomach,' she says. 'How can you put a value on a child’s life, eight . and a half years for a child, for two children who couldn't defend themselves and had their whole life in front of them. 'That is disgusting, . the law is absurd.' Mrs Thomson, who has two other sons, one of whom is estranged, first met Robert Thomson, known to his family as Rab, when she was just 17 years old. Despite his previous convictions for violence and a controlling personality, she fell in love and in 1981, the couple were married. Gone: June's disabled daughter Michelle, 25, had defensive wounds and was stabbed 12 times . Heartbreaking: Ryan Thomson, 7, was murdered while playing computer games in his bedroom . Rab swiftly moved to cut off contact with June's friends and family and less than a year later, she was pregnant with daughter Michelle. 'When we first got married I never really . got to see any of my friends, and I never got to see my family,' she remembers. 'We . moved, he moved me up to Fife, and my sister did phone one day, because . she’d been trying to get in contact with me, and he picked up the phone, . told my sister not to contact me again and never to phone this number, . so I had lost all family contacts as well.' His violent temper, never far from the surface, resurfaced during her pregnancy and when Michelle was born with severe learning difficulties, he was furious. Worse, as their family expanded, Rab began to turn his fists on the children - eldest son Shaun in particular. 'He’d batter me black and blue,' remembers Shaun. 'If I got caught smoking at school, he would take a belt and batter me with . the buckle, I was just covered in bruises. 'I think he, like, enjoyed the power of it, . being the one in control.  He made you scared of him.' June too suffered regular beatings, frequently in front of the children who were powerless to help their mother. It took another attack on Shaun for her to pluck up the courage to leave. 'It was one thing being violent to me, but it was a different thing being violent to my kids, so I just got the kids and I left,' she remembers. But when she allowed Rab access to the three children, he spirited the family away to the Republic of Ireland, where he threatened to remain unless June came home. Happier times: Although Rab was violent, the early years of June's marriage were relatively happy . 'He said if I wanted to see the . kids again I would need to promise to come back to him, so I did, . because I knew if I didn't do that then he would have stayed in . Southern Ireland and it might have took me years and years to get my . kids back, and I couldn't cope with that.' Back with Rab, June soon became pregnant for a fourth time, giving birth to her youngest son Ryan at the age of 41. 'When I found out I was pregnant with . Ryan I was so shocked at first, but then I was happy,' she remembers. 'Everybody just . adored him [when he was born], and Michelle just couldn't keep her hands off of him; she loved him and she was so motherly towards him.' 'My wee brother was everything to me,' adds Shaun. 'Me and my wee bro went everywhere . together, we just had a really strong bond, and we were just always . together.' Despite her happiness, her relationship with the increasingly violent Rab continued to deteriorate and by the time Ryan was seven, it was damaged beyond repair. Loved: Michelle and Ryan, the baby of the family, were much loved by their mother and two brothers . Evil: Rab is taken away in handcuffs from an Edinburgh court after being found guilty of murder . When Rab threatened to send Michelle to a care home, June had had enough and began divorce proceedings. A few days before a custody hearing on the 2nd May 2008, Rab arrived, angry and swearing, at June's new home. 'He came, and he’d said to me, 'What you gonna do when you’re all alone and you’ve no got any kids there?  You’ll just be all alone on your own"" and I just laughed at him. I just assumed he was talking about him getting custody.' When the hearing arrived, June was given full custody of the children but agreed to allow Rab access visits. That night, he phoned his eldest son Shaun, by then living in Essex. 'He’d said to Shaun that he wanted him to . come up so that he could talk some sense into me,' remembers June, . 'Shaun just told him, ""My mum’s never going . back to you"" and that he was a monster and he hated him and . he wanted nothing ever to do with him.' 'My dad was sneaky,' adds Shaun, 'and I knew that I would be his first target. Out of everybody I would have been his first.' The very next day, June agreed to let Rab have Michelle and Ryan for the afternoon. When she dropped them off at his home on 3rd May 2008 at 3.30pm, it would turn out to be the last time she would see them alive. 'The last words I said to Ryan was ""Right, okey-dokey, I’ll be back to pick you up just shortly"", she remembers. 'And . I went back a couple of hours later, just expecting to pick them up. Instead I found their dead bodies. 'Ryan was lying on the bed and his . mouth was open, and his lips were blue, and I knew he was dead. I went through to Michelle’s bed and Michelle . was dead, lying in her bed, and her eyes were open and her mouth was . open and the whole room was just a bloodbath.' Ryan, the first child to die, had been stabbed 14 times as he sat playing on a computer game. His sister Michelle had been attacked 12 times and had defensive wounds all over her arms. Scene: Forensic teams and police officers surround the Buckhaven home where Michelle and Ryan died . Guilt: June, seen here leaving court, says she will always feel guilty about what happened . 'That’s the bit that tortures me more . than anything,' adds June. 'Knowing, you know, that he was killing them and they’d . be wanting their mum there, and I wasn't there to protect . them. 'That’s the bit that tortures me all the . time, that will never stop torturing me. Because I wasn't there to . protect them.' Shockingly, their killer father showed no remorse, even, according to the police constable who arrested him, attempting to control the police interview that followed. 'When Thomson came into our custody he . was very matter of fact,' reveals DI Graham Fenton who worked on the case. 'He showed no remorse and he never asked for his children once.' And although Rab was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 17 years at his trial, for his murdered children's mother and older brother, the nightmare continues. 'I just never, ever can describe the pain at that moment when . I saw Ryan’s body,' adds June.  'I can . never, ever describe that pain, it was absolutely . horrendous. 'I can never, ever forgive him [Rab] for what he’s done, for taking the children’s lives. Why . didn’t he just take mine and let them live?  I never, ever can forgive . him for that. Never.' 'I . was destroyed,' adds Shaun. 'Everything was wrecked, everything. I’ve lost a family; . the only one I’ve really got left is my mum. That’s about it.' 'I still feel guilty, that guilt will . never leave me,' reveals June. 'I don’t think there will ever be a time when I won't feel . guilty for not being there when they really needed me to protect them. It’s like a living nightmare.' June and Shaun appear on Britain's Darkest Taboos, Sunday 13 April at 9pm on CI (Sky 553, Virgin 237 and BT 433)","Michelle, 25, and Ryan, 7, were stabbed to death by their violent father, Rab .

Speaking about her enviable wardrobe, the star told the fashion site: 'I’m crazily organised with my wardrobe. Everything is hung in categories: dresses, jackets, shirts, skirts and . trousers are all hung in order, and they’re then hung in colour order . too so that when I’m looking for something I know exactly where it is.' Scroll down for video . Welcome to my world: Daisy Lowe, 25, has invited fashion fans into her Primrose Hill home and treats us to a sneak peek into her designer wardrobe . Daisy, who cites Wednesday Addams, Bettie Page and Kate Hudson as her style icons, describes her seasonal must-haves as a Christopher Kane suit and a few Richard Nicoll pieces. 'There were a lot of great pastel coats this season as well,' she adds. Speaking about a piece she always wanted but never managed to get her hands on, Daisy pays tribute to late designer L’Wren Scott. 'I have a version of her dress in pink but I’d love it in black. It has a little white collar and just holds you in all the right places. Fashionable face: Model Daisy, who hangs out with Nick Grimshaw, even got her pet dog involved in the photoshoot for Vestiaire Collective . Glamorous: Daisy cites Wednesday Adams, Betty Page and Kate Hudson as her style icons . 'The way she cut her clothes just makes you feel so womanly. Nicole Kidman has worn it too.' The 25-year-old cites the three things she 'absolutely' couldn't live without as a vintage Chanel necklace that she wears almost every day, a pair of black combat boots and a Saint Laurent leather jacket, which 'I don’t have yet but I’m definitely going to get!'. Daisy, who garners inspiration from old photos of Katherine Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot, credits Rodial Glamoxy Snake Serum, Crème de la Mer eye cream and 'a plethora of masks once a week' for giving her that rosy glow. Homemaker: Daisy, who is currently preparing to release her own cookbook, says she is extremely organised and has separate sections in her wardrobe for each item .

Domestic goddess: Model Daisy Lowe has penned a cookbook in which she shares her favourite healthy sweet treats . Speaking about the £15 . book, which will hit shelves in July, Daisy said: 'This is the result of . my journey to discover the craft of baking guilt-free delicious treats. 'I wanted to create a collection of recipes that ensure you can enjoy sweet things without harming your body. 'I love food and I have the sweetest tooth but I have to look after my body doing what I do for a living, I started collecting lots of wheat-free, dairy-free and refined sugar free recipes to make for whenever I wanted to treat myself. I wanted to share them with the world because I wanted other people to enjoy sweet treats guilt-free. Daisy explains that limiting sugar has had a huge impact on her life. 'My sugar intake affects everything, my energy levels, my skin, my mood...I love, love, love sugar but I have to limit my intake and find alternatives to satisfy my sweet tooth,' she said.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Landing on Mars is no easy business. In the past small vehicles could land using airbags and regular parachutes. But bigger vehicles require much more innovative ways of making it to the surface, leading Nasa to design a new breed of parachute. Scroll down for video . The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator is a giant parachute being developed by Nasa that could one day be used to land humans on the red planet . The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) is one of the largest parachutes ever built. The reason for its size is to deal with the atmosphere on Mars. Earth has a reasonably thick atmosphere, so we can parachute relatively easily to the surface. But the Martian atmosphere is much thinner, so parachutes need to be much larger in order to create sufficient drag to land safely. The system is designed to land large vehicles on the surface of Mars. The Curiosity rover, for example, needed an innovative landing method due to its size but this technology wasn’t ready yet. Instead, to land the rover on the surface Nasa developed a landing mechanism that used rockets known as the ‘sky crane’. The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) is the successor to the Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD-R), pictured, another Nasa-designed parachute . Nasa has already been testing the strength of the LDSD using rocket sleds. The tests in June will be the first to drop it from the upper reaches of the atmosphere . The LDSD, however, is an alternative way to reach the surface that will be able to land things that are bigger than Curiosity, such as equipment for a manned mission or humans themselves. The LDSD is unique in its design, using a donut-shaped inflatable decelerator to create atmospheric drag. When . attached to the exterior of a capsule travelling at Mach 3.5 it will . be capable of slowing it down to Mach 2, where a regular parachute can . then deploy. To simulate the Martian atmosphere on Earth, the LDSD will be lifted to a height of 37 kilometres (23 miles) by a high-altitude balloon. A small rocket will then launch it 18 kilometres (11 miles) higher. As this point the LDSD will inflate around a larger saucer-shaped object, bringing it safely back to land in open water. ‘It may seem obvious, but the difference between landing and crashing is stopping,’ Allen Chen, a Mars landing expert at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California told New Scientist. ‘We really only have two options for stopping at Mars: rockets and aerodynamic drag.’ There will be four tests of the LDSD in total before mission managers decide whether to employ it on future Mars missions. The tests are taking place over the Hawaiian island of Kauai in June. ‘Personally I think it’s a game-changer,’ Robert Braun at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta said. ‘You could take a mass to the surface equal to something like 1 to 10 Curiosities. ‘Think about it like a bridge for humans to Mars. ‘This is the next step in a sequence of technologies that would need to be developed.’","The Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator is a giant parachute .

"By . Louise Eccles . Amanda Knox has claimed she is ‘proud’ of a string of one-night stands she had as a student and admitted that marijuana was her ‘vice’. In her autobiography out tomorrow, Knox reveals that cannabis was ‘as common as pasta’ at the Italian apartment she shared with murdered  British student Meredith Kercher. Miss Kercher, 21, who was living in Perugia as an exchange student, was found in her bedroom, semi-naked and with her throat cut, in 2007. Scroll down for video . Amanda Knox spoke with ABC News' Diane Sawyer in New York. She has now revealed that she is 'proud' of having a string of one night stands and smoking marijuana at university . Knox, 25, and her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, spent four years in jail until their convictions for Miss Kercher’s murder were overturned in 2011. They are now facing a retrial after Italy’s highest appeals court quashed their acquittals last month.In Waiting To Be Heard, Knox recalls a life of drug use and casual sex as she travelled around Italy en-route to Perugia. Her first one-night stand was with a man called Cristiano, whom she met on a train in Florence.She wrote: ‘We shared a joint, and then, high and giggly, we went to his hotel room. ‘I’d just turned 20. This was my first one-night stand. ‘I’d told friends I couldn’t see myself sleeping with some random guy. But Cristiano was a game-changer.’ Two weeks after arriving in Perugia from her home in the US she had sex with an Italian named Mirko, who invited her back to his house for pizza. She says she later discussed this with her housemate Miss Kercher, a Leeds University student from Coulsdon, Surrey. Knox and Rafaele Sollecito (left) are accused of killing British student Meredeth Kercher (right) Knox wrote: ‘I was proud of myself for having a no-strings-attached consensual encounter but I felt awkward and out of place. I didn’t yet know if I’d regret it. ‘Later I told Meredith about the sex and feeling “like an idiot”. ‘“Amanda”, she said, consolingly, “Maybe uninvolved sex just isn’t for you”.’ Knox later slept with ‘Bobby from Rome’, before meeting Sollecito a few weeks later at a classical music concert. She says she found him ‘nerdy and adorable’ and recalled how, before they had sex for the first time, she told him that making faces made her laugh. She wrote: ‘We made faces until we collided in a kiss. Then we had sex. It felt totally natural.’ Knox was reportedly paid £2.5million by HarperCollins for the autobiography, which goes on sale tomorrow in the US, Canada and Australia. The book will not be sold in the UK, reportedly because of  ‘libel fears’ surrounding the retrial and separate defamation cases in Italy against Knox and her parents. Outside the murder scene: Knox says she was at Sollecito's apartment on the night of the murder, and was not in her Perugia home when Meredith was killed . Amanda Knox and then boyfriend Sollecito spent four years in jail until their convictions for Ms Kercher's death were overturned . In extracts published by the Sun newspaper, Knox describes how she and Sollecito bonded over their mutual love of cannabis. Soon after meeting, Knox asked him: ‘Do you like marijuana?’, to which he said, ‘It’s my vice’. ‘It’s my vice, too’, she replied.  Knox, who was in Perugia for the third year of an Italian, German and creative writing degree, said: ‘Around our house marijuana was as common as pasta. We all chipped in. It was purely social.’ Knox also describes how she became suicidal locked up in a women’s prison outside Perugia. She wrote: ‘I imagined myself as a corpse. It made me feel sick, not relieved, but it was a fantasy I had many times – terrible, desperate recurring thoughts that I never shared with a soul.’ She also recalled the sexual advances made by her cellmate Cera, who had the ‘tall, lean looks of a model’. She said: ‘One morning I was walking into the bathroom to put something away, I bumped into Cera and she kissed me on the lips.’ Following their release from prison, Sollecito moved to Switzerland while Knox returned to Seattle to finish her degree at the University of Washington. She has been in a relationship with classical guitar student James Terrano, 25, for 18 months. Knox cannot be compelled by Italian law to appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at all. A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence for Miss Kercher’s murder.","Amanda Knox said she is proud of her one-night stands and marijuana use .

"By . Chris Parsons . An 11-year-old Syrian boy has described in heart-wrenching detail how he had to cover his clothes in his brother's blood to save his own life as killers slaughtered his entire family. Ali el-Sayed witnessed his parents and all four of his siblings killed by Syrian gunmen during last weekend's horrific massacres, which he only survived himself by playing dead. The youngest to die was Ali's brother, 6-year-old Nader. His small body bore two bullet holes - one in his head, another in his back. Tragic: Ali el-Sayed, pictured here in an interview on Wednesday, had to play dead to avoid being executed by Syrian gunmen who killed his family . The 11-year-old boy told how he covered himself in his brother's blood to fool the gunmen and make them think he was also dead . Ali miraculously survived by covering himself in his brother's blood and lying motionless on the floor as shaven-headed killers, said to be working for the Syrian government, executed his parents and four siblings one by one. Ali is one of the few survivors of a weekend massacre in Houla, a collection of poor farming villages and olive groves in Syria's central Homs province. More than 100 people were killed, many of them women and children who were shot or stabbed in their houses. In an interview with the Associated Press on Wednesday, five days after becoming an orphan and an only child, Ali said: 'I put my brother's blood all over me and acted like I was dead.' Ali said his mother began weeping the moment about 11 gunmen entered the family home in the middle of the night. The men led Ali's father and oldest brother outside. 'My mother started screaming 'Why did you take them? Why did you take them?'' Ali said. Soon afterward, he said, the gunmen killed Ali's entire family. Brutal: . In further bloodshed, UN observers found the 13 bodies of Syrian army . defectors lying on the ground near Deir el-Zour, in Syria after being . killed by Assad's forces . The killings brought immediate, worldwide condemnation of President Bashar Assad, who has unleashed a violent crackdown on an uprising that began in March 2011. Activists say as many as 13,000 people have been killed since the revolt began. Ali's ordeal emerged today as the bodies of 13 more people were discovered bound and shot in eastern Syria. Syrian activists claimed that the victims were army defectors killed by President Bashar Assad's forces, although it has not been possible to verify their accounts. In response, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that every day of slaughter in Syria is strengthening the case for tougher international action. U.N. investigators and witnesses blame at least some of the Houla killings on shadowy gunmen known as shabiha who operate on behalf of Assad's government. Execution: The men are believed to be defectors from the Syrian army who were caught and killed . As Ali huddled with his youngest siblings, a man in civilian clothes took Ali's mother to the bedroom and shot her five times in the head and neck. 'Then he left the bedroom. He used his flashlight to see in front of him,' Ali said. 'When he saw my sister Rasha, he shot her in the head while she was in the hallway.' Ali had been hiding near his brothers Nader, 6, and Aden, 8. The gunmen shot both of them, killing them instantly. He then fired at Ali but missed. 'I was terrified,' Ali said, speaking from Houla, where relatives have taken him in. 'My whole body was trembling.' Recruited from the ranks of Assad's Alawite religious community, the militiamen enable the government to distance itself from direct responsibility for the execution-style killings, torture and revenge attacks that have become hallmarks of the shabiha. Terrible aftermath: A heartbreaking image of children said to have been killed in Houla by Assad's thugs . Horror: The UN counted 49 children and 34 women among the dead. Activists from the Houla area said the army pounded the villages with artillery and clashed with local rebels after protests Friday . In many ways, the shabiha are more terrifying than the army and security forces, whose tactics include shelling residential neighborhoods and firing on protesters. The swaggering gunmen are deployed specifically to brutalize and intimidate Assad's opponents. Activists who helped collect the dead in the aftermath of the Houla massacre described dismembered bodies in the streets, and row upon row of corpses shrouded in blankets. 'When we arrived on the scene we started seeing the scale of the massacre,' said Ahmad al-Qassem, a 35-year-old activist. 'I saw a kid with his brains spilling out, another child who was no more than 1 year old who was stabbed in the head. The smell of death was overpowering.' The regime denies any responsibility for the Houla killings, blaming them on terrorists. And even if the shabiha are responsible for the killings, there is no clear evidence that the regime directly ordered the massacre in a country spiraling toward civil war. This citizen journalism image provided by Shaam News Network taken Saturday, May 26, 2012 purports to show shrouded dead bodies following a Syrian government assault on Houla, Syria . Anger: Britain and France have condemned the attack on children and pointed the fingers at Syrian troops . As witness accounts begin to leak out, it remains to be seen what, exactly, prompted the massacre. Although the Syrian uprising has been among the deadliest of the Arab Spring, the killings in Houla stand out for their sheer brutality and ruthlessness. According to the U.N., which is investigating the attack, most of the victims were shot at close range, as were Ali's parents and siblings. The attackers appeared to be targeting the most vulnerable people, such as children and the elderly, to terrorize the population. This type of massacre - even more than the shelling and mortar attacks that have become daily occurrences in the uprising - is a sign of a new level of violence. By most accounts, the gunmen descended on Houla from an arc of nearby villages, making the deaths all the more horrifying because the victims could have known their attackers. UN probe: Bodies pictured piled up in Syria, as released by the opposition's Shaam News Network . According to activists in the area, the massacre came after the army pounded the villages with artillery and clashed with local rebels following anti-regime protests. Several demonstrators were killed, and the rebels were forced to withdraw. The pro-regime gunmen later stormed in, doing the bulk of the killing. Syrian activist Maysara Hilaoui said he was at home when the massacre in Houla began. He said there were two waves of violence, one starting at 5 p.m. Friday and a second at 4 a.m. Saturday. 'The shabiha took advantage of the withdrawal of rebel fighters,' he said. 'They started entering homes and killing the young as well as the old.'","Ali el-Sayed played dead to avoid being executed by gunman who slaughtered his family .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman began to scream hysterically on an American Airlines flight bound for Tampa screaming 'God your my saviour!' In a video posted to YouTube, the woman who was traveling from Miami to Tampa repeatedly screamed over and over leaving passengers around her deeply unsettled. As she shouts,'God, you’re my savior! God, you’re my savior!' she flips through a magazine with one hand and taps restlessly on her cellphone with the other. Scroll down for video . Seeking salvation: The blonde woman in this YouTube video had an epic meltdown as the man in the black hat tried to calm her down . As she repeated the phrase, the woman began contorting and shaking in her seat . The man who shot the video says the woman began her rant about 20 minutes after takeoff. Initially she asked people sitting nearby to pray for her because her mother who had recently died - then the yelling began. Although . flight attendants didn't restrain the woman, they did ask passengers to . intervene if she headed towards the back of the plane and attempt to . open the doors. Get me out of here: The woman in the aisle seat can't get off the plane fast enough . The video, uploaded  to YouTube last October, has had well over 690,000 views, and shows the woman going . crazy as the plane lands in Tampa. Shot . by Reed Stanley, the video shows the man sitting next to the hysterical . woman trying to calm her down. His failure to calm her elicits an . exasperated shrug of the shoulders. ‘She’s . been freaking out for the last 20 minutes,’ Mr Stanley explains over . the shouting woman. ‘She started off by telling everyone to pray for her . mother who just passed away. ‘She . went up and down the aisles telling everyone to pray for her mother,’ Mr Stanley further explains as the woman’s tirade shows no signs of . slowing down. ‘ . 'The flight attendant has asked me that if she tries to head to the back door of the plane, I'm to block her.'

The man’s efforts to calm the woman finally incense her, as she points and yells ‘don’t f**king touch me’ at him before repeating her mantra and apologizing to God for cursing. She then goes right back into repeating ‘God you’re my savior and fast and loud as she can. Clearly distraught: The crazed woman asked passengers to pray for her recently deceased mother before launching into her repetitious rant . Eventually, she appears to run out of steam, finally quieting down, Mr Stanley explains the flight attendant asked him to make sure the woman doesn’t make a run for the plane’s door. ‘If she tries to go back, we’re going to block her,’ Mr Stanley said as the woman’s meltdown caught a second wind. Though not as loud and fast as before, the mantra is repeated over and over. It is not clear what the woman’s ultimate fate was, she has not been publicly identified. Then, like a voice from the heavens, an automated message advised passengers to ‘remain in their seats’ until the aircraft arrived at its gate.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . Even the most verbose of Germans are unlikely to be sorry to see the back of this tongue-twister. The country's longest word - Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz - has officially ceased to exist. The compound noun, which stretches to 63 letters, is the name of a law relating to the testing of beef. Tongue-twister: The 63-letter word, which refers to the law regulating the testing of beef, has been dropped from the German language . A regional parliament repealed the word, meaning the 'law for the delegation of monitoring beef labelling', after the EU lifted a recommendation to carry out BSE tests on healthy cattle, the Telegraph reported. Germany is notorious for lengthy compound nouns, many of which are gradually whittled down to abbreviations when they become impractically extensive. Germans simply add extra concepts to existing words, meaning that, in theory, a word could become never-ending. Linguistics expert Professor Anatol Stefanowitsch, from the Free University of Berlin, told German news agency dpa the word was the longest 'authentic' word in the German language. It is recognised by linguists because it crops up in official texts, although it was never an entry in the German dictionary, which includes words based on their frequency of use. At 36 letters, Kraftfahrzeug-Haftpflichtversicherung - motor vehicle liability insurance -  is thought to be the longest German word with an entry in the dictionary. The Oxford Dictionary of English can top that; pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis - which describes 'an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling a very fine ash and sand dust' - has 45 letters.

"By . Richard Spillett . Police in Nigeria say the bombing of a bus station in the country's capital, Abuja, has killed 71 people and wounded at least 124. Witnesses described a horrific blood-strewn scene after a huge blast in the busy bus terminal about 10 miles from the city centre destroyed 16 coaches and 24 minibuses this morning. Islamist militant group Boko Haram are suspected of carrying out what is the first attack in the Nigerian capital for two years. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Rescue workers collect the bodies of victims after a blast rocked a bus station in Abuja, Nigeria this morning . The bomb went off when the bus station, roughly 10 miles from the capital, was crowded with workers starting their morning commute . Mimi Daniels, who works in Abuja, said: 'I was waiting to get on a bus when I heard a deafening explosion then saw smoke. People were running around in panic.' Another witness, Kingsley Ajimobi, added: 'More than two buses carrying workers were cut up by the blast. I saw many people in the bus dead, and many were injured.' Civil servant Ben Nwachukw said: 'I can't count the number of people that died. They took them in open vehicles. People were running and there was confusion.' The blast ripped a four-foot deep hole in the ground and destroyed more than 30 vehicles, causing secondary explosions as fuel tanks went up in smoke. Victims families and witnesses were left devastated after the attack, the first in Nigeria's capital for two years . Bodies had to be piled onto the backs of trucks as emergency services struggled to deal with the number of casualties . Witnesses stand around victims of the explosion. The number of dead has been estimated at 71 but the death toll could still rise . There was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion is likely to fall on Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which has waged an increasingly bloody insurgency in the country's North East. Suspected militants killed at least 60 people in an attack on a village late last week and eight people were killed in another recent attack at a teacher training college. Visiting the scene, President Goodluck Jonathan denounced 'the activities of those who are trying to move our country backwards'. 'We will get over it... The issue of Boko Haram is temporary' he said, and called on Nigerians to be more vigilant in the face of terrorist activity. Boko Haram, which means 'Western education is sinful', is modelled on the Taliban movement in Afghanistan and has forged ties with al-Qaeda. The group want to carve an Islamic state out of Nigeria and have concentrated their onslaught in the North East in the past year. The last time terrorists struck in Abuja was in April 2012, when suicide bombers targeted the offices of newspaper This Day. Police look through the debris after officials confirmed 71 had been killed in the explosion and around 124 injured . Witnesses said the explosion sparked scenes of chaos in the busy bus station, with two buses hit directly by the blast and waiting passengers showered in debris .","The blast ripped through the crowded bus station in Abuja this morning, with witness describing scenes of carnage .

"By . Katy Winter . A fashion staple of the Eighties, the jumpsuit has made a mega comeback onto the catwalks and red carpets of late. Teaming comfort and practicality with all manner of fashion possibilities from demure cover up to structural statement, the jumpsuit trend seems set to stay. It may hark back to the days of David Bowie and even Elvis, but celebrities have been embracing the jumpsuit in a big way during the award season ... to varying degrees of success. Jumpsuit super fan Miley wore another all-in-one number to the Billboard Music Awards featuring cut out lace panels . Kate Moss stepped out in London wearing a grey jumpsuit on Thursday channeling workman chic . Solange Knowles stood out from the crowd when she stepped out in a startling white jumpsuit that boasted ruffled and spherical detailing around the neckline and arms . The recent Billboard Music Awards saw celebrities embracing the trend in many different styles: Miley Cyrus made a dramatic entrance on the blue carpet wearing a Balmain crocheted jumpsuit featuring a harlequin diamond design. Castle actress Stana Katic took the plunge in a white pantsuit, while Mistresses star Alyssa Milano flaunted her pins in a sheer, flared style. Undisputed queen of fashion Kate Moss joined the latest A-list craze earlier this month when she managed to make a boiler suit look cool, not once but twice (she slipped in to her Stella McCartney design to run errands in the day as well as teaming it with a fur coat for a night on the town). Jumpsuit super fan Miley Cyrus appeared every inch the victor as she strutted into Maxim's 2013 Hot 100 Party to collect her award as the hottest female in a black and white Valentino all-in one teamed with metallic Saint Laurent platform heels.

"By . Cosmo Soave Smith . She's evangelical about vegetables, obsessive about exercise and she won't let her children touch carbohydrates. Now Gwyneth Paltrow has revealed the secret to her holier-than-thou lifestyle: the Up wristband. The ultimate health accessory for control freaks, the £99 band from Jawbone uses a built-in motion sensor and Motionx GPS to register the time you spend walking, running or just sitting around. It vibrates if you've been inactive for too long, and a 'stopwatch' lets you note the start and end of specific workout sessions. It works alongside a smartphone app, which estimates the calories burned. You can input your mood into the app or scan the barcodes on your shopping to calculate your calorie intake. Actress Gwyneth Paltrow, left, has revealed the secret to her holier-than-thou lifestyle: the Up wristband, right . Everything is relayed back to you as a message on your phone and through vibrations in the wristband, with suggestions for ways you can live more healthily. The wristband uses Actigraphy - a sensor which measures tiny movements to determine whether you are awake or in a light or deep sleep. With these, it calculates the optimum time to wake you each morning with a gentle vibration through the wristband. So can it really lead to a healthier you? I've been wearing the Up bracelet for four weeks. It noticed I've not been getting much 'deep' sleep, and correlated this with the convenience food I've been eating in place of real dinners. Then it suggested I eat leafy greens for a magnesium boost to promote sleep. I took my wristband's advice - and slept like a baby. The Up wristbands measures activity levels and tells you if you've been sitting down too long and reminds you to get up and move about . After a month of entering my moods on the app, Up saw that on Wednesdays I'm rather miserable. It also noticed, using the motion detection system on the wristband, that on Wednesdays I lazily opt for a bus to work instead of walking, and that my mid-week 'treat' breakfast is high in carbohydrates. The following Wednesday I walked to work and drank a fruit smoothie instead of scoffing a bacon sandwich and felt energetic all day. Because of Up I've been cutting down on coffee and walking more often - and my mood has improved. My favourite trick? Up has figured out the optimum length for my mid-afternoon nap: 25.6 minutes. It vibrates at that precise moment, leaving me sparky to face the rest of the day. I may not be able to afford her massage therapist and trainer, but Gwyneth's round-the-clock wellbeing coach is money well spent.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Britain is among the least active nations in Europe despite being one of the most diet-obsessed, according to a survey. Asked whether they regularly practised a sport, only a fifth of respondents in the UK said yes, compared to well over half in Denmark and Holland. Only Poland is less active. However, few watch their waistline more closely than a Briton, with 17 per cent of UK respondents claiming to have followed a slimming diet in the previous six months. Phew! Asked whether they regularly practised a sport, only a fifth of respondents in the UK said yes, compared to well over half in Denmark and Holland. But few watch their waistlines as much as Britons . This was higher than all other countries except Denmark (23 per cent) and more than double the number in Germany, where the response was just 8 per cent. The British obsession with dieting dates back centuries. Lord Byron, the 19th century poet, was a devotee of a fad diet involving eating potatoes drenched in vinegar. One of the first low-carbohydrate diets was published by William Banting, a formerly obese London undertaker, in 1863. ‘Banting’ was a synonym for dieting in the UK as well as America well into the 1920s. The current most popular diet in Britain is the 5/2 diet, which involves severe calorie restriction for two days a week. It was devised in the UK and has since spread to the US and Europe. The survey, conducted by Spanish bank BBVA, involved 15,000 people across 10 European countries and also questioned respondents on values and world views. It concluded that people in the UK felt significantly less part of Europe than other countries. Britons were found to place greater importance on having a job with a high salary rather than a good work/life balance, where the opposite was true in countries such as Spain and France. Of those surveyed, nearly half of respondents in the UK considered the offer of good pay as being the most important aspect of a job. The survey concluded that Europeans rate family as the most important thing in their lives. █ US scientists have uncovered a genetic link to obesity. The researchers ‘deactivated’ the Mrap2 gene, which regulates energy use, in mice and found that the rodents put on weight even when eating the same amounts as a control group. Some people with severe, early-onset obesity have mutated versions of the gene.","Only the Poles are less active, with only one in five Britons playing sport .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Keith Gladdis . RAF warplanes were scrambled to intercept an incoming flight from Pakistan yesterday amid fears of a possible hijacking. Two Typhoon fighter jets raced through the skies to meet the Pakistan International Airlines plane following reports two men ‘tried to get into the cockpit’. After the captain activated an emergency signal, they escorted the airliner as it was diverted from Manchester, where it had been ten minutes from landing, to Stansted airport in Essex. Scroll down for video . Held: Police, some wearing forensic gear, detain a man on the tarmac . Police appear to search one of the suspects by the side of the plane at Stansted . The man also appears to be putting on a forensic suit at the scene . The incident is not thought to be terrorism-related, but in this week’s febrile atmosphere following the Woolwich atrocity the authorities were taking no chances. Armed officers from Essex Police boarded the Boeing 777 and arrested two British men, aged 30 and 41, on suspicion of ‘endangerment of an aircraft’. PIA Flight PK709 was carrying 297 passengers and 11 crew on the 13-hour flight from Lahore in Pakistan to Manchester. Passenger Umari Nauman said: ‘The cabin crew informed us that basically they tried to come into the cockpit a few times and because they had been asked not to do that they got into a bit of an argument with the crew and made a few threats.’ Captain Nadeem Sufi reported to his bosses at PIA’s headquarters in Pakistan that, 30 minutes before landing, crew members told him that two passengers had threatened ‘to blow up the flight after a heated conversation’. The captain reportedly said: ‘As soon as crew told me, I raised the alarm to air traffic control.’ He sent out what is known as a ‘squawk 7700’ – an emergency code transmitted by a radio transponder signalling the aircraft is in peril. The Pakistan International Airlines plane that was escorted into Stansted by two RAF Typhoon jets last week . The Typhoons were immediately scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, as a precaution.Passenger Noman Rizvi said later: ‘We did not notice anything extraordinary until we saw a jet fighter outside the window. ‘The pilot announced we were diverting towards London due to bad weather. When the flight landed, the pilot told us we were under threat and that is why we had been escorted by the Royal Air Force.’ For more than three decades, Stansted has been the designated airport for hijacks and major security incidents, with a remote area known as Compass Base set aside far from the main terminal. As soon as the plane landed armed police swarmed aboard and removed two men. They were named by PIA officials as Umera Ashraf and Mohammad Shafqat, British citizens of Pakistani origin who had been occupying economy class seats 61J and 61H. The remaining passengers were told to leave their belongings and were escorted from the plane. They were taken to a holding area while police and forensic experts checked the aircraft. Superintendent Darrin Tomkins, of Essex Police, said: ‘In accordance with standard protocols, the plane was diverted to Stansted airport and military aircraft escorted it until it landed. The plane touched down at 2.15pm and once it had been directed to a safe location, armed police officers entered the aircraft and arrested two suspects on suspicion of endangerment of an aircraft.’ He said the suspects were taken to a police station for questioning, and the rest of the passengers taken to the terminal building ‘for debriefing’.

The flight from Lahore to Manchester was diverted to Stansted following the 'incident' 10 minutes before it was due to land . This image shows how the plane was moved away from the passenger terminals after it landed at Stansted . He added: ‘At this point in time no . suspicious items have been recovered. This incident is being treated as a . criminal offence and remains under the direction of Essex Police.’ In Pakistan it was suggested there . had been some sort of misunderstanding on board, in which two passengers . had gone to the aid of another passenger who had become ‘unwell’. A . source claimed: . ‘There was an announcement asking if . there was a doctor on board, but when the two men rushed forward, there . were heated words with the crew, who reported the exchange to the . pilot.’ Amid the confused picture of what had happened on board, another version of events emerged last night. A Pakistani journalist, Murtaza Ali Shah, who has spoken to a friend on board the plane, Fakhir Iqbal, said: ‘Two guys started a row with a girl and lots of other people. Some people tried to calm them and asked them not to be rowdy and abusive. Fakhir told them to calm down. They said, “Don’t bloody speak to us or we will blow up the plane”. ‘The crew came and spoke to them and they were openly threatening the staff. Fakhir went to other crew members and told them they were making threats.’ Passengers are led from the plane after it landed at Standsted Airport . Police have confirmed they are treating the incident as a criminal offence . A spokesman for Stansted said . passengers would be held until police had finished interviewing them, . and ‘at some point police and the airline will arrange for their onward . transportation to Manchester’. Procedures for intercepting . suspicious aircraft were brought in following the 9/11 outrage. The . Ministry of Defence said Typhoon jets were routinely scrambled after a . pilot or crew of a passenger aircraft sent out an emergency signal. ‘The purpose of going up is to investigate what the situation is,’ said a spokesman. ‘Often when a Quick Reaction Alert . aircraft is launched, the details are not known, but it is known that a . signal has been sent. Part of the purpose of sending a Typhoon up is to . have a look and see what they can see.’ The spokesman said a total of 25 . Quick Reaction Alerts had been launched last year alone. And in . September 2011, the very same plane on the very same flight from Lahore . to Manchester had been diverted to Stansted because of a bomb scare. The fact the aircraft is Pakistani . will have heightened the sense of alarm because that country has . recently suffered a string of terror attacks after the presidential . elections.

"By . Leon Watson . Worrying too much about stressful events can trigger inflammation, according to a new study. Researchers found dwelling on negative events can increase levels of inflammation in the body. They discovered that when study participants were asked to ruminate on a stressful incident, their levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of tissue inflammation, rose. The study is the first time to directly measure this effect in the body. Worrying too much? Researchers found dwelling on negative events can increase levels of inflammation in the body . Study lead author Peggy Zoccola, an assistant professor of psychology at Ohio University in the United States, said: 'Much of the past work has looked at this in non-experimental designs. 'Researchers have asked people to report their tendency to ruminate, and then looked to see if it connected to physiological issues. It's been correlational for the most part.' The research team recruited 34 healthy young women to participate in the project. Each woman was asked to give a speech about her candidacy for a job to two interviewers in white laboratory coats, who listened with 'stone-faced' expressions. Half of the group was asked to contemplate their performance in the public speaking task, while the other half was asked to think about neutral images and activities, such as sailing ships or grocery store trips. The researchers drew blood samples that showed that the levels of C-reactive protein were significantly higher in the subjects who were asked to dwell on the speech. The study found that when study participants were asked to ruminate on a stressful incident, their levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of tissue inflammation, rose . For these participants, the levels of the inflammatory marker continued to rise for at least one hour after the speech. During the same time period, the marker returned to starting levels in the subjects who had been asked to focus on other thoughts. The C-reactive protein is primarily produced by the liver as part of the immune system's initial inflammatory response. It rises in response to traumas, injuries or infections in the body. C-reactive protein is widely used as a clinical marker to determine if a patient has an infection, but also if he or she may be at risk for disease later in life. Doctor Zoccola said: 'More and more, chronic inflammation is being associated with various disorders and conditions. 'The immune system plays an important role in various cardiovascular disorders such as heart disease, as well as cancer, dementia and autoimmune diseases.' Now Dr Zoccola is working with Fabian Benencia in Ohio University's Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine and Lauren Mente, a registered nurse and graduate student in the School of Nursing, to investigate the effect of rumination on additional inflammation markers. She also hopes to study the issue in other populations, such as older adults, who might be vulnerable to rumination and health problems. She was due to present the findings at the annual meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society in Miami.","Researchers at Ohio University studied 34 healthy young women .

"By . Margot Peppers . Domino's has combined two fast food favorites into an indulgent and mouth-watering new dish: chicken crust pizza. 'Specialty Chicken' is made with 12 pieces of breaded, boneless chicken as a base and topped with pizza add-ons like cheese, sauces, vegetables and meats. MailOnline gamely sampled each of the four different flavors - crispy bacon and tomato, classic hot buffalo, spicy jalapeno-pineapple and sweet barbecue bacon - ahead of its April 21 release, and the verdicts were overwhelmingly positive. The ultimate combination: Domino's has combined two fast food favorites into an indulgent new dish called Specialty Chicken, which consists of breaded chicken bites with pizza cheese and toppings . 'I think their focus group is a brilliant bunch of college kids,' surmised U.S. editor Katherine. 'I want to order this at 2am after a night of drinking. It would be heaven.' She added that the standout 'by far' was the jalapeno and pineapple flavor. 'It's sweet and spicy and I would eat three boxes of it.' Femail editor Tamara agreed. 'Not much can fail to be improved by melted cheese, and this rule is true of breaded chicken,' she said. 'The buffalo flavor was an easy favorite, ditto the barbecue sauce version. The pineapple jalapeno was a surprise hit though. It's so retro, but somehow it works.' Indeed, spicy jalapeno-pineapple was the flavor that really won over the office, followed by the sweet barbecue bacon, although some complained that this one could use some improvement. 'The barbeque chicken was really good and I would happily order it and eat it,' said Katherine. 'But it is a bit messier, since it's saucier, and could benefit from more cheese.' On the menu: It comes in four different flavors - crispy bacon and tomato, classic hot buffalo, spicy jalapeno-pineapple and sweet barbecue bacon . She also noted that Domino's could venture even further into chicken menu items by producing more varieties of this new dish. 'They should offer a grilled option as well,' she said. 'The breading wasn't that integral. And I'm sure people cutting carbs or allergic to gluten will celebrate this alternative way to pig out on pizza flavors.' Photo editor Robert also suggested toning down the bread crumbs, which 'could help the flavor of the sauce and chicken come through'. 'The pineapple jalapeno was a . surprise hit. It's so retro, but somehow it works' More like a box of chicken fingers than a pizza pie, Specialty Chicken is 'one of the most creative, innovative menu items we have ever had,' said Russell Weiner, Domino's Pizza chief marketing officer. 'Our pizza chefs have taken chicken to a whole new level, using our unique ingredients to create these four bold flavors. There's nothing quite like Domino's Specialty Chicken on the market today.' Specialty Chicken, will be part of the pizza chain's $5.99 mix and match deal, which lets you order one of the four flavors as well as another item from the menu. Winning flavor: Spicy jalapeno-pineapple (pictured) was the flavor that won us over. 'It's sweet and spicy and I would eat three boxes of it,' said MailOnline editor Katherine . According to Bob Golden, executive . vice president at restaurant research firm Technomic, this move by . Domino's to create more innovative chicken dishes may well be a smart . one. '[Chicken] has a . little bit more halo than red meats,' he told USA Today, explaining that . consumers tend to see it as a 'healthier' option (though the calorie count for Specialty Chicken has yet to be released). But, he added, it's also a risky move. 'Every time a pizza chain tries to diversity, it usually doesn't work so well,' he said. Judging by the ad for Specialty Chicken, Domino's is fully aware that it is something of a gamble. Get ready: Specialty Chicken will be part of the chain's $5.99 mix and match deal and will launch officially on April 21 . 'You know, at Domino's, failure is an option,' says a man in the commercial. And Domino's 'chicken chef' Tate Dillow explains: 'If we gave up after every mistake, we wouldn't come up with something really special like our new Specialty Chicken.' In related fast food news, it was revealed today that KFC will be relaunching its Double Down meal, a bacon and cheese sandwich with fried chicken filets instead of bread. According to USA Today, the sandwich will be available starting April 21 - coincidentally, the same day as Domino's Specialty Chicken - for a limited time only.",MailOnline put the pizza chain's new Specialty Chicken to the test - with overwhelmingly positive verdicts .
"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius offered a public apology before a congressional committee on Wednesday, and insisted that its performance had 'improved.' But moments before her hotly anticipated appearance before the House . Energy and Commerce Committee, the Obamacare website crashed and was apparently unavailable in at least 20 states. Even those congressmen who came to question her were unable to load the site in their browsers before the hearing. 'I am as frustrated as anyone,' she told Americans. 'You deserve better. I apologize. I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems and I'm committed to earning your confidence back by fixing the site.' As she faces calls for her resignation from several lawmakers, Mississippi Republican Rep. Gregg Harper pressed her on whether the buck ultimately stops with her, or with President Obama. After several minutes of dissembling, she finally sniped while shaking her head: 'Whatever. Yes, he is the president. He is responsible for government programs.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Feeding frenzy: Seats at the Sebelius hearing were impossible to come by on Wednesday. Her first statement was to apologize for the debacle . In the firing line: As Sebelius sat down to the sound of hundreds of shutters to give evidence before the committee, the website she admitted she was 'accountable for' went dark in 20 states . She outlined efforts that she said have 'improved the performance' of the website in recent weeks, producing 'fewer errors and timeout messages' for users. She even said healthcare.gov can now process applications at a rate of five per second. Sebelius insisted that despite the 'unacceptable' problems with flawed website, the larger Obamacare law is 'working for millions of Americans.' She told the congressional panel, however, that her agency still doesn't have hard numbers to show how many Americans have signed up for Obamacare insurance plans. 'We do not have any reliable data around enrollment, which is why we haven’t released it to date,' she said, and refused to provide raw numbers to Congress that couldn't be verified through insurance companies. The only number HHS has released describes 700,000 Americans overall who have completed the the process of finding out if they are eligible for the federal government's insurance subsidies. 'The system isn't functioning,' Sebelius said, 'so we're not getting reliable data.' Staunch: Sebelius said that the website was 'improving' and that error messages were reducing as she desperately tried to put a positive spin on the disastrous roll-out . Low blow: Sebelius went on to agree that ultimately President Obama was responsible for the website failure, saying: 'Yes, he is the president. He is responsible for government programs' Disbelief: Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana couldn't believe what he was hearing on Wednesday, as Sebelius defended the Affordable Care Act . An annoyed President Barack Obama has shown signs of losing confidence in his top health deputy, and her turn on the congressional hot seat new will either sink his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, or calm his nerves. Sebelius fanned the flames mounting against her with an admission, under withering questions, that the buck stops with her. Asked if Michelle Snyder, the chief operating officer of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was ultimately responsible for the failed website, she replied, 'Michelle Synder was not responsible for the debacle. Hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.' The Washington Post's official public fact-checker declared on Wednesday morning that President Obama lied when he promised that his health care plan would permit Americans to keep health insurance plans they liked. 'No matter how we reform health care,' the president said in 2009, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you’ll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.' 'If you like your insurance plan, you will keep it,' he said in 2010. 'No one will be able to take that away from you. It hasn’t happened yet. It won’t happen in the future.' The Post's Glenn Kessler called those promises 'an extraordinarily bold — and possibly foolish — pledge, unless [Obama] thought he simply could dictate exactly how the insurance industry must work.' Obama's pledge ultimately 'ignores the regulations written by the administration to implement the law,' according to the Post. Those rules have caused insurers to cancel millions of insurance policies, killing consumers' chances of keeping them active. 'The president's promise,' says the Post, 'apparently came with a very large caveat: ""If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan — if we deem it to be adequate.""' Obama's memorable pledge was awarded a 'Four Pinocchios' rating, the newspaper's lowest measure of truthfulness. Committee chair Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, framed the hearing as an accountability exercise for Sebelius, outlining some of the problems with the Obamacare rollout and placing responsibility at her feet. 'Over the months leading up to the October 1 launch, the secretary and her colleagues at HHS repeatedly looked us in the eye and testified that everything was on track,' Upton said. 'But something happened along the way – either those officials did not know how bad the situation was, or they did not disclose it.' The healthcare.gov website, he said, was unavailable Tuesday night at 5pm when his staff checked on it. 'Even this morning' before the hearing, Upton said, 'we were hit with an error message.' Indeed, before the hearing the website was completely unavailiable in at least 20 states, according to a variety of news agencies and reports from Twitter and Facebook. 'The website never crashed,' Sebelius would insist later. 'It is functional, but at a very slow speed and very low reliability.' Rep, Marsha Blackburn, a feisty Tennessee conservative, attacked Sebelius over the Affordable Care Act's minimum insurance standards, which have driven policy cancellations as insurers have reconfigured coverage in order to comply with the Obamacare law. Those minimum requirements include mental health care, vision coverage, pediatric dental care and other features – previously seen as options – which many consumers don't want. 'Some people like to drink out of red Solo cup, not a crystal stem,' Blackburn jabbed. But New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone called concerns about widespread policy cancellations a 'red herring.' 'Insurance companies are canceling lousy policies with high prices,' he claimed. Sebelius told Congress on Wednesday that she didn't know how many Americans would receive cancellation notices when their insurers phrase out their policies in order to comply with the Obamacare law. About 12 million people, she said, buy insurance on the individual market. Driving his crazy: Illinois Republican Rep. John Shimkus couldn't believe his ears on Wednesday when Sebelius said 'Whatever; in response to a question about whether the buck stops in the Oval Office . Sebelius said she was 'responsible' for the Affordable Care Act's dodgy launch, fueling talk in Washington that her job is on the line . On Tuesday, documents were released . showing that one of HHS' top . contractors warned that healthcare.gov faced . fatal flaws in the weeks before its disastrous launch. In . the September 6 report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid .

House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep.

'The . fact is that the Affordable Care Act delivered on its product: quality, . affordable health insurance,' her remarks read. 'The tremendous interest in HealthCare.gov shows that people want to buy this product.' CMS . Administrator Marilyn Tavenner inspired little confidence with her own . congressional testimony on Tuesday, refusing eight separate times to say . how many Americans have signed up for medical insurance policies during . the initial rollout period. And cost concerns continue to mount about the multimillion-dollar healthcare.gov website. 'So far we have spent about $118 million on the website itself,' Sebelius said Wednesday, adding that contractors have received another $56 million for other technology to support it.","Obama's point-person on Obamacare admits 'I am as frustrated as anyone. ...

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Around 1.6 million Brits will be heading abroad over Easter, with those staying at home facing packed roads, disrupted rail journeys and the threat of unsettled weather. Popular foreign spots for those going overseas include Spain and its islands, Turkey, Tunisia and Florida, according to UK travel organisation Abta. Top city destinations are Paris, Dublin, Amsterdam, Rome and New York, while bookings for UK breaks are described by Abta as 'healthy'. Easter holiday: 1.6 million Brits are set to leave the UK this weekend for a break abroad . Over the Easter weekend, 370,000 passengers will leave from Heathrow airport, 200,000 from Gatwick, 120,000 from Stansted, 60,000 from Luton and 4,500 from Bournemouth. In the north of England and the Midlands, 110,000 will leave from Manchester airport, 45,000 from Birmingham and 23,000 from East Midlands, while more than 100,000 will be leaving via the Scottish airports. Thousands will also take ferry services to the continent, while Channel Tunnel high-speed train company Eurostar is expecting to carry more than 130,000 passengers over the holiday weekend - a 15 per cent increase on numbers at Easter 2013. While those heading for the sunshine abroad can expect high temperatures, those having a break in Britain are being warned by forecasters to expect isolated showers on Good Friday and Easter Saturday. Easter getaway: 370,000 passengers are forecast to leave the UK flying from Heathrow Airport this weekend . Easter holiday: Turkey is one of the most popular destinations for a getaway . Easter Sunday and Easter Monday are expected to bring unsettled weather in the South, with north east England and the Midlands getting the best of the sunshine, the Met Office said. As is usual over bank holiday weekends, Network Rail is carrying out a large programme of engineering works which will see a number of key routes disrupted. The extensive work will affect services to and from a number of major termini, including London's Charing Cross, London Bridge, Paddington and King's Cross stations. Southampton Central and Sheffield are among other major stations where services will be affected over the weekend. Congestion warning: Some 16 million cars are expected on the UK's roads this weekend . With Easter falling earlier last year and proving distinctly chilly, this Easter is expected to see a rise in the number of vehicles taking to the road. Traffic information company Trafficmaster and the AA have forecast as many as 16 million cars will be on the move over the holiday, with drivers from Northern Ireland the most likely to get behind the wheel and Scots the least likely to do so. Another traffic information company, Inrix, has forecast that the worst-affected congestion hotspots in south east and south west England will be twice as busy over Easter as during non-holiday periods. The company said this Easter's busiest periods will be all day on Thursday, between 10am and 3pm on Good Friday and between 10am and 4pm on Easter Monday. Inrix listed the sections of road likely to be the most congested over the holiday. These include the M4 between Hampshire and the West Country, the western section of the M25, the A303 in Wiltshire, the M55 between Preston and Blackpool, and the M4 between London and Reading in Berkshire.","Paris, Dublin, Turkey and Spain among most popular destinations .

"By . Chris Parsons . Updated: . 13:31 EST, 23 December 2011 . Coward: Ex-councillor Robert Payne claimed he could not remember battering four kittens in a drunken rage in November . An 'unimaginably cruel' former councillor decapitated two kittens after swinging them round his house in 'appalling scenes', a court heard. Robert Payne swung the four-month-old cats round his house in Keighley, West Yorkshire, broke their skulls and most of their limbs, and decapitated two of them. The 'cowardly' former councillor for the Keighley West Ward of Bradford Council then kept three of the poor creatures in his freezer while their blood was spread round his house and their remains strewn across his living room. Payne, 36, flew into a drunken rage on November 15 and attacked the four kittens he had bought off the internet. He then 'picked up one of the cats by its stomach and used it as a battering ram' and 'smashed its head against something'. Police were eventually called to his house after a neighbour reported hearing banging and the sound of a cat screaming. Officers were confronted by the horrific scene of dismembered animal parts scattered over the house, along with blood on the walls at shoulder height from where he had swung the injured kittens around the room. Payne was today jailed for just five months at Bradford Crown Court and banned from keeping animals for life. Stephen Wood, prosecuting, told the court: 'The police went inside and they were met with what the prosecution submit was an appalling scene, with fragments of dismembered parts of animals over the house, together with a substantial quantity of blood.' The barrister said the pattern of blood on the walls suggested a 'profusely' bleeding cat had been swung around the room. He said officers also found fragments of bone, an eyeball and part of a jaw with the tongue still attached on the living room floor. Three of the kittens were found in a freezer and the fourth was found decapitated upstairs. Its head was never found. The skulls of the other cats had all been crushed and nearly every limb had been fractured. Mr Wood said: 'Prior to their deaths, these kittens had been subjected to unimaginable cruelty. 'The blood was contorted around the entirety of the room in a circular fashion, at shoulder height.' Horrific: RSPCA officers and police were greeted with this grim scene of blood and kitten remains splattered across Mr Payne's house in Keighley, West Yorks . Payne, who bought the kittens over the internet, told police he was not '100%' sure what had happened but said it was 'more than likely' he had killed them. Judge Robert Bartfield rejected Payne's claim that he couldn't remember the attack taking place and labelled him a 'coward'. Sentencing Payne, Judge Bartfield said: 'For some reason, you decided to take your frustrations out on these innocent creatures who looked to you for their care. 'You had killed three of them in circumstances which for them can only have been in the most unimaginable terror. 'Each of them was swung round the room deliberately, no doubt as to cause the maximum distress, and all of them had their skulls broken.' Judge Bartfield continued: 'The police and RSPCA were greeted by the most horrific scene, with the living room spread about with the remains of these unfortunate creatures.' The judge said people feeling 'revulsion' at the case would wonder why Payne was not being sent to prison for years. But he said he was bound by sentencing guidelines, which state a maximum prison term of six months for such an offence. Bespectacled Payne, wearing a short-sleeved red checked shirt and jeans, stood in the dock with his hands clasped in front of him and showed no expression as he was jailed. Payne was handed a suspended sentence in June this year for fraud by abuse of position. Mr Wood told the court the defendant, who was acting as an accountant, kept a Â£3,587 tax rebate from a client. He received calls to resign from his position as an independent councillor after this conviction but only stepped down from the role earlier this month. Speaking after today's sentencing, Keith Dredge, a Labour councillor for the same ward, said he felt sickened to hear the details of the cruelty. 'Justice has been done and this guy's been removed from local politics,' he said. 'The guy's obviously got problems and being a councillor has not helped him. He's done nothing for the constituency, he's done nothing for himself.' Mr Dredge continued: 'All I'm thankful for is that Robert Payne is now out of the council. He's gone and we can start a new chapter in Keighley West.'","Robert Payne, ex-councillor for Keighley West, killed four kittens in barbaric attack .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Psychologists have found that adding a lot of detail to a fabricated story is the easiest way to remember a lie . Most people have told a lie only to be caught out later on when they mix up a story or forget about the fib all together. But now psychologists have found that adding a lot of detail to a fabricated story is the easiest way to remember a lie and not get caught out. U.S. scientists said a lie that consists of simple denial doesn't become so ingrained in our memory and could therefore be more easily busted at a later date. Psychologists have found it is harder to remember a false denial than a made-up description, which could have important implications for forensic interrogation. Even telling the truth when denying something can lead to a guilty feeling. For example, the scientists said a suspect who repeatedly refutes being at a crime may actually begin to imagine where it was, what it looked like and who was present, causing the scene to feel strangely familiar even if they were not there. The phenomenon is known as the â€˜illusory truth effectâ€™ when hearing false information repeatedly makes it appear correct, and in a courtroom can be disastrous. Professor Sean Lane, of Louisiana State University, said: 'They are telling the truth, they are denying, but later this thing seems familiar. They are confusing the familiarity of the repetition with the truth, not realising those repeated denials are what makes it seem familiar 48 hours later.' Humans remember false descriptions well . because of the effort required to make them up. When subjects in a study . were asked to recall these 48 hours later, they remembered accurately . what they had said and that it was untrue. Psychologists have found it is harder to remember a false denial than a false description including a few memorable details, which could have important implications for forensic interrogation . The same is not true for false denials. Denying something that actually happened is often brief, and its cognitive demand is therefore much smaller. Professor Lane explained: 'I am not constructing details. But I am also not going to remember the act because there is not much cognitively involved in the denial.' The 'illusory truth effect' - when hearing false information repeatedly makes it appear correct - can prove disastrous in a courtroom . His participants had a hard time remembering their own false denials after 48 hours. In a series of rapid fire questions a guilty suspect is more inclined to forget a false denial and therefore more likely to contradict himself on the same information later. But there is also a frightening implication . for the innocent, as the volunteers also had a hard time remembering if . the denials they had made were true or false. This same memory problem . might plague suspects asked to make repeated truthful denials. The study, published in the Journal of Applied Research and Memory Cognition, says false descriptions and false denials are two separate kinds of lies that use different mental machinery. Professor Lane said: 'If I am going to lie to you about something that did not happen, I am going to have to keep a lot of different constraints in mind.' Liars must remember what they say and also monitor how plausible they seem and the depth of detail they offer as well as how confident they appear to the listener. If the listener does not appear to be buying it, they must also adapt the story accordingly. Professor Lane said: 'As the constructive process lays down records of our details and descriptions, it also lays down information about the process of construction.'","U.S. psychologists said fictional descriptions and false denials are two separate kinds of lies that use different mental machinery .

Peter Clarke, 58, who ran the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit, has been made Education Commissioner and will review the evidence in connection with the allegations, the Department for Education (DfE) said today. His role will be to conduct a thorough investigation into the situation and work with Birmingham City Council to 'analyse evidence of extremist infiltration in both academies and council-run schools', the Department said. The DfE said that Mr Clarke has substantial experience in leading high-level investigations, and his appointment means that the allegations can be examined in a 'professional and dispassionate manner'. The move comes the day after it was disclosed that 25 schools are now under investigation over the alleged hardline Muslim plot to force out governors and headteachers. Birmingham City Council has already announced the appointment of Ian Kershaw as chief adviser to directly handle at least 200 complaints received in relation to the Operation Trojan Horse allegations focusing on schools in the city. The council's investigation, running next to the DfE's separate inquiry, is due to initially report back in May. Mr Gove said: 'I am extremely concerned by the allegations made in connection to a number of schools in Birmingham. 'I have already asked Ofsted to inspect a number of schools of concern and these investigations are ongoing. But wider, more comprehensive action is needed. 'These allegations need either to be substantiated and firm action taken, or to be shown to be baseless. We cannot allow uncertainty for parents or pupils to persist. 'That is why I am appointing a Commissioner to oversee this work. Peter Clarke brings a wealth of relevant skills and experience, and is very well placed to lead a fair and thorough assessment of the evidence, and report back to me. We expect he will work closely with Birmingham City Council. Birmingham's Park View, where Â£70,000 was allegedly spent on loudspeakers to call pupils to Islamic prayer . 'No pupils should be exposed to extremist views or radicalisation while at school. I have tasked Peter Clarke with getting to the bottom of these allegations, so schools in Birmingham can continue the excellent progress that so many have been making.' Mr Clarke is due to report back with his findings in the summer. His remit will cover both local council-run schools and academies. Today West Midlands chief constable, Chris Sims criticised Mr Clarke's appointment, calling it 'desperately unfortunate'. Mr Sims said: 'Peter Clarke has many qualities, but people will inevitably draw unwarranted conclusions from his former role as national co-ordinator for counter terrorism.' Birmingham City Council announced the appointment of former headteacher Mr Kershaw, managing director of Northern Education, as its chief adviser, and said it was also setting up a review group of MPs, councillors, national teaching and governors groups, the police, and faith leaders, to look into the claims. Education Secretary Michael Gove said he hoped Mr Clarke, who led the investigation into the 7/7 London bombings, right, which killed 52, would conduct a thorough probe into the Birmingham school allegations . Its council leader Sir Albert Bore . confirmed the council had also spoken to the local authorities in both . Manchester and Bradford, during its three-month long investigation, . where similar allegations have been raised. Ofsted has also been sent in by Mr Gove to inspect 15 Birmingham schools in recent weeks, after the allegations first broke.  The results of these snap inspections are due back next month. Concerns over how some of the city's 430 schools were being run first emerged when an anonymous letter known as Operation Trojan Horse was leaked, claiming that a small but radical group of Muslims were pursuing their own agenda in the classrooms, with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out. The unsigned and undated 'Trojan Horse' document also claimed to have caused 'a great amount of organised disruption' in the city, crediting the plan with forcing a change of leadership at four schools. Lindsey Clark, the headteacher of Park View, said she would act against anyone plotting against the school . Since the letter came to light, anonymous whistle-blowers have claimed that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies, sex education was banned, non-Muslim staff bullied, and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand Al Qaeda-linked Muslim preacher praised to pupils. Sir Albert said the council was 'in dialogue' with the DfE, and confirmed none of the Ofsted inspection reports would be published by the education watchdog until after Easter. West Midlands Police is also still looking into the authorship of the document, the council's leader said. The allegations detailed in the Trojan Horse letter focus on the Park View Educational Trust, which runs three schools in the city - all of which have been subjected to snap Ofsted inspections in recent weeks. Among further claims which have since come to light, one former anonymous staff member at Park View Academy in Alum Rock alleged a colleague had in an assembly praised the firebrand Al Qaeda-linked Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki - he was killed by a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011. The school trustees have firmly denied all the claims, branding the allegations 'a witch-hunt', while pointing to very good academic results among its pupils. Born in 1955, Peter Clarke was educated at the Glyn School, Epsom, Surrey, before attending the University of Bristol where he read law. After graduation, he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1977, becoming an inspector in 1984 and a detective inspector in 1986.  Two years later, he joined the National Drugs Intelligence Unit, and in 1990 he was promoted to Operations Chief, central London division. Mr Clarke progressed from being Met commissioner in 1993 to become Brixton Divisional Commander from 1994-1997.  He spent three more years as head of the Protection Command from 1997-2000, which meant he was in charge of Royal protection when Diana, Princess of Wales died in Paris in 1997. As Deputy Assistant Commissioner with the Specialist Operations team, Mr Clarke was Britain's top anti-terror police officer . From 2000-2002, he was deputy director of personnel, before becoming head of the Anti-Terrorist branch in summer 2002.  This later merged with Special Branch to become the Counter Terror Command, which put Mr Clarke in charge of the investigation into the 7/7 bombings and the failed London bombings of 21 July 2005. Mr Clarke, who is married with three children, retired as Assistant Commissioner, Specialist Operations in 2008.  His retirement was delayed at the request of then-Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, following the resignation of Andy Hayman over champagne expense claims.","Peter Clarke, 58, ran Scotland Yard's national counter-terrorism unit .

"By . Wills Robinson . British people fighting against the Syrian regime are being trained as 'jihadists' and urged to launch attacks in the UK when they return. Fighters who have travelled to the country to join the battle against Bashar al-Assad's government are being brainwashed into becoming terrorists before they are encouraged to return home and set up terror cells, an al-Qaeda defector revealed. Extremists are teaching them how to construct and detonate devices like car bombs and suicide vests so they are prepared to return to Britain and carry out atrocities similar to 9/11 or the London bombings. Security fears: Foreign fighters joining the attempt to overthrow the al-Assad regime are being brainwashed by fanatics so they can carry out atrocities similar to 9/11 and the London bombings (file picture) It is feared 500 Britons are among the of thousands of foreign fighters in the war-torn country, and security services are concerned that many could return to carry out attacks on home soil. MI5 is said to have increased the number of resources to tackling the danger in the past six months. The defector from the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) told The Daily Telegraph that some of those who want to overthrow the Assad regime are being turned by fanatics. Known as Murad, the former extremist said foreign fighters have 'often talked about terrorist attacks' suggesting they were 'proud of 9/11 and the London bombings'. Prepared: The fighters from abroad are being taught how to construct explosives such as car bombs and suicide vests (file picture) 'The British, French and American mujahideen (holy warriors) in the room started talking about places that they wanted to bomb or explode themselves in Europe and the United States,' he said. 'The American dreamed of blowing up the White House.' A stream of young men have left everything they have at home in Britain to fight in the violent revolution, while Shirz Maher, a senior research fellow at King's . College London, has estimated 50 may have already returned. Ifthekar Jaman, 23, travelled more than 2,000 miles to fight in a bid to overthrow the Assad regime . and developed into a '5-star jihad'.

He walked out of his family's £1million home several months ago telling them he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'. Friends said Bary – an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene – grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Last Friday, two 21-year-old men from Birmingham were charged with travelling to Syria to carry out terrorist acts. Yusuf Sawar and Mohammed Ahmed, from Handsworth, Birmingham, were arrested at Heathrow after arriving on a flight from Turkey. It also emerged last week that two French schoolboys have travelled to Syria to become Al Qaeda fighters. The youngsters were reported missing after they failed to turn up at school on January 6, instead using a credit card to book flights to the Middle East. Manuel Valls, France's interior minister, said citizens returning from Syria as extremists was the 'biggest threat the country faces in the coming years', estimating that 700 French nationals have been involved in the conflict.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . At the crack of dawn, gangs of black grouse put on one of the Scottish Highland's most bizarre spectacles. Over the course of two hours, endangered male grouse puff themselves up, strut around, leap into the air, and square up to each other in an attempt to impress the watching females. The black grouse is one of only three British species to exhibit this strange 'lekking' ritual behaviour. Spring has arrived in the Scottish Highlands and the aggressive mating . rituals of the black grouse have begun. The bird, native to Scotland, is one of only three British species which . exhibits 'lekking' behaviour . The practice involves males competing . with each other on a patch of territory known as a lek - a circular area . roughly 65ft (20m). Within this space, five to ten male birds battle it out to dominate the centre of the circle and show off their skills. Once the hens arrive, the atmosphere becomes hostile - the males jumped at each other, 'crashing around like dodgems'. The dominant bird, which secures the . centre of the lek, is marked out as the alpha male. Calls and posturing . are then used to attract a mate. In contrast to this lavish display, the females known as ‘greyhens’, remain camouflaged in their habitat.

Within this space, five to ten male birds battle it out to dominate the centre of the circle and show off their skills . Black grouse are game birds found in northern Europe's woodland and moorland. They are also known as black cocks and grey hens, because of the colour of the male and female birds respectively. The black grouse population, one of the most threatened species in the UK, has suffered a dramatic decline in recent decades. This was largely caused by weather patterns, changing farming activities and loss of food sources, such as heather and birch scrub. ‘Once the hens arrived, things started to get really hostile - the males jumped at each other, crashing around like dodgems. ‘I could sense the aggression between them from my hide. They were pinning each other down and I could hear their wings beating against the ground.’ The dominant bird, which secures the centre of the lek, is marked out as the alpha male. Calls and posturing are then used to attract a mate. In contrast to this lavish display, the females known as ‘greyhens’, remain camouflaged in their habitat. ‘By gaining dominance, the winning male ensures he has access to the best females, and the greatest number of them, making it likely he will pass on his genes to the next generation,’ said Paul Stancliffe of the British Trust for Ornithology. 'The males started to gather around the lek when it was still dark,' said Mr Moore. 'All I could hear was them babbling and cooing at each other.

This was largely caused by weather patterns, changing farming activities and loss of food sources, such as heather and birch scrub. At the time of the last national survey in 2005, populations fell from an estimated 25,000 displaying males in 1970 to just over 5000. To thrive in the British countryside, Black grouse require need a varied habitat. Blanket bog, farmland, moorland and open all allow them to recreate more lekking sites as well as have cover in which to nest. A complete UK-wide count takes place every 10 to 12 years, with the next one scheduled for 2017.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Millions of dollars in heroin labeled ‘NFL’ was recovered and two people were arrested this week when authorities busted a dope ring only miles from the site of this Sunday's Super Bowl. Federal, state and city agencies converged on the Bronx ‘heroin mill’ Thursday night and found 33 pounds of dope with a street value of $8million and hundreds of thousands of baggies stamped with various brand names including the NFL monicker. Scales, 18 coffee grinders, baking soda, face masks and rubber bands from the apartment just a short drive from MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the DEA announced. Not league approved: This NFL stamp was used to brand millions of dollars worth of heroin flowing from a Bronx apartment building . Stacks: Bundles of tiny baggies called 'decks' filled garbage bags hauled out of the fifth-floor apartment . Law enforcement had been surveilling the location for some time and moved in after seeing Cristino Then, 25, delivering a package to the building. Both he and Augustin Rivera, who was caught trying to flee down the fire escape, were arrested and face multiple drug distribution charges. ‘Agents and officers seized approximately 13 kilograms of heroin (33 pounds) and hundreds of thousands of individual ‘glassine’ bags stamped with numerous brand names, including ‘NFL,’ ‘government shutdown,’ ‘iPhone,’ and ‘Olympics 2012,’ an agency statement said. ‘The brand names used are tied to upcoming events, indicating the savvy and sophistication of the heroin distribution ring,’ special narcotics prosecutor Bridget Brennan added. 'Heroin mill': Authorities referred to the location as a heroin mill while announcing the massive bust . Brand names: NFL was one of many brand names stamped onto the heroin distributed from the location, other names found in the bag of stamps pictured here included 'iPhone,' 'income tax' and 'McDonalds' Sophisticated: Authorities say the use of relevant brand names shows the sophistication of the drug ring . The agency further explained that ‘coffee grinders are often used to cut pure heroin with a dilutant, such as baking soda.’ Each of the two men arrested faces felony charges of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree, criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree and criminally using drug paraphernalia in the second degree. The bust was made as heroin addiction rates across the country are soaring and an epidemic of killer dope has been ravaging the Northeast since the beginning of the year. ‘A seizure of this size should open everyone’s eyes to the magnitude of the heroin problem confronting us,’ said Ms Brennan. Large scale: Authorities also said they believe the apartment was the center of a regional distribution chain feeding into the alarming growth of heroin use throughout the Northeast . Uncut: Pure yellow heroin can be seen sitting in a separate bag on top of baking soda, which is used to what drug dealers call 'cut' the product in order to maximize profits . Ready to go: Cases of already packaged heroin - bagged, stamped and neatly packed - filled this oven in the apartment . This latest bust does not appear tied to the fentanyl-laced heroin blamed for at least 100 deaths in the past few months from New Hampshire to Washington State and down to Louisiana. Those batches of heroin have been labeled 'bud ice,' 'income tax' and 'theraflu.' This past week, in nearby Nassau County, on Long Island, authorities linked multiple deaths to the heroin-fentanyl blend. The drugs used by to those victims were branded ‘24K,’ authorities said.","Authorities seized 33 pounds of heroin worth about $8million on the street .

"By . Daniel Bates In Cleveland, Ohio . The three girls who were held captive for a decade can't be left on their own because they were so 'brainwashed' they thought they the others would always be around, MailOnline can reveal. Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight have to be walked around in groups because they get agitated if they are left on their own. Relatives said that because they had spent so much time in each other's company they could not comprehend what it was like to be left alone. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Coming home: Gina Dejesus, now 23, who . disappeared in Cleveland, Ohio in 2004, escaped from a home on Monday . just miles from where she went missing - and is believed to have known . her abductor . Transitioning: The DeJesus family are trying to figure out the best way for reintegrate her into society . Gina is also more 'on edge' when men . are around compared to when there are just women in the room - a . chilling result of her years of alleged abuse at the hands of Ariel . Castro. Jackie Figaro-Roman, . an aunt of Gina DeJesus who was among the welcoming committee at her . home to welcome her back, told MailOnline that the families are only now . coming to terms with the impact the captivity has had on the girls. She said: 'They were brainwashed. They can't walk around by themselves and they have to walk around in groups. 'It's because they spent so much time with those other girls.' Asked how Gina is doing, she added: '(Her mother) Nancy is so happy. Joy: Nancy Ruiz, mother of Gina, hugs a police officer as her daughter arrives at her home on Wednesday . Return: Gina gives a thumbs-up for the crowds as she is escorted toward her home on Wednesday . 'Little by little Gina is coming out (of herself). 'Gina is afraid of too many people, . she's afraid of crowds. She is still more comfortable around women (than . men). She's very timid. 'When men are around she is different. She's more on edge. 'She's not talking much, she's smiling. 'The family wants to tell people more and thank them for all they did.' Miss . Figaro-Roman also revealed that Gina's family are already planning a . reunion for the girls so that they can help each other heal and move on. She said: 'We want to get these girls together. We want to try to help Michelle.' Shared experiences: DeJesus' relatives said that they plan to arrange meetings with Gina and Michelle Knight (pictured) as well as Amanda Berry since they were so used to spending time together in captivity . Happy ending: Amanda Berry (center, seen with her sister at left and the daughter she birthed in captivity) was the one who broke free and helped save the other kidnapped girls . Psychologists have said that it will be many years, if ever, before the girls will be able to come to terms with their ordeal and that they will have to undergo intensive therapy. Dr Tina Walch, director of ambulatory services at Zucker Hillside Hospital in New Hyde Park, New York, has also spoken of how the 'human need for affiliation' would have asserted itself, meaning they formed a warped bond with their alleged kidnapper and the other captives. As the young women begin to re-adjust to their free life, leaked police reports give the public more clues into the harrowing lives they were forced to lead for roughly a decade. 'Captor': Ariel Castro, 52, has been charged with kidnapping and raping the three women . Knight, now 32, says she saved the . life of Berry's daughter Jocelyn when she was born in an inflatable pool . six years ago at the 'house of horrors'. Castro . allegedly told the girls that if the baby died, he would kill Amanda. She said that she put her mouth to Jocelyn's and 'breathed for her' - to . save both their lives. After saving the infant's life, Knight was told to clean up the mess. Castro initially held all three women chained up in the basement, the report says, but later allowed them to live together on the second floor after years in captivity. On the two occasions they were allowed out into the daylight, they were taken out into the backyard, but were heavily disguised with wigs and sunglasses. And in a bizarre and twisted ritual, Castro marked the date of each woman's abductions every year by serving them dinner and a cake, one victim's cousin told the New York Times. Castro also made sure Jocelyn - his daughter with Amanda - did not know the real names of DeJesus or Knight - because he didn't want the young girl to repeat their names in public. Knight told investigators she fell pregnant five times, but lost the baby each time. She said she was starved and repeatedly punched in the stomach to force her to miscarry. DeJesus told police that she did not think she ever became pregnant during her captivity. The report said that none of the three women ever saw a doctor or had medical treatment in the decade they were held captive. It also reveals how when police forced their way into the house on Monday afternoon, a terrified DeJesus jumped into the arms of the police officer.","Gina DeJesus' relatives say that she has been surrounded by people in the wake of her release because she was used to having the other young women around her .

"By . Martin Robinson . Jailed: Drag queen Robert Clothier was caught red-handed after arranging to have sex with a father and his two children in an online undercover police sting . A paedophile drag queen who arranged to have sex with a father and his two young children has been jailed today. Robert Clothier, 37, who also goes by the name Lady James, turned up for a liaison with ‘Mark’ and his eight and 11-year-olds, but it was a police sting. Clothier was arrested at Wimbledon train station in south-west London with a box of chocolate flavoured glow-in-the-dark condoms and pink children’s underwear from Primark. He also had an Easter egg for each child, heart-shaped hairbands and a Lego toy, Southwark Crown Court heard. MailOnline can also be revealed the entertainer, who is based in Brighton, was filmed at the 2011 Pride Festival making jokes about being a sex offender. 'I'm sweating like a paedophile in Mothercare it's so hot in here', he told the crowd during his drag gig. Today the court heard in a series of online chats last March, Clothier confessed to having ‘naughty thoughts’ about his own nieces and nephews, but had never acted upon them as he did not want to ‘hurt his family’. He said he was ‘turned on’ while purchasing the pink underwear and had chosen a particular set because it was ‘sexy’. When he was caught he said he had stocked up on condoms as it was ‘best to be prepared’. He described being constantly aroused while thinking about the children and how he was excited and honoured to meet them, adding that, if everything went well, it would not be ‘just a one off’, prosecutor Mervyn Burton told the court. Following Clothier’s arrest police raided his Brighton home and found a string of child porn images, including 18 cartoon images of fathers abusing their sons. On stage: Lady James (left), on stage with another drag artist as he joked about 'sweating like a paedophile in Mothercare' He also shared an image of a naked teenage boy bending over, Mr Burton said. Sentencing Clothier to a total of 26 months in prison, Judge Deborah Taylor said: ‘It’s clear from the chat room logs that you were expressing an interest to engage in sexual activity with the children. ‘You arranged to meet Mark, having said you bring protection, including condoms which were chocolate flavoured and glowed in the dark. ‘You also bought underwear for the daughter, who you believed to be 11, and other presents to make yourself more acceptable to the children. ‘I take into account that you are of previous good character and all the indications are you have not involved yourself in previous offences of this kind. ‘But these are serious offences and ones which the courts take very seriously indeed.’ Lying in wait: Officers pounced as soon as Clothier arrived at Wimbledon station, which led to his prosecution and jail term . Gareth Morgan, defending Clothier, said he had a ‘troubled background’ which led to him developing an interest in ‘liaisons with what he considers father figures’. ‘He has been candid from the outset and fully accepts his guilt. ‘His intentions lay towards ‘Mark’ and had he been faced with the children he very much doubts he would have done anything with them. ‘He has never been before the courts before and has led a blameless life to date.’ Clothier has also been involved in charity work for the Brighton Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual (LGBT) Pride association. He admitted arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, making indecent images of children, distributing images of children and possessing prohibited images of children. Judge Taylor also order that Clothier’s computer and the indecent images should be forfeited and destroyed. He will also be subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order restricting his access to children under 16 and internet use and must also sign the Sex Offenders’ Register.","Robert Clothier set up sexual liaison with 'Mark' and his children online .

The Met Office predicted highs of up to 21C across the country today and the mercury will hit 23 tomorrow - matching yesterday's hottest day of the year so far. But forecasters predict the the warm spell will end on Saturday - just in time for the school Easter holidays. Although, despite temperatures dropping to 12, there is still little sign of any rain - prompting new drought warnings.Temperatures are likely to pick up mid-week, but only as high as 16C. It comes after almost a week of unseasonably warm and sunny weather. Amazingly, rather than the south of England, it was the Scottish village of Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, which recorded the highest temperature of the year so far as the mercury hit 22.9.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust jumpsuit and hand-written lyrics are among items chosen from the singer's vast collection of 60,000 objects set to go on public display for the first time. Bowie, 65, gave curators at London's Victoria and Albert museum rare access to his huge personal archive in New York for what is being billed as the first museum Bowie retrospective. More than 300 objects have been selected for the show which opens next spring and will feature instruments, sketches, musical scores, diary entries and album artwork. Cultural Icon: An exhibition of items chosen from David Bowie's personal . archive of 60,000 objects will go on display at the V&A museum in . London . The museum, which plans to hold an academic symposium on the singer, picked out 60 stage costumes as well as photography, film, music videos, set designs and storyboards. The show has been curated by the V&A and Bowie recently took to Facebook to deny that he was directly involved in the exhibition. 'Contrary to recently published reports relating to the announcement by the V&A of an upcoming David Bowie exhibition, I am not a co-curator and did not participate in any decisions relating to the exhibition,' he said.

David Bowie's Union Jack coat designed by Alexander McQueen featured on the cover of 1997's  Earthling album and, right, a self portrait pose also adopted for the Heroes album cover in 1978 . 'The David Bowie Archive gave unprecedented access to the V&A and museum's curators have made all curatorial and design choices.' Organisers said the show would trace the star's 'reinvention across five decades', the way he inspired others to 'pursue freedom of expression' and his influence on movements in art and culture. Curators said Bowie's influence was not just cultural but political and that he was a worthy subject of a university doctorate. Co-curator Geoffrey Marsh said: 'We're aiming for a ground-breaking exhibition to reflect a ground-breaking artist'. Trend setter: The London-born singer has enjoyed success across five-decades and has influenced many of today's current stars . A photograph from The Man Who Fell To Earth sessions.

'dedicated fan who already knows everything' and its general audience. He said: 'Bowie has played a crucial role in the shaping of modern society because of his focus on personal self-expression. 'He . might not have intended to do this ... but help change the world he did . and the ripples of those changes continue to move outwards around the . globe today.' Costumes include the Ziggy Stardust . jumpsuit (1972), designed in collaboration with Bowie and inspired by . Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Orange. Bowie appeared on Top Of The Pops with . flame-orange hair, make-up, multi-coloured clothing and red patent . boots to perform Starman, the first single from the album The Rise And .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Former members of the KKK have revealed even they considered the elderly White Supremacist who allegedly shot dead three people in an anti-Semetic rage 'a loose cannon.' Johnny Lee Clary, an ex-national leader in the KKK with the title Grand Wizard, said Tuesday that he chose to stay away from Frazier Glenn Cross aka Glenn Miller, who is charged with three counts of murder in the Kansas City killing spree Sunday. 'I wanted nothing to do with him. I knew he was a lose cannon,' Clary said. Scroll down for video . Precautions: Frazier Glenn Cross chose to wear a quilted sleeveless vest rather than clothes during his Tuesday court appearance . 'Loose cannon': Former members of the KKK Johnny Lee Clary, right, and Scott Shepard, left, have revealed even they considered the White Supremacist 'a loose cannon' He added in the interview with the Huffington Post: 'I knew good and well if I continued to be around somebody like that, I was going to end up dead.' Scott Shepard, another reformed KKK member, also questioned the man's character. He told the news website that he believed going around with the 73-year-old would make him a 'more violent person.' 'He stood out as a really violent person,' Shepard said. 'At the time, I probably didn't have enough sense to be scared. I was indoctrinated into that life and I believed everything they said.' Separate hate crime charges are expected to be filed later. He is the prime suspect in the horror shooting that targeted a Jewish Community Center and retirement center. The startling character judgements came as Kansas prosecutors filed state-level murder charges against the white supremacist. Cross has been charged with one count of capital murder for the deaths of 14-year-old boy and his grandfather outside the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City. Hateful: Cross, pictured, appeared to target Jews but none of his victims in fact belonged to the faith . Charged: Cross, 73, now faces three counts of murder and is expected to have hate crimes brought against him following the triple homicide on Sunday at two Jewish facilities near Kansas City . Cross also faces one count of . first-degree, premeditated murder for the death of a woman who was . gunned down while visiting her mother at a nearby retirement complex. The capital murder charge carries the death penalty as possible punishment and Cross is being held on $10million bond. The 73-year-old Vietnam War veteran is scheduled to appear in court at 1.30pm Tuesday in Johnson County District Court. Cross was arrested Sunday after shooting and killing three people at two different Jewish centers in Kansas City, Kansas. Cross is from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party. None of Sunday's victims were Jewish: . Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood, . 14, were at the community center for a singing contest audition, while . 53-year-old Terri LaManno was visiting her mother at the retirement . complex. Familiar: Cross, seen during his arrest on Sunday and in the subsequent mugshot, was put in witness protection in 1987 in exchange for testimony on fellow KKK members . The Southern . Poverty Law Center also monitors, to varying degrees, the activities of . hundreds of known white supremacists and anti-Semites at any given time. Federal authorities were . well-aware of the racist war vet, as were the SPLC and the ADL, who . sometimes was known as Frazier Glenn Miller. After a 1986 contempt-of-court conviction in North Carolina for operating a paramilitary camp, Cross went in hiding while free on bond and fled to Missouri. There, federal agents found him and several other men in a rural mobile home stocked with hand grenades, automatic weapons and thousands of bullets. Cross entered federal witness protection programs in 1987, according to The Wall Street Journal, and agreed to cooperate with authorities. It is not clear when the protection ended. Indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of SPLC founder Morris Dees, Cross served three years in federal prison but avoided a longer sentence in exchange for testifying against more than a dozen other KKK leaders. Victims: Dr. William Lewis Corporan, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood (left) were at the Jewish Community Center for a singing competition while Terri LaManno (right) was visiting her mother at a Jewish assisted living facility. None of the victims were Jewish . 'We were aware he was affiliated with certain hate groups,' FBI special agent Michael Kaste said at a Monday press conference. Federal prosecutors say there's enough evidence to warrant putting the case before a grand jury as a hate crime. Moving the case from state to federal prosecutors would likely mean tougher punishments if Cross is convicted. 'The motivation behind these attacks was a hate crime... He was trying to hurt someone based on race or ethnicity,â€™ FBI agent Kaste said at a Monday press conference. Before the shootings, Cross had been contemptuous of some of his like-minded allies' reliance on social media over violent confrontation. 'He felt it was easy to be a 'keyboard commando,' but that the only way activists will ever succeed is by going out on the streets,' said Devin Burghart, the vice president of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. History of violence: Authorities were aware of Frazier Glenn Cross (who also went by the name Glann Miller) since the early 1980s when he founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, seen here in 1984 . Racist: In recent years, watchdog groups were aware of Cross, seen here in an undated photo, and viewed him as a possible threat but because he had stopped posting as often, they became less concerned . Burghart said his group made a presentation on white supremacists to the Jewish Community Center in August, a discussion that included a description of Cross as an example of dangerous anti-Semitic figures in the region. It wasn't clear what, if any, steps were taken by the center to act on the information. The timing of the attack is worth . noting, as a group monitoring anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. cautiously reported a sharp decline in such incidents less than two . weeks before this weekendâ€™s attack. In . a report April 1, the Anti-Defamation League noted a 19 per cent drop . in anti-Semitic incidents last year compared to 2012, part of what the . group called a 'decade-long downward slide' and one of its lowest . tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979.","Johnny Lee Clary, an ex-national leader in the KKK with the title Grand Wizard, said Tuesday that he chose to stay away from Frazier Glenn Cross aka Glenn Miller .

"By . Bianca London . We bargain-hunting Brits are happy to scrimp on staycations and budget for our weekly shop - but when it comes to weddings, we are less skilful at saving our pennies. According to a new study, the average Brit spends an eye-watering £440 for every wedding we attend - that amounts to an entire week's salary every time someone ties the knot. And with most of us attending five weddings per year, our matrimonial attendance is costing us a total of £2,180 every year. Hey big spender: The average Brit spends a whole week's wages being a wedding guest and most attend five a year, which tots up to £2,180! Not surprisingly, the British women . surveyed saw their outfit as being the most important part of being a . wedding guest. With so many cameras flashing and potential Facebook tags awaiting, it comes as no surprise that a staggering 70 per cent of women choose to spend more on their outfit . than they do on their accommodation. Accommodation came in second place when it came to costs, with 61 per cent shelling out over £150 for an evening of celebration. When it comes to a wedding gift, over half of those generous wedding guests surveyed said they spend over £100 on a present for the happy couple. The least amount of money gets spent on alcohol, with 44 per cent spending over £50 on tipples on the big day. Helen North, Head of Marketing for fashion brand Kaleidoscope who commissioned the survey said: 'We all know that weddings are a billion pound industry in the UK, and that they can be a very costly affair for the bride and groom. But what about the guests? Splashing the cash: 70 per cent of women choose to spend more on their outfit than accommodation, with the least amount of money being spent on alcohol . 'We commissioned this survey as we wanted to reveal the expenditure the average guest faces attending the nuptials of our nearest and dearest. 'The cost of weddings is always considered from the perspective of the bride and groom, but just how much does it cost the guests and where do they see the need to spend money to ensure they are the very best wedding guest. 'It’s wonderful to see from our survey results that despite the current economic climate, it is still important for British men and women to celebrate weddings in style.'","Average Brit spends a substantial £440 per wedding .

This isn't his first brush with the law. In December, Haynes was charged with animal cruelty for setting a cat on fire on Christmas Eve. The Monmouth County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told Asbury Park Press that Haynes was charged with using a lighter and aerosol spray to ignite the box while the animal was inside. The cat escaped but was later found dead from its injuries. Haynes is due in municipal court for that crime on February 11. Workers at the Petco on the same strip as the Bed, Bath & Beyond where Kerri Dalton was stabbed told reporters that Haynes often went into the store to stare at the animals. Clinical psychologist Dr Bart Rossi told CBS that cruelty to animals is often a prelude to violence against humans. 'This is not the result of a couple of bad days or a bad month.

A group of tourists on their way back from sightseeing at the Grand Canyon are lucky to be alive after their tour bus was swept away by flood waters in northern Arizona this afternoon. The water then carried the bus 300 yards before it flipped onto its side in the flooded wash. In all, 33 people were on the bus when it flipped. Thankfully, none of them were injured. A spokesman for the Northern Arizona Consolidated Fire District said the incident happened just before 2 p.m. He said the bus approached a low-lying area and was swept away by a flash flood. Swept Away: A flash flood in Arizona swept this tour bus 300 yards downstream before flipping it over . Lucky: nobody was hurt when this bus flipped over after get swept away by a flash flood . The passengers and the driver managed to escape the bus by climbing through windows and swimming to dry land. By the time the passengers had escaped, the water had risen to 8 feet in some areas. Arizona is in the middle of its monsoon season, when flash-floods are common in some of the low-lying areas and mountain passes. In many cases, what appears to be little more than a few inches of rain covering a section of a roadway is actually a fast-moving stream capable of sweeping away things as large and heavy as a bus. For decades, state and local officials in Arizona have urged motorists to not attempt to cross flooded roadways, regardless of how shallow the water appears. But people continue to do it, and frequently end up with a fate similar to the bus that was swept away this afternoon. Aftermath: The road is dry after a flash flood swept a tour bus 300 yards downstream . Tourists: The group on the bus was headed back to Las Vegas after spending the visiting the Grand Canyon . Emergency responders then would be forced to assist these motorists - rescue efforts that were paid for by state and local municipalities. In 1995, Arizona passed a law dubbed 'The Stupid Motorist Law,' which allows the state to hold people financially responsible for any rescue efforts that are needed to save them if they attempt to cross a flooded roadway and get swept away. The law states that a stupid motorist 'may be liable for expenses of any emergency response that is required to . remove from the area the driver or any passenger in the vehicle that . becomes inoperable in the area or the vehicle that becomes inoperable in . the area, or both.' Monsoon: Arizona's monsoon season creates flash floods across the state - and gets plenty of 'stupid motorists' swept away by fast-moving streams . In addition to covering the expenses of the rescue effort, motorists can be fined up to $2,000. Arizona rescue official Pat Moore told Phoenix's ABC15 that he thinks the driver of the bus should be cited for driving the bus across standing water. However, it will be up to the Mojave County Sheriff's Office to determine whether the driver will be cited.","All the passengers and the driver escaped the bus without injury .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Protest: Udar Party leader Vitali Klitschko (front) attends a protest against the Ukrainian Government's decision to reject an EU trade deal . The European Union’s expansion project was dealt a blow yesterday, after Ukraine rejected a trade agreement in order to appease Russia. Hundreds of demonstrators, including boxing star Vitali Klitschko, took to the streets of Kiev on Thursday to protest after the government put a free trade deal with the EU on ice. Ukranian prime minister Mykola Azarov said his cabinet had rejected the agreement because the EU could not offer Ukraine any compensation if the country lost trade with Russia. The decision by Ukraine – one of the last remaining countries in Europe not to have joined the EU – represents a major setback to the ambitions of Brussels. Russia controls Ukraine’s gas supply, shares a border with the state and has been accused of threatening its neighbour with reprisals if it became the latest former ally to ‘defect’. But yesterday president Putin, speaking in St Petersburg, denied putting any pressure on Ukraine. Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk has now called for more protests, saying: ‘We will fight against the anti-Ukrainian, anti-European regime. Come and fight for your rights, for your European future.’ Braving a freezing rain, up to 3,000 people voiced their desire to move back toward the West and away from the Moscow-aligned course on which President Viktor Yanukovych was taking the country. It was the same day Ukraine marked the anniversary of the Orange Revolution that overturned a fraudulent presidential election result and brought a Western-leaning government to power. Similar rallies were also held in other cities across Ukraine, and a much bigger demonstration was planned in Kiev for Sunday. Anger: Braving a freezing rain, up to 3,000 people voiced their desire to move back toward the West and away from the Moscow-aligned course on which President Viktor Yanukovych was taking the country . The weekend rally will test the strength of the opposition, and some say that a large showing may nudge Yanukovych back in the direction of the EU. 'We must press these leaders to the end so that the agreement is signed next week,' said world heavyweight boxing champion and opposition leader Vitali Klitschko. 'We must force them to fulfill what they have promised.' One key EU demand in the free trade and political cooperation deal is the freeing of Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko - the heroine of the Orange Revolution and Yanukovych's arch-enemy. Tymoshenko said Friday she was ready to urge the EU to drop demands for her release if that would persuade Yanukoyvch to sign the agreement. There was no immediate reaction from the EU. Tymoshenko, whose incarceration the West calls politically motivated, also urged Ukrainians to take to the streets to protest the government's decision. 'She is calling on everybody to come out and express your civic position on the squares of all the cities of the country,' Tymoshenko's lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko said yesterday. Outrage: Similar rallies were also held in other cities across Ukraine, and a much bigger demonstration was planned in Kiev for Sunday . An EU spokeswoman said Yanukovych is still welcome to attend a scheduled summit in Vilnius, Lithuania during which the two sides had been intending to sign the agreement. Ukraine's decision to suspend preparations for the agreement was a big victory for Russia, which has worked aggressively to derail the deal and keep Ukraine in its orbit. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov sought to defend the decision in parliament Friday, but was booed by opposition lawmakers, who chanted 'Shame' and threw stacks of papers at his ministers. He also complained that the conditions the International Monetary Fund has set for rescuing Ukraine's struggling economy with a bailout loan were impossible to fulfill. Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russian in the EU. Russia's President Vladimir Putin, speaking in St. Petersburg on Friday, denied twisting Ukraine's arm, and, in turn, accused the EU of using 'pressure and blackmail' against Ukraine. He said: 'It will become clear in the next few days whether Ukraine and its leadership will yield to pressure or will be able to resist it and take a pragmatic stance in line with national interests.' In the 2010 presidential election Yanukovych narrowly defeated Tymoshenko. The next year, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison on abuse of office charges.","Around 3,000 protestors took to the streets of Kiev to demonstrate .
