"Islamic State militants have seized a major Syrian air base, wiping out the last government stronghold in a province dominated by jihadists. The extremists won a week-long battle today to capture the sprawling Tabqa base 25 miles from their stronghold in Raqqa, reportedly killing dozens of soldiers in the process. The base was reportedly one of the military's largest  facilities in the region, with several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition. Dubious celebration: Islamic State extremists smiled broadly and embraced today after they won a bloody battle to seize the Tabqa air base, the last surviving government outpost in Syria's Raqqa province . Damage: The capture followed several days of fighting between Islamic State militants and Syrian government forces. Pictured, A man inspects damage at the entrance of a Tabqa hospital after a government air strike . Its capture is a huge blow to President Assad's regime and will spark concern over the treatment of any survivors. Militants beheaded Syrian soldiers and impaled their heads on fence posts when they captured similar bases, including the sprawling Division 17 base in Raqqa. There were several failed efforts to breach the facility's walls in recent days but the facility was captured today, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Despite government airstrikes to try to beat back the attack, the jihadis quickly quashed the remaining pockets of resistance, killing dozens of soldiers. Sprawling: An image of what is believed to be the air base, just south of the city of Tabqa, shows its long fence . Arsenal: Campaigners say the base contained weapons and jets which may now be used by the militants . Spies are close to identifying the hooded jihadist dubbed Jailer John who beheaded the journalist James Foley, Britain's ambassador to the U.S. revealed today. 'I can't say more than this but I know from my colleagues at home that we are close,' Peter Westmacott told CNN. 'We're putting a lot into it and there are sophisticated technologies, voice identification and so on which people can use to check who these people are'. A 'significant force' of SAS soldiers and signallers have deployed to northern Iraq in the hunt for the extremists, who spoke with British accents and callously boasted of making personal fortunes from ransoms paid for other released hostages. The gang openly talked of making so much money they could ‘retire to Kuwait or Qatar’, according to testimonies by former hostages obtained by The Mail on Sunday. 'Some of the Syrian regime troops pulled . out and now the Islamic State is in full control of Tabqa,' said . Observatory director Rami Abdurrahman. 'This makes Raqqa province the first to fully fall out of government hands.' Another activist group, the Local Coordination Committees, also said the extremist group was in control. The SANA state news agency confirmed that the government had lost the air base, saying troops 'are successfully reassembling after evacuating the airport.' Fighters have swept through a huge tract of northeastern Syria after seizing control of much of northern and western Iraq in June. From their Syrian stronghold in Raqqa they have declared a self-styled caliphate, a Sunni regime ordering its subjects to operate under an extreme interpretation of Sharia law. It has opened up three fronts in the fighting in Syria, which is already home to a bloody and long-running civil war between President Assad's forces and anti-government rebels. Islamist militants have fought soldiers from both sides of the previous conflict making large parts of the country unstable.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said: 'Some of the Syrian regime troops pulled out, and now the Islamic State is in full control of Tabqa' Key target: The extremists won a week-long battle to capture the sprawling Tabqa base 25 miles from their stronghold in Raqqa, reportedly killing dozens of soldiers in the process . Taking opponents at first by surprise and building a reputation for callous ruthlessness, militants have  overwhelmed outposts held by rival rebels in Deir el-Zour province, which borders Iraq, . But the have also systematically picked off isolated government bases in the northeast, decapitating army commanders and pro-government militiamen and putting their heads on display. Last month Islamic State fighters overran the sprawling Division 17 military base in Raqqa, killing at least 85 soldiers.

CCTV footage has emerged reportedly showing the moment five separate British jihadis strolled through the departure lounge of Gatwick Airport on their way to fight in Syria. They are all among more than 500 Britons who have enlisted with jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, prompting warnings of new terror laws from the Home Secretary. The Gatwick video, which emerged today, purports to show a group of five British jihadis from Portsmouth leaving the airport for Turkey early on October 8 last year.

Mashadur Choudhury, 31 (left) returned weeks later and became the first Briton to be convicted over the current conflict in Syria. Former Primark worker Muhammad Rahman (right) was killed while fighting . According to the Sunday Telegraph, the men booked a return journey but instead used an intermediary to cross the border into Syria where they joined militants. One of the men is said to be 31-year-old Mashadur Choudhury, who returned just weeks later and in May became the first Briton to be convicted of a terror offence in relation to the current conflict. His 12-day trial at Kingston Crown Court saw social media evidence of him talking about dying a martyr's death and setting up a group called the al-Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys. The trial also heard how he went on a spending spree with £35,000 which he had borrowed from his family, including a £17,000 Audi A6 and £200 prostitutes. Toll: At least one of the men who is reportedly pictured in the footage has since been killed, said his father . Another of the men was reportedly fellow Portsmouth resident Muhammad Hamidur Rahman. The 25-year-old was sacked from his job as a Primark store supervisor a month before he left for Syria last October. His time as an Islamist fighter was short-lived, as his father said earlier this month that he had been killed during the conflict. The ease with which the men left the country comes despite promises of new laws to crack down on British extremists by the Home Secretary Theresa May. Yesterday she insisted authorities had already excluded more than 150 people from Britain. But she was also widely mocked by Labour, a Muslim MP and outspoken Tory David Davis over proposed new laws to stop radical preachers when they were likened to 'Asbos for terrorists'.","Jihadists began long-anticipated attack on sprawling Tabqa base last week .

"A Princeton graduate accused of killing his multimillionaire father spoke to cops about his physique, exercise regime and diet in the hours after his arrest, but did not mention his death, court documents have revealed. Tommy Gilbert Jr, 30, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to shooting Thomas Gilbert Sr, 70, in the head at his luxury Manhattan home last month. The 6'3' former aspiring model appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court  handcuffed and dressed in his Department of Corrections orange jumpsuit with prison-issue sneakers. His blonde surfer locks were cropped short and his once-groomed facial hair was now long and unkempt. According to court documents, Gilbert was asked in the hours after his arrest by a detective how he kept in such good shape. 'A lot of it is diet and exercise,' Gilbert said. Asked if he ran marathons, he said, 'I'm not a distance runner.' Scroll down for video . Tommy Gilbert Jr, 30, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to the second-degree murder of his father during a hearing at Manhattan Criminal Court. Documents revealed he spoke to cops about his physique and diet plan in the hours after he was arrested . Gilbert Jr, 30, appeared in court today with his hands cuffed behind his back. He has been charged with shooting Thomas Gilbert Sr in the head at his luxury Manhattan home in a row over his allowance last month . During an interview after his arrest, Gilbert (mugshot right) was asked by a detective how he kept in such good shape. He replied: ''A lot of it is diet and exercise.' Asked if he ran marathons, he said, 'I'm not a distance runner.' Gilbert Jr, who attended the prestigious Deerfield Academy prior to Princeton and was seen at some of Manhattan's most exclusive society events, was charged with second-degree murder and related crimes. Seated with his defense attorney, Alex Spiro, Gilbert responded in a deep, level voice: 'Not guilty.' The defendant remained seated at a table with hands cuffed behind his back during the brief appearance, nervously tapping his feet on the floor. A court officer stood behind his chair and another officer to the side. Defense attorney Alex Spiro objected to the presence of press photographers in court to Judge Jackson. His request was denied. Mr Spiro said outside court that his objection  was because the murder case is circumstantial without eyewitnesses. 'Because of the garb that they had him wearing, I think it's prejudicial to have his photo published,' the lawyer said. He didn't comment further. Spiro is a Harvard-educated criminal lawyer from one of the city's top firms. It's not clear who is paying the attorney's fee. Gilbert's next court date has been set for April 30. He is being held without bail at Rikers Island. Gilbert remained seated during the brief hearing at the court where he was kept company by courts officers . Gilbert's defense attorney Alex Spiro (left) is a Harvard-educated lawyer. It is unclear who is paying his fees . A grand jury voted to indict Gilbert last month over the death of his 70-year-old father, boss of $200million Wainscott Capital Partners. The New York Medical Examiner's office confirmed to Daily Mail Online last month that Gilbert Sr. died of a gunshot wound. An autopsy ruled his cause of death as a homicide. Thomas Gilbert Sr was found dead by his wife Shelley in the bedroom of his luxury midtown apartment on January 4, shot once in the head. Gilbert Jr. had allegedly tried to stage the body to make it look like a suicide - placing the .40-caliber Glock pistol on his chest. He allegedly murdered his father after he cut the 30-year-old's allowance from $600 a week to $400 and threatened to stop paying the rent on his $2,400-a-month Chelsea apartment, according to authorities. Police found a case for the weapon, as well as extra magazines and ammunition at Gilbert Jr.'s apartment when they broke down the door and found him hiding out there hours after the murder. Gilbert Jr answered not guilty to charges of second-degree murder and related crimes in court in New York on Thursday . Gilbert Jr confers with his defense attorney in the Manhattan courtroom. The defendant is due back in court on April 30 . Gilbert Jr was arrested on murder charges the following day. Investigators also discovered a skimming device - used for stealing credit card numbers - and 21 blank credit cards inside the ground-floor home. The death of Thomas Gilbert Sr., 70,  was ruled a homicide last month after he suffered a gunshot wound to the head . Gilbert Jr. is also the main suspect in a September blaze that destroyed a historic Hamptons mansion that belonged to the family of a former friend-turned love rival, according to multiple reports. The New York Post reported that Gilbert Jr. burned down the home belonging to the family of Peter Smith Jr. because he believed Smith was sleeping with his girlfriend. Three days after the blaze - which razed the 19th-century mansion - Gilbert Jr. was arrested by Southampton police for violating a protective order taken out by Smith Jr. He was later released on bail, though that trial remains ongoing. He has not been charged with any crime related to the fire. Gilbert Jr., was a fixture at New York society events - often seen with a different women on his arm at charity galas and parties. But he was jobless, and didn't seem to have any interest in finding serious employment - despite graduating from Princeton with a degree in economics. Instead, friends said, he was a yoga enthusiast and gym rat who spent most of his time at his family's $10million Hamptons home, where he enjoyed surfing. Gilbert Sr. was a longtime Wall Street fixture, who ran the $200million hedge fund Wainscott Capital. His son's ex girlfriend, twice-divorced Manhattan socialite Anna Rothschild, 49, said Tommy was obsessed with his father. He frequently complained about how controlling he was with money and said that his father was hard on him. Gilbert Jr. said he was upset because 'nothing he ever did was good enough' for his dad, Ms Rothschild said. Friends and family said that Gilbert Jr. suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder that had become more severe in recent years and made his behavior increasingly erratic. When he went to his parents' apartment on January 4 to confront his father, he sent his 70-year-old mother out and get him a sandwich and a soda. When she was gone, he is believed to have killed his father, investigators say. His mother, Shelley, returned 15 minutes later because she had a 'bad feeling' and found her husband had been executed.

"Argentine investigators have failed to find an intelligence chief wanted over the death of a prosecutor who had accused the country's president of a cover up. Officials were unable to locate ex-counter intelligence boss Antonio Stiusso at three different addresses held in his name - and are unsure if he is even in the country. He is wanted after the death of prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who had accused President Cristina Fernandez of covering up Iran's alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenes Aires that left 85 dead. Alberto Nisman (pictured) was discovered dead in his own apartment in January - a day before he was due to testify about his claims . Officials in Argentina were unable to locate ex-counter intelligence boss Antonio Stiusso (pictured) at three different addresses held in his name - and are unsure if he is even in the country . Alberto Nisman had accused President Cristina Fernandez (pictured) of covering up Iran's alleged role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish centre in Buenes Aires that left 85 dead . Nisman's body was discovered in an apartment in January - a day before he was due to testify about his claim that Fernandez sought to whitewash his findings that Iran was behind the attack on the centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association. One top official acknowledged the government did not know if Stiusso, who had been regarded as one of the most powerful operatives in Argentina's leading spy agency, was even in the country. 'He was not at any of the properties registered as his own,' Oscar Parrilli, head of the Intelligence Secretariat (SI), told . reporters. Stiusso's lawyer also appeared to be in the dark. 'I assume he is in the country, but I don't know,' Santiago . Blanco Bermudez told local TV station Channel 26. Iran has vigorously denied involvement in the bombing and . Fernandez has dismissed Nisman's findings as absurd. She said . Nisman was duped by rogue agents involved in a power struggle . and killed when he was no longer of value to them. One of those spies was Stiusso, Fernandez's government has . said. Fired during a December shake-up of the SI, Stiusso had . helped Nisman with his investigation of the bombing. 'I have no doubts that Stiusso is behind all this, after the . decision of (President Fernandez) to fire him from the SIDE,' Anibal Fernandez, the president's chief of staff, said on . Twitter on Tuesday, referring to the top spy agency by its . former name. Thee 1994 bombing of a Buenes Aires Jewish centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association,  left 85 dead . Parrilli said secrecy laws would be lifted so that . investigators could grill Stiusso fully about the mysterious . events leading up to Nisman's death. He said the president . wanted 'the whole truth to be known.' Stiusso's spy career spanned four decades. He was one of the . most feared men in the intelligence agency, which played an . important role in the military government's 'dirty war' against . suspected Marxist rebels, union leaders and other leftists in . the 1970s. Since democracy was restored in 1983, successive governments . are widely believed to have continued to use the agency to snoop . on opponents. Stiusso, whose name is often spelled Stiuso in . Argentina, is believed to have been at the heart of its . wiretapping operations.

"Video taken at Yellowstone National Park that was meant to show some bison roaming around may show something far more exciting and elusive.

Sadly, the video cuts away before a the creature gets any closer to the camera. A creature roaming in Yellowstone Park (circled in red) is believed to be bigfoot by one person . 'Or are we witnessing some ancient scene that has been going on for thousands and thousands of years? You decide,' says the YouTuber, who goes by the name ThinkerThunker, according to the Billings Gazette. As for the webcam footage, that comes from the good old National parks Service. Now these could also be cross-country skiers or park employees or grown men in gorilla costumes, but until it is proven as completely false, they could also be bigfoot. A pack, or flock, of bigfoots. The creature was captured on webcam video released by the National Park Service . This as almost 100 years after the first reported spotting of a yeti or Sasquatch or Bigfoot, there is still no proof the animals even exist. And, if they did, breeding would likely be a problem given how few there would be.

"In the future, those with hearing loss may no longer need a cochlear implant - instead they could hear with their mouths. At least, that's the vision of a group of Colorado researchers who are developing a hearing device that bypasses the ear altogether. The technology relies on a Bluetooth-enabled earpiece to detect sound and send electrical impulses to an electrode-packed retainer that wearers press their tongue against to 'hear.' Scroll down for video . The technology relies on a Bluetooth-enabled earpiece to detect sound and send electrical impulses to an electrode-packed retainer that wearers press their tongue against to 'hear' 'It's much simpler than undergoing surgery and we think it will be a lot less expensive than cochlear implants,' said John Williams, associate professor at Colorado State University. Professor Williams came up with the idea for the device during what he calls a 'research midlife crisis', when he also developed tinnitus - a constant, high-pitched ringing in his ears. He hit upon the idea that the tongue contains thousands of nerves and the region of the brain that interprets touch sensations from the tongue is capable of decoding complicated information. 'What we are trying to do is another form of sensory substitution,' Professor Williams said. Unlike hearing aids, which amplify sound, cochlear implants circumvent damaged areas of the ear and stimulate the auditory nerve directly. Professor John Williams (pictured)  from Colorado State University came up with the idea for the device during what he calls a 'research midlife crisis' Microphones outside the ear detect sounds and send them to a speech processor, which analyses the information and transmits it to a receiver where it is converted into electric impulses. A microphone attached to a Bluetooth earpiece detects sounds and words from the environment. These sounds  are transmitted to a receiver where they are converted to distinct patterns that represent a word. The receiver/processor sends these patterns of electric impulses to the electrode-dense retainer fitted to the roof of the mouth. The wearer presses his tongue to the retainer to feel the distinct pattern. With training, the brain is able to 'hear' or interpret that pattern and understand words being spoken. The implant sends those impulses directly to the auditory nerve. With training, the brain learns to recognise these impulses as useful sound information. The Colorado device operates in the same way except electric impulses are sent via Bluetooth to a retainer-like mouthpiece packed with electrodes. When users press their tongue against the device, they feel a distinct pattern of electric impulses as a tingling or vibrating sensation. The idea is that, with training, the brain will learn to interpret specific patterns as words, thus allowing someone to 'hear' with their tongue. The concept is not as far fetched as it first sounds. Phoneticists can identify specific words from the series of black lines on a sonogram. And people who lose their sight can learn to 'read' words again with Braille. When users press their tongue against the device, they feel a distinct pattern of electric impulses as a tingling or vibrating sensation. The idea is that, with training, the brain will learn to interpret specific patterns as words, thus allowing someone to 'hear' with their tongue . The notion that the human brain is 'set' by adulthood and therefore, unable to change how it receives and interprets information is inaccurate, said Leslie Stone-Roy, assistant professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. 'We have a remarkable amount of plasticity in our brain even as adults,' she said. 'We now know that is able to make changes and adapt to changes in incoming information, especially stimuli that are of importance to the individual.' Professor Williams and JJ Moritz, a CSU graduate student, have spent the past year building and testing prototypes of the technology. Their initial results are promising enough that they have filed a provisional patent for the technology and launched Sapien LLC, a start-up company, to help advance the technology. Professor Williams and his team believe that, once refined, their technology could turn the world of hearing devices on its ear.","The technology relies on a Bluetooth-enabled earpiece to detect sound .

"Bode Miller crashed out of the alpine ski world championship Super-G in Colorado on Thursday, exiting in the attacking style that has become his trademark. A shaken Miller was able to ski to the bottom of the hill, where he was greeted by a thundering ovation from the packed grandstand. Miller was taken to the hospital with a gruesome gash cutting across the back of his right calf after he exited the hill. Scroll down for video . Crash: American alpine skier Bode Miller crashed during the Super-G Thursday and was left with an open wound on the back of his leg . Calamity: With his wife Morgan and two children looking on from the finish area,  Miller launched into one of his patented charges, leading by more than half second at the second interval when disaster struck . Fall: Miller exited the hill and was taken to the hospital with a gruesome gash cutting across his right calf . Plummet: Miller twisted backwards, flying spread-eagled into the air before slamming violently onto the snow his skies exploded from his boots . Competing in his first race of the season after missing the start of the World Cup campaign following back surgery, Miller took a deep breath and pushed out of the start hut onto a sun-kissed Birds of Prey layout to loud cheers. With his wife Morgan and two children looking on from the finish area, the 37-year-old American launched into a charge, leading by more than half second at the second interval when disaster struck. As always, Miller raced on the edge searching for the most direct line possible to the finish. Instead, he clipped a gate with his left arm as he roared into the section of the course known as the Abyss. He was twisted backwards, flying spread-eagled into the air before slamming violently onto the snow his skies exploded from his boots. Miller tumbled down the hill before slowly coming to a stop and managed a small wave to the crowd. Wound: Bode Miller suffered a gash on the back of his leg from his fall . Back on his feet: Miller tumbled down the hill before slowly coming to a stop Thursday. He managed a small wave to the crowd . Family: Miller's wife looked on in horror while his daughter covered her eyes before he was helped up and skied down the hill despite an open wound . While coaches rushed to Miller's side, his wife looked on in horror while his daughter covered her eyes before he was helped up and skied down the hill despite an open wound. 'Bode was skiing outstanding, he was going for it absolutely sending it from top to bottom and putting down a run that inspired Americans, inspired the world,' said U.S. team head coach Sasha Rearick. 'Unfortunately in the Abyss he caught his arm on the gate, the force spun him around in an instant and he took a nasty crash. A real nasty crash.' Asked if he thought Miller would race again at these championships Rearick was cautious but hopeful, 'I hope so, we're waiting for evaluation.' Long a favorite performer on the White Circus, Miller has spent his career entertaining fans and bristling at authority often at odds with the U.S. ski team and the International ski Federation. He broke away from the U.S. association and started his own team travelling to races in a recreational vehicle that became known as the Bode-mobile and once threatened to start his own race circuit. Out of the running: The U.S. Ski Team tweeted Thursday Miller will not be at the world championships in Vail . Rebellious: Miller has spent his career entertaining fans and bristling at authority often at odds with the U.S. ski team and the International ski Federation . Smooch: Miller and wife Morgan Beck kissed in the wake of his dramatic crash . Updates: Miller posted this image of himself on Thursday and praised The Steadman Clinic . His resume includes six Olympic medals (one gold), five world championship medals (four gold), 33 World Cup wins and has twice been crowned overall World Cup champion. The U.S. Ski Team tweeted Thurday 'After watching replays, it looks like @MillerBode caught his arm in the gate, spinning him around. He sliced his leg open pretty deep.' The team later wrote that '.@MillerBode suffered a torn hamstring tendon and underwent surgery. He'll be out for the @Vail2015 World Champs.' Miller also posted on Twitter a photo of himself in a hospital bed giving a thumbs-up. He tweeted 'Out of a successful surgery for a severed hamstring tendon. Feeling lucky since things could have been way worse.' Miller said in a another tweet 'Thanks to my friends over at @SteadmanClinic for taking care of me' and included an emoticon of a thumbs-up.

"A  reptile store owner was arrested Thursday in Quebec, Canada, more than a year after his 100-pound snake escaped and killed two young boys. Jean-Claude Savoie's lawyer confirmed his arrest, but said authorities had not yet pressed charges and it's still unknown what crimes he may face.  Usually, police can only hold a suspect for 24 hours without an arraignment. It was on August 5, 2013 that Savoie's best friend's two young sons Connor, 6, and Noah Barthe, 4, were killed during a sleepover at his apartment, located above his shop Reptile Ocean in Campbellton, New Brunswick. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Jean-Claude Savoie (left) was arrested on Thursday, more than a year after his best friend's two sons Connor, 6 (center) , and Noah, 4 (right) were killed by a snake he owned . Scene: The two young boys were sleeping over at Savoie's house above his reptile store in Campbellton, New Brunswick on August 5, 2013 when the snake escaped . Killer? Savoie previously posted this picture of an African rock python to his Facebook, which may or may not be the 100-pound specimen which strangled the young boys to death . That night, Savoie's 14-foot African rock python escaped from its enclosure and crawled into the building's ventilation before dropping on top of the sleeping boys, and attacking them with a fatal squeeze. Savoie's lawyer Leslie Matchim said Thursday that the arrest didn't come as a surprise, considering the year-long investigation. However, she says her client was previously informed that charges wouldn't be pressed when the Royal Canadian Mounted Police wrapped up their investigation in July. 'After they sort of recanted that position and announced that in fact the investigation was ongoing, then … I can't say that I’m surprised that we're at the point we're at today,' Matchim told CBC. Animal lovers: Connor and Noah were the two sons of Savoie's best friend Mandy Tracertin, who posted the following pictures of them playing around in his store to Facebook . Little helpers: This picture posted to Connor and Noah's mother's Facebook page shows them cleaning out an enclosure for large reptiles at the store . While charges have not been announced yet, there's a strong chance that they will be related to the boys' deaths as opposed to violations against the store. Savoie's store was discovered to be unlicensed, but the Department of Natural Resources decided not to proceed with charges on those counts. Those issues would have also been the responsibility of the local province - not the RCMP. At the time of the tragic incident, MailOnline spoke to a reptile expert briefed by police who said that the snake had escaped from its enclosure before and was 'an accident waiting to happen'. 'This was preventable, if the snake had been kept safe and secure,' Bry Loyst, curator of the Indian River Reptile Zoo in Ottowa, told MailOnline. The two boys spent the day with Savoie and his son, swimming, barbecuing and playing with animals at a farm.  Connor and Noah were the sons of Savoie's best friend Mandy Trecartin. A reptile expert previously told MailOnline that the snake could have been attracted to the two boys because of the scent of animals on their bodies. 'Sadly, the snake could have mistaken them for a food item, which they weren't',the owner of Little Ray's Zoo in Ottowa said at the time. In a tragic twist of fate, the two boys would have usually spent Saturday and Sunday with their dad - but he was out of town on a trip to Boston. Change of plans: The boys usually spent Saturday and Sundays with their father - but he was out of town the night they were killed .","Jean-Claude Savoie was arrested in Quebec, Canada on Thursday .

He can't tell you how he feels,' Sandy Valentine told KFOR. Robby's infection began while he was in jail and spread because he didn't get the treatment he needed. As a result, doctors had to remove almost half of his skull. 'He asked for medical attention, and they gave him ibuprofen,' Valentine said. 'I knew he needed antibiotics. I knew he needed medical treatment, and he wasn't getting it.' Robby has a criminal record with multiple arrests, but family attorneys said his medical care is a civil rights issue, not a criminal matter. 'The county, the jail needs to provide (medical care). If that's not happening, then it's something that needs to be addressed,' said Brian Buswell, an attorney for the family.

"A new test which could spare thousands of women with breast cancer from having needless chemotherapy is to be available on the NHS. From April, hospitals in England can join a scheme that has cut the price of the Oncotype DX test. It was recommended by the health watchdog Nice 18 months ago but the cost of £2,000-£2,500 per patient deterred most NHS hospitals from using it. A new test which could spare thousands of women with breast cancer from having needless chemotherapy is to be available on the NHS (file picture) Genomic Health UK, which has not disclosed the new price, announced yesterday that the test was now an option for clinicians and patients in England. It looks at genes found in breast tissue removed during surgery and indicates how likely breast cancer recurrence is and whether chemotherapy will actually benefit the patient. An estimated 10,000 women each year who are at most risk of their cancer returning could be eligible for the test, and its use – when it is not clear whether a patient will benefit from chemotherapy – could mean some avoid the treatment. Research suggests only around 10 to 20 per cent of patients with early-stage breast cancer benefit from chemotherapy. Professor Kefah Mokbel, lead surgeon at the London Breast Institute, said ‘This is great news. For too long we’ve had to treat too many women in a blanket fashion – whatever their tumour is like, they are offered chemotherapy. ‘This is a real step forward and it’s fantastic news for the NHS. Around 25 per cent of women who have breast cancer will be eligible and some will be able to safely avoid chemotherapy.’ An estimated 10,000 women each year who are at most risk of their cancer returning could be eligible for the test and its use could mean some avoid the treatment (file picture) Professor Mokbel said younger women in their 40s often have chemotherapy to maximise their chances, when older women with similar characteristics might not get it. He said: ‘These younger women will get a more accurate picture of their risk.’ The test analyses a group of 21 genes found in breast cancer and results are reported as a ‘score’ between 0 and 100. This score indicates how likely the cancer is to return and whether chemotherapy will benefit the patient. The lower the score, the less likely the cancer is to come back and treatment is normally withheld at scores below 18. The higher the score is above 31, the more likely the cancer is to come back. If the figure is between 18 and 31, the benefit of chemotherapy is less clear. Professor Mokbel said scores in that range mean a woman will need to discuss the pros and cons with doctors. Professor Karol Sikora, chief medical officer of Cancer Partners UK, has visited the California-based facilities where the tests are sent for analysis, and said it was a highly organised business with test results coming back in seven days. He said: ‘There will be definite benefits for some women. In around 80 per cent of cases chemotherapy makes no difference to the outcome.’ Dr Emma Pennery, clinical director from Breast Cancer Care charity, said the test would be invaluable. She said: ‘Patients can suffer from debilitating effects for a long time and it can have a real impact on quality of life. ‘This test could enable some to avoid the brutal side-effects of chemotherapy without compromising their survival. ‘Every year in the UK 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer and treatment decisions can be extremely difficult. It is incredibly important that these women have all the information to help them make the best choice for them.’ Dr Andrea Pithers, of Genomic Health UK, said: ‘We will work with local hospitals to facilitate quick and equitable access throughout the country.’","Oncotype DX test studies genes found in tissue removed during surgery .

"A top aide to Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock resigned Thursday following published reports that he posted racially charged comments on social media. Benjamin Cole had served as the four-term Republican lawmaker's spokesman since March. Cole's October 13, 2013 Facebook posts were published in the middle of the government shutdown - and one of them called African-Americans 'animals.' Those posts were first reported and obtained by liberal website ThinkProgress Thursday and included comments mocking two black people outside his Washington apartment. Cole's Facebook page is now shut down. One post said 'So apparently the closing of the National Zoo has forced the animals to conduct their mating rituals on my street. #gentrifytoday Pt. 1.' Comments: Benjamin Cole, a top aide to Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock, resigned Thursday. Several Facebook posts he made were obtained and published by ThinkProgress and Buzzfeed . Remarks: Before his resignation, Cole had served as Rep. Aaron Schock's spokesman since March . Hidden: Cole's Facebook page is now down, but this and other posts have been preserved and circulated online . ThinkProgress reported 'That message included a video of a woman, shouting and seemingly engaged in an argument with someone not visible as she walked.' The news outlet preserved a post from that day which said '#gentrifytoday Pt. 3. 'This is where she finds another glass bottle, and breaks it on their stoop to use as a weapon.' A December 13, 2013 that was saved said 'one of the hood rats on my street just got shot by another hood rat. I was right there when the gun was fired.' A preserved Facebook post from last Thursday said: '""You white people need to learn."" 'That's what she said to me, after throwing an elbow at me as I walked by, and just before I filed an assault claim against a Black female accompanied by 4 Black males and 1 Hispanic male standing on 14th Street a W NW. '""Do you have a problem talking to me?"" 'That's what the Black Metro police officer said to me when he began asking me to explain what happened.' Racial exchange: Cole said last week 'The fact remains that White people who live in my building are routinely harassed by Black miscreants who blockade the sidewalks and entryways in front of and behind my building' Dialogue: Cole also seemingly joked about the 2012 film 'Django Unchained,' which follows a freed slave's quest for vengeance . Buzzfeed reported Thursday it found two more of Cole's Facebook posts. The first, from August 16, 2010, said 'thinks they should build a mosque on the White House grounds.' In the comments section on that post, Cole wrote 'I wasn't talking about the Ground Zero mosque. I just think it would be nice for the President to have his own house of worship, since he's not been able to find one suitable in DC since 2004 when he moved here.' The second was from January 22, 2013, in which Cole uploaded a video he described as 'Lata sucka!' and referred to 2012 film 'Django Unchained,' which follows a freed slave's quest for vengeance. Cole commented on his own post 'For a second, I thought maybe Quentin Tarantino was filming a new installment in the Django series. It was so very exciting. All the pretty lights. All the law enforcement. All the shouting.' Buzzfeed also found a comment Cole made on his January 29 post. It read 'I'm all too worried about the deportables, as you know. I am doing, however, my absolute best to put as many Black criminals who live and loiter on my street behind bars. And if I found any White, Hispanic, Arab, Aleutian, Islander, or other such race causing mischief in my neighborhood, I would pursue their arrest, prosecution, and imprisonment as well.' Gawker reported that nearly all of Cole's Facebook cover photos were of First Lady Michelle Obama. Former staffer: Benjamin Cole (left) worked for Illinois Republican Rep. Aaron Schock (right) Scandal: Earlier this week, Cole tried to stop a Washington Post reporter from taking photos of Schock's congressional office, which is decorated in a style modeled after the TV show 'Downton Abbey' Concern: 'Are you taking pictures of the office?' the Washington Post quoted Cole as asking a reporter. 'Who told you you could do that?' Schock (R-IL) said in a statement to The Peoria Journal Star 'I am extremely disappointed by the inexcusable and offensive online comments made by a member of my staff. I would expect better from any member of my team. Upon learning about them I met with Mr. Cole and he offered his resignation which I have accepted.'

A staff member then asked the reporter to delete the photos from his cell phone, the Post reported. A watchdog group has requested an ethics inquiry over the interior design work, which was donated by Illinois interior decorator Annie Brahler. House rules broadly prohibit members of Congress from accepting gifts or services valued at more than $50. The rules include numerous exemptions, including one that allows gifts from personal friends. Dismissal: A watchdog group has requested an ethics inquiry over the interior design work, which was donated by Illinois interior decorator Annie Brahler . Brahler, who owns an Illinois-based firm called Euro Trash, also decorated Schock's previous Washington office. Schock told ABC News Wednesday that he paid Brahler about $6,000 to decorate his office four years ago and will pay her again this year once he receives an invoice.

"French authorities are investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video titled Blow Up France 2 may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist- a source has claimed. The footage, released by French-speaking ISIS fighters on Tuesday, shows masked jihadists praising the attacks on Paris last month and calling on Muslims to carry out further terror attacks in France. In a chilling statement to camera, the terrorist says: 'Don’t give up and particularly don’t lower your weapons, don’t surrender, kill. Today it’s our darwa, kill them, you now have more than 4 million targets.' Scroll down for video . French authorities are said to be investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video (pictured in camouflage headgear) may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist . A source close to the French investigation into the kosher deli attacks, told CNN that authorities think the woman   in the video, seen wearing camouflage clothing and holding a weapon, could be Hayat Boumeddiene. Boumeddiene is the wife of Amedy Coulibaly, the Islamist gunman who killed four hostages at the kosher Hyper Cacher market in the eastern part of the French capital on January 9. He was killed by police following an hours-long standoff. Authorities are searching for Boumeddiene, who is also believed to have been a co-conspirator in attack. She is currently thought to be in Syria. Hayat Boumeddiene, wife of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, is believed to have appeared in the latest ISIS video . She and Coulibaly were married in a religious ceremony, but the marriage was not officially recognized under French law. The kosher supermarket attack followed the January 8 massacre by Islamic gunmen at Charlie Hebdo, a satire magazine. Gunmen brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi killed 12 people at the  magazine's offices in Paris. The next day, a French police officer was killed. Seventeen people were killed over those three days. The massacre caused a worldwide outcry and calls for the defense of free speech after ISIS claimed the cartoonists were murdered because they published pictures of the prophet Mohammed. But in the new ISIS video, the militants claimed: . 'Where is this freedom of speech? When in 2009, the cartoonist Siné, after drawing the Jews and Sarkozy’s son, was sacked by Charb and Charlie Hebdo.' The video also calls for more attacks on soldiers and police officers in France. The jihadist calls on French Muslims to: ''Kill a cop with a knife, take his gun, with his gun kill a soldier, with his shotgun throw yourself in the way of your God.' The latest ISIS video, by French-speaking fighters, calls for more attacks on soldiers and police officers in France . Fighters praise the terrorist attacks that took place in Paris last month at the offices of satirical cartoon Charlie Hebdo and at a kosher supermarket . They go on to warn the West that they cannot expect peace from the Islamist terrorists. 'If you fight for democracy, we will fight for Islam,' they said. 'You will have to accept that we will react fully to the numerous crimes you committed. You took our rights. Therefore you can't expect to be in peace.'

"Nick Clegg yesterday announced plans for an £8 billion tax hike after the election, as he laid the groundwork for a coalition with Labour. In a significant shift towards Labour’s position, Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems would pursue a higher ratio of tax rises to spending cuts if they find themselves still in power again after the election. He said this would involve ‘at least’ £8 billion in tax rises, more than half of which have yet to be set out. Scroll down for video . In a significant shift towards Labour’s position, Nick Clegg (left) said the Lib Dems would pursue a higher ratio of tax rises to spending cuts if they find themselves still in power again after the election. Right: Ed Miliband . David Cameron condemned the move, saying it would hit millions of ordinary families. But the shift opens the door to a potential post-election deal with Ed Miliband, who is also expected to raise taxes and reduce the pace of spending cuts if he wins power in May. The coalition has pursued a deficit reduction programme comprising 80 per cent spending and welfare cuts and 20 per cent tax rises. But the new Lib Dem plans will see that shift to 60 per cent cuts and 40 per cent tax rises after the election. The Conservatives want to clear the remaining budget deficit entirely through cuts to spending and benefits. Mr Clegg yesterday dismissed the Tory plans as ‘implausible and undeliverable’. Speaking at the Shangri La Hotel on the 52nd floor of the Shard building in London, Mr Clegg said his party’s ‘sensible, balanced approach would bring an end to the era of austerity in three years’ time while protecting public services and the most vulnerable in society. ‘Austerity should only be a means to an end - and the end is in sight,’ he said. Mr Clegg insisted that the planned tax rises would not hit those on low and middle incomes, and would not involve a rise in the headline rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT. But speaking at a campaign event in Leeds, Mr Cameron dismissed the Lib Dem proposals, warning that they would hit ‘hard-working people’. ‘I don’t think it is right to have a plan that involves really quite substantial tax increases that would hit hard working people,” he said. ‘I think that what we need now is a plan that the Conservative Party has set out which is to eradicate the remaining deficit, to start putting money aside during years of growth for a rainy day.’ Mr Clegg (pictured) said his party’s ‘sensible, balanced approach would bring an end to the era of austerity in three years’ time while protecting public services and the most vulnerable in society . The deputy Prime Minister was speaking at the Shangri La Hotel on the 52nd floor of the Shard in London . The Lib Dem shift came as a new analysis found the party now shares almost 100 policies, fuelling speculation that they are plotting a post-election Coalition. Agreement over major issues such as the mansion tax, votes at 16 and a green light for further government borrowing would make it easier for Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg to come to a deal in May. A commitment to implement in full the draconian recommendations of the Leveson Report into press regulation is also shared between the two leaders’ parties – as is a commitment to sex and relationship education in schools. The analysis by the Fabian Society and Centre Forum, two think tanks, suggests that agreement between Labour and the Lib Dems may be significantly easier than between the Tories and the Lib Dems. The two organisations, which are close to the respective parties, has identified 97 areas of agreement in their joint report, ‘Common Ground?’. These include fiscal rules which permit the government to borrow billions more, a mansion tax for properties over £2million, decarbonising the power sector by 2030, and major devolution of power and money to English councils. Other shared priorities include more free childcare for children under five, greater control over free schools and academies, the construction of at least 200,000 new homes a year, and restrictions on access to some benefits for EU migrants while supporting international students. The two parties also agree on a higher minimum wage, withdrawal of the winter fuel payment from the richest pensioners, votes at 16 and a commitment that the UK should ‘remain a committed member of the EU’ and of the European Convention on Human Rights.","Nick Clegg said Lib Dems would pursue higher ratio of tax rises to cuts .

"Senior Labour figures piled pressure on Ed Miliband over his row with British business last night, with one of the party’s biggest donors claiming it is ‘in danger of promoting communism’. And in a separate attack, former minister Geoffrey Robinson accused his party’s leadership of a ‘terrible, neglectful’ attitude to its relations with captains of industry. Mr Robinson, who worked in the Treasury as paymaster general alongside Mr Miliband, then an adviser to Gordon Brown, insisted: ‘The mood music is wrong. I don’t know how it’s happened but it needs to be corrected.’ Scroll down for video . Key donor: Hull City owner Assem Allam (left in the gold shirt) with Ed Miliband after inviting him to watch the team play . He told the Daily Politics: ‘The policies are right; the mood music is wrong. They are still New Labour, all the policies, all the statements on business. If they [the shadow Cabinet] haven’t given that impression it’s a terrible, neglectful omission on their part. ‘We have got to engage. We are not anti-business, we are not anti-trade union. We are for both of them.’ Assem Allam, the Egyptian-born entrepreneur and owner of Hull City football club, who donated £110,000 to Labour as recently as last June, accused the party of treating successful businessmen as if ‘they should go away and die’. ‘I create wealth, exports and jobs. What’s wrong with that? Labour is promoting socialism – and they’re in danger of promoting communism,’ Dr Allam said. Lord Noon, another prominent donor, who is now a Labour peer, criticised Ed Balls’ inability this week to recall a single business supporter’s name as well as Mr Miliband’s failure to mention the deficit in his conference speech last year. ‘I cringed when Ed Balls forgot the name of a business backer and Ed forgot whole paragraphs from his conference speech. It is very embarrassing,’ he said. He suggested the Labour leader and the Shadow Chancellor should ‘eat almonds’ – said to improve memory – ‘every day so they remember things when they speak in public’. Piling on the pressure: Former minister Geoffrey Robinson (pictured left with Ed Miliband) accused his party’s leadership of a ‘terrible, neglectful’ attitude to its relations with captains of industry . Sir Charles Dunstone, founder of Carphone Warehouse and one of 63 business figures who signed a letter supporting Labour in 2005, said he was ‘frightened’ by the idea of the party winning May’s general election. The business community felt ‘isolated’ by Labour’s shift to the left, he warned. ‘As a business person I’m frightened of an environment where there isn’t sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts,’ he said. ‘It feels like we have gone back to old Labour and business people feel very detached from the party.’ Mr Miliband has announced a series of policies taking aim at what he calls capitalist ‘predators’ across a range of industries from energy suppliers to private landlords. The latest row began at the weekend, when the Labour leader went to war with Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina after he expressed concern at the prospect of the party winning the election. Labour criticised Mr Pessina as a tax avoider and raised allegations about the tax affairs of the chain, which has 2,500 stores and 70,000 staff in Britain. His stance appears to have backfired badly, prompting other business leaders to join a chorus of warnings about Labour’s plans. Mr Miliband was defiant last night, insisting the row had revealed ‘a truth about our country’. ‘It was five days which showed the two different paths for Britain. The Conservatives believe that when a few at the top succeed, the country succeeds,’ he said in an interview with the Western Morning News. ‘We think a country succeeds with an economy based on a different idea, that it is only when working people succeed that Britain succeeds.’ Mr Robinson said a warning from former M&S boss Lord Rose that Mr Miliband is a ‘Seventies throwback’ who is ‘blowing apart’ Britain’s pro-business consensus in an article for the Daily Mail earlier this week was deeply worrying. Describing Lord Rose, who advised Mr Brown and is now a Conservative peer, as a ‘very good man’, he added: ‘If Stuart Rose can say that there is something obviously wrong with our communication with business.’ ■ Ed Miliband has admitted that he will be hit by the mansion tax on his £2.7million home. The Labour leader whose four-bedroom home North London has risen in value by £1.1million since it was bought five years ago, said he would be ‘very happy’ to pay the controversial charge, which he has said will raise money for the NHS.","Labour figures pile pressure on Ed Miliband over row with British business .

"The New York City subway is cramped with people, but a new study shows that the underground system may be much more crowded than we realized. Scientists from Weill Cornell Medical College have unveiled their findings after 18 months swabbing turnstiles, ticket kiosks, railings and benches for DNA on the world's largest transport system. They found 15,152 different types of microorganisms that share the train with its 5.5 million riders, including bubonic plague, dysentery and meningitis. Zoom in on the map to find out which subways stations have the most bacteria... Principal Investigator Dr Chris Mason and his team released findings from their 'PathoMap' study on Thursday, a map of all the microorganisms and DNA present on surfaces in the New York City subway. The study, which used a super computer to study more than 10 billion biomedical fragments, was apparently inspired by Dr Mason seeing his daughter, then in preschool, sticking toys in her mouth in 2010. Scientists and volunteers started the project in 2013 and found 637 known bacterial, viral, fungal and animal species when swabbing the spaces between commuters and street musicians and logging the data in real time with a mobile app. Most of the bacteria the group found were harmless, though nearly half (48 per cent) of the DNA found matched no known organisms, according to the published study at Cell.com. Scientists from Weill Cornell Medical College have unveiled their findings after 18 months swabbing turnstiles, ticket kiosks, railings and benches for DNA on the world's largest transport system. The red areas show the areas with the most bacteria, according to their findings, while the cooler colours reveal less bacteria . Pictured are some of the most popular stations in New York, along with a common type of bacteria found in the area. Many are associated  with different diseases such as food poisoning and infections . The New York subway system is famous for being grimy - but commuters may not have realised just how much until now. Traces of anthrax and the Bubonic plague have been found in central areas (pictured) Bacteria linked to diseases including bubonic plague and staph infections (left) are found at a number of stations around the city, along with dysentery and meningitis . The mysterious finding 'underscores the vast wealth of unknown species that are ubiquitous in urban areas,' project leader Ebrahim Afshinnekoo said. Researchers also saw 67 different bacteria species associated with diseases on the subway's surfaces in about 12 per cent of their samples, though bacteria in general made up nearly 47 per cent. Some bacteria associated with ailments such as food poisoning are found at nearly half of the 466 open stations shared by germs, riders and rats. Thankfully, more serious bacteria are less common. The most diverse station was the G train's Myrtle-Willoughby stop in Brooklyn, with 95 different bacteria . Researchers also saw 67 different bacteria species associated with diseases on the subway's surfaces in about 12 per cent of their samples, though bacteria in general made up nearly 47 per cent. Pictured are the hotspots . The microbes associated with dysentery was only found at three stations, as was the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. Scientists, who include researchers from six New York medical centers and other institutions around the world, said that the plague microbes were shown not to be alive. The New York City Department of Health disputed the finding of plague on the subway,  according to the Wall Street Journal. The most diverse station was the G train's Myrtle-Willoughby stop in Brooklyn, with 95 different bacteria groups. South Ferry station, which was submerged and temporarily closed after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, showed unique sets of bacteria normally found in marine environments. Dr Chris Mason said that someone who licks a subway pole (held above by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg) would 'probably be fine' Scientists said that most of the harmful bacteria are found in low quantities and good or neutral bacteria may be out-competing them. Bubonic plague  found at 3 stations . Dysentery 3 stations . E. Coli 56 stations . Food poisoning 215 stations . Meningitis 9 stations . Strep infections 66 stations . Tetanus 9 stations . City dwellers' immune systems are also equipped to handle all the microbes thrown at them during the typical day. 'You wouldn't want to lick all the poles, even though you'd probably be fine,' Dr Mason said. The principal investigator advocated exposing young children to germs when speaking at the American Museum of Natural History, according to Gothamist. 'The best thing to do with newborns is roll them like sushi on the subway ground,' he said. Researchers also mapped  microorganisms that were not bacteria, including those that likely came from popular New York foodstuffs such as Italian mozzarella and kimchi. 215 stations in New York had traces of bacteria associated with food poisoning such as salmonella (pictured) The most common DNA besides bacteria came from insects, plant matter and humans, who represented 0.2 per cent of the material collected. The PathoMap study hopes to eventually create a 'weather map' or microscopic organisms to be able to warn people about potential disease outbreaks. Scientists believe studying how microbes move around urban environments will help them keep track of long-term health trends. Other researchers in 14 states are undertaking similar projects to map the microbes in transit systems. Subway studies are also underway in Shanghai, Tokyo, Paris and Sao Paulo.

"Iain Duncan Smith said 200 people a week are moving off welfare due to the benefits cap . Some 200 people a week are ‘turning their lives around’ and moving off welfare due to the benefits cap, Iain Duncan Smith said. The threshold of £26,000 a year per household has now capped the handouts of 55,000 families since it was introduced in 2013. In total about 800 people per month have either found employment or are no longer claiming housing benefit, the Department for Work and Pensions said. Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said the policy restored fairness to the system and would save £225million over the two years since it was introduced. ‘As well as restoring fairness to the system and saving the taxpayer money, the benefits cap provides a clear incentive to the get people into work’, he said. ‘Today’s figures show that the cap has led to hundreds of people breaking free from welfare dependency every week, and gaining the financial security and esteem which comes with a job and pay packet. That’s real people their lives and the prospects of their families around.’ Critics have expressed concerns that the vast majority of those subject to the cap, which is £500 a week for families and £350 a week for a single adult – do have children. But the figures show that around 40pc of those whose benefits are no longer capped, or around 12,500 people, have moved into a job. DWP officials say these former claimants are ‘making the most of almost 700,000 vacancies in the economy and contributing to record levels of employment.’ Before the cap was introduced in April 2013, some 300 of the highest earning families raked in over £9million in benefits every year. Ministers have hailed the cap as a success in making sure no family is making more money on benefits than in employment, for which the average salary across the UK is £26,000. David Cameron said promised to cut it to £23,000 as his ‘first act’ if he wins a second term, which would slash benefits by a further £60 a week and save the taxpayer £135million a year. Slashed: David Cameron said promised to cut the cap to £23,000 as his ‘first act’ if he wins a second term . Mr Cameron said in an interview this month that reforms of the welfare system were a ‘deeply progressive programme’ that is ‘changing people’s lives.’ According to a poll by Ipsos Mori last year, nearly half of benefit claimants hit by the cap on welfare payments said they were doing more to find work than before. And despite predictions by critics that the cap would cause misery – it found 45pc of those affected said they had felt spurred to get a job. Many had sent off more applications or were using agencies or careers centres to help them find employment.","Threshold of £26,000  per household capped handouts of 55,000 families .

The footage, which has not been independently verified, appears to have been filmed by a jihadi fighter on a mobile phone, reportedly from Ma'arrat al-Numan in the north-western city of Idlib. In the video, a small crowd of masked fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra - an Al Qaeda affiliated group in Syria - gather near the city's main roundabout. Most of the men are carrying machine guns and are dressed in thick coats and military fatigues. The cameraman turns the camera to show the emptiness of the roads, with the traffic halted to allow the execution to be carried out in full public view. A woman, who activists have suggested is thought to be around 50 years old, is shown standing next to several fighters. Except for a red cardigan, the lady is seen wearing an all-black robe, covering down to her feet. She also wears a black hijab (headscarf) which tightly covers all her hair. Nearby a concrete wall, tagged in graffiti declares the area to be the stronghold of Jabhat al- Nusra (the Nusra Front). A bearded fighter, wearing body armour stands intimidating behind her, warding off anyone uninvited who gets too close to the woman. Too brutal... even for extremists: The video, which was posted on social media, has drawn condemnation even from rival Islamists, with one ISIS supporter asking 'which Sharia (Islamic law) is that???' Sickening blood sport: Jihadists with machine guns and dressed in military fatigues watch the execution . The fighter orders the woman to crouch down on the concrete pavement. Her hands are bound behind her back, leaving her slightly unbalanced as she awaits for her fate. Several other fighters pull out their mobile phones and also begin to film the shocking scenes. Another bearded man emerges, possibly a senior religious member of the Al Qaeda-affiliated group. Wearing a full-length black tunic, the man declares that the woman has been convicted by an Islamic court of being an adulterer. The woman tries to interrupt the man but he continues, condemning her for allegedly running a brothel in the city. Under Sharia law, the man declares, such crimes are punished by death. Unlike an Islamic State public execution, the scene appears chaotic, with fighters in the crowd moving around, jostling to get a better position to film the forthcoming execution. On several occasions the senior Jabhat al-Nusra figure has to pause as chatter from the crowd appears to distract him. At the end of his speech, the fighter wearing body armour pulls out a pistol and shoots the woman straight in the head with a single shot. The footage, which has not been independently verified, appears to have been filmed by a jihadi fighter on a mobile phone, reportedly from Ma'arat al-Nu'man in the north-western province of Idlib . Chants of Allahu Akbar - Arabic for God is greatest - begin to resonate from the crowd, creating a cacophony of praise for the execution. The video ends with one of the fighters producing a large grey rug and using it to cover the dead woman's body. The shocking video has generated a surprising amount of anger from Islamic State supporters, who have condemned the public execution of a woman. One ISIS supporter, known as Abu Hammad, wrote his disgust about the apparent unIslamic nature of the execution: 'Jabhat al-Nusra kills a woman by shooting for adultery. Which Shariah is that???' In response, one Jabhat al-Nusra fan said that the woman was 'a whore' and 'they (Jabhat al-Nusra) can choose how (to) kill her.' Another Muslim tweeter, who refers to themselves as Abu Khattab Australi, appeared uncomfortable with the killing, tweeting: 'she doesn't look the woman pimp type.' However, Abu Khattab insists the execution is legitimate: 'if they apply the Sharia then al-hamdulilah (praise be to God)'. Jabhat al-Nusra first emerged in Syria in January 2012 after claiming responsibility for a spate of suicide attacks in 2011. Another group, Al Qaeda in Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced in April 2013 that Jabhat al-Nusra had become part of a merger group called Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) The merger was rejected by Jabhat al-Nusra's top commander, Abu Muhammad al-Julani, who continued to pledge his allegiance to Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, leading to fierce clashes between Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS. In February 2014, Al Qaeda publicly disavowed all relations with ISIS, leaving Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS as bitter enemies. Whilst there have been signs of occasional joint offensives by Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State, particularly in the Qalamoun mountains, the two groups continue to remain fierce rivals. Since ISIS seized Mosul and declared the formation of the Islamic State, Jabhat al-Nusra has struggled in their fight for both territory and recruitment against Islamic State.","Woman in headscarf ordered to kneel down with hands tied behind back .

"A wildflower has become the first living species in the UK to be named after Sir David Attenborough. The Attenborough’s hawkweed (Hieracium attenboroughianum) was found a decade ago in South Wales but it took ten years of study to ensure it was a new separate species. It is one of a group of plants belonging to the daisy family and experts believe it has evolved in the Brecon Beacons since the last ice age. The Attenborough’s hawkweed was found a decade ago in South Wales but it took ten years of study to ensure it was a new separate species . It is found on rocky ledges on Cribyn - one of three peaks in the central Brecon Beacons which are owned and managed by the National Trust. It can be easily seen from the main path up to Cribyn in late June and early July when it colours the rocks yellow with its flowers. Dr Tim Rich, the naturalist who named it, said Sir Attenborough had inspired him to study ecology as a teenager. Dr Rich said: 'Finding a new species is a really exciting moment and something you dream of as a naturalist. 'This is a personal thank you for the years of fascination he has given me going to different places to search for new things.' Sir Attenborough said he was ‘thrilled’ and added: ‘Bestowing a name on a new species is surely one of the greatest biological compliments and I am truly grateful. 'It is an added joy that Hieracium attenboroughianum should be so beautiful and live in such a lovely part of the country.' Attenborough's hawkweed brings the number of plants and animals bearing the name of the world-famous broadcaster to 11, although the little plant is the first living species in the UK to be named after him.

"Ed Miller Band: The Labour leader, not to be confused with the Steve Miller Band . They have mistaken toddlers for Ayatollahs, called for violence at funerals, and let loose zebras onto the football pitch. No wonder the broadcasting regulator Ofcom has criticised TV companies for their frequent bloopers in subtitles. ‘It is clear from viewers’ feedback that they sometimes find live subtitling frustrating, and, on occasion, unwatchable,’ the watchdog has said. Mistakes happen during live TV, such as the news and sports events, because a Heath Robinson system called ‘re-speaking’ is used to create subtitles as the programme is being broadcast. A specialist sits in a soundproof booth and repeats every word, slowly and clearly, into a microphone. Quickly processed by voice-recognition software, the words are then displayed on screen, within a second or two. Sometimes, however, the computer software doesn’t get things quite right . . . ‘Medical staff have been urged to step up high jean levels.’ The reporter on BBC Breakfast was referring to ‘hygiene levels’. ‘More controlled burning of witches will save bush fires in future.’ The news reporter didn’t say witch, but ‘which’. ‘Welcome to the year of the whores.

It wasn’t a ‘zebra’ on the pitch but the then Manchester United player, (Patrice) Evra. ‘Andy Murray has become Midge Ure’ This Wimbledon commentary subtitle should have stated Andy had become ‘mature’. Prince William and his wife, the 'badgers of Cambridge' - better known as the 'Duchess of Cambridge' ‘Both teams mock the fact that tomorrow is Remembrance Sunday.’ Match Of The Day again! In truth, the teams were ‘marking’ the event by standing in silence. ‘They’re all here because of my cologne.’ The BBC sports reporter was referring to one of England’s top footballers: ‘They’re all here because of Michael Owen.’ ‘They love to nibble anything that comes into the shed, like our willies.’ Wellies!

"A US Air Force veteran has broken down while describing his experience at being the latest victim of the dangerous 'swatting' trend, where hackers report a bogus emergency with the goal of mobilizing a SWAT team. Joshua Peters, 27 - who returned from service in Kuwait on a medical evacuation - was playing browser games from his home in St Cloud, Minnesota, and live-streaming himself online, when 10 armed officers stormed the house. The hoaxer had found Peters' address and called the local police, reporting that someone had 'shot their roommate and now they were pointing their gun at them', according to The Guardian. Police also heard two gunshots ring out before the call ended. Victimized: Joshua Peters, 27, a returned US Air Force officer, is the latest gamer to be targeted in the 'swatting' trend sweeping the streaming world, where hackers report a bogus emergency with the goal of mobilizing a SWAT team . Emotional: Peters was live streaming a game of RuneScape when he was swatted, with about 60,000 watching it unfold online. He later addressed the camera about what happened and broke down (pictured) Peters said his siblings were home at the time and his 10-year-old brother answered the door. He currently lives with his parents, and his mother was also home. The team of police forced Peters face down to the floor. By this time he had realized what was going on and tried to explain to police he had been streaming the popular games RuneScape and Clash of the Clans. The cops assessed the house and realized Peters was telling the truth. He returned to his computer about 15 minutes later. The camera had been streaming the whole time, with about 60,000 watching the incident unfold. An emotional Peters then addressed the situation, saying he had been swatted. Vet: Joshua Peters returned from service in Kuwait due to a medical evacuation . 'I had police point a gun at my little brothers because of you,' Peters said through tears, with a video of the stream since uploaded to YouTube. 'They could have been shot, they could have died. 'Because you chose to swat my stream. 'I don’t give a s--- about what you have against me, or what I did to you. 'For that I am at a loss for words. 'Your gripe is with me. 'But do not involve my family in this. 'They don’t deserve it.' Gamer: Peters was playing the popular browser games Clash of Clans and Runescape when the attack occurred, scaring his family . In an interview with The Guardian after the swatting incident, Peters said he believes the attack was random. In other swatting attacks, gamers have been able to track down the addresses of people streaming using available information online, and then prank them. 'There’s no possible persons who I can think would do something like this to me,' he said. 'Before I knew it, my face was on a tile on the ground, hands wide open and a bunch of police officers with assault rifles.' Peters added that he has witnessed other streamers being swatted. St Cloud police are investigating what happened to Peters. They hope to track down the person who staged the emergency call. Sadly, swatting is not new to the gaming world. The dangerous prank, where hackers report a bogus emergency with the goal of mobilizing a SWAT team, first surfaced around 2011, as streaming became increasingly popular.","Joshua Peters, 27, was live streaming browser games RuneScape and Clash of the Clans at his home in St Cloud, Minnesota .

"Rick Perry delivered a scathing indictment of Barack Obama on Thursday night in Washington, teeing up a presidential run with a speech that took little notice of presumptive Democratic favorite Hillary Clinton and instead castigated the president as feckless, clueless and gutless. Just 16 days removed from the 10,000-square-foot Texas governor's mansion, Perry is on the road and shaping the messages that will accompany a White House campaign. He stopped in Washingtonto deliver rhetorical red-meat to a friendly and very conservative audience. The early going has been kind to the Texan: While reporters can't let go of his calamitous 'Oops!' moment in 2011, he raised political eyebrows on Thursday by unveiling a list of 80 financial power brokers who will shake the trees and make rain for him. One of those financiers, who requested anonymity, told Daily Mail Online on Thursday – in advance of the governor's address to the conservative American Principles Project – that Perry is confident he can win. 'He and his wife believe they are touched by God, and that this is his time,' the donor said. 'It's like – they can't lose – that's the sense of it.' 'I don't know if he'll win the nomination, but I'm absolutely sure he'll be one of the last two Republicans standing,' he added during a phone interview. Perry got a warm reception in Washington on Thursday with themes that hammered President Barack Obama and pointed toward a second presidential run . PRESSING THE FLESH: Perry mingled in a room full of hundreds of right-wingers at an event hosted by the American Principles Project, which opposes abortion and gay marriage . Perry shunned reporters on Thursday night after his speech – Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal held a press conference after his lunchtime remarks – but his turn at the podium during the nighttime gala brimmed with that confidence – half campaign stemwinder, half inaugural address. He lifted a line from Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration, where the 41st president said, 'There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured with what is right with America.' Perry's version took aim at Barack Obama. 'There is nothing wrong in America today,' he said, 'that can't be fixed with a change in leadership.' That change is sure to come in January 2017, but it's anyone's guess who will move into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 'Our nation is on a slow glide-path to decline,' Perry said Thursday night. And Republicans see eight more years of a Democratic administration as a political doomsday. The GOP has a deep bench, with no fewer than 20 would-be nominees talking about running. They include governors, senators, former CEOs and diplomats, and a pediatric surgeon. Democrats, on the other hand, have Hillary Clinton, the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. And few others judged as powerful enough or daring enough to challenge her. Knowing who will likely await them in America's political Super Bowl has allowed GOP White House hopefuls to keep their anti-Hillary powder dry and hold their best attacks until 2016 when they will matter most. Instead Perry and others are focusing their energy on Obama. The governor's speech on Thursday could have been the one he delivered on the stump in 2012 if his first presidential bid hadn't imploded when he couldn't remember which three federal cabinet agencies he had said he would close if he won the presidency. He hit Obama on foreign policy, on energy, on the economy and jobs, and on that distinctly Texas concern: illegal immigration. And he slapped Republicans, as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal had earlier in the day during an American Principles Project lunch, for risking the loss of their congressional majorities by straying too close to the political middle. THREE YEARS AND ONE 'OOPS' LATER: Perry was all smiles in October 2011 when he filed the paperwork for his name to appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot . CAMPAIGN MODE: The Texas governor wound up his crowd with reliable conservative themes and spent most of his time at the podium railnig against the Obama administration . READY TO RUN? Perry is road-testing themes for future speeches when the political stakes will be as high as any in American history . Americans, he said, rejected the Obama administration in November – citing 'the VA allowing our heroes to die, the IRS targeting citizens, the administration trading five terrorists for a military deserter, the rise of ISIS, the lies upon which Obamacare was passed, (and) the weakest economic recovery in history.' 'But let’s be clear about something,' he said in the Mayflower Hotel just a mile from the U.S. Capitol: 'The American voters’ rejection of the Democrats does not mean they embraced Republicans.' 'A congressional majority is a terrible thing to waste.' Similarly, Jindal had warned against the GOP slouching toward status as 'Democrat-lite.' Both men are rock-ribbed conservatives. Along with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, they will inhabit the right flank of the Republicans' march through next year's political playoffs. Perry spat out a litany of anti-Obama sentiments that could have come out of a tea party convention platform. 'Six years of study on the Keystone Pipeline, and still nothing happens,' he said. 'When Vladimir Putin was invading Ukraine, the president dithered when he could have sent a powerful message to the Russian president.' 'Our broken, outdated tax code has become an incubator of corruption, favoritism and bureaucratic harassment.' 'We need to stop strangling small businesses with over-regulation.' Perry, seldom soft-spoken, took special umbrage at Obama's plan to mainstream more than 5 million illegal immigrants with residency cards and work permits while hundreds of thousands more pour across the U.S.-Mexico border with drugs and human chattel. 'Those who smuggle children, enslave women, destroy lives by peddling illegal drugs and weapons, they are the face of evil,' Perry boomed. 'Texas has done more to secure the border than any state in the nation,' he exclaimed. 'And the message is clear: as long as Washington will not secure the border, Texas will.' 2016 STARTS NOW: Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal spoke earlier in the day to the American Principles Project, the same group Perry appeared with at night . Perry was loose on Thursday night, free-wheeling his words as he boasted about his state's economic boom.. 'More people have moved to Texas than any other state,' he said. 'Lemme give you a little news-flash here – it's not because of our great weather in August.' At times he strayed near the eccentricities of an infamous October 2011 speech in New Hampshire that was so disengaged and free-spirited that political observers suspected he was drunk. Perry spent a week denying it, and was rescued from the biggest headlines only by businessman Herman Cain's sexual harassment scandal. The 'Oops' collapse came less than two weeks later. On that occasion, he said later, he was on painkillers for a back ailment. But Perry has never styled himself as a practiced orator or a charm school graduate. 'If you're looking for a slick politician, or a guy with great teleprompter skills, we already have that,' he said in one 2011 commercial. 'And he's destroying our economy.' 'I'm a doer, not a talker.'","Perry appeared at the annual gala of the American Principles project, an anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage group in Washington, DC .

"Darcy Smith, 41, is accused of having sex with the boy - a former student - when he was just 14 years old and living at their home in Washington state . An award-winning elementary school teacher in Washington state is facing child rape charges following allegations that she sexually abused a former student. Darcy Smith, 41, is accused of having sex with  the boy when he was just 14 years old and living with her, her husband and her children at their home in Renton. The alleged victim, who is now 19 years old, first reported the allegations to the King County Sheriff’s Office last May. Smith has been on administrative leave since August, when her employer, the Highline School District, was informed of the boy’s claims. He told detectives that he and Smith started having sex when he was in the 8th grade and the relationship continued until he moved out of her home at 18. The boy had moved in with Smith and her family when he was 12 years old and a pupil in her 6th grade class, reports Seattle PI. After breaking his collarbone, Smith had taken him to the hospital and soon after that he started living at her house which was closer to the doctors than his own home. The unusual arrangement had the blessing of the boy’s mother who didn’t speak English and though Smith would be a good influence on her son whose brother was in a gang. According to the boy, he and Smith first had sex when he turned 14 and continued to have relations until he moved out four years later. The boy told detective that Smith first showered him with gifts and affection before agreeing to care for him full time, according to charging papers. But the victim said things would change in the evenings when the kids and Smith's husband went to bed, and she drank wine. According to the documents, the victim said Smith made him promise not to tell anyone or 'she would go to jail and be in big trouble if he told.' Smith, who  received a regional Teacher of the Year award in 2012 for her employer, has been charged with three counts of third degree child rape.

Highline Public Schools spokeswoman Catherine Carbone Rogers said parents of children taught by Smith were notified of the investigation earlier this week. Smith hasn’t been jailed and is scheduled to be arraigned next week.","Darcy Smith, 41, is accused of having sex with a former student when he was just 14 years old and living at their home in Washington state .

"A drug manufacturer has been arrested after cops found a to-do list with plans to 'make butane hash oil' in his house following a huge explosion, allegedly caused by his lab. Kevin Patrick Hubbard from Palm City, Florida, suffered severe burns during the fire at his home on Wednesday. But the 27-year-old is now facing charges of arson, manufacturing hash oil, possession of marijuana and possession of hash oil when he is released from the hospital. Raid: Kevin Patrick Hubbard, 27, from Palm City, Florida, has been arrested after cops found a to-do list with 'Make BHO' (or hash oil) and marijuana during a search of his home . Authorities searched the home after neighbors heard a loud bang and found the list. The first item was 'Make BHO' - or hash oil. Others included 'pay Sixt', 'pay [the] New York Times' and 'clean, oven, floor'. When they looked around the remainder of the property, they found scales, multiple cans of butane, a hash oil manufacturing device and a glass dish containing hash oil, according to the TCPalm. The substance is believed to be one of the most potent strains of marijuana because the manufacturing process garners the largest amount of THC. Evidence: Photos taken at the scene by Martin County Sheriff's Office shows some of the paraphernalia found in Hubbard's home following the fire. He faces multiple charges following his release from hospital . Authorities suggested he was trying to make the substance in his kitchen when he caused the explosion. They have also accused him of then trying to hide the illicit items before first responders turned up. Sheriff William Snyder told the TCPalm: 'An explosion or fire in a residential community is a serious public safety concern . 'It was very clear from our early entry into the house to provide assistance to the victim that there was a very good likelihood that we were facing a BHO lab.'

"A woman sentenced to a North Korean labour camp has revealed she was forced to clean out filthy toilets with her bare hands as people ate rats in a desperate attempt to survive. Ji-hyun Park spent a year inside one of the country's notorious detention camps after being deported from China where she had fled to escape starving to death. Now, she has revealed the truth about life inside the secretive state and said: 'Really it was unspeakably bad. You could say the whole of North Korea is one big prison. 'The people are all hungry. And now, there aren't even rats, snakes or wild plants left for them to eat.' Scroll down for video . Labour: Ji-hyun Park spent a year inside the brutal Chongjin labour camp, where she was forced to perform back-breaking manual labour after being deported from China as an 'economic defector' Harsh: After disobeying orders, Ji-Hyun was forced to clean out the filthy toilets in the labour camp with her bare hands . Devastated: Recalling the North Korean famine of the late 1990s, Ji-hyun said: 'A lot of people died between 1996 and 1998. The train station platforms were full of dead bodies' Brave Ji-hyun has now spoken out about her ordeal to Amnesty International in a short film called 'The Other Interview'. The name refers to the recent controversial Sony Pictures comedy 'The Interview', where two TV producers are recruited by the CIA in an attempt to assassinate current North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Outraged North Korea authorities initially called for the film to be banned and said releasing it would be 'act of war'. In December, Sony's email database was then hacked and several thousand embarrassing emails were released. Ji-hyun first left North Korea during the the famine that ravaged the country  in the late 1990s. Estimates on the number of people who died have been as high as four million. She said: 'A lot of people died between 1996 and 1998. The train station platforms were full of dead bodies.' The country was then being run by Kim Jong-il, the totalitarian ruler whose son Kim Jong-un is now in power. Heartbroken, Ji-hyun had to leave her dying father behind as she paid to be trafficked into China along with her sister to escape the famine. But authorities soon discovered her origins and sent her back to North Korea, where she was sentenced to hard labour as punishment for her attempt to escape. As she was arrested in China, Ji-hyun was classified as an 'economic defector' and sent to the brutal Chongjin labour camp in the Songpyong district. Revealing the truth about life inside the camp, where prisoners are forced to call the guards 'teachers', she said: 'We were worked harder than animals. 'Our working day began at 4.30am, before we could have anything to eat. In the summer when the days are longer, we would work until 8pm or 9pm in the evening. 'We would only stop working when it got pitch dark. And the day doesn't end there. 'After eating we had to reflect on our day's performance, recite the Worker's Party's principles and learn songs. By that time, it'd be close to midnight.' Tears: An emotional Ji-hyun broke down as she spoke about her past life and said: 'Really it was unspeakably bad. You could say the whole of North Korea is one big labour camp' Cramped: women were herded into the labour camps in their hundreds and ordered around by guards they were forced to call 'teachers' Ji-hyun also recounts being sent to the mountains in the Ranam district of the country, where the prisoners were forced to clear the mountainside to create terraced fields. Starving women would eat raw potatoes straight from the ground with dirt still on them  as they were so desperate for food. Prisoners would also pick seeds out of animal dung to eat, and feast on food left out for dogs and cows as they desperately struggled to survive. Ji-hyun said: 'We cleared the land with our bare hands. Four women had to pull an oxcart, two in the front and two in the back, carrying a ton of soil in the cart. 'We wouldn't do this at a walking pace either. We had to run.' In another horrific memory, she recalls: 'If you got caught trying to wash your sanitary towel, you were ordered to wear it on your head, dripping blood and all, and beg for forgiveness.' Starving: Working long hours on the mountainside to create terraced fields, the starving women would eat rats and raw potatoes in their fight for survival . Anyone caught trying to to defect to South Korea were sent to political prison camps and never seen again. In an interview with Amnesty International, Ji-hyun says that after her family were displaced during the famine, she stayed to look after her elderly father. A heartbroken Ji-hyun remembers: 'As my father's condition grew worse, he wasn't able to speak anymore. He could only gesture with his hands, telling me to go, to leave North Korea. 'My father kept gesturing to me to go. I couldn't be there for him when he passed away. I left him there in that cold room. I left him a bowl of rice and a change of clothes. I left North Korea like that.' Wiping away tears, she adds: 'I wasn't by my father's side when he passed away. Like a selfish child, I left just to save my own skin.' But just two weeks after being trafficked into China there, she was told she must marry a man to ensure her family's wellbeing. Traffickers were prepared to sell her on and share the money with her family. When Ji-hyun refused, she was threatened with deportation, which forced her to then agree to marry the stranger. Survivor: Today, Ji-hyun lives in Manchester with her partner and four children, where she is rebuilding her life after suffering in the labour camps . Dynasty: Kim Jong-il (left) was the leader of North Korea when Ji-hyun was imprisoned. His son Kim Jong-un (right) is the current leader of the country . She was then put in a safe house, where prospective buyers would come to look at her. Ji-hyun said: 'They would come and haggle over my price. It was no different from an animal being sold in the marketplace.' She was then sold for 5,000 Yuan – approximately £500. She said: 'When you get sold off, the person who bought you will say, ""I've paid for you so now you must do whatever I tell you. If you disobey in the slightest, I could report you. Even if I kill you, no-one's going to say anything, and no-one will know what happened to you""'. 'That's how they intimidate and threaten North Koreans into forced marriages.' Famine struck North Korea in the 1990s due to a combination of economic mismanagement, failing crops and a series of flood and droughts. Experts have claimed as many as four million people may have died - but it has been impossible to provide a definitive total due to the secret nature of the totalitarian state. The country requested humanitarian aid in 1995 to try to prevent further deaths, but the problems persisted until around 1999. One of the long-lasting effects has been severe malnutrition in the nation's young people. It has been estimated that approximately 45 per cent of under-fives in the country today suffer from stunted growth due to malnutrition. Ji-hyun then fell pregnant and gave birth to a baby boy, alone and in a guarded hut. She named her son Chol – which means 'iron' – because she wanted him to have a strong character. But her time in China was cut short when she was deported by the authorities. She was separated from her son and husband at the police station, and did not get the chance to say goodbye to them. After contracting tetanus in her leg, Ji-hyun was left unable to work or even walk. Now considered useless to the regime, the authorities discharged her from the labour camp. Frightened and alone, she returned to China were she was eventually reunited with her son. Terrified of being deported back to North Korea, Ji-hyun then arranged for them to travel to Mongolia. They arrived at the border by foot and clambered through two wire fences, taking extra care not to alert the border guards who were on patrol. But Ji-hyun and her son were unable to make it through the fences, and panicked as Chinese police cars pulled up to investigate. Luckily, a mystery man then appeared and cut through the wire fences, allowing the two to finally enter Mongolia. Ji-hyun then fell in love with the man who saved her life and the couple are now live in Manchester with their three children and her son. They plan to get married in the near future. Sold: When she arrived in China, Ji-hyun was sold off by the traffickers who had got her into the country. She was eventually bought for approximately £500 . Torn apart: When the Chinese authorities arrested and deported her, Ji-hyun was taken away without getting to say goodbye to her son. Years later, the pair would be emotionally reunited . Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK Director, said: 'This is the other film North Korea really doesn't want you to see, and with good reason. 'People in North Korea are subjected to an existence beyond nightmares. The population is ruled by fear with a network of prison camps a constant spectre for those who dare step out of line. 'Thousands of people in the camps are worked to death, starved to death, beaten to death. Some are sent there just for knowing someone who has fallen out of favour. 'Amnesty is releasing ""The Other Interview"" so that people all over the world can hear first-hand how people in North Korea are suffering appallingly at the hands of Kim Jong-un and his officials. 'They don't want you to see it, which is precisely why you should.'

"InStyle magazine has taken to Twitter to deny allegations that it intentionally whitened Scandal actress Kerry Washington's skin in an image featured on the cover of this month's issue. In a statement released on Thursday evening, which was later retweeted by 38-year-old Kerry, the magazine blamed the actress' seemingly altered appearance on the 'lighting' of the cover. 'We are super fans of Kerry Washington here at InStyle,' the statement explained. 'To feature her on the cover of our March spring fashion issue is both an honor and a delight. Scroll down for video . Appearances are deceiving: Online critics are slamming Kerry Washington's cover of InStyle and accusing the magazine of 'whitewashing' the star for its March 2015 issue . Natural beauty: Kerry looked much more like her usual self when she attended the Jennifer Meyer xo Jessica Alba Necklace Launch Celebration Party in West Hollywood, California on February 3 . Thank you: Both Kerry and InStyle took to their respective Twitter accounts on Thursday evening to apologize for any upset caused by the cover . 'We have heard from those who have spoken out about our newsstand cover photograph, concerned that Kerry’s skin tone was lightened. While we did not digitally lighten Kerry’s skin tone, our cover lighting has likely contributed to this concern. We understand that this has resulted in disappointment and hurt. 'We are listening, and the feedback has been valuable. We are committed to ensuring that this experience has a positive influence on the ways in which we present all women going forward.' Posting on her own Twitter account, Kerry thanked the publication for making such a 'beautiful statement', adding that she was grateful the magazine had taken the time to open up such an 'important' conversation. Alongside a link to InStyle's official statement, she wrote: 'Beautiful statement. Thank u 4 opening this convo. Its an important 1 that needs to be had.' Critics first began speculating that InStyle had edited Kerry's cover image in order to purposefully 'whitewash' the star and drastically alter her appearance on Wednesday, shortly after the actress shared the image on her social media accounts.. Kerry happily took to Instagram to reveal the cover, writing: 'I'm THRILLED to share with you all that I'm on the cover of this year's March @instylemagazine! Can't wait for you guys to see it and read it! So honored. And crazy excited.' But many of her fans were unable to feign pleasure over the image – and quickly responded to share their outrage at the overly-edited image. False representation: One woman called out the magazine on Instagram, calling the InStyle cover 'an egregious mistake' Angry customer: Another critic said she would never buy InStyle again because the magazine made Kerry 'look white' An unhappy man: This Twitter user also accused the magazine of 'whitewashing' the actress . Many voiced their thoughts by posting in the comments section under Kerry’s image, lashing out at what they described as a ‘false representation’ of the Scandal star. One woman went as far as to suggest that the magazine should issue an apology to Kerry for altering the image so drastically, referring to the cover as 'an egregious mistake'. 'You mean to tell me your editors saw fit to Photoshop @kerrywashington to the point where not only is her completion is severely lightened but the ENTIRE character of her face is altered?' she fumed. 'Your magazine needs to issue a statement of apology not only to your readers but to Kerry Washington as well.' Another woman chimed in to say that she would boycotting the magazine from here on out, adding that she was ‘disgusted’ at the behavior of the magazine’s editors. 'Sooooo what you guys do it brighten the photo to a point that Kerry looks WHITE!?? Never buying your magazine again. I'm DISGUSTED! #BLACKISBEAUTIFUL!' she wrote. Someone else added: 'They removed everything that makes her Kerry. Why the lighter skin, why the thinner lips? Lord forgive them.' Critics also took to Twitter to share their disgust. Pretty ladies: Kerry posed for a photo with Jessica (left), Jennifer (center left) and Rachel Zoe (right) during the event . Mommy glow: Kerry, who gave birth to her first child in May, hung out with fellow moms Molly Simms (left) and Rachel Zoe (center) 'Some woman pretending to be Kerry Washington is on the cover of InStyle magazine. #Scandal,' someone wrote. Another man added: 'What did InStyle Magazine do to my Kerry Washington?! The picture doesn't even look like her #whitewashing #Instylemagazinecovers .' This isn't the first time fans have been left outraged by one of Kerry's cover photos, nor is InStyle the first magazine called out for supposedly lightening someone's skin. Many people felt that Kerry’s December 2013/January 2014 cover of Lucky had been edited beyond all recognition, with many voicing similar concerns about the apparent lightening of her skin color. Meanwhile, Lupita Nyong'o's 2014 spread in Vanity Fair saw similar criticisms. And in 2010, Elle was accused of lightening Gabourey Sidibe's skin for its 25th anniversary issue, but the magazine maintained that the cover appearance was the result of studio lighting. Beyond the cover, Kerry spoke with the magazine about her red carpet style and her Olivia Pope-inspired clothing line for The Limited. The Scandal star noted her personal style is more daring than her fashionable television character's. 'Red-Carpet Kerry wears a lot more color and pattern than Olivia does,' she explained. 'She makes bold choices. She continued: 'When I was pregnant, I showed up at the SAG awards in a bare-midriff gown by Prada. I knew some people were going to hate it, but I thought it was super cute and really fun.' While she had no problem flaunting her baby bump, the new mom said she relied on pilates, Tracy Anderson pregnancy DVDs, hiking, the elliptical machine and yoga get her figure back after giving birth to her daughter Isabelle in May. She also talked about her experience as a working mom with a young child. 'Women use this ""guilt"" word a lot, but I’m not sure how I feel about it,' she explained. 'I know why it’s the word that keeps coming up, but I can’t co-sign on it yet... You can’t be all things to all people all the time. 'You have to experience your humanity, you have to know you are a limited vessel, and you can only do so much.'","The cover image was released on Wednesday and quickly came under fire from critics who claimed that the Scandal actress' appearance was altered .

"Saved: Postman Mick Leak was set to be reassigned from his route in the Dorset village of Chetnole . A band of villagers who clubbed together to save their postman have won a victory over the Royal Mail by forcing the organisation to back down on the decision to change his route. Mick Leak has delivered the post in the village of Chetnole, Dorset for 24 years - but last month he was told that the community would be taken over by a senior colleague. Locals launched a petition and turned the village hall into a campaign headquarters, leading to a Royal Mail U-turn as the other postman agreed to pull out and allow Mr Leak to keep his route. However, in the wake of the campaign the villagers - many of them pensioners - have been accused of intimidating the senior postman into changing his mind. A trade union said the people of Chetnole were 'disgraceful' for lobbying to keep their postman, even though they pointed out that they had never even met his replacement and had not made contact with him. Chetnole has been part of Mr Leak's daily rounds since the early 1990s, and he is relied upon to 'keep an eye open' for vulnerable residents, according to villagers. As part of the Royal Mail modernisation programme, bosses announced that some routes - including Mr Leak's - would be merged with one another. A colleague was offered the new merged route - because he had been working as a postman for three months longer than Mr Leak. When residents of Chetnole heard about the proposed change they were quick to mobilise, launching a petition which was signed by half the village within just a few hours. They also put up banners saying 'Royal Mail - taking the Mick', and after 10 days the replacement postman decided to allow Mr Leak to continue on his previous route. Retired nurse Sue Morgan, who has lived in the village for 10 years and helped organise the campaign, said she was delighted by the success of the protest. 'It all started about 10 days ago when our postman notified a few of us that he had been asked to change his round,' she said. Campaign: Villagers in Chetnole launched a protest petition against their postman being reassigned . Experienced: Mr Leak, pictured on his rounds today, has worked in the village for the past 24 years . 'We knew that wasn't going to be good for any of us - he didn't want to leave and we didn't want to lose him. He's been the postman in the village for 24 years, that's longer than most of us have lived here. 'Mick is the most reliable person, he knows everybody in the village and he keeps an eye open for people, lets neighbours know if he sees anything out of the ordinary. We rely on him. 'We got together and decided to have a protest. Everybody signed the petition, we got 168 signatures. We wrote to our local MP and lobbied the Royal Mail to make our feelings known. 'We have no quarrel with the guy who was going to take over, we just really felt it was inappropriate to replace someone who had been with the village for so long. 'We were delighted when we heard the other guy had pulled out. Now we just hope that things will quieten down and go back to the status quo.' HQ: The village hall was home to efforts to bring back Mr Leak after he was due to be reassigned . Row: Union bosses accuse the villagers of 'intimidating' the proposed replacement postman . However, the Communication Workers Union blamed 'hostility' from villagers for the new postman's decision to pull out of the proposed changes. 'It's disgraceful that customers have been allowed to intimidate a postal worker out of his new delivery round,' he said. 'The changes applied in Royal Mail's Sherborne office were voted through by the staff and there were no complaints from workers about the agreed changes. 'As Royal Mail adapts to life under privatisation and with increasing competition there is huge change taking place in the business. CWU has negotiated fair and democratic approaches to change which treat staff consistently.' Sleepy: But Chetnole has become a hotbed of activism over the Royal Mail decision . But Mrs Morgan said: 'We've had absolutely no contact with him, we don't know who he is or what round he does. 'We wouldn't want to upset anybody. We're being portrayed as an aggressive bunch but we're really not, we just got together one morning to save our postman. 'We would be appalled if we thought he was feeling in any way threatened, we just wanted to keep the man we know.' Chetnole has a population of 350 people with a local pub, village shop and post office, as well as a railway station where trains stop on request. Villagers now say they will hold a celebratory coffee morning to honour Mr Leak after their victorious campaign.","Mick Leak has delivered the post in Chetnole, Dorset since the early 1990s .

"Hundreds of companies are being helped to avoid tax ‘on an industrial scale’ by accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, a report by MPs will warn today. Executives at PwC will also be accused of misleading Parliament about their activities when they insisted two years ago they did not sell tax avoidance products. MPs on the Public Accounts Committee said leaked internal letters exposing PwC’s dealings with 343 firms show the firm clearly did ‘mass market’ schemes for companies to divert profits to Luxembourg. Hundreds of companies are being helped to avoid tax ‘on an industrial scale’ by accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, a report by MPs will warn today . Committee chairman Margaret Hodge, who worked at PwC from 1992-94, said that the firm's clients do not have to demonstrate that they run any operations in the tax haven to use this tactic. One firm advised by PwC, Shire Pharmaceuticals, used such a scheme to pay just 0.016 per cent tax on its profits in Luxembourg. Shire, which is incorporated in Jersey and has most of its 5,600 staff in the US and Britain, based just two employees there – one of whom was also a registered director of 41 companies. It set up a subsidiary in the country which lent its main operation £10billion. Interest payments on this loan reduced the tax burden in Britain significantly and PwC negotiated with authorities in Luxembourg to pay almost no tax there. Mrs Hodge said: ‘It is only right that companies pay their fair share of tax according to the profits they make from their economic activity in the countries in which they do business. MP Margaret Hodge said PwC's activities represented 'the promotion of tax avoidance on an industrial scale' ‘We believe that PwC’s activities represent nothing short of the promotion of tax avoidance on an industrial scale. ‘Contrary to its denials, the tax arrangements PwC promotes, based on artificially diverting profits to Luxembourg through intra-company loans, bear all the characteristics of a mass-marketed tax avoidance scheme.’ The MPs said evidence which PwC executive provided to them two years ago, that they did not market or produce tax products, was ‘misleading’. Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PwC, told the committee in 2013: ‘We are giving the best advice we can to clients on the options which they have. I don’t see anything wrong with that.’ PwC and other accounting firms tried to claim that they made arrangements tailored to the needs of individual clients. But PwC’s activities were revisited by the committee after the leak, three months ago, of 28,000 pages of documents by a former junior accountant at the firm. It exposed hundreds of deals PwC brokered – all ‘effectively variations on a scheme’, MPs said. The whistleblower, Frenchman Antoine Deltour, 28, has been charged with theft and exposing trade secrets over the so-called ‘LuxLeaks’ scandal, which unveiled deals with some of the world’s largest firms, such as Apple, Ikea and Pepsi, to avoid billions in taxes. Mrs Hodge said HM Revenue and Customs was also at fault, warning that without urgent action public finances will be harmed. The committee wants a code of conduct for all tax advisers to be enforced. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘Since 2010 we have brought in £31billion additional tax from intervening with large businesses and tackling non-compliance ... We have an outstanding record for challenging multinationals and their tax advisers who try to get around UK tax law.’ This week it emerged that leather goods firm Smythson, which employs David Cameron’s wife Samantha, is based in Luxembourg for tax reasons.","PricewaterhouseCoopers helped companies avoid tax, MPs' report to warn .

"There was a moment of disbelief when it dawned on Ina Mills that she and her family had become victims of fraud. She had put a $9000 engagement ring up for sale in a bid to raise funds for her sick son's urgent medical treatment. So when a potential buyer came by their family home to meet 19-month-old Roki, who was born with brain damage and cerebral palsy, Mrs Mills had every faith the woman had made an honest purchase of the antique diamond ruby ring. But Mrs Mills says the funds never came through. This not only shocked the family from Newport, northern Sydney, but also the wider community as they raised more than $11,000 for Roki. Since the incident on Australia Day, police arrested and charged a 25-year-old woman in Liverpool - southwest Sydney - on Thursday for the alleged fraudulent purchase of the handmade ring. Scroll down for video . This is Roki who's now 19-months-old. He was born with brain damage and cerebral palsy .

Police will allege that a 25-year-old woman (pictured in brown) fraudulently purchased the ring at Roki's family home in Sydney on Australia Day . The woman was taken to Liverpool Police Station on Thursday and charged with three counts of obtain benefit by deception . Mrs Mills placed the details of the sale in an online advert on Gumtree on December 21 and received expressions of interest from a woman by the name of Tanya. 'The ring had been given to us by my husband Dave's aunt as it was valued at about $9000 and she wanted us to sell it,' the mother-of two told Daily Mail Australia. 'But it was quite a unique ring so we put it up for sale for $7000 but we really didn't receive any interest for it until this woman called Tanya got in touch with us on Australia Day.' The woman was invited to Mrs Mills' home on January 26, where she met little Roki and his two-year-old sister Ruby. 'She tried on the ring and said that she'll have to get it re-sized because it was too small,' Mrs Mills said. 'She then said she'll do a bank transfer on the spot from her phone and showed me what looked like a legitimate bank receipt. 'I didn't suspect anything at all and I thanked her for helping us because the last 19 months have been very hard for us. 'I told her that her money was really going to help Roki and she also told us that he'll get better.' But three days had passed and there were no signs of the funds. 'I was positive that the money was going to come in but I got this sinking feeling when I tried calling the woman and her phone was disconnected,' Mrs Mills said. 'I just couldn't sleep for three days because this woman had stolen from Roki.' Roki had to be resuscitated soon after his birth due to some complications and suffered brain damage . The Mills family in India in October last year for his second stem cell treatment . Roki and his family in India during his first stem cell treatment in February last year .

Mrs Mills and husband David had planned for he proceeds from the ring to go towards Roki's third and hopefully final stem cell treatment in India next month. He began his therapy at six-months-old at Nu Tech Medi World and Mrs Mills said 'the results have been amazing'. 'After his first treatment early last year his muscle spasm completely disappeared,' she said. 'We just wanted to get him out of pain so this was a great result for us. 'Then he started to move his right and left arm and considering he was diagnosed with quadriplegic cerebral palsy we were amazed. 'After his second treatment in October he started lifting his head up on his own - something he's never done before.' But each trip to India comes at a price - $40,000 for the flights, accommodation and Roki's treatment. Roki being looked after by his dad whilst he undergoes treatment in hospital . Roki had to be kept in hospital for six weeks after his birth to undergo tests and MRI scans . Doctors delivered the bad news to Roki's parents, telling them their son had brain damage and cerebral palsy . Despite the cruel act of deceit, donations began flowing in for Roki - named after the 'rocky start' he had from the moment he was born. 'We were completely swamped by good will after our faith in humanity was destroyed,' Mrs Mills said. Even media personalities were touched by Roki's story as one of the hosts of 2GB radio Ben Fordham helped raised $11,000 for the 19-month-old. 'I've got the most generous listeners in Australia,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'When they heard about some lowlife stealing from a lovely family they jumped in to help. 'One of my listeners threw in a hundred, another two hundred, five hundred, a grand, two and a half grand and before you knew it we had raised enough money to cover the theft.' Mrs Mills shared Roki's heart-breaking story on his website, detailing how her newborn son had to be resuscitated soon after his birth due to some complications and suffered brain damage. He was then kept in hospital for six weeks, undergoing MRI scans and other tests, where doctors discovered his reactions and development 'proved to be more severe than predicted'. 'We were told that he may not talk, suck, eat, walk or see,' Mrs Mills wrote. 'But we continued to believe that he may and we still do. We could cope with all the bad news but the hardest thing remains the daily pain and discomfort he suffers from his severe muscle spasms. 'Roki's daily life is not easy. He is on very strong medications to help with the pain and control of his muscle spasms.' Mrs Mills posted a photo of her son thanking the community for their generous donations . Roki's family remain hopeful that he will one day get better through his stem cell treatments . Days after the  incident on Australia Day, police charged a 25-year-old woman in relation to the alleged fraudulent purchase of Mrs Mills' ring. She was taken to Liverpool Police Station on Thursday and charged with three counts of obtain benefit by deception. She was granted bail and will face Liverpool Local Court on March 4. In a separate matter, when the woman was released, she was allegedly recognised by a man who had attended the station to report a fraud. Police then re-arrested the woman near the police station where they spoke to her about the new allegations before releasing her pending further investigations. 'I just don't know how that woman could have seen the state of Roki and walked out of our home with the ring,' Mrs Mills said. 'But I think Roki is a little hero for catching someone who is abusing other people's trust. 'I hope Roki will one day return the help that he's received because he will get better. We will remain relentless in finding a cure for our son.' The ring is yet to be recovered.","Police have charged a woman in relation to the alleged fraudulent purchase of an engagement ring .
Ina Mills put the ring up for sale on Gumtree  to raise money for her sick son's medical treatment .

"Trevor McKendrick, an atheist from Utah, earns more than $100,000 annually in revenue from his Spanish Bible apps . A Utah man has made a six-figure salary by selling Bible apps, but feels guilty because he is not a practicing Christian. Trevor McKendrick, an entrepreneur from Salt Lake City who was raised Mormon but is now an atheist, has successfully created two Spanish Bible apps. After launching the apps and raking in an annual revenue of $100,134, he has begun questioning his morality over selling the religious book he does not believe in. McKendrick attended a Mormon college and was also married in a Mormon temple, but he eventually left the church, according to Business Insider. He said that he does not believe in Christianity or the Bible, and likened him selling the apps to someone selling Harry Potter and telling people it was real. 'What if you sold Harry Potter books or Lord of the Rings books, but you told people it was real?,' he said in a podcast interview with StartUp. 'And you told people if they would just learn how to write spells themselves, they could heal their children? 'And if you sold that as a real thing? I would feel terrible about that. 'But that's really the situation I am in selling the Bible. I am selling this thing I truly believe is fiction.' McKendrick, who successfully launched the audio version of the app, La Biblia Reina Valera (left), said he battles with the notion of selling the religious book he does not believe in.  The app is compatible with iPads and iPhones (right) Source: Wycliffe Bible Translators . Both of his apps are Spanish translations of the Bible for iPhones. One app is a text version that is free to download and offers in-app purchases, and took less than $500 to create, according to the International Business Times. The second one is an audio book app that sells for $9.99 in the Apple app store. The more successful of the two, the audio book app, made $5,000 to $6,000 per month following its launch, and his annual revenue jumped from $74,034 in the first year to $100,134 in the second year. McKendrick came up with the idea in 2012 as a way to pay his $600 rent and realized that there were a few Spanish Bible apps that were terrible. Since creating the apps, he said he has received emails from customers asking for prayer as they think he is a preacher. McKendrick said: 'If you're emailing the maker of an app to get help for your son, you're probably not a in a great spot. Trading that for profit weighs on me a little bit.' But when asked if he felt guilty enough to stop selling the product, McKendrick said even though he might have a problem with it, he cannot stop. He told the Huffington Post that he takes pride in his positively reviewed product that people really like and are grateful for, which makes it easier for him to reconcile his faith with his business.","Trevor McKendrick, a software entrepreneur, was raised as a Mormon but eventually left the church .

"A young Connecticut mom with a previous conviction for prostitution has been arrested for allegedly leaving her newborn baby in a car in the freezing cold wearing only a onesie, while she shopped in a sex store with a male friend. Police say that Lindsay Hoffmann, 26, and her acquaintance, Marquette Riggsbee, 54, walked into an adult emporium in Southington called VIP on Wednesday morning. However they were stopped at the door and told that children were not permitted. Hoffmann then allegedly put her two-week-old son in the car. The temperature outside was 29 degrees. Busted: Lindsay Hoffmann, 26, and her acquaintance, Marquette Riggsbee, 54 - who both have previous prostituion-related arrests - allegedly left her two-week-old son in the car to shop in a Connecticut adult store . Police received a call to the store at 11am after a worker noticed the little boy inside the 1997 Nissan Sentra. They believe he had been in the vehicle for over 20 minutes. The baby’s core temperature was 'found to be adequate but it did have cold extremities', police said, according to The Smoking Gun. 'He was not dressed for winter,' VIP District Manager Tina Marchese told WFSB. 'He was just in a normal onesie - no hat, hands exposed. 'It really affected us because we are all mothers so it was a really sad thing for the baby.' The child was taken to hospital for an evaluation but was deemed to be fine. He has been taken into custody by the Department of Children and Families. Hoffmann and Riggsbee were each charged with risk of injury to a minor and leaving a child unsupervised. They were remanded in jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. Scene: Hoffman allegedly left her baby son in this carpark - with the outside temperature sitting at 29 degrees - while she shopped at the store, VIP in Southington, Connecticut . Hoffmann, of Waterbury, is scheduled to appear in court Thursday. She has 2013 convictions for prostitution and failure to appear in court, according to The New York Daily News. She was found guilty in December of driving with a suspended driver’s license, online court records show. Riggsbee faces pending charges for trafficking in persons, coercion, promoting prostitution and unlawful restraint. He was convicted of resisting arrest in 2013.","Lindsay Hoffmann, 26, and, Marquette Riggsbee, 54, entered the adult store in Southington, Connecticut, around 11am Wednesday .

"Michael Gove's education reforms have suffered a fresh blow after his flagship policy of giving universities a say over the content of A-levels was discontinued. He wanted universities to take 'ownership' of the exams by dictating their syllabus and reviewing them annually. The reforms were designed to address concerns from academics that A-levels were not rigorous enough to prepare students for university. The failure to commit to a continuing academic-led review might be viewed as the latest weakening of Mr Gove’s reforms since he was sacked as education secretary in July last year . It is understood the board, formed of academics at Russell Group universities, will soon be registered as a dormant company after a decision by Nick Gibb (pictured), minister of state for education . But the A-Level Content Advisory Board formed 18 months ago to oversee this process has been mothballed, it has emerged. The decision by Education Minister Nick Gibb will be seen by some as the latest weakening of Mr Gove's reforms since he was sacked as Education Secretary last July. Since then, his replacement Nicky Morgan has been dubbed 'Ms U-turn' because of her differing views on key issues including grammar schools and pupil punishment. The Department for Education said the advisory board could be recalled, but its suspension is likely to disappoint many academics keen for the sector to retain a role in ensuring the exam's rigour. Although Mr Gove had suggested all A-levels would be scrutinised, only three subjects underwent major reviews. Some of the board's recommendations were shelved after proving unpopular with teachers.","Under Michael Gove, universities were to take 'ownership' of A-levels .

"Defence chiefs are trying to recruit more Muslims into the army after the rise of Islamic State and massacre in Paris, it has been revealed. Troops have posted pamphlets on British military values through the doors of Islamic religious schools and have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers. The drive comes after it emerged there are just 480 Muslims serving in the British army - 0.5 per cent of the 88,500 overall troops. Drive: Troops have posted pamphlets on British military values through the doors of Islamic religious schools and have been instructed to take part in integration projects in a bid to boost numbers. By contrast, more than twice as many British Muslims were believed to have travelled to Syria to fight for extremists including the Islamic State. And the percentage of Muslims in the UK population overall is much higher at five per cent. Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter, said: ‘My highest priority is ensuring we continue to have the best possible talent throughout our Army. ‘This requires us to draw talent from all of the society we represent.’ He said the army’s recruitment from the UK’s black, Asian and ethnic minority populations was ‘nowhere near where it needs to be’. He added: ‘We have to do more. The Army has always played an important role in making the connection to all elements of society and there are plenty of examples of initiatives that have built enduring relationships with minority communities.’ He said there was ‘common ground’ between the values of the army and those in minority communities and the military could build on that ground to broaden their recruitment base. As well as young Muslims, the British army is also trying to recruit people from all ethnic minorities. This year the army will participate in ten events across the UK each month, focused on engaging with these communities. Currently 9,100 – just over 10 per cent - of the strong regular army is drawn from these communities. Islamic State: There are just 480 Muslims serving in the British army. By contrast, more than twice as many British Muslims were believed to have travelled to Syria to fight for extremists last summer . But the UK’s ethnic population is growing and is expected to reach 30 per cent of the total in the coming decades. A defence source said ‘talent must therefore be attracted from this population’ as the figures show ‘that UK ethnic minorities are under-represented in the army’. They added: ‘Diversity in all its forms drives change and can be a key factor in organisational agility. ‘This agility is key for an Army facing evolving and hybrid threats.’ The Ministry of Defence is working to develop better mutual understanding between the army and minority communities, it was said. One initiative to recruit more Muslims included a warrant officer and recruiter in the North West who had been trying hard to recruit in Asian and Muslim communities – but without great success. This was until he started posting a copy of British Army values through the doors of madrassas- the Arabic term for schools – in Burnley. This resulted in the director of the school asking the officer if he would come round for a cup of tea and then realising they had many shared values. Another initiative the army has been engaged in involved army officers integrating mixed-race members of the community by building off-road ‘warrior buggies’ with them. The scheme sees students attending weekly sessions at the local Territorial Army base at Swinton, Manchester, where they learn basic engineering and mechanical skills, as well as the building of team skills. Paris attacks: Defence chiefs are trying to recruit more Muslims into the army after the rise of Islamic State and massacre in Paris, it has been revealed . There will also be a focused campaign to target different ethnic communities across the UK during the coming year, which will feature across social and digital channels supported by events. The Army has also launched the Armed Forces Muslim Forum, designed to bring the civil and military Muslim communities together. Another initiative includes the army working in partnership with the Shah Jehan Mosque and the people of Woking to create a Muslim Peace Garden that commemorates Muslims serving in the Armed Forces. Next week British soldiers of different faiths, including British Muslim soldiers, will plant trees as part of the project. A source added: ‘With improved understanding the Army is seeking to build bonds with the whole nation it serves. ‘Myths need to be dispelled and more ethnic minorities should be encouraged to look at careers in our Regular Army, Army Reserve and at volunteering opportunities with the Army Cadets.’ Muslims in the UK armed forces are able to pray five times a day and fast, as long as there is not an overwhelming operational requirement against either. They are provided with halal rations, can seek support from Muslim chaplains, and use prayer rooms on base – one of which was recently made available on a naval warship. Figures show that half of ethnic minorities currently in the UK are Asian and 50 per cent of the Asian population are non-Muslim. The army is trying to recruit from all sectors of society .","Leaflets on British military values posted through doors of Islamic schools .

"If you have ever found yourself wishing your life was more like the movies, it seems you're not alone. Buyers are snapping up properties in British towns and villages that have featured in films – sending prices soaring.

"The key to a happy marriage is supposed to be not keeping any secrets from one another. So perhaps that explains the very guilty secret one in ten of us has – a stash of cash kept hidden from our partner in case we want to flee the relationship. And according to the survey that revealed these ‘escape funds’, men are more likely than women to have accumulated them. Eleven per cent of men admitted they had hidden cash away so they could leave, compared with 8 per cent of women. The average amount in these secret accounts is £7,500. The Money Advice Service questioned 2,000 adults, three-quarters of them married and the rest in long-term relationships. Those living in the West Midlands and London were the most likely to say they are sitting on a secret escape fund – one in six, compared with around one in 30 in Northern Ireland and one in 25 in the South West. Nearly a fifth of those surveyed admitted to a different financial secret – they said they had hidden their debts from their partner. Of those who were married, 24 per cent said their spouse would be ‘upset, angry or surprised’ if the true state of their finances was revealed to them. The average couple has around 39 arguments about money every year, the study found. Londoners have the most frequent finance-related rows, typically having 53 arguments per year. One in eight of those surveyed said their credit rating had been damaged by the actions of a partner, rising to one in five of those aged between 25 and 34. Eleven per cent of men admitted they had hidden cash away so they could leave, compared with 8 per cent of women. The average amount in these secret accounts is £7,500. Nick Hill, a money expert at the MAS – an independent body set up by the Government to offer free money advice – said: ‘We like to think that the person we choose to share our life with will always be honest with us, but our research shows that, even for married couples, this may not be the case. ‘It may be upsetting to find out your partner is hiding money from you, but finding out they are in significant debt could be much worse, with consequences for your own finances.' Mr Hill said money should not be a taboo subject, adding: 'It is vital to talk about your financial position as soon as you feel comfortable, ideally, before you become financially connected to your partner. 'If you are planning to share bills such as a rent or mortgage, make sure you are clear about how these are split.","Eleven per cent of men admitted they had hidden cash so they could leave .

"Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander were at the top of London’s Shard skyscraper. Oh no! Were they about to jump? Happily it was nothing to do with an opinion poll suggesting both will lose their seats. Instead they had hurriedly called a Lib Dem PR event to try to scupper a big Cameron-Osborne event promoting the Tories’ ‘northern powerhouse’ idea. The Shard venue was mad, delicious, screamingly vulgar: the 52nd-floor, Chinese-accented Gong Bar of the Shangri La hotel (minimum spend per head 30 quid). Welcome to utopia and the ‘timeless allure of the Orient’, as the bar’s slogan goes. Scroll down for video . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg (left) and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (centre) were speaking at the Shangri La Hotel on the 52nd floor of the Shard in central London in the hastily-arranged PR event . It was a small, thick-carpeted boudoir lined by bottles of Champagne – Billecart-Salmon, Deutz, Egly-Ouriet. Aren’t they in the French three-quarter line? Waiters shimmered in white, collarless uniforms, as favoured by dental nurses. We were greeted by wide-smiled beauties. Lib Dem sportsman Lord Rennard would have been beside himself, had he only been there. Instead we had perhaps ten non-media attendees, not all Lib Dems. The suited gent’ next to me was witheringly rude about the party. How had the Lib Dems paid for this chi-chi pad? Our host was a busy little puffball in a plum-coloured velvet jacket flourishing a top-pocket, silk hankie. His name was D.K. Matai and he was giving out business cards like after-dinner mints. He looked like Nick Nack in The Man With The Golden Gun. Cleggy and decent Danny A (quite chunky these days) scuttled in and stood in the corner. Their backdrop should have been the glittering City but the view was of mist. A low cloud’s bright light cast the two MPs’ faces into shadow. Mr Alexander opened proceedings. Clegg watched with a sullen air. Why so cheesed-off? Hand in pocket, a diagonal expression. Peevishness stewed in his eyes. Channel 4’s Michael Crick asked Mr Clegg if he was going to lose his Sheffield seat. In a spurt of petulance Cleggy said the poll was ‘complete and utter nonsense’ got up by the trade unions. He had hoped Channel 4 might have asked about Lib Dem fiscal policies. But what will be the point of manifesto pledges on tax/spending ratios if Cleggy and Danny are both decapitated by the electorate? What, indeed, is the point of any Lib Dem manifesto, seeing as it can only be a precursor to coalition talks? Mr Clegg was acidic about his Tory Coalition partners, accusing them of being cruel to the poor. The Labour party was derided rather less, though mocked for wanting to put bills on the ‘never-never’. Mr Clegg (pictured) said his party’s ‘sensible, balanced approach would bring an end to the era of austerity in three years’ time while protecting public services and the most vulnerable in society . Cleggy four times described the Tories as ‘ideological’, as though this was undesirable in MPs. The opposite of an ideological politician, I suppose, is an opportunistic one? Is that preferable? Cliches bubbled: ‘Economy back on track ... let us finish the job ... our plan ... fairness, etc.’ Mr Clegg claimed that the Lib Dems were the party of stability. Priceless! He mentioned the North and the South West of England, though not the South East (where Vince Cable has his seat). Venomous Vince’s name was mentioned at one point. Mr Clegg, hearing it, immediately started to shake his head. And he took a swipe at the Tories ‘mismanaging their inner demons on Europe’. Ah yes, Europe. Is pro-Brussels Mr Clegg himself not a teensy bit ‘ideological’ on the EU? A reporter asked if the Lib Dems and their higher tax policies had any supporters in the business world. Mr Clegg said they did: a chap called Richard who runs Innocent drinks. Any others? Cleggy said he would send the reporter ‘a postcard’ with further names of Lib Dem business backers. Not so many of them, then. Not everything was audible, because a BBC TV reporter started doing a loud live broadcast in the room while Mr Clegg was talking. Velvet-jacketed Mr Matai told the reporter to be quiet. Well done, Nick Nack. Take a peerage.","Nick Clegg and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander at Shard .

"Motorists are to have a motorway station 'tsar' to drive up poor greasy spoon standards on Britain's motorways. Roads minister John Hayes said he is to launch an inquiry into the service offered and prices charged to motorists. He will soon be appointing a chairman or 'tsar' to head it. Motorists are to have a motorway station 'tsar' to drive up poor greasy spoon standards on motorways . He wants to see fewer mass market chains and more independently run shops, bistros and outlets, as well as more green spaces in which to relax. It follows moves by the Chancellor to force motorway filling stations to advertise their pump prices by the side of the road so drivers can decide whether to fill-up or drive on to the next one which may be cheaper. Mr Hayes said: 'Service stations were once rather glamorous. 'Crowds flocked to the opening of the first service station at Watford Gap in November 1959, and to Newport Pagnell which opened the following year. But like the motorway system they served, the glamour faded quickly. 'They became more notable for bad food, congestion and fighting football fans than for providing a pleasant, friendly environment for motorists and their passengers to take a break.' Roads minister John Hayes wants to see fewer mass market chains and more independently run shops . He said John Major had made an effort to improve things when he told the 1992 Conservative Party conference that service stations needed to be reformed. Many were subsequently privatised. But much more is needed: 'I want to encourage owners and operators to go further - Providing green spaces as well as car parking spaces.' He also wants to 'improve the quality and range of independent cafes and shops available'. He said: 'These places should be charming and eclectic, creating a break from the particular monotony of long distance travel, not adding to it.' 'My vision for service stations is not just to offer a place where electric cars can be recharged, but also where drivers can be recharged, relaxed and ready to carry on with their journey.","A tsar is being brought in to improve British motorway service stations .

"Hubble has captured the rare sight of three of Jupiter's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet's banded face.

Hubble has captured the rare sight of three of Jupiter's largest moons parading across the giant gas planet's banded face. The telescope took a string of images of the event which show the three satellites — Europa, Callisto and Io — in action 601 million miles (968 million km) from Earth. Jupiter and its moons have long fascinated astronomers. The ones seen in these images are called Galilean satellites — named after the 17th century scientist Galileo Galilei who discovered them. They complete orbits around Jupiter ranging from two to seventeen days in duration. Each of the moons can commonly be seen transiting the face of Jupiter and casting shadows onto its layers of cloud. The image on the left shows the Hubble observation at the beginning of the event. On the left is the moon Callisto and on the right, Io. The shadows from Europa, which cannot be seen in the image, Callisto, and Io are strung out from left to right . The Jovian lunar gathering, which happens only once or twice a decade, was captured on January 23 showing the unusual sight in a single frame . Astronomers believe the rough, icy surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa, is the most likely place in the solar system to harbour alien life. 'For the first time in the history of humanity we have the tools and technology and capability to potentially answer this question. And, we know where to go to find it,' Kevin Hand, a Nasa astrobiologist, said last year. The $18.5 billion Nasa budget recently proposed by the White House for next year includes money earmarked for a mission to the moon. Previous scientific findings point to the existence of a liquid water ocean located under the moon's icy crust. This ocean covers Europa entirely and contains more liquid water than all of Earth's oceans combined. Europa is the sixth closest moon to Jupiter and the smallest of the four Galilean satellites that belong to the planet. It is one of the smoothest objects in the solar system with few craters on its surface. The moon Io, which orbits significantly closer to Jupiter and so moves much more quickly, can be seen approaching the eastern limb of the planet. While Callisto's shadow seems hardly to have moved, Io's has set over the planet's eastern edge and Europa's has risen further in the west. Missing from this sequence is the Galilean moon Ganymede which was outside Hubble's field of view. Each moons of Jupiter have very distinctive colours. The smooth icy surface of Europa is yellow-white, the volcanic sulphur surface of Io is orange and the surface of Callisto, is a brownish colour. The moons are bigger than all the dwarf planets, and Ganymede, Callisto and Io are all larger than Earth's moon. Ganymede, meanwhile, is larger than the planet Mercury. The images were taken with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 in visible light. While Hubble captures these moons in great clarity, Nasa says they can also be seen with a small telescope or even a strong pair of binoculars from home.

Margaret suffered broken bones in her jaw and cheek and other injuries from the attack on January 6, 2010 . ‘I felt like my head was just mush inside, and I thought, “I’m dying,’” Margaret, now 49, told ABC News' 20/20. ‘And then I was thinking, “I've got to hold it together. I have to stay conscious so I can save the girls.'"" Farren, now 62, was sentenced to 15 years in prison last July after a jury found him guilty of attempted murder, first degree assault and risk of injury to a child. The judge also ordered that he never again have contact with his two daughters. ‘The wounds didn't heal for a long time. The impact was so severe that I completely lost my sense of smell,’ said Margaret. Farren choked his wife and beat her with a metal flashlight until she lost consciousness at their home in January 2010. She managed to flee the house with her two daughters. Farren disputed the seriousness of the charges and also tried to use a mental health defense, but a judge didn't allow it.

"Sajid Javid owed to change counter-terror laws used for official snooping on reporters . The Culture Secretary declared ‘journalism is not terrorism’ yesterday as he vowed to change counter-terror laws used for official snooping on reporters. Sajid Javid said he was ‘shocked’ by the extent of police accessing journalists’ phone records revealed in a report this week. He said new safeguards requiring the authorisation of a judge before such evidence is released would be rushed through before May’s general election. Mr Javid said journalists were ‘just as much part of our democracy as the MPs that sit in the chamber’ and told an audience of political journalists: ‘If you are not free to go about your legitimate business, it is our democracy that suffers. Democracy needs journalists to function.’ A report by the Interception of Communications Commissioner Sir Anthony May this week revealed the extent of the use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to monitor journalists. It was prompted after it emerged Scotland Yard had accessed the phone records of reporters to try to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row. The report found that Ripa did not ‘provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources’ – and found that over a three-year period, 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into contacts between public officials and journalists. Mr Javid said there was ‘no excuse’ for the authorities to use powers created to tackle terrorism as a tool to investigate reporters. He added: ‘Democracy needs journalists to function. That is why last month’s attacks in Paris struck a chord around the world. They weren’t just an attack on a magazine, they were an attack on the ideals that underpin our way of life. ‘Our journalists also face insidious threats from other quarters, be they commercial, judicial or political. Yesterday, we learnt the full extent to which Ripa was used to monitor journalists and their contacts. Mr Javid said he was 'appalled' to learn legislation used to catch terrorists such as the Charlie Hebdo attackers was being used on journalists . ‘Like many of you, I was shocked. In Paris we saw terrorists attacking the fundamental freedoms of the media, so I was appalled to discover that legislation created to hamper terrorists was now being used to undermine those very same freedoms. ‘Judicial approval will now be required before Ripa is used to access journalists’ data. It is a great victory for everyone who believes in press freedom.’ Mr Javid also referred to speculation that he plans to bid for the Conservative leadership when David Cameron stands down. He joked as he opened his address: ‘I have today agreed to let my name go forward for the leadership of... Oops, wrong speech.’","Culture Secretary vows to change counter-terror laws used on journalists .

"A Texas man fatally shot his ex-girlfriend Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide just hours after the woman went to the police seeking protection, police say. Heather Coglaiti, 33, reported her ex-boyfriend, 46-year-old Jose Calderon, to the Corpus Christi Police Department Monday seeking protection after he allegedly slashed her tires and sent her threatening text messages. Calderon spoke with police in a 37-minute interview and was released without being charged, according to BuzzFeed. Murder: Jose Calderon (right) fatally shot his ex-girlfriend, Heather Coglaiti (left)Tuesday morning before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide just hours after the woman went to the police seeking protection .

Police say Calderon forced his way inside the mother-of-three's apartment in Flour Bluff, shot her brother, shot her, then shot himself, KRIS-TV reports. Someone called the police around 5am Tuesday morning after hearing gun shots, and police arrived to the gruesome scene. Coglaiti's brother suffered a gunshot wound and was taken to a hospital where he was listed in stable condition, KZTV reports. Coglaiti's two young daughters were in another room when the shots rang out, they were not injured. The tragedy was the culmination of a series of incidents of domestic abuse between the two. The couple had broken up earlier this year after being in an on-again-off-again relationship for two years, according to KRIS-TV.

Coglaiti's friends and family told KRIS that the after the two broke up in January, Calderon began harassing Coglaiti and she feared for her safety. In the last month, Coglaiti reportedly filed seven reports with the police against Calderon including receiving death threats, Calderon smashing her windows, and recently slashing her tires. Police say that once Calderon even poured a bottle of liquor on Coglaiti's head and threatened to set her on fire. Coglaiti's friends said she was afraid Calderon would go through with his threats. A friend of Coglaiti's told KIII-TV, that the woman lived in constant fear of Calderon and the victim's younger brother was staying with her and her three children in the apartment to protect them. 'There was a couple of times when police were called,' the friend said, 'but it was pretty much one of those things where she tried to handle it herself and they'd argue and he'd leave and she'd let him back in.'

Police had arrested five teenagers over the alleged sexual assault of a teenage girl on  a trampoline at a party in Englewood, Colorado (file picture) The alleged victim was said to have consented to sex with one of the boys, but three others joined in despite her protests, reported CBS Denver. Court documents also alleged that the same girl was later assaulted by two boys in a tent. The attack reportedly only ended when the mother of one of the accused called him inside, according to CBS Denver. A number of those involved are believed to attend Englewood High School and letters were reportedly sent to families to let them know that counsellors were on hand for any students upset by the incident. One supect, named as Daylon Benjamin Hill, 19, is being held at Arapahoe County Jail on a $50,000 bond. The alleged sex attack happened in the town of Englewood, Colorado, pictured . The others, aged between 15 and 16 years, were said to be at a youth detention facility.

"The last time David Moyes took career advice from Sir Alex Ferguson, things did not work out quite so well. But that did not stop him seeking the opinion of his predecessor at Old Trafford before accepting the invitation to become the new manager of Real Sociedad, as he revealed after his official unveiling in San Sebastian. It would suggest Moyes harbours no grudge against Ferguson after his dismissal from United in April, or indeed after an updated version of Ferguson’s autobiography was released last month. If some saw the new chapter as less than complimentary about Moyes, the former Everton manager did not take offence once he was aware of the full context. David Moyes poses with a Real Sociedad scarf as he was unveiled as the club's new manager on Thursday . Moyes admits he took advice from Sir Alex Ferguson, as he did before taking over at Manchester United . The new Sociedad boss was in high spirits as he oversaw his first training session in San Sebastian . There was not a hint of bitterness as he embarked on this new Spanish adventure here on Thursday. Not only did he feel rejuvenated after a seven-month break but he felt vindicated too, such are the difficulties Louis van Gaal has endured this season after amassing fewer points than Moyes at the same stage last year. He was even generous towards his Dutch successor, who he said should be given more time than he was. The conversation with Ferguson was nevertheless an interesting one. ‘I phoned Sir Alex about coming out and he spoke about the job and the opportunity, which he thought was a great one for me,’ he said. ‘He thought it would be a good chance and something very few British managers get the opportunity to do.’ Very few British managers get the very top jobs in English football these days and the 10-month spell he endured at United will always be a source of frustration. But appearing before the Spanish media here at the Anoeta Stadium there was no shortage of confidence. He was relaxed and self-assured, delighted to be in Spain’s wealthiest city even if his new boss happens to be in the arms business. Moyes was greeted at his press conference unveiling with large welcoming backdrop . The Scot took his first training session at the Zubieta training ground, where he met his new players . Moyes (right) alongside Real Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay (left) and Director General Lorenzo Juarros . ‘I feel that I have now got myself in a position where I’m in a good frame of mind,’ he said, smiling. ‘I feel good. I still stand by what I said at the time that I was not given enough time at United to succeed or fail. ‘I think there was nothing wrong with how we worked and everyone can see that whoever is in charge at Manchester United, it is quite a long job to do things. Nine months would never be enough time for any manager. ‘I do think that most real football people understood that there would be a period of transition at Manchester United when you take over from Sir Alex. I always believed I was the right person for the job and I still believe that is the case. But Louis van Gaal now has to be given the time to do the job.’ If that amounted to a bit of score-settling, his focus soon shifted to the opportunity he now has at ‘La Real’. Moyes cut a different figure to the one seen at the end of his Old Trafford tenure, smiling for the cameras . The former Everton and Manchester United man (far right) addresses his new players at a training session . Moyes threw a scarf round his neck as he posed for photographs at the side of the Anoeta stadium pitch . He sat in the bar of his hotel on Thursday night and spoke enthusiastically of the plans he has seen for the stadium refurbishment; the fact that the pitch will be lowered to accommodate new seating that will fill the space currently occupied by a running track. And he revealed how he would be beginning Spanish lessons on Monday, determined to embrace the culture here as much as the challenge of managing in a league he considers superior to English football’s top flight. As he said, Spain has the ‘best players’ and the clubs currently dominating European football. ‘Look at the last Champions League final,’ he said. In the main press conference he was asked by a Spanish journalist if he was ‘more of a Mourinho or a Guardiola’. He did not duck the question, the one-time Chosen One answering that he was more like the Special One because he ‘works hard’ and has a history at Everton of building successful teams. Moyes was seen smiling as he made a phone call during the training session at Zubieta, San Sebastian . Moyes follows in the footsteps of John Toshack (left) and Chris Coleman (right) at Real Sociedad . The 51-year-old is settling into his new environment, where he hopes he can bring success to the club . They seem to like talk of Everton here. They regard themselves on a similar level and the league finishes Moyes consistently achieved at Goodison Park would be seen as success by the Basques. Their excitement here is almost tangible. They view Moyes as quite a catch, ‘a big international coach’, so much so that golfer Jose Maria Olazabal — a Basque himself — made the effort to join him for dinner with senior club officials. Moyes seemed to like that, just as he was delighted to hear from his old friend Carlo Ancelotti on Thursday morning. ‘He welcomed me to Spain,’ he said of the Real Madrid manager.

Moyes (right) next to club president Perribai during his official unveiling in a press room at Anoeta stadium . ‘I’m looking forward to getting back out on the grass and working and coaching again,’ he said. ‘This for me is a big challenge to come away and take on a big Spanish club who are at the wrong end of the table and need to be pulled up. ‘It’s probably my biggest challenge because it is a different country and you come here not actually knowing the players as directly as you might back home.’","David Moyes was sacked as Manchester United manager in April .

"Experts have blamed the  rise in the number of children killed on Britain's roads  on parents failing to properly secure their children in cars . The number of children killed or seriously injured on Britain’s roads has risen for the first time in two decades because of complacency over seatbelts. Experts and motoring groups last night blamed the first full year rise since 1995 on parents failing to properly secure their children in cars. The number of youngsters killed or seriously injured rose by 3 per cent to 2,060 in the year to September 2014, official statistics revealed. The AA described the figures as ‘shocking’ and pointed to a study by the UK’s Transport Research Laboratory that found that 13 per cent of child passengers were not properly restrained. This compares with just 1.9 per cent of drivers caught failing to wear a seatbelt. Even when parents do try to secure their children in their car, many still fail to do so properly either through ignorance or by accident. A Which? survey last year revealed nine out of ten shops – including major high street names – made ‘potentially lethal mistakes’ when showing parents how to install their child and baby car seats properly. Motoring groups said it was time to bring back children’s road safety campaigns such as Green Cross Code and Tufty the Squirrel, updated for the digital generation of youngsters. But campaigners also claimed the figures highlighted how the Government’s road safety record had ‘slammed into reverse’ as the total number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads rose by 4 per cent to 24,360 compared with the previous year. Road deaths were up by 1 per cent to 1,730 in the year to September 2014. Total casualties rose by 5 per cent to 192,910 compared with the previous year. Even slight casualties were up 5 per cent to 168,540. The Department for Transport’s latest road casualty report concluded: ‘Child Killed and Seriously Injured (KSI) casualties have risen in each quarter of 2014 in comparison with the same periods in 2013. These increases have now resulted in the first rise in rolling year comparisons in child KSI casualties since the year ending March 1995.’ Interestingly, the death and serious injury rate among child pedestrians decreased by 1 per cent over the same period – suggesting it is children in cars bearing the brunt of the rise. Child casualties ‘of all severities’ also rose by 6 per cent to 16,640 compared with 2013. For the three-month summer period of July to September last year the total number of under-16s killed or seriously injured – including those travelling in vehicles – was up 1 per cent to 580. The number of youngsters killed or seriously injured rose by three per cent to 2,060 in the year to September 2014, official statistics have revealed (file picture) Yet here again the figure for child pedestrians was down by 1 per cent. Overall child pedestrian casualties last summer were down 7 per cent. AA president Edmund King said: ‘These latest road casualty statistics do not make for happy reading. ‘They indicate a clear rise in in-car child casualties. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest this could be linked to the failure of parents to properly fit their children’s child seats. ‘There is also separate research showing that some parents may not be keeping their children belted up in the back. ‘The statistics highlight the need for a continued focus on driver education, improved road conditions and a strong presence from traffic police officers.’ The road safety charity Brake said after years of improvement ‘the Government has slammed on the brakes and gone into reverse’. Pete Williams of the RAC said the figures should be a ‘wake-up call’ to ministers: ‘It is alarming to see that years of progress on road safety appears to have come to an abrupt halt.’ The Department for Transport figures revealed a 2.1 per cent rise in traffic volumes in summer 2014 compared with the previous summer. It could not definitively blame issues with child car seats for the rise, it said, but confirmed this was an issue it would look into. Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: ‘Britain’s roads are still among the safest in the world and there are 40 per cent fewer road deaths per year than a decade ago.’","Number of children killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads has risen .

"The ‘ludicrous’ prosecution of a doctor for female genital mutilation has created a climate of fear in which other medics are too scared to do their jobs, it was claimed yesterday. A jury took fewer than 25 minutes to acquit Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, of carrying out the potentially lethal procedure on a new mother. Another man, Hasan Mohamed, 41, was also cleared of abetting the offence. The Crown Prosecution Service is now under pressure to defend its decision to pursue the case – the first in the UK. It is facing accusations that the case was nothing more than a ‘show trial’ which risked diverting attention from genuine victims of the crime. Scroll down for video . Cleared: A jury took just 25 minutes to clear Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena of performing FGM after hearing  the 32-year-old was faced with a 'nightmarish scenario' when a patient cut at the age of six went into labour . Doctors and lawyers said the ‘insulting’ prosecution had risked making other doctors fearful of treating FGM victims. Dr Pallavi Bradshaw, medicolegal adviser at the Medical Protection Society said: ‘We need to be mindful that in pursuing criminal investigations of doctors, we do not create a climate of fear and undermine the much-needed culture of openness.’ Andrea James of Shoosmiths solicitors, which specialises in representing doctors, said she found it ‘difficult to understand’ why the CPS thought it an appropriate first case to prosecute under the FGM Act. She said there was ‘a very clear exemption’ in the act for professionals involved with childbirth. She added: ‘There is a definite risk that it will put doctors off treating victims of FGM. What I have seen from clients of ours who are obstetricians and gynaecologists is that they are extremely concerned about this case and they are saying that they do not want to undertake treatment (of FGM victims) unless their hospital has very clear procedures in place.’ Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders has come under fire over the timing of the announcement of the prosecution . Dr Katrina Erskine, a consultant at Homerton Hospital in East London added: ‘I thought it was ludicrous and insulting to survivors of FGM to equate anything that a midwife or a doctor does immediately after childbirth to what happens to young girls in terms of FGM.’ During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, the jury was told the alleged victim had been subjected to FGM as a six year-old in Somalia. She went into emergency labour at the Whittington Hospital in North London on November 24, 2012, and Dr Dharmasena had to make an incision to allow safe delivery of the baby. The prosecution said the way he repaired the incision – with a single figure-of-eight stitch – amounted to FGM. They said he acted under pressure from Mr Mohamed to reinstate her FGM after the birth. But Dr Dharmasena said the stitch was needed to stop the woman bleeding. The woman herself did not support the prosecution but he was arrested and suspended from his job after a midwife complained. The CPS announced the decision to charge both men with great fanfare in March last year. But there were questions over the timing of the announcement, which came just days before Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was due to appear before MPs to explain why there had been no FGM prosecutions in the UK. Asked yesterday on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if she thought it was the ‘wrong case’ to pursue, she said: ‘The legislation is designed to make FGM a crime no matter who commits it… The classic case is a young girl who has been cut, normally there are family or friends involved, the chances of a young girl coming into a police station to make a complaint about that are remote. That classic case is going to be a very difficult one to find.’ GPs will be forced to report cases of FGM and flag up girls who are thought to be at risk, under a raft of measures to be announced today. As part of the action, a system will be introduced which will allow clinicians to note on a child’s health record that they are potentially at risk of FGM. It will also become mandatory for GPs and mental health trusts to record cases of FGM. Hospitals are already required to do so. There will also be improved training for frontline health workers on how to communicate sensitively with patients about FGM. FGM dates back at least 2,000 years. In some cultures it is valued as a rite of passage from childhood to womanhood. Others believe it preserves a girl’s virginity until marriage.","Doctors fearful of treating FGM victims after 'ludicrous' prosecution .

"A lawyer for the Charles Manson family said that the cult leader murdered many more people than previously thought, according to tapes that have recently been heard for the first time in 40 years. Billy Boyd, a lawyer who represented cult member Charles 'Tex' Watson, reportedly said that Manson had told his client that he killed 'a bunch of other people'. In 1969, the Manson family murdered seven people including film director Roman Polanski's pregnant wife Sharon Tate under the direction of the charismatic ex-convict. Accusations: Charles 'Tex' Watson (left) allegedly told his lawyer that Charles Manson (right) had murdered many more people . Dark secrets: Manson family lawyer Billy Boyd (pictured) allegedly says on previously unheard tapes that Manson had murdered before the Sharon Tate killings . A voice which is allegedly Boyd's says that beside the seven known murders, Manson had told Watson he had killed alone, according to a recording obtained by Fox. Billy Boyd died in 2009, while Watson is serving a life sentence. Boyd said in the recordings, while speaking to an author, that his client was not implicated in any of these crimes. Watson was originally sentenced to death for killing Sharon Tate Polanski, Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Thomas Jay Sebring and Steven Earl Parent but California suspended the death penalty in 1972. Despite multiple attempts at parole, Manson is still behind bars for orchestrating the brutal killings, which he dubbed 'Helter Skelter' - in a deeply disturbed tribute to the Beatles song. The lawyer had taped 20 hours of conversations with Watson as they prepared for his murder trial. The . Los Angeles Police Department is desperate to get their hands on the . tapes which they believe could hold crucial information to solving many . more murders. Murdered: Actress Sharon Tate was eight and a half months pregnant when she was killed by Manson's followers on his orders . LAPD Chief Charlie Beck asked the Department of Justice to hand over the tapes which had been the property of Boyd's Texas law firm which went bankrupt last year. Watson tried to stop the tapes becoming public saying their release was a 'public dishonor' to those affected by the Manson murders. The recordings were private until September 1976 when Watson authorised their sale to author Chaplain Ray Hoekstra to help cover legal fees. The material was used in Mr Hoekstra's book Will You Die For Me? which was released in 1976. Charles Manson, now 77, is one of America's most notorious mass murderers. Amid the hippie culture of the 1960s, . the ex-convict put together a collection of runaways and outcasts known . as the Manson Family. In . the summer of 1969 he became one of the 20th century's most infamous . criminals when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder . seven people. Actress . Sharon Tate was stabbed 16 times by members of the cult in the early . morning hours of August 9, 1969 at the Benedict Canyon estate, sheltered . in the hills of Los Angeles. She was eight and a half months pregnant. Life in prison: Charles Manson, who orchestrated his cult to murder seven people, will not be eligible for parole until he is 92 . Four other people were stabbed or shot to death in Tate's home that night by the Manson followers, who scrawled the word 'Pig' in blood on the front door before leaving. The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write 'Rise,' 'Death to Pigs' and 'Helter Skelter' - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song - on the walls and refrigerator door. Manson is imprisoned at Corcoran State Prison in Kings County, California. He was convicted of the seven slayings as well as the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in July 1969. Like Watson, he was originally given a death sentence but spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Manson will next be eligible for parole in 15 years, when he will be 92-years-old. When he was denied release in 2007 the parole board ruled that he 'continues to pose an unreasonable danger to others and may still bring harm to anyone he would come in contact with'.","Lawyer Billy Boyd had 20 hours of conversations with convicted murderer Charles Watson at his Texas law firm .

"An 84-year old man was just trying to cook shrimp for his 70-year-old girlfriend when he accidentally burned down her house leaving four of her pets dead. A year later, having put the incident behind them, he received a letter telling him that his girlfriend was suing him. Only she wasn't. John Pyron of Fort Worth, Texas, was informed that Cecilla Ellison had filed a lawsuit against him for $152,926 plus interest for damage to her home in the 2012 cooking fire. John Pyron accidentally burned down his girlfriend's house while cooking shrimp for a dinner party. The couple and her dog made it out alive, but unfortunately her two cats and two birds did not . A year after the fire, Cecilla Ellison (left) was as shocked as Pyron (right) when a letter arrived stating that she was suing him for damages. The couple now live together with Ellison caring for Pyron who has health issues . 'I guess I was just stunned. I was in shock. I said, 'My God, what's going on?'' Pyron told NBC 5. But Ellison hadn't filed the suit and was just as shocked as Pyron, who has since moved in with her. Far from opponents locked in a hostile legal battle, Ellison now cares for him as he has health problems. 'I don't know what I'd do without her,' he said. The 2012 fire erupted during an August 18, 2012, dinner party at Ellison's house when Pyron poured water into an outdoor fish cooker, lit the fire underneath it and went to get the shrimp. Within minutes he realized both the cooker and the house were on fire. Efforts to put out the blaze failed and the Ellison's home was destroyed. Both she and Pyron escaped unharmed, as did her dog, but her two cats and two birds died in the blaze. Ellison filed an insurance claim with State Farm, and the company paid to put her into a temporary rental property and to repair the damage. Damage to the house was total, but Ellison's insurance company, State Farm, had put her in temporary accommodation and paid to repair the damage. After several months she was able to move back in . After several months she was able to move back into her home. But a year later the letter arrived in the mail specifically naming her as the plaintiff and Pyron as the defendant in the legal action. Neither of them could believe it, and Ellison wondered who was signing her name. It turned out that suit had been filed by State Farm in Ellison's name in a legal process known as 'subrogation', where insurers seek reimbursement when they believe someone else is at fault and should pay for damages. In this case, State Farm accused Pyron of leaving the fryer unattended. Pyron had his own insurance at the time through Farmers, which is providing his attorney free of charge to fight the case. The policy he had at the time covers him up to $300,000 – more than enough to cover the claim. While filed in their names, the lawsuit is actually between the two insurance companies and not Ellison and Pyron. Neither company wants to actually foot the bill for the damage. On paper the lawsuit names Ellison and Pyron as the plaintiff and defendant, but in reality it is their respective insurance companies fighting over which should pay the damages . 'When is it going to end? What's it going to cost me? Will I live long enough to see it?' said Pyron (right) While in the end Pyron probably won't have to pay for the damages, and Ellison technically won't receive a penny, both of them feel anxious to be caught in the middle. 'It's a mess,' Ellison said. They worry constantly about the lawsuit, which has been delayed five times since it was filed in May 2013 in Tarrant County District Court. 'When is it going to end? What's it going to cost me? Will I live long enough to see it?' said Pyron. State Farm declined to comment on the case, but Farmers released a statement: 'We are working diligently to secure all the relevant information necessary to properly defend our customer and hope to resolve this matter soon.' Worse than the stress of the lawsuit, Ellison's homeowner's insurance rocketed to $1,000 per month from $1,200 per year. Not being able to afford the higher rate she is forced to go without coverage.","John Pyron, 84, of Fort Worth, Texas, accidentally set fire to Cecilla Ellison's house in August 2012 while cooking shrimp .

"For almost a century, thousands gathered under the roof of this Edwardian pool to celebrate the golden age of public swimming. Now plants, rust and decay adorn the walls of the Moseley Road Baths in Birmingham, which campaigners are fighting to save from destruction. These stunning images of the 1907 gala pool, which shut in 2003 amid spiralling repair bills, show the depth of heritage which could be lost from what is now one of Britain's oldest surviving facilities of its kind. Scroll down for video . Swimming in decay: The Moseley Road Baths in Birmingham, whose Grade II*-listed Edwardian pool has lain empty for more than a decade, have been captured in a new light by photographer Mike Jones, 27. He said: 'I wanted to get some images before it was too late' Magnificent: The pool opened in 1907 costing £33,000 and many of the original features remain, leading to safety fears as repair bills mount . Rust: One small pool remains open but councillors have warned they cannot afford the £24million to keep the building open - to the fury of campaigners. More than 100 gathered for an art project on the tiled floor last summer and another vowed to chain himself to the building . Photographer Mike Jones, 27, ventured past the 100ft Gothic renaissance terracotta and red brick frontage to capture the haunting decay of one of the city's most beloved buildings in a new light - using coloured torches to give it a haunting hue. The gala pool pictured closed in 2003 amid safety fears and was followed swiftly by Britain's only surviving set of pre-war private 'slipper baths' - 46 of them - which shut in 2004. Now the disused main pool cuts an eerie image. Metal poles line the pool walls once brimming with water and the blue-and-white tiled arches no longer echo with the sound of pattering bare feet. One small pool remains open to the public, but that, too, faces closure within the next few years. Opened on October 30, 1907, at a cost of £32,924, the baths are now the oldest of only three Grade II*-listed swimming pools still operating in Britain. The other two are at the privately-owned RAC Club in London and The National Sports Centre at Crystal Palace, also in London. Eerie: Photographer Mr Jones used coloured torches to produce an unusual effect, leaving silhouettes of ghostly figures under the arches . Disused: Metal poles line the pool walls once brimming with water and the blue-and-white tiled arches no longer echo with the sound of pattering bare feet. The other two Grade II*-listed baths to remain in any operation are both in London, at the RAC Club and Crystal Palace . Trick of the light: With the blue hue created by the photographer, the pool looks almost as though it could still be filled with water . Despite most of the building shutting more than a decade ago, its oak ticket office, spectator gallery, balconettes, steam-heated drying racks and 200,000-litre cast iron cold water storage tank remain much as they were at the turn of the last century. Now the ornate Edwardian building is at the centre of a fierce battle between history-lovers and Birmingham City Council, and has been listed as one of the Victorian Society's ten most endangered buildings in Britain. In 2013 the Labour administration said it could not afford repairs to the building - which would cost £24million just to get into basic working order - and it would be cheaper to build and maintain new leisure centres than keep the crumbling small pool open for the sake of history. One Liberal Democrat councillor, Martin Mullaney, was so angry at the threat to the beloved baths that he vowed to chain himself to the building in protest. Another protest last summer saw 110 swimmers pose as a living 'terracotta army' on the pool's tiled floor holding a banner which declared: 'We want to swim at Moseley Road Baths'. Features: Elsewhere in the pool building are a complete set of steam-heated drying racks, thought to be the best-preserved in Britain . Nook: Corners of the pool building, which has a 100ft red brick and terracotta frontage, remain hidden under the equipment propping it up . Beauty: The ornate building is at the centre of a fierce heritage campaign and was listed as one of the ten most endangered buildings in Britain . The photographer of seven years said: 'Although it's really only one big room, there are lots of interesting details to capture' History: Despite most of the building shutting more than a decade ago, its oak ticket office, spectator gallery and balconettes remain . But campaigners say they are realistic - and would accept an option which makes use of the building's beauty without actually re-filling it with water. Mr Jones, a professional photographer for seven years, said: 'I know that the remaining pool is due to close in the next few years so I wanted to get some images before it was too late. 'I wanted to get something different with my shots so I made a special point of going in the late afternoon when the light was a bit softer. 'As it is winter I knew within an hour or so of me getting there it would be dark enough to use torches to really make the photos look good.' He added: 'I've photographed quite a few abandoned and disused places over the past seven years, some buildings are really spectacular and this one is no exception. 'I was in there about three hours as getting around in the dark, as well as trying to get each picture perfect, was quite time consuming. 'Although it's really only one big room, there are lots of interesting details to capture and I think the pictures do the stunning architecture justice.' Modernity: There are a few reminders that the pool was open to the public until 2003 - such as this Speedo lap timer clock . Walkways: The grandoise paths to the spectator galleries have fallen silent, but in swimming's golden age would have teemed with people . Shared story: Dozens of pools have closed across Britain in the last few years since the decline of the age of baths and lidos . Uncertain: The future of the main room is yet to be mapped out, and its use could preserve the architecture without refilling the gala pool .","Campaigners fighting to save Birmingham's Grade II*-listed Moseley Road Baths after gala pool shut in 2003 .

Ms Pollard graduated from All Saints Anglican College in Merrimac, on the Gold Coast, in 2003. The past students' association celebrated her appearance on MKR in a Facebook post this week, a commenter writing: 'Good to see ash's drama/acting abilities haven't weakened!!!' After she left school, the MKR contestant moved to Sydney to acting school, where theatre documents said she was 'mentored by Hugh Jackman and Dean Carey along the way'. The contestant - now known for her acid tongue on the reality TV show - then moved to Los Angeles, California, where she worked in film and television. The biography was produced for a performance she of A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum at Williamstown Little Theatre in Victoria, where she was cast as a promiscuous nun. 'She has very much enjoyed playing a slutty nun,' the November 2013 document said. Ms Pollard had spent more than 15 years dancing as of 2013, and her performing credits include Shakespearean classics The Taming of the Shrew and The Merchant of Venice, as well as Measure for Measure, Blood Wedding, Chess the Musical and Arsenic and Old Lace. Her sister works in Queensland as a veterinarian technician and her father is the director of a tiling and stone-washing company, according to Facebook. On a social media profile, Ms Pollard is connected with what appears to be a profile of War Machine, the UFC martial artist who is facing life in a Californian prison if found guilty of charges of beating his girlfriend, porn star Christie Mack, however Ash says doesn't know the American man, with a Seven spokeswoman telling Daily Mail Australia: 'She doesn't know who he is.'

'Our social calender is absolutely brimming,' Ms Pollard said. 'One half of the year it's polo, the second half it's the races.' She described Melbourne as the 'Paris of the south' in publicity material. Ms Pollard defended herself from claims she was this season's 'villain' in interviews with Sunrise and KIIS FM this morning.

"A former Apple CEO who it is claimed fired Steve Jobs in the 1980s from the company he founded has admitted he made a mistake - and said he wished he had hired him back. John Sculley, who clashed with Jobs during his ten year tenure at the tech giant, said he thought that bringing back Jobs could have avoided the firm's disastrous performance in the 1990s. 'I wish in hindsight I had reached back to Steve and told him, 'I want to help you come back to Apple,'' Sculley told CNNMoney. Scroll down for video . Accusations: John Sculley, left, allegedly fired Apple founder Steve Jobs, right, from his own company - but now said he wished he had hired him back. 'I wish Apple had hired him back sooner rather than later.' Sculley's ten-year career at Apple saw some of its least successful products - including an iPad forerunner called Newton - and is viewed as a decline ahead of its resurgence in recent years. Sculley has previously spoken about his sometimes-fractious relationship with Jobs, which came to a head in a dispute over the pricing of the Apple Macintosh computer. Jobs wanted it to be cheap to drive sales and interest, while Sculley wanted to keep the price higher to protect its other products and defend the company's bottom line. Sculley, who also defended his tenure at the company, said in 2012: '[Apple] was the most profitable computer company in the world - not just personal computers - and Apple was the number one selling computer. 'So the myth that I fired Steve wasn't true and the myth that I destroyed Apple, that wasn't true either.' Sculley was finally forced out of Apple in 1993 over a dispute about licensing Macintosh's software to other PC makers. The board was in favour of letting other computer makers use Apple's software, but Sculley was opposed. Apple did end up licensing its software, which turned out to be a major mistake. By the time Apple hired Steve Jobs back in 1997, the company was posting giant losses. Had Sculley mended his differences with Jobs sooner and brought him back to Apple during his tenure, he says the company wouldn't have been in such dire straits in the late 1990's. 'When Steve came back, the first thing he did was to cancel the licensing,' Sculley said. 'At that point, only Steve Jobs could have revived the business. There's no way I could have ever done the things Steve Jobs did.' Sculley reserved his biggest compliments for current Apple CEO Tim Cook, who Sculley says is 'exactly the right guy' for the job. 'I say that without any reservation,' Sculley told CNN. 'Tim is doing a brilliant job.' Tenure: Sculley, pictured center above with Jobs (left) and co-founder Steve Wozniak (right) was Apple CEO for 10 years . Sculley was recently accused of hiding his fortune during a divorce battle . He allegedly signed over investments worth $25million to his brothers to avoid them being claimed by Carol 'Leezy' Sculley. Sculley, who spent ten years at the helm of the tech company, finalized his divorce in 2011, having claimed their combined worth was just $4.8million, Page Six reported. But his ex-wife claims that he had in fact been squirreling away assets more than a decade in advance, after starting an affair with a former Apple colleague in 2000. According to filings from 2013 seen by Page Six, Sculley asked his brothers Arthur and David to take on assets for him by starting a joint investment firm called Sculley Brothers - charges Sculley denies. The filing, made in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2013, accuses Sculley of lying to court. It then alleges he 'submitted a false financial affidavit . . . and failed to fully and honestly disclose his assets.' Those assets are later described as 'substantial private equity investments and investments in privately held companies and ventures around the globe'. Some estimates say that Sculley is worth as much as $200million in total. However, a representative for Sculley refuted the claims. He told DailyMail.com: 'The reality is that this case has been in the court of law for a number of years, and leaking false items to the media in a desire to pressure Mr. Sculley into settling this case is despicable. 'There is zero truth to these allegations. Mr. Sculley is confident this case will result in a full vindication for him.'","Sculley clashed with Jobs during his tenure at Apple - but denies sacking .

"BBC Newsnight host Evan Davis, 52, blames increased drug use among gay community on lack of children . BBC Newsnight host Evan Davis has revealed that gay people take more drugs because they don't have children, it has been reported. The gay broadcaster, who has always been candid about his own sexuality, said homosexuals were more prone to destructive behaviour as they were not bound by the same 'discipline.' He was said to have described drug taking as 'socially infectious' among the gay community and said it was not helped by their slightly greater disposable income. 'The gay community has less discipline because it doesn't have kids to go home to, and slightly more disposable income, and then add to that that when these things catch on they tend to have a momentum,' the 52-year-old broadcaster told Attitude magazine. 'Once gay people start taking drugs, they'll take more drugs because it's socially infectious and one person will take them, then another. I just think it's something gay people have to watch out for.' Davis comments come after the British Crime Survey found drug use among gay and bisexual men was three times higher than for straight men and was higher in the majority of individual drugs consumed including cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines and cannabis . The same report concluded illegal drug use by gay and bisexual women was four times higher at almost 23% than among heterosexual women. This is not the first time that Davis has discussed drugs. In 2010 he was accused of using a new purge of health and safety rules to promote the legalisation of cannabis. During an interview with, Lord Young, he seized on the Tory peer's remark that: ‘Frankly, if I want to do something stupid and break my leg or neck, that’s up to me.’ When Lord Young replied: ‘Haven’t you ever been skiing?’ the presenter retorted: ‘So if I want to smoke cannabis, that’s up to me as well, presumably? ‘What principle distinguishes between me doing something dangerous that can break my neck and having a spliff?’ The journalist, who presents the BBC Two current affairs programme, told Attitude magazine that he was 'tortured' during his teenage years due to his sexuality. Mr Davis,who was formerly an economist before joining the BBC, said he now hopes 16-year-old's in the same position think 'it's not a very big deal.' Davis, 52, who took over from Jeremy Paxman as Newsnight host, said that drug taking was socially infectious in the gay community . Mr Davis, who is also known for his role on Dragons’ Den and Radio 4 flagship breakfast news show Today, replaced Jeremy Paxman as the host of Newsnight last year. When his appointment was announced Tony Hall, BBC director general said: 'Evan is an outstanding journalist, an extraordinarily clever and intelligent interviewer. 'He has a wonderful presence on TV. I’ve got no doubt he will be a really great presence on Newsnight.'","Davis reportedly said gay people take more drugs as don't have children .

"A family-of-three on a fishing trip were fortunate to escape with their lives after their car broke through the frozen surface of a lake and sank in just five minutes. The father, mother and child were on an ice fishing trip on the lake in Qitamu township near Changchun, the capital of north-eastern China's Jilin province. They were not the only people who had driven onto the ice and in the background of the footage of the incident, other cars can be seen driving around on the frozen surface during an annual ice fishing festival. Scroll down for video . The car started sinking because its owners parked it near a hole they had carved out for ice fishing . A stunned crowd watched as the car sank deeper into the water after breaking through the ice . Left, the car's owners climb out of the vehicle as it begins sinking beneath the ice. Right, two bystanders wander past the stranded car . After a few minutes, nothing of the car was left on the ice. Authorities said the vehicle's engine heated the ice beneath it, causing cracks . Their problems began when they dug a hole in the ice and parked their Audi Q7 near it, extending a fishing rod into the lake while keeping warm in the car. Local police believe that the heat from the car's engine slowly melted the ice which, cracked as a result, creating a hole in which the vehicle began to sink. Witness Zhen Ku, 34, who filmed the incident, said: 'It was lucky the family managed to escape at the last moment before the car sank completely. No one was injured but it was still a sad sight to see.' Crowds attending the fishing festival gathered around to watch the vehicle quickly disappear below the ice, shedding the family's belongings into the water as the rear door sprung open just before it sank to the floor of the lake. As it disappears into the hole, fishing gear can still be seen poking out of the window, and other cars can be seen driving on the ice behind. According to police, no one was injured and the car was later recovered.","The family of three were visiting lake near Changchun, in north-east China .

"Dozens of children's bodies exhumed from old graves have begun yielding the shocking secrets of a shuttered Florida reform school, shedding light on decades of abuse, rape and deadly violence. There was the 6-year-old boy who ended up dead after being sent to work as a house boy. And another boy who escaped but was later found shot to death with a blanket pulled over his body and a shotgun across his legs. Then there was the 'rape dungeon' where students attending the Arthur G. Dozier School were taken and sexually abused. What the researchers have learned about the horrific acts carried out at the now closed Marianna institution is outlined in a report released by the University of South Florida as researchers continue grappling with the mystery of the graves and deaths there. Scroll down for video . Buried and forgotten: This December 20, 2013, file photo shows where researchers found some of the remains of 55 people in a graveyard at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida . Field of crosses: The 1,400-acre campus at the school became a series of graveyards, as officials buried scores of boys who had died while attending . Crime scene investigators: USF students assisted in the digs, which are intended to find human remains and investigate if possible the causes of death . USF anthropologist Erin Kimmerle has been leading a team of anthropologists in Marianna . University anthropologists have found the remains of 51 people buried at the school during a dig that also uncovered garbage, syringes, drug bottles and a dog encased in an old water cooler buried in the cemetery. They are not only trying to identify who was buried there, but the stories behind how they and others died at the school. Beyond studying remains, researchers are looking through the school and state records, newspaper archives and interviewing boys' families, former inmates and former school employees to provide a history of the dead. 'Maybe I've been doing this too long, but I'm not surprised at what horrible things people do to one another,' said USF anthropologist Erin Kimmerle, the team leader who has researched other mass graves. 'It's just really sad the way people treat one another, which may be in part what's captured the public's attention on this —  just the sense that it's not right.' The report, prepared for the Florida Cabinet, identifies two more people buried in graves, in addition to three who were identified previously. One was Bennett Evans, an employee who died in a 1914 dorm fire. While there wasn't a DNA match, remains found are consistent with his age and cause of death. Bring up the bodies: Researchers have found the remains of 51 people buried at the school during a dig that also uncovered garbage, syringes, drug bottles and a dog encased in an old water cooler . The other was Sam Morgan, who was brought to the school in 1915 at age 18 and later wound up dead in a case that still has unanswered questions. Morgan was identified through a DNA match with his relatives. To date, the remains of four people have been identified through DNA matches. It's not an easy project. The school underreported deaths; didn't provide death certificates, names or details in many cases, particularly involving black boys; and simply reported some boys who disappeared as no longer at the school. And many in the Panhandle community don't want to talk about the school's dark past. Several of the boys were killed after escape attempts, including Robert Hewitt, whose family lived a few miles from the school. He was hiding in his family's house and men from the school came looking for him several times after the 1960 escape, according to relatives. First victim: George Owen Smith (left) was the first victim positively identified from one of the unmarked graves. Pictured right is the hand of Ovell Krell, Smith's sister, gathering up an undated family photo of her brother . Update: University of South Florida researcher Dr. Erin Kimmerle, left, speaks to the media while sitting with Hillsborough County Sheriff's Detective Greg Thomas, right, on Thursday . The family came home one day to find his covered body lying in a bed. He had a shotgun wound and his father's shotgun was lying across his legs. There's also the story of 6-year-old George Grissam, who the school sent out to work as a house boy in 1918. He was delivered back to the school unconscious and later died. George's 8-year-old brother Ernest also disappeared from school records, which simply described him as 'not here.' Other boys died after severe beatings, being smashed in the head or other injuries. Former inmates and employees interviewed also told researchers about a 'rape dungeon' where boys, some younger than 12, were sexually assaulted. While many of the cases are nearly a century old, some of the dead have surviving brothers, sisters and other relatives still seeking answers. 'To some of this is history, but for many of the people who are involved it's actually their reality every day,' Kimmerle said. 'They're really committed and moved by this because it's their direct family.' The first of the bodies to be identified by researchers last summer was 14-year-old George Owen Smith, who was sent to the school after being caught in a stolen car. In December 1940, George's mother, Frances Smith, sent a letter to the school inquiring after her son's welfare. She received a reply from Superintendent Millard Davison saying that no one knew where the teenager was. Hell on earth: Former inmates and employees interviewed told researchers (pictured) about a 'rape dungeon' where boys, some younger than 12, were sexually assaulted . A month later, the family was summoned to Florida Panhandle school and led to an unmarked grave. Smith was in it, they were told - he had escaped and was found dead under a house. Frances Smith never accepted the story. When Smith's two-foot grave was opened last year, researchers found his body lying on its side without any clothes on with his hands over is head. The reform school for boys opened its doors in 1900 on 1,400 acres of land and closed down only in 2011 for budget reasons. Some former students from the 1950s and 1960s have for at least a decade accused employees and guards at the school of physical and sexual abuse, but the Florida Department of Law Enforcement concluded after an investigation that it couldn't substantiate or dispute the claims because too much time had passed. Many former Dozier inmates from that era call themselves 'The White House Boys' after the white building where they say the worst abuse took place. In 2008, the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice held a ceremony to officially 'seal' the building and recognize the boys who passed through it. Speaking out: US Sen. Bill Nelson, center, along with University of South Florida Associate Professor Erin Kimmerle, left, and Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee, right, speak to the media about the on-going research being done at the Arthur G. Dozier School . At its peak in the 1960s, 500 boys were housed at the Dozier school, most of them for minor offenses such as petty theft, truancy or running away from home. In 1968, when corporal punishment was outlawed at state-run institutions, then-Governor Claude Kirk visited and found the institution in disrepair with leaky ceilings, holes in walls, cramped sleeping quarters, no heating for the winters and buckets used as toilets. 'If one of your kids were kept in such circumstances,' he said then, 'you'd be up there with rifles.' In September 2014, the USF team identified two more sets of remains belonging to 13-year-old Thomas Varnadoe and 12-year-old Earl Wilson. Varnadoe died in 1934, reportedly of pneumonia. Wilson was beaten to death in 1944, reportedly by four other boys while in a small confinement cottage on the property, known as the 'sweat box.' The other boys were convicted in his death.","University of South Florida researchers have found the remains of 51 people buried at Arthur G. Dozier School in Marianna, Florida .

'I'm a real conservationist and I've spent most of my years rescuing wildlife and saving injured or orphaned animals - you name it. ‘I’ve been making crocodile-skin products for the past eight years but recently, I started to get sick of making the same stuff over and over.' The idea came to light when a customer approached the 43-year-old and requested a ‘bondage whip’ to be made from the reptile's skin. ‘Someone asked me about making bondage products so I started designing and it pretty much took off from there,’ West said. ‘I started mucking around and showed people some of my creations that I was making and the word of mouth kicked off through friends and it just went crazy. 'It's surprising because I'm getting corporate people and people making the big decisions in life who are buying my stuff but it's all a bit of fun.'

'It's the first in the world and its' unique range has hit the big markets all around the world – I’m getting exclusive distribution as far as Europe. ‘It’s definitely opened up to a lot of people’s eyes and I'm going to try and keep the creativity going.'

"A normal teenager turned convicted felon who impersonated a physician’s assistant at a Florida Hospital and who pretended to be a Miami cop while on bail says his lying began at an early age. Matthew Scheidt of Central Florida told ABC that he began inventing stories after his mother was arrested in 2002 for possession of crystal meth. Ashamed of his impoverished lifestyle and of his mother's addiction he says he told his classmates lies about the type of lifestyle he lived. Scroll down for video . To air tonight: Matthew Scheidt, a teenager who impersonated a physician’s assistant at a Florida Hospital and who pretended to be a Miami cop tells 20/20 that the lying began early . Catch me If You Can: The case has been compared to the Leonardo DiCaprio film Catch Me If You Can, were a conman evaded justice by posing under a number of aliases including a doctor and pilot . 'Every time I would walk to the bus, you know, I would make up these little fibs to kids that I was in school with that, ""oh no, I don't live there. I live in a nice house across the street,''' Scheidt, now 21, told ABC News' ""20/20"" in an episode that will air tonight at 10 p.m. Scheidt said that he always had a love of medicine and that he would read about health and watch doctor television shows such as Grey's Anatomy and E.R. He also had an app on his phone that would teach him about the human anatomy. The case has been compared to the Leonardo DiCaprio film Catch Me If You Can, were a conman evaded justice by posing under a number of aliases. These included a doctor and a pilot . Scheidt's premature involvement in medicine began when he wasn't yet a teenager. When Schiedt was just 11-years-old he volunteered at a Florida hospital and lied about his age because the minimum age for volunteers was 14-years-old. When Scheidt was only 13-years-old he was caught pretending to be a nurse at a Florida hospital but no charges were made against him. Fake ID: Matthew Scheidt was found guilty at 18 of working in the Osceola Regional Medical Center emergency room, in Florida, for weeks, changing bandages, handling intravenous drips and helping to conduct physicals . 'If we were talking about something in the medical field, I would probably put out a word or two to make it sound like I knew what I was talking about, even though I had no idea,' said Scheidt. Matthew Scheidt was found guilty at 18 of working in the Osceola Regional Medical Center emergency room, in Florida, for weeks, changing bandages, handling intravenous drips and helping to conduct physical examinations and was jailed for a year. At one point he even performed CPR on a patient who suffered a drug overdose. There is no way to prove if it was Scheidt's fault but the patient sadly died the next day. Matthew Scheidt, pictured in 2012, is pleased following his sentencing where he was convicted of impersonating a physician's assistant and practicing medicine and not granted any prison time..at least yet . Full gear: In January of 2012, he was back in police custody, this time for impersonating a police officer and carrying actual police weapons . He told investigators that he had performed CPR on a patient who had overdosed: 'I felt so uncomfortable even doing that.' 'And, you know, the only reason why I did do it was because there was nobody else in there. And I'm not going to let her die.' Scheidt said he had 'messed up' but that he had just wanted to learn as much as possible. He admitted he 'should have addressed the issue' earlier. 'I just didn't want any questions asked, like I just wanted to learn as much as I possibly could,' he added. He was sentenced  to a year in jail.then told to spend a year under house arrest, followed by eight years' probation. The teenager had previously been told he could expect up to 25 years in jail. Dr or imposter?: Scheidt was convicted in August 2012 of two counts of practicing medicine without a license and two counts of impersonating a physician's assistant in August 2011, when he was 17 . The Osceola County Courthouse heard the teenager had also had access to confidential medical records, and had worn scrubs and a stethoscope, used a pager and bought a lab coat. When his case went to trial Scheidt was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the film Catch Me If You Can, an imposter who lies his way through the medical profession among other fields. Scheidt was convicted in August 2012 of two counts of practicing medicine without a license and two counts of impersonating a physician's assistant in August 2011, when he was 17. He was arrested in September 2011 and released on bail. But in January of 2012, he was back in police custody, this time for impersonating a police officer. Scheidt told investigating police he had originally gone to the hospital to get a badge for his job as a clerk at a doctor's office, which was just across the road. But the teenager was entered as a physician assistant into the computer in error, CNN reports. A physician assistant helps a doctor treat and administer medication to a patient, and will normally undergo a minimum of two years medical training. Scheidt didn't have much education of any kind and just had a high school diploma he earned online. By 16-years-old he lived on his own and took high school courses online. His only type of medical training was the kind he got while working as a medical file clerk in a local doctor's office. He would run errands at to Osceola Regional Medical Center and one day lied about being a physician assistant in order to get an id badge giving him access to emergency rooms. He loved the environment but says he didn’t know what he was doing and therefore he put people’s lives at risk.

"The team behind Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything have revealed their next project is a Second World War drama about Winston Churchill. Set to start filming next year, Darkest Hour focuses on the wartime Prime Minister's make-or-break decision to fight the Nazis alone. In 1940, Germany had successfully invaded France while British forces were stranded at Dunkirk. Newly appointed Prime Minister, Churchill was facing mounting pressure to make a deal with Hitler as people began to lose faith the war could be won. The team behind the Stephen Hawking biopic have announced they are working on a new film about Winston Churchill (pictured) But Churchill  refused to give up and was able to persuade his government that Britain had to fight, whatever the cost. The film follows his decisions and immortal speeches which went onto define history. Writer and producer of   Theory of Everything, Anthony McCarten, is the man behind the script for the Churchill biopic which he promised would reveal a side of the famous politician which had never been shown before. McCarten joins fellow producer of the Academy Award nominated biopic Lisa Bruce and Working Title partners Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan for the epic war drama. McCarten joins fellow producer of the Academy Award nominated biopic Lisa Bruce and Working Title partners Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan for the epic war drama. The Theory Of Everything starred Eddie Redmayne (right, in the film) as theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and his fist wife, played by Felicity Jones (left) 'We aim to present a Churchill you haven't seen before, a new portrait that shows all his famous strengths but also adds new dimensions, such as the grave doubts he privately harbored, the dark moods that would seize him unexpectedly and his fear of failure, a driving force that is often is left out of any discussion of the man,' McCarten told Yahoo. 'It is enormously exciting to be embarking on another project with Lisa Bruce and the Working Title team.' Bruce added: 'This big screen portrait of a monumental figure navigating a treacherous moment in time brings forth a story that is stunningly relevant today.' The film comes after the 50th anniversary of the passing of Churchill. The Theory Of Everything starred Eddie Redmayne who plays theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking as he falls in love with his fist wife, played by Felicity Jones, and copes with his worsening motor neurone disease. Set to start filming next year, Darkest Hour focuses on British Prime Minister (pictured in 1945) make-or-break decision to fight the Nazis alone . It garnered five Academy Award nomination including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar as well. Director James Marsh and the film's stars are also nominated. This pivotal moment in the Second World War has been a long fascination for McCarten, who turns to this passion project after spending a decade getting Jane and Stephen Hawking to allow him to turn their complicated marriage into a film which grossed $82 million (£53.5 million) worldwide, won two Golden Globes and received ten BAFTA nominations to go along with its five Oscar nominations. At the beginning of the Second World War, the newly appointed Prime Minister Winston Churchill clashed with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax over whether Britain should continue fighting Nazi Germany. After the successful invasion of France, and with British forces cut off at Dunkirk, Viscount Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, believed the war was not winnable and recommended Britain negotiate a peace settlement with Adolf Hitler. He had warned that the war was no longer a question of defeating Germany but 'of safeguarding the independence of our own Empire' and warned that Britain should be ready to consider any proposals which might lead to that. Churchill disagreed and said he could never accept  peace at the price of German domination over Europe and the UK. Winston Churchill at his seat in the Cabinet Room at No 10 Downing Street, London, in 1940 . He said: 'that nations which went down fighting rose again, but those which surrendered tamely were finished.' Between 25 and 28 May Churchill and Halifax fought to bring the British War Cabinet round to their view. At one point, Halifax seemed to be gaining the upper hand, with Churchill facing the possibility of being forced from office. But the Prime Minister was able to sway the government that the country had to fight, whatever the cost, with the now famous, impassioned speech to his Outer Cabinet in which he said: 'If this long island story of ours is to end at last, let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground.'","Writer of Theory of Everything has a new script about Winston Churchill .

"De'Miyia Walker, four, was tragically killed while asleep in her room after a space heater caught on fire in her family's home in Alabama . A four-year-old girl was tragically killed in a house fire caused by a space heater. De'Miyia Walker was asleep in her bedroom at the family's mobile home in Duncanville, Alabama when the heater in her room caught on fire last Saturday around 4am. Her father, Demonia Clay, was unable to rescue her due to the thick smoke. State Fire Marshal Ed Paulk said the fire was caused by an electrical problem with the space heater, which led to the girl's death, according to WBRC. Her mother had purchased it the day before - and in the early hours of January 31, it caught on fire while the family was inside the home. The girl's sister and parents managed to escape. Jacob Henderson, De'Miyia's great uncle, said the family was awakened by the oldest daughter, and their nephew tried to rescue the girl but the black smoke made it too difficult, according to ABC3340. The child's great aunt, Juanita Tucker, said the family is hurting as they mourn De'Miyia's loss. She said the young girl was everybody's joy and that she had just spoken to her on the phone the day before as she was leaving for work, according to Alabamas13. She was asleep at the family's mobile home (remains after the fire above) in Duncanville, Alabama when the heater in her room caught on fire last Saturday around 4am . Relatives were unable to find her due to smoke from the fire, and when firefighters arrived at the scene, they eventually found her body . The girl's family is mourning her loss after the horrific fire, said her great aunt Juanita Tucker (left). They are hoping others will be cautious when choosing methods to keep warm. Di'Miyia's great uncle Jacob Henderson (right) said everyone should take care how they heat their homes each year . Ms Tucker said: 'I told her I love her. She said ""I love you too.''' The family hopes the incident will be a warning to others when it comes to how they choose to warm their homes during the colder seasons. Mr Henderson said: 'May everyone just be aware of what they're doing to heat their home each and every year.' Marshal Paulk also said that there are safer options to staying warm at night which include wrapping up in quilts and covers, and not leaving space heaters running all night. Funeral arrangements for Di'Miyia have been scheduled for Saturday. Services are at 1pm at Friendship Baptist Church in Duncanville. The child's mother had purchased the space heater the day before - and in the early hours on January 31, it caught on fire while the family was inside.  Her sister and parents managed to escape . State Fire Marshal Ed Paulk said that there are safer options to staying warm at night which include wrapping up in quilts and covers, and not leaving space heaters running all night . More than 25,000 residential fires and more than 300 deaths are caused each year by space heaters, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. There are also more than 6,000 Americans who receive hospital emergency room care annually for burn injuries associated with room heaters. The Burn Center at Loyola University Medical Center said around 40 per cent of their burn cases are children with the majority being aged two and younger. The center has offered tips for those who use space heaters: . Source: Loyola Medicine .","De'Miyia Walker died in family home in Duncanville, Alabama .

"They are just tiny specks in a vast landscape of deep ridges which ripple  spectacularly, making North America's lowest, driest, and hottest place look like the surface of the moon or an alien planet. The handful of intrepid walkers are the only signs of life in the baron desert and give a breathtaking sense of scale to Death Valley in these pictures from British travel photographer Chris Upton. Mr Upton was on a driving holiday through Death Valley, in Eastern California's Mojave Desert, when he spotted the walkers on one of the ridges. The 57-year-old from Nottinghamshire was there to photograph the sunrise but could not resist taking the set of snaps at Zabriskie Point in Badwater Basin. British travel photographer Chris Upton caught an incredible sense of scale with these pictures taken while on a driving holiday through Death Valley, in Eastern California's Mojave Desert . Visiting the Zabriskie Point at sunrise, Mr Upton caught spectacular images of walkers set against giant ridges rippling through the valley . Death Valley stretches across about 3,000 square miles and its highest point is Telescope Peak in the Panamint Range which is  11,043 ft (3,366 metres) tall. The average annual rainfall in the vast and baron Death Valley desert is just 60mm . Zabriskie Point is made up of sediments from Furnace Creek Lake which dried up five million years ago - way before Death Valley was formed . Zabriskie Point is in the Badwater Basin - the lowest  lowest point in North America, at 282ft (86 metres) below sea level . Zabriskie Point sits on the edge of Death Valley's Furnace Creek, which holds the air temperature record at 56.7, recorded in July 10, 1913. But temperatures can drop below freezing at night during the winter . Death Valley got its name during the gold rush  from prospectors  who sought to cross the valley. Although, the name may be misleading, with only one death recorded during the period. The oldest rocks in Death Valley National Park in California are thought to be at least 1,700 million years old . When Mr Upton came across the walkers they were too bunched up. But he said: 'Fortunately three disappeared over the ridge leaving the two walkers perfectly positioned to give some scale and context to the image...I had my shot' Glacial lakes once filled Death Valley but about 10,500 years ago these lakes began to dry up, producing the desert environment seen today .","British photographer snaps breathtaking pictures of walkers in Death Valley, California .

"Hilary Mantel has laughed off comparisons between her novel Wolf Hall and Prince Charles' household as being an 'exaggeration'. The author made the comments following an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace this morning, during which she had a damehood conferred on her by Prince Charles. Charles has endured a torrid week, thanks to the publication of a new biography, which along with comparing his household to the 'treacherous' Tudor Court, claimed he would be 'a meddling monarch'. Scroll down for video . Exaggeration: Mantel laughed off comparisons between Wolf Hall and Clarence House this morning . The book, Charles: Heart of a King, also alleged that he attempted to back out of his 1981 wedding to Lady Diana Spencer and revealed that he compares himself to Blackadder buffoon, Baldrick. So stung was Charles by author Catherine Meyer's less-than-flattering portrayal, he yesterday took the rare step of authorising a letter to the Times newspaper that hit back at the 'speculation' and denied that Meyer had had any sort of privileged access. In it, his private secretary William Nye described the contents of the book as 'ill-informed speculation' and said Charles will run a monarchy 'inspired' by that of his mother and grandfather when he takes the throne. But it was Meyer's comparison of Clarence House to the court depicted in Wolf Hall that proved most eye-catching, with the author describing it as 'treacherous and opportunistic'. 'One former householder refers to Clarence House as Wolf Hall,' writes Meyer, 'in reference to the treacherous and opportunistic world depicted by Hilary Mantel in her fictionalised account of the rise of Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII.' Proud: Mantel, seen here with her damehood, also revealed that Charles is a fan of the BBC2 adaptation . Treacherous: The royal household was compared to Wolf Hall's Tudor court by author Catherine Meyer . Torrid: Charles, who spent the morning conferring investitures, has endured a difficult week . Mantel, however, would not be drawn into the controversy and laughed when asked about similarities between Clarence House and her novel. 'I couldn’t possibly comment on that,' she said. 'I think there may be an element of exaggeration there.' Nevertheless, Mantel is no stranger to a royal controversy, having once ignited one herself courtesy of a speech in 2013 in which she described the Duchess of Cambridge as 'bland'. She also likened the Duchess to a 'machine-made' doll and called her 'painfully thin', adding: '[She is] without quirks, without oddities, without the risk of the emergence of character. 'She appears precision-made, machine-made, so different from Diana whose human awkwardness and emotional incontinence showed in her every gesture.' Claims: Charles, seen here with the Duchess of Cornwall, has hit back at 'ill-informed speculation' Not amused: The claims were made in a new book entitled: Charles: Heart of a King . Buffoon: Among the claims was the revelation that Charles compares himself to Blackadder's Baldrick . Despite Mantel's comments, she was given a warm welcome by Prince Charles, who even told the author that he is a fan of her work - despite Meyer's comparisons. The 66-year-old royal also admitted to being a fan of the current BBC2 adaptation, which stars Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Damien Lewis as Henry VIII. 'We talked about the television series of Wolf Hall,' said Mantel, following the investiture. 'He is enjoying [it] very much.' Mantel, whose books about the life of Henry VIII’s adviser Thomas Cromwell have been critical and commercial hits, was made a dame by Charles for her services to literature. Success has come late to the 62-year-old, but she has more than made up for it by collecting a haul of literary honours, including twice winning the Man Booker Prize.","Hilary Mantel was presented with a damehood at Buckingham Palace .

"A fifth expectant mother has died giving birth at a hospital already under investigation after four other women died in similar circumstances. A new probe is today under way at Homerton Hospital in Hackney, east London, instigated following the latest death last month. NHS England was called in last summer to assist an internal review into how the first four mothers died within a space of eight months. Such deaths are extremely rare - therefore it is unusual for a single hospital to have so many deaths in a short period. In the whole of England and Wales in 2013 there were just 47 maternal deaths during pregnancy, childbirth and the six-week period following birth - out of almost 700,000 deliveries. A fifth expectant mother has died at Homerton University Hospital, it has emerged. A new investigation is now under way at the east London trust. It comes after a series of probes following the deaths of four other women in similar circumstances over eight months from July 2013 to April last year . Homerton Hospital has already been the subject of one internal review, another by the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission and a further by the City and Hackney Commissioning Care Group. The investigations came following persistent allegations from an anonymous group of whistleblowing midwives raising concerns over 'avoidable' deaths of mothers and babies at the maternity department. The first four deaths occurred in July and October 2013, and January and April 2014. The latest death, the fifth, is believed to have followed an elective Caesarean section. The mother died on January 17, and a spokesman for Homerton University Hospital said the matter 'is in the hands of the coroner'. The hospital added  the case would not be included in its internal review into the other four deaths, which is not yet complete. It has also not revealed details of any of the cases, citing confidentiality and 'potentially identifiable patient information'. A group who dub themselves the 'unhappy midwives' flagged up concerns two years ago. They referenced several unspecified serious incidents at the hospital, claiming women and babies were being exposed to poor standards of care and a culture of racial discrimination. Results of an independent investigation by the City and Hackney Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) published in September concluded none of the allegations could be substantiated and did not identify any failings in the standard of care. But an unabridged copy of the report leaked to the Hackney Gazette made urgent recommendations. It refers to an under-staffing of consultants and supervisor midwives, and the extraordinary fact no obstetricians were available to undertake an analysis following any major incident. The report states that serious events were not referred for further scrutiny 'that may have enabled the service to detect themes with incidents or individuals involved'. Maternal deaths in childbirth are very rare. In England and Wales in 2013 there were 47 such deaths in total . It adds: 'In at least three cases that were reviewed the statements described missing equipment or inadequate rooms that could have an impact on the care provided.' At the beginning of an investigation in October 2013, the trust was advised to consider informing the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) of serious incidents. However the report points out that in early January 2014 - by which time three maternal deaths had occurred - it had not informed the NMC. A spokesman for the trust said it was investigating the latest death which had been reported to the 'appropriate authorities'. A spokesman for City and Hackney CCG said: 'As commissioner for maternity services, City and Hackney CCG takes its role and responsibilities extremely seriously, which is why it requested a full and independent review of the allegations made by the Unhappy Midwives. 'The investigation found no failings in the standard of maternity care at Homerton Hospital although there were some recommendations for improvement. 'These are being closely monitored by the CCG's Maternity Services Board. 'Any maternal death is extremely saddening and the CCG will work closely with the Trust to implement any recommendations of the recent review that was carried out by NHS England at the request of Homerton Hospital. 'Our overriding concern is, and always will be, to ensure that women receive the best care possible.'","New probe under way at Homerton University Hospital in east London .

"The White House, along with every other cog in the U.S. intelligence machinery, snapped to attention on Friday when the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) announced that a Jordanian airstrike had killed a female American hostage. 'We're obviously deeply concerned by those reports,' White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, en route to a presidential speech in Indianapolis, Indiana. 'We have not at this time seen any indication to corroborate those claims, but that's all we have right now.' Tragic: Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the IIS terror army, which had been demanding $6.6 million for her release . Rubble: ISIS claims Mueller was inside this building and was killed by a Jordanian airstrike; the group added that none of its militants had been injured during the raid . Schultz noted at the time that ISIS's claim was 'a few old,' adding that 'our intelligence community is looking into them.' He acknowledged that the U.S. was working with Jordan's king to hammer ISIS positions, partially in retaliation for the grisly burning death of a Jordanian Air Force pilot this week. The hostage, 26-year-old Kayla Jean Mueller, is a Prescott, Arizona native who devoted her young adulthood to charity work in Syria. White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz had few facts to share on Friday about Kayla Jean Mueller's fate, but said the Obama administration is 'deeply concerned' about reports that she had been killed . She volunteered for three years with the Save Darfur Coalition, battling genocide in the war-torn African region. While the White House scrambles to determine if Mueller is still alive, Jordanian Interior Minister Hussein Majali seems certain that ISIS is hoaxing the world. 'They tried to cause problems internally in Jordan and haven't succeeded,' Majali told CNN on Friday. 'They are now trying to drive a wedge between the coalition with this latest low PR stunt.' Schultz told reporters that 'the United States of America spares no effort to secure the safe release of any American held overseas.' 'That includes exhausting military options, intelligence resources, diplomatic channels, obviously the financial stranglehold we put on ISIL. 'ISIL' is the White House's preferred alternative acronym for ISIS. U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said Friday that the White House has 'not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates' ISIS's version of events. 'We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,' she said.","Jordan's interior minister now says claims from ISIS are a 'PR stunt'

"Katy Perry's attorneys have taken a bite out of an artist's bid to sell small figurines of the dancing sharks that stole the spotlight during the pop star's Super Bowl performance. After the stumbling and uncoordinated sharks became an overnight internet sensation, Fernando Sosa, 31, joined in on the web frenzy and worked up a design of a three-inch 'Left Shark' made with a 3D printer. His handiwork hit the Shapeways.com marketplace on Tuesday - and by Wednesday afternoon, the Orlando-based artist had sold ten to 15 sharks at $24.99 each. After Katy Perry's back-up dancing, stumbling and uncoordinated sharks became an overnight internet sensation, Fernando Sosa, 31, worked up a design of a three-inch 'Left Shark' made with a 3D printer . Sosa's handiwork (above) hit the Shapeways.com marketplace on Tuesday and by Wednesday afternoon, the Orlando-based artist had sold ten to 15 sharks at $24.99 each . Shapeways officials notified Sosa later on Wednesday of a cease-and-desist letter from Perry's Los Angeles-based attorneys who demanded the shark's removal from the site. 'They said they were pulling the design because they didn't want to deal with lawyers,' Sosa said. He said the company cancelled the orders and refunded customers. The letter from attorney Steve Plinio said Katy Perry is the 'owner of the intellectual property depicted or embodied in connection with the shark images and costumes' portrayed during the halftime show.

The letter from attorney Steve Plinio said Katy Perry is the 'owner of the intellectual property depicted or embodied in connection with the shark images and costumes' portrayed during the halftime show . The letter said the failure to comply with the demands outlined 'will be viewed by the courts as willful infringement'. Sosa said he didn't think a halftime show prop would be copyrighted. He added that his product didn't mention Katy Perry or claim that it was associated with her. He typically does politically-oriented pieces, including a design depicting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie holding a stop sign and wearing construction gear during the investigation into traffic jams caused by the closure of lanes of the George Washington Bridge in 2013. He has  done 3D figurines of world leaders, including former President George W. Bush, and TV characters, including Walter White from Breaking Bad. The artist said he has never heard from lawyers. 'It's one of the more mainstream designs I've done and it came down in about 24 hours,' he said. Sosa said he plans to talk to a lawyers on Friday and hopes he can begin selling the figurines again.

"Controversial MP George Galloway was heckled on Question Time last night after the 'provocative' decision by the BBC to invite him on the show in a Jewish area. During the the hostile hour-long political debate the crowd shouted 'you are not welcome in London' and accused him of fuelling anti-Semitism in Britain. After the recording pro-Israel supporters waving flags and chanting attacked his car as he left the venue in Finchley, north London. The Respect MP for Bradford West claimed afterwards presenter David Dimbleby mishandled the debate, a question was changed at the last minute and said 'it wasn't an audience it was a hit squad'. Mr Galloway has hit out at the BBC following his appearance on the show, saying he was set up and that David Dimbleby privately apologised to him afterwards. Scroll down for video . Hostile: Controversial MP George Galloway was heckled by audience members after a 'provocative' decision by the BBC to invite him to be a guest on Question Time last night . Fury: During the the hostile hour-long debate the crowd shouted 'you are not welcome in London' and accused him of fuelling anti-Semitism in Britain . Reaction: After the recording pro-Israel supporters waving flags and chanting attacked his car as he left the venue in Finchley. The MP is circled on the left . BBC bosses caused consternation after they invited Mr Galloway onto the panel in Finchley, which has the largest Jewish community of any parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom. Last year MP Mr Galloway was interviewed by police on suspicion of inciting religious hatred after he declared his Bradford constituency was an 'Israel-free' zone. He previously refused to debate with a student at Oxford University because he was Israeli. Tensions boiled over when Question Time audience member Gabriel Rosen asked him: 'Why is anti-Semitism rising in the UK and does a certain member of the panel bear some responsibility?' As Mr Galloway was about to answer others then shouted: 'You're not welcome here' and called him 'scum'. Mr Galloway said: 'Am I on trial here? Zionism and Israel are different things from Judaism and Jewishness. 'Anti-Semitism is a foul form of racism that in the 1930s led to the Holocaust. If I had been born then I would have been the first in the line in the recruitment office to fight fascism'. Another audience member yelled: 'You support Hezbollah' and Mr Galloway was accused of supporting violence against Jews. He told the crowd: 'You are in favour of some political violence but against other political violence. You're in favour of freedom of speech for some people, but not for others'. He added: 'You will not stop me speaking however much you shout' and told them: 'You be the lions, I'll be Daniel'. Other guests on the programme included Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, her shadow counterpart Tristram Hunt and Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland, . Britain's Jewish community had reacted with fury to the decision to have him on the show. Mike Freer, the Conservative MP for Finchley and Golders Green, said the invitation was 'deliberately provocative'. He added: 'The BBC can't have done it by accident. 'Given what's going on in the world it is a slap in the face for the local community. It lacks sensitivity.' Mr Freer and the Jewish Leadership Council, which brings together major Jewish organisations, wrote to the BBC challenging the decision, and asked whether it is a 'responsible move'. The Community Security Trust, a charity which monitors anti-Semitism and organises security for schools and synagogues said: 'If the BBC didn't understand the strength of feeling in the community about George Galloway, I think they understand it now.' Upset: The Respect MP for Bradford West, second left, claimed afterwards presenter David Dimbleby, centre, mishandled the debate . Mr Galloway was thrown out of the Labour party in 2003 but made a comeback with the Respect party in 2005 in East London. He returned to Westminster in March 2012 after winning the seat of Bradford East in a by-election. He was interviewed by West Yorkshire Police last August after saying at an event, which was filmed: 'We have declared Bradford an Israel-free zone. We don't want any Israeli goods; we don't want any Israeli services; we don't want any Israeli academics coming to the university or the college. 'We don't even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford even if any of them had thought of doing so. We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel - and you have to do the same.' In November 2012, during an anti-Israeli demonstration in his Bradford constituency, he told those present: 'We do not hate Jews. We hate Zionism, we hate Israel, we hate murder and injustice.' The Question Time controversy centred around a question that one audience member asked about a rise in anti-Semitism in the UK. But the question also included a reference to the MP for Bradford West bearing some responsibility for this rise, an inclusion he said that had not been agreed beforehand. Crowds: Britain's Jewish community had reacted with fury to the decision to have him on the show and protested in numbers with Israel flags . The anti-war politician said the host David Dimbleby later apologised to him for this, but it represented what he said was a set-up within the BBC. 'A lot of people are very unhappy about it as it was a set-up,' he said. 'It was very poorly chaired by a man I admire but who let himself down immensely. It showed the opposition in a very bad light and I don't know who was advising them. 'It is defamatory and worse and it was not the question that was asked. The question that was tabled and agreed was not the question that was asked. 'He added his own words and David Dimbleby should have stopped and re-shot that question, as it's not a live show. 'David Dimbleby apologised to me afterwards for the man adding on that bit, but he should have made it clear to the audience that this trick had been played and not just apologise afterwards. 'To accuse a parliamentarian of 27 years of being responsible for a spike in anti-Semitism is totally ludicrous.' Security: Police outside the Arts Depot in Finchley, but Mr Galloway said there was not enough security . Mr Galloway also took issue with the make-up of the audience, saying there was not a single Muslim among them, despite there being many in the borough where it was filmed. Fellow panel member Jonathan Freedland also did not escape his ire, as he said he had stoked the fires and for that he would never forgive him. 'There was not a single Muslim person in the audience even though there are 50,000 Muslims in the borough,' he said. 'Jonathan Freedland was the prosecutor in chief, he lit the touch paper and then smugly retired and for that I will never forgive him. 'Any anti-Semitic attack of any kind is utterly despicable but there are at least ten times the number of attacks on mosques. 'Mr Freedland claimed there had been 1,000 attacks on Jews but there have actually been 84.

The BBC later said in a statement: 'We are satisfied the programme was conducted appropriately and fairly. 'Each week Question Time aims to have an audience that reflects the ethnic make-up of the area where we are filming, as well as being politically balanced.

"Jordan McDonald, 23, has been jailed for eight years for stealing £23,000 from a 26-year-old . A thug who robbed a businessman was caught after leaving his bus pass in the abandoned getaway car and storing pictures of £5,000 in stolen cash on his phone. Jordan McDonald, 23, has been jailed for eight years for stealing £23,000 from a 26-year-old after spotting him withdrawing staff wages from a Birmingham bank in July 2013. He was part of a four-strong gang that pulled up alongside the businessman in a stolen Toyota Corolla in Handsworth Wood before taking out a metal bar  and demanding the cash. The gang abandoned the getaway vehicle in nearby Winson Green, but McDonald was easily traced by police after he left a travel pass and a shopping voucher in the back seat- which both had his name on. When officers searched his home they seized his phone and found images showing bundles of £50 notes neatly laid on a stairway at his girlfriend's house. McDonald, from Aston, Birmingham was arrested after a search of his partner's property uncovered £5,800 of the stolen money. He even tried to pass of the cash - which equated to about a quarter of the spoils shared between the offenders - as money received from the sale of a car. The 23-year-old denied the offence and stood trial last month at Birmingham Crown Court where he was sentenced to eight years in jail earlier this week. Detective Constable Michelle Hunt, from West Midlands Police, said: 'McDonald was foolish to think that the jury would believe his web of lies with the amount of evidence against him. 'He will now have several years behind bars to contemplate the error of his ways.' McDonald's accomplices have not been traced and police are still appealing for any information that might assist in their arrest.

"His character has a tendency to bite but it will be the fans who will be getting their teeth into this version of 50 Shades of Grey actor Jamie Dornan. The life-sized replica, which is entirely made from cake, takes centre stage in the 50 Shades of Cake display at Cake International's Sugarcraft Cake Decorating Show in Manchester. Created by baker Rosie Cake-Diva, the cake depicts a topless version, complete with a rippling six-pack, of the 50 Shades of Grey protagonist  with his belt undone and jeans unzipped. Tasty: The life-size version of Christian Grey was created for the 50 Shades of Cake feature at a food show . Not so similar: Unfortunately, the cake bears little resemblance to the real Mr Grey, actor Jamie Dornan . The display also features peep holes into exotic edible designs, many of them X-rated, and whips made from liquorice. But it is Mr Grey who is the star of the show, with not one but two cake versions of the character taking pride of place. 'One is at the entrance and one is revealed inside partially dressed,' said Ms Cake-Diva, who also revealed that both are 6ft tall and made of Genoese sponge. 'They were constructed from 10 rectangles of 17' x 28' cakes, made using 25kg of flour and 340 eggs,' she continued. The baker and her team of six took two and the half months to construct the edible Mr Grey and used 200kg of sugar paste to craft his exterior. In his hands: A peephole focusing on Christian Grey's fingers on the body of a nearly-naked female . Risque: This could possibly the lacy bra of female character Anastasia  Steele, played by Dakota Johnston . The Christian Grey cake is set in a 50 Shades inspired room decorated with  scenes from the forthcoming film. Along with the cake centrepiece, the display features edible props such as lacy underwear made from liquorice, a cover of the 50 Shades book and exquisitely decorated masks. 'The accessories are made from sugar paste and liquorice,' Ms Cake-Diva continued. 'The bed [is] for posing for photos with Christian Grey. 'The top of the chest of drawers is made from cake, and the elements of the two scenes set beyond peep holes contain cheeky edible elements.' Visitors will get glimpses of the props through peepholes. One shows the top half of a woman's body covered with a lacy bra, while another offers an X-rated glimpse of another part of the anatomy. Less jaw-dropping is the peephole showing a beautiful black mask, complete with intricate white sugar work swirls. Baker: Rosie-Cake Diva, with her creation. She also designed the whips made from liquorice (pictured) Intricate work: The black mask is made from fondant and is iced with white icing . Tidying up: Ms Cake-Diva adds the final touches to the cake version of a topless Christian Grey . The exhibition also features a fully dressed Grey - also made of cake -  clad in a grey business suit, his hands tightly gripping a tie. Hitting cinemas on February 13, the 50 Shades of Grey film, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, is based on the very popular erotic novel of the same name written by E.L James. Famous for explicit scenes involving bondage, dominance and BDSM, the book, which was released in 2011, was a hit and was followed by two more instalments - 50 Shades Darker and 50 Shades Freed. It was recently revealed that 50 Shades is set to be the raunchiest blockbuster film in over a decade, with 20 minutes of sex in its 100-minute running time. The motion picture adaptation also stars Rita Ora, Marcia Gay Harden, Jennifer Ehle, Max Martini, Luke Grimes and Sloise Mumford. In order to stay loyal to the story, director Sam Taylor-Johnson did extensive research into the world of BDSM before filming started. Fully dressed: The other version of Christian Grey is positioned by a member of the Cake International team . Detailed: The cake Dornan wears a patterned silk tie and a neat grey business suit . She recently revealed that she consulted a professional dominatrix for the film, which is more than two hours long, and said she 'learned a lot' from her. She told The Independent: 'The sex scenes are pretty intense, so I'm sure people are going to feel aroused - but I've seen them so many times that I tend to forget.' Jamie Dornan recently revealed to Glamour magazine that he had found some of the scenes difficult to shoot. He said: 'There were times when Dakota was not wearing much, and I had to do stuff to her that I'd never choose to do to a woman.' And Dakota admitted that Jamie would be the first person to cover her up, telling the magazine: 'It's stressful enough to be tied to a bed naked in a scene. The highly-anticipated  film is out on February 13, just in time for Valentine's Day . 'But then they call cut, and you're still tied to the bed, naked. Jamie would be the first one to throw a blanket over me.' The movie is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, with the trailer having already been watched a massive 45million times on Youtube. Cake International's  Sugarcraft, Cake Decorating & Baking Show is the largest of its kind in the world, with 70,000 people expected to attend  across three venues in Manchester, London and Birmingham .","The life-size replica takes centre stage at the 50 Shades of Cake display .

"It takes Bradley Denton more than two hours to get ready for a night out - as he transforms himself into his drag queen persona Pearle Gattes. The 19-year-old dance student, from Leeds, says he has always felt more at home in the womenswear section of stores, and started dressing ultra-feminine two years ago. In fact, Bradley only goes out as the male version of himself if he's with people he's only just met at university. Scroll down for video . By night Bradley Denton transforms himself into drag persona Pearle Gattes (right) 'When I was 18 I started working as a dancer at a gay bar in York and I absolutely loved it,' he said. 'I felt really at home there and was made to feel really welcome but now I think it was more than that: for the first time in my life, I felt like I was where I belonged. 'When I'm Pearle, I feel so much more at home and I'm actually comfortable in my own skin. More than that: when I'm Bradley I long to be Pearle again.' When he first came out to his parents, Bradley's father refused to speak to him for over a week. But he did eventually succumb, saying that Bradley being gay wasn't worth losing their father-son relationship. Bradley said: 'It was really hard to take at first because my Dad's my idol. Ever since he was little he would put on pretty much everything he could find in his mother's makeup bag . When he is Pearle, he feels so much more at home and says he is 'actually comfortable in my own skin' 'I felt like I'd done wrong by him but at the same time, I knew that I'd told him the truth so I had some really mixed emotions. 'In the end it was a massive relief when Dad accepted me for who I was and, ever since, my parents have been really supportive.' He also has revealed since dressing as a woman, has been beaten up more than 20 times. When he was withdrawing money on the way back from a night out, three men passed by and, assuming Pearle was a woman, wolf-whistled as they went. When it became clear Pearle was, in fact, a man, the men proceeded to beat him in a tirade of homophobic abuse. 'I'm used to it. If anything, the hate makes me stronger,' he said. 'I've had at least 20 beatings over the years simply because I'm gay. 'It's hard to take but at the same time it gives you that bit of fire in your belly. The abuse has made me absolutely certain that this is who I am and I'm right to stick to my guns.' Bradley looks dapper as his male ego (l) and loves to apply heavy makeup and wear short skirts as Pearle (r) When he was withdrawing money on a night out as Pearle, three men beat him after realising he was a boy . Bradley added: 'Ever since I was little I've always liked wearing heels. I used to put on pretty much everything I could find in Mum's makeup bag. 'Whenever I walked into a shop I'd always go into the womenswear section. All my friends at school were girls and they'd always apologise for ""forcing"" me around the womenswear section. 'What they didn't realise at the time was that I was far more comfortable in the womenswear section than the menswear. 'I'd been putting makeup on for years but I started dressing up in drag two or three years ago.' Bradley Denton in full drag as Pearle on the left, with an unnamed friend on the right .

"Meet the young millionaire from Qatar who, at 26, has already owned a Bentley, a Ferrari and now drives a $270,000 Rolls Royce Ghost. Mohammed Al Kubaisi quickly built up a large fortune when his father handed over the reins to the family business - and like any young man with wealth, he indulged in his passion. But he has also opened up the world of supercars to the masses by congregating dozens of the coveted luxury vehicles at events in capital Doha. Usually locked away in the garages of the extremely wealthy or glimpsed roaring the streets of Doha - or Knightsbridge - Mr Al Kubaisi decided to feed his addiction to supercars by gathering together various models, including McLarens, Lamborghinis and Ferraris, in one place, for fans to admire. Scroll down for video . Supercar fanatic: Mohammed Al Kubaisi, who holds events for the luxury vehicles, waves from inside a bright blue Mercedes McLaren SLR . Sleek and sophisticated: The 26-year-old has previously owned this matte blue Ferrari 458 Italia, which carries a price tag of $240,000 . Luxury: The 26-year-old supercar enthusiast casually handles an eagle while sitting in a white Mercedes G55 truck in the desert in Qatar . He describes himself as 'a fan of supercars' and has owned an enviable fleet, including $235,000 Bentley Continental GT, a $221,000 (£140,000) Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG and a Ferrari 458 Italia worth $240,000 (£160,000). And his current ride is a powerful Rolls Royce Ghost - which comes with an eye-watering price tag of $270,000 (£175,000)/ . Mr Al Kubaisi, who owns a small but successful real estate business which specialises in rentals for expats as well as a garage, said his events have been well received by Qatar's wealthy car enthusiasts. From a wealthy Qatari family, he moved to Denver, Colorado, to study at the age of 18. Now, back in Qatar, he is single, and spends his time with friends, playing soccer or with his supercars. He says the first event, in 2012, featured around 30 models which were scouted from friends and contacts - and some were even featured after being spotted on the streets of Qatar. He said: 'Our first event in 2012 was during Ramadan and it went well. We gathered around 30 vehicles including supercars and European models,' said Mohammed. 'We got all the cars from friends and contacts, and also from spotting them on the streets. Immaculate: Supercars are a common sight in oil-rich Arab nations, including in Qatar.

Striking: Mr Al Kubaisi has owned this Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 painted white with eye-catching racing stripes . 'Our next event was held at Qatar Sports Club and was even bigger, we almost had too many cars, including McLarens, Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Mercedes.' A third event was staged in March last year - and attracted 50 extravagant supercars as well as numerous promoters and sponsors. Mr Al Kubaisi adds he loves life in the fast lane - but his biggest problem is deciding which car he wants to drive. 'I had a Maserati Granturismo S - it was a nice car but I eventually sold it and bought an Aston Martin Rapide which I didn't think was very good,' he said. 'I sold that and bought my very first supercar, the Ferrari 599 GTB which was great but it wasn't quite powerful enough so I sold it and bought a (Mercedes-Benz) SLS 63 - but again I needed more power. 'So I waited around six months and bought the Ferrari 458 Italia - which is a great car.'

The Sex Factor puts eight men and eight women who have no prior experience in a Las Vegas home together as they compete for stardom and a $1million prize. And among the contestants are Wall Street intern Paige Jennings, who goes by the name Veronica Vain, and recently made waves when she announces she was leaving the financial world to pursue her dreams of porn. Duke University porn star Belle Knox had previously been named as the host, but has now been replaced by Asa Akira. Scroll down for video .

The show is the creation of Buddy Ruben, a former Silicon Valley software developer with no television or porn experience. 'I would say I enjoy porn as much as the next guy, no more, no less,' he said in an interview with Nightline. After a casting call went out on social media, finalists came to audition for a panel of judges that include female stars Tori Black, Lexi Belle and Remy LaCroix and the lone male of the group, Keiran Lee. Lee is a British star famous for having his penis insured for $1million by Lloyd's of London. Those who made it through the casting process also now have some experience in the business.

"Wayne Marlon Jones, 53, bishop at United Spiritual Baptist Church in Canada has been charged with sexual assault and three counts of fraud more than $5,000 . A Canadian pastor has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman during 'spiritual guidance' sessions when he performed exorcisms on her. Wayne Marlon Jones from United Spiritual Baptist Church in Scarborough, Toronto, is also accused of convincing her to give him money and property, according to police. The 53-year-old, who was arrested last August, has been charged with sexual assault and three counts of fraud over $5,000. Jones, allegedly assaulted the woman during sessions from May 2011 to May 2013, according to the Toronto Sun. He was arrested on August 31. Originally from Trinidad and Tobago, the married man is named as bishop of the church which was founded in June 2000. Residents in the area said the church, located in a bungalow, had been operating for seven years but was vacated last August after there were disputes with both the city and the municipal board. However previously during Sunday services, the church would have nearly 30 cars filling the streets as both adult members and children attended sermons. Neighbor Sue Lamonday, 60, who lives across the street from the church said weird things go on there. She said: 'It didn't make sense people would be there at 2 a.m. until 4, 5, 6 a.m. I walked by last summer and heard (a man) screaming, 'God is going to save you from the fires of hell if you hand over your help any way you can.' Police believe there may be more victims and are encouraging anyone with information to come forward. The investigation is ongoing and Jones is set to appear in Old City Hall court on February 11. He has been accused of assaulting the woman during sessions from May 2011 to May 2013.

"Four minutes of crucial dash camera footage that might hold the truth behind a night in which an officer shot a man three times has gone missing. Shoua Yang, of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, was shot three times by Officer Jason Chadbourne following a ten-person brawl at a Valentine's Day party at a banquet hall in January 2014. And although there are three hours of footage on the officer's dash camera, the four minutes in which the shooting took place are unaccounted for. Shoua Yang, of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, was shot three times by police officer Jason Chadbourne following a ten-person brawl at a Valentine's Day party in January 2014. But four minutes of footage from Chadbourne's squad car dash camera have gone missing . The fight that included ten males erupted outside the banquet hall shortly after 11 p.m., according to the Star Tribune. A criminal complaint said officers saw three men run into a car, and when they yelled at the men to stop and talk, the driver put the car in reverse directly toward Jason Chadbourne at high speed, according to KMSP. Chadbourne, then 23, reportedly fired his gun at the partygoer's car as he drove away from the scene and three bullets hit Yang, then 22 . That's when Chadbourne, who was 23 at the time, reportedly fired his gun and three bullets hit Yang, then 22, as he was driving the car. Yang, faced charges of second degree-felony assault after the brawl. The partygoer, who now has a massive scar on his stomach, was acquitted on all charges last month and has brought up his side of the story in a new lawsuit. He claims he never knew the police were at the scene in the greater-Minneapolis suburb, that it was dark and snowy and that he and the other two in the car were just pulling out to leave. Chadbourne allegedly shut the squad car's camera and his microphone off only to later turn it on again, according the the lawsuit. Attorney Bob Bennett, who filed the suit against the officer, claims Chadbourne fired at the three people in the car 'without being able to see what they're doing, were they are or whether they pose any danger'. 'We don't let hunters shoot at game they can't identify. The same should be for police officers,' Bennett told KMSP. The suit also claimed Brooklyn Park police policy 'mandates officers utilize the devices to record all stops and contacts with the public'. The dash camera should be automatically turned on when lights and sirens are triggered, according to KMSP. Officer Chadbourne remains an employee at the Brooklyn Park police department. Yang claims he never knew the police were at the scene at the greater-Minneapolis suburb banquet hall (pictured) and that it was dark and snowy. He said he and two others in the car were just pulling out to leave .","Police responded to a fight at a Valentines Day party in January 2014 .

"Two Algerian men and two Czech women have been imprisoned for sham marriages - but the men fled half way through the trial and have not been seen since. Zdenka Sudikova, 22, wed Mahrez Benbetka, 28, and then Katerina Gaborova, 28, married Fateh El Fiad, 38, for the men to gain the rights of EU citizens. At court, it was revealed there was no communication, interaction or affection among the couples. Katerina Gaborova, 28 (left) and Zdenka Sudikova, 22, (right) were jailed for one year each at court today . Gaborova married failed asylum seeker Fateh El Fiad, 38, (pictured outside the Middlesbrough register office) six days after Sudikova married Benbetka, an overstayer on a six-month visa . The two men were jailed for 18 months each - but they were not at Teesside Crown Court today to hear the sentence as they absconded halfway through their trial. If caught, they will face automatic deportation. The women were jailed for one year each. Sentencing the four, who all lived in Middlesbrough, Recorder Henry Prosser said: 'I am satisfied this was a commercial enterprise. 'There was no love or affection between the parties to the marriage. 'They were strangers to each other at the time of the marriage and I'm satisfied that the marriages were entered into for the purposes of financial gain, both to enable the men to obtain work in this country and to remain here indefinitely. 'I am satisfied that there was a significant degree of organisation that went into the commission of these offences.' He told Teesside Crown Court the four were in contact with a network allowing non-EU citizens to pay for sham marriages with EU citizens. Jailing the women, Recorder Prosser said: 'I am satisfied that each of them would have expected to be paid for taking part in this marriage.' Prosecutor David Brooke told how the Middlesbrough Register Office registrar had no legal right to stop the nuptials, but reported concerns over the validity of both marriages. It was suspected the couples had been 'coached' as there was no affection between them. Each of the women said they had met their partners in a coffee shop months earlier. Gaborova paid for Sudikova, a bakery worker, to fly from Prague in May 2013 for the fake marriage. Sudikova then married Benbetka, an overstayer on a six-month visa, on September 24, 2013. She told investigators Benbetka proposed unexpectedly. She knew he was an illegal immigrant but was happy about the marriage. In text messages, they asked questions about each other's families to prepare for discussions with the registrar. The two men were jailed for 18 months each - but they were not at Teesside Crown Court today to hear the sentence as they absconded halfway through their trial. If caught, they will face automatic deportation . Gaborova and failed asylum seeker El Fiad,  got married six days after Sudikova and Benbetka on September 30. Gaborova lived with her partner - another man - and their two children. She told investigators she was going to marry behind his back. The bride was photographed in her wedding dress outside Middlesbrough register office, in front of the courthouse where she was later convicted. Suspicions arose as El Fiad did not appear to know his fiancée's full name. Both marriages went ahead despite arrests and interviews by immigration officials weeks earlier. And the men both applied for residence following their marriages in September 2013. The four all denied the charges and were convicted in two trials. The two men disappeared in the middle of the first trial in October last year, and have still not been found. They were convicted in their absence of obtaining leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception. The women were found guilty of assisting unlawful immigration to an EU state. Barristers for two missing men said their motivation was simply to enable them to work. Nigel Soppitt, for the two women who still maintain their innocence, said they were wrongly influenced or guided by others . He said: 'They took a great risk for scant reward. These are two young women who have been very foolish. 'They may have been tempted by some easy money by somebody else and they've fallen into that temptation not thinking of the consequences. 'These two young ladies are well down the pecking order, the bottom rung or thereabouts.' He added Gaborova had worked long hours tirelessly since coming to the UK and a prison sentence would profoundly affect her children, one of whom has a kidney disorder. He said a deportation order for the women would be ineffective since, as EU citizens, they could return to the UK at any time. Mr Soppitt asked the judge to consider suspended sentences, but Recorder Prosser refused arguing that prison was the way to deter others.","Zdenka Sudikova, 22, wed Mahrez Benbetka, 28 on September 24, 2013 .

"A former soldier in Hawaii has been sentenced to life in prison after beating his five-year-old daughter to death in an attack so brutal she was left with knuckle imprints on her tiny chest. Naeem Williams, 35, and his daughter Talia Williams's stepmother, Delilah Williams, assaulted the little girl almost daily during the seven months she lived with them at their military home in 2005. They used both belts and their fists to beat the youngster - in at least one case, until they 'felt a bone crack'. During the fatal attack, Naeem Williams punched Talia in the chest, leaving  visible imprints. Murder: Naeem Williams (left) has been sentenced to life in prison after beating his five-year-old daughter, Talia Williams (right), to death in an attack so brutal she was left with knuckle imprints on her tiny chest . The U.S. Department of Justice later sought the death penalty against Williams for the murder of his daughter, which occurred at the married couple's  home at Wheeler Army Air Force Base in Wahiawa. However, last year, the jury that had earlier convicted Williams of murder deliberated for a week on his sentence - either life in prison without parole or execution - before declaring they were deadlocked. Because the panel could not reach a consensus, the judge was required to sentence Williams to a life term, capping what was the first death penalty case to go to trial in Hawaii since it became a state. On Friday, a federal judge in Honolulu fulfilled his task to imprison the killer for life. Now, Williams - whose wife worked at a day-care facility at the Army base - will spend the rest of his life behind bars. Abused: Williams and his daughter's stepmother, Delilah Williams, assaulted the little girl almost daily during the seven months she lived with them at their military home in 2005. Above, Talia in a family photo . Killers: The married couple used both belts and their fists to beat the youngster - in at least one case, until they 'felt a bone crack'. Above Naeem (left) and Delilah Williams (right) are pictured in their police mug shots . Although Hawaii's territorial government abolished capital punishment in 1957, Talia's murder took place on Army property, and the case was tried in federal court, where the death penalty is allowed. During a long and emotional trial last year, jurors heard graphic testimony about how Williams and his spouse often beat Talia at Schofield Barracks, partly because of her bathroom accidents. Taking to the stand, Delilah Williams said that she and her husband had decided to pull her step-daughter out of elementary school because they were worried that officials would notice the abuse. 'She started having marks on her body,' Delilah Williams said, adding that she and Naeem Williams would often curse at Talia, as well as calling her names and hitting her almost daily. In shocking testimony, Delilah Williams told of how her husband had bound his daughter to a bedpost with duct tape, before beating her with a belt while she had a 'pleading look' on her face. She said that she had attempted the taping routine once herself, but had found it was not effective because the girl could squirm around. 'It required too much effort,' she added. Although the step-mother delivered most of her testimony was delivered with an even, calm voice, she sounded like she was going to cry when she described a beating  on June 29, 2005. Delilah Williams said she had come home from work that day to find Talia had wet herself. 'I started stomping on her,' she told the court through glistening eyes. 'I just continued stomping on her until it felt like a bone cracked under my foot and she defecated on herself.' Victim: Naeem Williams will spend the rest of his life behind bars for the murder of Talia (pictured, left and right, before her death in July 2005). Delilah Williams was previously sentenced to 20 years in prison . She forced the child to sit on a toilet and pushed on her stomach so hard that a toilet pipe broke, causing a leak. She said she then grabbed Talia by the hair and slammed her head against a wall. Delilah Williams was jailed for 20 years in 2014 as part of a plea agreement for the July 2005 murder. During proceedings leading up to Naeem Williams's death penalty sentencing last June, his family, including his daughter, nine, and  son, 11, testified that they love him and that his life has value. Williams read a statement to jurors apologizing for killing Talia and asking them to let him live.","Naeem Williams beat up his five-year-old daughter, Talia, 'almost daily'

"He's the unremarkable Liberal MP who pulled the trigger on next week's leadership crisis, which could see Prime Minister Tony Abbott out of a job. West Australian backbencher Luke Simpkins this afternoon  emailed his colleagues, announcing he had submitted a motion to spill the Liberal leadership. 'The Knighthood issue was for many the final proof of a disconnection with the people,' Mr Simpkins said. 'I think we must bring this to a head and test the support of the leadership in the party room.' But prior to today's dramatic announcement - Mr Simpkins has rarely been a figure in national headlines. The former Army officer perhaps drew the most attention when Daily Mail Australia exclusively revealed he had publicly confused a nightclub logo on stickers in Perth for Islamic State flags. Scroll down for video . Seat of power: Liberal backbencher Luke Simpkins has moved a motion for a Federal Liberal leadership spill . Who's corner is he in? Luke Simpkins, the man who pulled the trigger on the federal leadership spill, is pictured here with potential leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull . The Shahada flag: It features a common Islamic expression but has been co-opted by jihadists . The nightclub logo: The Speakeasy logo also features white cursive writing, but is written in English . Mr Simpkins asked the Transport Department to paint over the symbols - which were actually the logo for local club night Speakeasy. 'It's definitely nothing to do with Islamic Anything,' event manager Pierce Ericson told Daily Mail Australia at the time. The black Shahada flag is a common expression of Islamic faith but has been co-opted by jihadists. The Speakeasy flag featured white, cursive handwriting on a black background. Mr Simpkins did not comment after the matter was revealed, but he removed the post from his Facebook page after online mockery. Mr Simpkins' seat - which covers Perth's northern suburbs - is marginal and has been in both Labor and Liberal hands over the past decades. He increased his vote at the 2013 federal election but could be at risk if lugged with an unpopular party leader, as recent polls indicate Mr Abbott has been. He told Sky News today he expected Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull will stand. Pictured: Federal MP Luke Simpkins posted these pictures of stickers on the Leederville Railway Station bridge and said alerted the State Government . That's Major Simpkins to you! Luke Simpkins has a record of distinguished service in the country's armed forces . In Parliament since 2007: Backbencher Luke Simpkins told his colleagues today he was not coveting the leadership . He said Mr Morrison and Ms Bishop have 'got a proven track record'. 'The reality is, people have stopped listening to the Prime Minister,' he said. A former Army Major, Mr Simpkins is quite vocal on terrorism-related issues. Last year, Mr Simpkins spoke about Australian militants embracing the Islamic State terror group under the Shahada flag in a speech to Federal Parliament. 'These people make a personal decision to betray their country and follow the black flag of Shahada and the Islamic State,' he said. He is also reportedly passionate about human rights abuses in Myanmar, recently illegally crossing the border from Thailand to attend a military parade, according to reports. Mr Simpkins' media releases indicate he is committed to ensuring his local community receives Federal funding, hailing the diversion of funds for roads and schools in his electorate. He has touted his commitment to crime prevention and local volunteering programs. Prior to his time in parliament, he was a successful sportsman, having represented his country and Western Australia in the sport of rowing, winning two national and six state championships, according to his official biography.

"Lance Elgar (pictured) 'lost it' after rowing with his mother before kicking the animal three times with steel toe-capped boots . A teenage thug who kicked and burned a cat to death after downing a bottle of whisky has walked free from court. Lance Elgar, who was living on a farm in Nether Heyford, Northamptonshire, 'lost it' after rowing with his mother before kicking the animal three times with steel toe-capped boots. While the cat lay paralysed from the vicious assault on April 21 last year, the 19-year-old then picked it up and threw it on a fire. The animal, which belonged to the owners of a farm where Elgar was living, died after suffering broken bones, fractures, internal bleeding and a severed spinal cord. The landscape gardener was handed a 12-week prison sentence suspended for two years after he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. He was banned from owning animals for 10 years and ordered to pay £2,353.15 court costs and a victim surcharge of £80. Northampton Magistrates Court heard the cat died after enduring 'extreme pain and suffering'. District Judge Tim Daber told Elgar it was 'completely incredible' someone would take their anger out on 'a defenceless animal'. He said: 'Neither arguments, drinking or scratches are any excuse whatsoever. It shows incredible cruelty. 'It is a very close call but your age, remorse and record for making positive contributions to the community have persuaded me to just keep you out of prison on this occasion.' The court heard Elgar attacked the cat after drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels following a row with his mother. He said the cat then scratched him. Prosecutor Janita Patel said: 'We can confidently say that this cat suffered extreme pain and suffering and was most likely still conscious after the first kick. Northampton Magistrates Court (pictured) heard the cat died after enduring 'extreme pain and suffering' 'This could have left it paralysed which would have increased its fear and anxiety. 'A gentle kick to the head would not have caused this. Extreme force must have been used with an intent to injure.' Hayley Pearson, defending, said: 'It was a moment of madness and he does not remember putting the cat on a lit fire. 'He had drunk a whole bottle of Jack Daniels and had had an argument with his mother who he had helped to build a house for. Then the cat scratched him and he lost it.'","Lance Elgar 'lost it' after rowing with his mother before kicking the animal .

"A Missouri boy's heart started beating after his mother prayed aloud to God in a hospital room, she says. John Smith fell through ice on top of a lake and stayed under for 15 minutes, KDSK reported. Two of his friends also made the fall, with the NBC affiliate reporting 'When rescuers arrived, one was almost out of the water, another was holding onto the ice and one couldn't be found.' The 14-year-old was reportedly taken to SSM St. Joseph Hospital West on Martin Luther King Day, when the trio's drop into the waters of Lake Sainte Louise occurred. Scroll down for video . Survival: John Smith, seen in an interview with The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, is getting better. Last month he reportedly fell through ice and was under water for 15 minutes. Though doctors feared Smith dead, his pulse started beating after his mother prayed aloud . The teenager was unresponsive to 27 minutes of CPR at the hospital, according to KDSK. Dr. Kent Sutterer said in an interview with the television station 'Everybody says ""Well the cold helped him."" Well, he was dead for 45 minutes.' KDSK reported the boy's mother, Joyce Smith, was asked to enter the room by Sutterer so he could tell her it wasn't looking good. Sutterer said that 'John's mom [Joyce Smith] came in and she started praying loudly.' 'Within a matter of a minute or two, his heart started again,' the doctor said. Joyce Smith told KDSK 'I don't remember what all I said. But I remember, ""Holy God, please send your Holy Spirit to save my son. I want my son, please save him."" And they hadn't been getting a pulse at that time, so all of a sudden I heard them start saying, 'We got a pulse, we got a pulse.""' The 14-year-old was reportedly taken to SSM St. Joseph Hospital West, where he was unresponsive to 27 minutes of CPR . Danger: Smith and two of his friends fell ice over Lake Sainte Louise on Martin Luther King Day . Smith's son was later transported to SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, KDSK reported. The news outlet reported the teenager's bloodstream had acid in it and his circulatory system was in shock and he soon started to heal. Dr. Jeremy Garrett said to the television station 'This is a bona fide miracle.' Garrett said that after signs of improvement, 'I did a very interesting neurologic exam. We said, ""Well John, pretend your left hand is Lebron James and your right hand is Michael Jordan,"" then asked him a series of questions and he got them all right. It's truly amazing.' John Smith, meanwhile, told the television station 'I'm surprised I'm alive but it's a real miracle that I'm alive, and I thank God I'm alive, and there's a reason I'm alive, so I'm just going to kind of follow what God has in store for me throughout my life.' The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Smith received a combined 43 minutes' worth of CPR from first responders and hospital staff. The newspaper reported 'He has some scrapes on his arms, legs and neck from the jagged edges of the ice, and his hands are sore, but not sore enough to keep him from texting his friends.' According to the Post-Dispatch, Smith will undergo physical therapy and left the hospital on Wednesday.","John Smith fell through ice last month along with two of his friends and stayed under for 15 minutes .

"A policeman lured a 16-year-old Australian girl to his home through a couch surfing website before drugging and assaulting her, it has been claimed. Dino Maglio, 35, who lives in Padua, Italy, used the name of Leonardo on Couchsurfing.com to entice the girl, who was travelling with her mother and sister, prosecutors say. He has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was underage, and is due to stand trial next month. It has been claimed that an Italian police officer Dino Maglio (pictured) used the name of Leonardo on Couchsurfing.com to entice a girl, who was travelling with her mother and sister . The 35-year-old has admitted drugging her with a tranquilliser and having sex, even though he knew she was underage, and is due to stand trial next month . Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liquer belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason' Since the allegations were made, more than a dozen women have come forward claiming they were assaulted by Maglio after using the host-a-traveller website to arrange accommodation. The case has raised safety concerns surrounding the social networking site, which puts travellers in touch with hosts who are willing to put them up and show them around their hometowns for free. It has been linked to several alleged sexual assaults over the years, including the rape of a Hong Kong tourist in Leeds, according to the Guardian. The website's chief executive, Jennifer Billock, told the newspaper users' safety was a top priority and it was constantly 'evolving our tools and processes to find and halt abusers of our system'. It is believed that Maglio had told one alleged victim he closed his profile because he had so many positive reviews he had to open a new one. The Investigative Reporting Project Italy (IRPO), which carried out a year-long investigation, said that 14 testimonies collected revealed a man who seemed like a fun and fast-living host. Some claim he would constantly compliment them and insist they drink while they were out together and on the first or second night say they were served drinks of tea or wine. They did not report feeling unsafe as they were not travelling alone but in separate incidents from March 2013 until March 2014, the women recalled feeling suddenly 'woozy and intensely tired'. Maglio has admitted spiking a drink of Baileys liquer belonging to the 16-year-old with a sedative, and when asked why he told police: 'I am stupid, there was no real reason'. He told investigators the sex was consensual and that he had joined Couchsurfing to improve his English, as he believed it would help further his career. Dino Maglio used Couchsurfing.com (pictured) to entice a 16-year-old girl to his home before drugging her and raping her, it has been alleged . More than a dozen women have since come forward after finding his profile on the social network and staying at his flat in the picturesque city of Padua in northern Italy . In a victim statement, one Canadian woman alleged she had tried to rouse three other female visitors staying at Maglio's after she discovered them passed out before falling unconscious herself. She added that she had hazy memories of being kissed and fondled by Maglio but was unable to protest. Others feared they had been slipped the drugged and were unsure if anything had happened while they were passed out. Three young woman from Czech Republic also said they had been unable to recall what happened after staying at the defendant's home and drinking his wine. They claim they had brief flashes of being kissed and touched by Maglio and vomited when they woke up. Another traveller from Hong Kong claimed she was unconscious after drinking his alcohol and posted a negative review on his Couchsurfing profile. The next day he allegedly sent her a threatening message over Facebook demanding she remove it and said that if she refused he would use his authority as a police officer to create 'trouble' for her on her next visit to Europe. 'It took me some days to realise I was sexually abused,' the alleged victim told IRPI. 'So I wrote to him on Facebook. I asked him what happened and he admitted we had sex. I felt like a whore. I felt nobody would ever want me again after this.' The alleged attacks came to light after the women connected on the website to share their experiences, reports say. When his home was searched officers found a gun and a large amount of pornography and child abuse images, according to the Guardian. Court papers showed he was also hosting two other Couchsurfing tourists at the time - with one showing the same 'sickness' as other alleged victims. Maglio is being held in a military prison for his own protection and police chiefs say he has been suspended from duty. He will go on trial in Padua near Venice on March 17 on charges of raping a minor with the aggravating circumstance of having administered a narcotic without her knowledge.

"Rant: Ukip's Robert Ray argued with police officers after being caught drink-driving in a hotel car park . A Ukip councillor launched a 2am drunken tirade at police after attending a fundraiser with Nigel Farage and declared: 'Do you know who I am?' Robert Ray, 65, was caught drink-driving by the officers in the car park of a four-star Essex hotel where he had been socialising with the party leader. Ray has apologised after he was fined £600 and handed a 19-month driving ban - but insisted he was only moving the car to help his collapsed wife. A court heard she died three months later, although it was not explained whether her death and the car park collapse were linked. The councillor, who previously made headlines when he was outed as a 1977 National Front candidate, was at the Orsett Hall country hotel last June in Thurrock, Essex, where he sits a borough councillor. Basildon Magistrates' Court heard staff advised him not to drive in his drunken state before calling police when they saw Ray walk towards his silver Peugeot 406 in the car park. It led to an angry confrontation which ended in Ray being breathalysed and recording a score of 75mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath - more than twice the drink-drive limit of 35mg. Samantha Doyle, prosecuting, said: 'The officers told him they had received a call and asked him if he had been drinking. He told them he ""had had a couple"". 'Mr Ray then became agitated and gestured at the officers and shouted that he had been at an event with Nigel Farage, adding: ""Do you know who I am? I am a prominent person and a councillor. I am a powerful man."" Ray refused to take a breathalyser test and was arrested as his wife lay ill at the side of the car. Miss Doyle added: 'Mr Ray told them he wasn't on the road, but he was told if he didn't consent to a breath test he would be arrested. He refused - the time was 2.15am. 'Mr Ray was ranting and raving and told the officers he knew the police commissioner and the chief constable. He was arrested and an ambulance was called.' Apology: Basildon magistrates heard Ray was trying to help his wife Maggie (with him right), also a Ukip councillor, who had collapsed between two parked cars. She died three months after the incident . Jeremy Sirrell, mitigating, argued his client had never intended to drive but was merely moving his car to treat his wife, who had fallen heavily between two parked cars. 'What happened was that his wife fell down and was on the floor at the side of the car,' said Mr Sirrell. 'Mr Ray was not able to get to her to help her because of where it was parked. 'Inevitably he had to move the car and was doing so when the police arrived. 'He was upset at being questioned by the police because he felt he was within his rights to drive the vehicle, because Orsett Hall is not a public place and there is case law to that effect. 'He does accept he drove the car, but only to move it to get to his wife, to help her.' Ray's wife Maggie O'Keefe-Ray, also a Ukip councillor, collapsed from a brain haemorrhage two months after the incident and later died. Fundraiser: Ray was 'ranting and raving' outside the four-star Orsett Hall hotel in Thurrock, Essex (above) The court did not hear whether her collapse outside the fundraiser in June and her death, which happened in September, were linked. Ray, from South Ockendon, Essex, was fined £600, ordered to pay costs of £500 and a victim surcharge of £60. He was also banned from driving for 19 months. The councillor released a short statement through Ukip which said: 'I deeply regret this unfortunate incident which was entirely out of character and I apologise to all of my residents.' A spokesman said Ray is now facing a disciplinary procedure within the party. The councillor made headlines in September 2013 when it was revealed he had stood as a candidate for the National Front in Newham, east London, in 1977. Ray said at the time he had severed all ties with the party decades ago and openly declared his past when he joined Ukip.","Robert Ray, 65, launched into tirade at 2am outside four-star Essex hotel .

"Jihadist: Mohammed Hadi, 18, is believed to be fighting with Isis in Syria . A radicalised schoolboy thought to be fighting in Syria for the Isis jihadist army was bought a plane ticket to the war-torn region by his mosque, it has been claimed. Mohammed Hadi, 18, dubbed Osama Bin Bieber, left Coventry in the West Midlands for Syria earlier this year and is now thought to be in Iraq. The boy - nicknamed after the Canadian popstar because of his youthful looks - posted pictures of himself in desert combat gear armed with twin pistols, saying that he was fighting with Isis (the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant). But, according to Hadi's mother, he had no means of paying for transport to the Syrian border with his £14 per week pocket money - and she believes religious leaders may have funded his journey. Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, she said: They have arranged for this - his flights. They've paid for his ticket - there is no other way'. 'He had no job. He is just a boy - he had money for soft drinks and to get the bus, no more. I don't know if he'll ever come back alive.' The mosque in question was not named, and a cleric thought to be involved refused to answer questions. Hadi also attended a religious school, or madrassa, which last week said it called police as soon as it discovered the Hadi's extremist leanings. Last week his father, 38-year-old Mahir Hadi, said the family had no idea where their son was. Family members headed to the Turkish border with Syria in the hope of hearing word of him, but have found nothing. Hadi is thought to have left for Turkey with friends Rasheed Amani and Ali Kharisani and headed on through Syria to Iraq. They are among around 500 British jihadists thought to have joined the fighting currently devastating the countries. Twitter . users have reported that Hadi, also known as Abu Yahya Al Kurdy, is . currently near the northern Syrian town of Sarrin with a group of . Chechens.

Recruitment: Isis posted a video showing British men urging others to take up arms and join them . A . police spokesman last week said: 'Police are investigating the whereabouts of an . 18-year-old man from the Stoke Heath area of Coventry as a result of . concerns raised by family members. The man was last seen on 26 March. 'Officers . are keeping an open mind as to the man’s whereabouts; however the . investigation is being led by officers from the West Midlands Counter .

"Judge Philip Wassall said viewing online porn gave the boy, now 16, a 'skewed' view of women and helped turn him into a predator . A schoolboy turned into a vicious sexual predator after getting hooked on hardcore online pornography when he was just 12 years old, a court has heard. The boy, now 16, sexually abused one girl aged 11, another aged 13, and went on to bully a 12-year-old into sending him explicit pictures of herself via Facebook. Judge Philip Wassall, at Exeter Crown Court, was told the boy's attacks started after he began watching porn on the family computer at his North Devon home. Mr Wassall said the disturbing images, which were viewed before the boy hit puberty, had warped his understanding of women and sex, and turned him into a predator. Mr David Sapiecha, prosecuting, said the boy committed his first offence aged 12 after viewing pornography during a troubled period for his family. He assaulted an 11-year-old after forcing  his hands down her trousers and touching her. Despite the girl's protests the boy convinced himself she wanted him to do it, and told friends afterwards that she was 'begging for it', Mr Sapiecha said. Aged 14 he attacked a 13-year-old girl after getting her drunk on a camping trip, and used Facebook to pressure another 12-year-old into sending him explicit pictures of herself. She initially refused, but after he accused her of being frigid she agreed to pose in her underwear. However he kept pressuring her into sending more and more explicit images of herself with a deodorant can. The court heard that all of the girls had been left emotionally devastated after the attacks, with one woman describing her daughter as 'an emotional wreck'. Another of his victims began self harming after she was teased at school and called a 'slag'. Mr Wassall sentenced the boy to a two-year long series of classes to adjust his sexist attitude to women, and banned him from accessing pornography under a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. Essex Crown Court heard the boy sexually assaulted an 11-year-old girl when he was 12 by putting his hand down her trousers, and attacked a 13-year-old after getting her drunk on a camping trip when he was 14 . The order means he is banned from visiting explicit sites, and is also banned from deleting his internet history. Officers are allowed to examine his computer at any time, and if they find information is missing he can be taken back to court. The maximum penalty for a breach is five years in jail. Mr Wassall said: 'What shines through in this case is that at the age of 12 you gained access to pornography, before you committed these offences, and it was at that time your difficulties began. 'When one thinks of the impact of that on a 12-year-old mind and on someone in a vulnerable position, it really makes one uncomfortably aware just how easy it is to access pornography, even for somebody very young. The boy is now banned from explicit websites, cannot delete his internet history, and must consent to police searches of his computer . 'Unless anybody has knowledge of what is happening, it is very difficult to do something about it. I take note of the fact the Government is engaging with internet service providers and this case highlights the need for that. 'Every day people are accessing mainstream pornography which can have a detrimental effect on children and young people. 'The Youth Offending Team’s report concludes this offending started very shortly after you started watching this material at a time before puberty. 'It is very likely to have led to a skewed attitude towards women when you went through puberty and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion it formed the background to this offending. 'Having said that, it was serious sexual offending which has been very damaging for the victims who have not only suffered directly but through online bullying by people who know you. 'None of the victims did anything to encourage you and you imposed your will on them. They are completely innocent victims.' He told the boy he expects him to work with probation 'to deal with the background of this offending and ensure your relationships with women in the future are healthy and responsible.'

"An Australian man who suffered shocking injuries when he crashed his motorbike into a tree in Bali will not be allowed to leave Indonesia by authorities unless he finds a way to pay his $10,000 medical bill. Liam Rudd, 24, is in a serious condition in hospital after suffering a fractured skull, bleeding and swelling on the brain and leg injuries after crashing last Sunday, just a week after arriving. Mr Rudd has been pleading with his twin sister, Tanika, to 'please get me out of here'. Tanika Rudd, revealed to Daily Mail Australia, that Indonesian doctors told her that they would not be able to perform emergency surgery, the day after his accident, without being paid up-front. 'They wanted $3500 up-front and when I said 'I haven't got that money, I'm just a single mum"" they told me that ""if you don't he's going to die"", all I could tell them was I promise I would do everything I could to get the money,' Miss Rudd told Daily Mail Australia. 'They did the emergency surgery because they had to stop bleeding.' Liam Rudd, 24, is in a serious condition in an Indonesian hospital after suffering a fractured skull, bleeding and swelling on the brain and leg injuries. He will not be allowed to leave the country until his $10,000 medical bill is paid for . Liam Rudd pictured with his twin sister Tanika before he left for Indonesia. She is on her way to Bali to be by his hospital bedside after he suffered horrific injuries in a bike crash . Mr Rudd had to undergo emergency surgery to relieve pressure on the brain . Miss Rudd will leave her two-year-old son Kobi behind to make a mercy dash to the island this weekend, to be by his Liam's side. But she doesn't know when they will be able to leave the country for Australia. She's been told by government officials that they will not allow Liam to leave the country until all expenses are settled. 'I had to keep the money problems quiet, I don't want him worrying about it too but I had to get him moved from the private hospital because it cost $1500 for the first night.' That's why friends have set up the GiveForward pledge page to try and help with the soaring hospital costs. 'He's pretty confused still and doesn't know why I am not there with him but he is improving a lot, he's starting to put sentences together,' Miss Rudd added. Mr Rudd lost control of his motorcycle and crashed heavily on Sunday, just a week after relocating to Indonesia. He was found unconscious on the side of the road by one of his Indonesian friends.. 'No one really thought he was going to make it, at first,' Miss Rudd admitted. 'The embassy has been amazing, I got my emergency passport and a friend has paid for a one-way ticket to get me over there. 'I'm getting consular assistance too but they can't help with the money but I have to get there, no one else can.' The twins' mother died when they were young. Miss Rudd expects the bill to 'be at least $10,000' by the time Liam is well enough to leave hospital. She has no information about what level of travel insurance, if any, her brother may have had. 'I am really grateful for all the help we're getting, I hope I can bring him home soon,' she said. Liam Rudd pictured with his nephew. His twin sister Tanika and friends have called for help on a fundraising site to cover more than $10,000 in medical expenses after he suffered serious injuries in Bali, after authorities told her he is not allowed to leave until they are fully paid . Liam Rudd had just relocated to Indonesia a week before his terrible motorcycle accident. He remains in a serious condition in an Indonesian hospital unable to pay his medical bills . His friend Nathan Reynolds is among those who is trying to raise funds to cover the costs and get him out of the country. His GiveForward campaign says: 'Our good friend, Liam Rudd, was involved in a serious motorcycle accident after moving from Australia to Indonesia a few weeks ago.' 'He sustained severe injuries including a fractured skull and internal bleeding in the brain,' he states. 'He is in need of surgery to place a plate in his skull and to stop the internal bleeding. 'After just moving to a new country, the financial circumstances surrounding this accident are not good news. 'There is already a few thousand dollars debt accumulated for his time already spent in hospital, and he is need of a further $7000 for the surgery, medication expenses, and approximately $800 a day for him to remain in the Intensive care unit. 'We are asking for assistance to help pay for his medical expenses. 'We are desperate, and with such distance between us and Indonesia, the only thing we have to offer is our love and support. 'We are hoping the generosity of others may help us alleviate his medical expenses . 'Even if you can only spare a few dollars to help out, it will all be very much appreciated.'

"The Royal Family might be more popular than ever before but the majority of Britons think funding for some parts of the institution should be cut. Although taxpayers are happy to fund the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Cambridges and Prince Harry, a new poll has revealed that most want the rest to take a pay cut. That would mean Prince Andrew, the Princess Royal, the Wessexes and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, among others, losing any form of public subsidy. Slimmed down: The majority of voters want a 'core' Royal Family comprised of the heir and his family . Currently, the Royal Family is funded by a combination of the Sovereign Grant, which replaced the annual Civil List payment and three other grants in 2011, and money from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall. The Sovereign Grant is taken from the revenues generated by the Crown Estate, a portfolio of properties and investments formerly owned by the monarch but now the Government, with the Royal Family being handed a total of £13.7m a year to cover the cost of official duties. Although taxpayers do not directly fund any royal activity, they do bear the cost of providing police protection teams for royals and politicians, which funded via the Home Office. The new poll, which was conducted by YouGov, asked voters which royals should be funded by the Sovereign Grant and the Royal Duchies. 69 per cent said the Queen and Prince Philip should continue to get funding, with 89 per cent of Conservative voters agreeing, compared to just 58 per cent of Labour voters. Who should be paid? According to a new poll, only the Queen, Charles, the Cambridges and Prince Harry . New look: If the rules were implemented, Prince Andrew and his daughters would be among those to miss out . A similar number thought the same about Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, while another 59 per cent said the same of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George. By contrast, just 28 per cent said Prince Andrew should receive a subsidy with a similar number saying the same about Prince Edward. 39 per cent said the Princess Royal should receive public money but just nine per cent said the same of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Although neither Zara Tindall or Peter Phillips are given any form of funding, 10 per cent of Britons said that they should be - more than the number happy to see payments to the Queen's cousins continue. Royal cousins who perform official duties and are given a subsidy from the Sovereign Grant include the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent. Royal Duchies: The Queen and Prince Charles are the holders of Royal Duchies Lancaster and Cornwall . Funding: Harry, William, Kate and George are mostly funded by Prince Charles' Duchy of Cornwall . The concept of a slimmed down Royal Family, although popular, is not a new idea and features heavily in Prince Charles' plans for the future of the monarchy. His idea, featuring a 'core' Royal Family comprised of himself, Camilla, Prince Harry and the Cambridges, has already been mooted and has met with some opposition. Prince Andrew is believed to be particularly upset at 'being pushed to the margins' of royal life and was reportedly furious after his daughters were dissuaded from taking on royal duties. Charles, who has been given an enhanced role since the Diamond Jubilee in 2012, was apparently also behind the slimmed down version of the Royal Family that appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the Jubilee Flypast the same year. Andrew, his daughters, and the Wessexes were also excluded from Prince George's Christening in October 2013, with the Cambridges apparently preferring a smaller ceremony with 'close' family and friends in attendance. Since then, the two York princesses have become increasingly career-focused, with Beatrice taking on a role, now ended, at Sony, while Eugenie has moved to New York to work as an art dealer. Grant: Princess Anne and Prince Andrew are part-funded by the Sovereign Grant and Duchy of Lancaster . Cutting down: Just 28 per cent of those asked said the Wessexes should continue to be funded . No cash: Even less, just nine per cent, thought Beatrice and Eugenie should receive public money . Held by the monarch and his or her heir, the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall have been the main source of Royal funding for centuries. Lancaster, the larger of the two, is owned by the Queen who also bears the subsidiary title of the Duchess of Lancaster. Established in 1265, the Duchy was founded by Henry III when he made a gift of some land to his son Edmund. A century later, Edmund's grandson Henry of Grosmont was given the title of Duke, making the Lancaster landholding into a Duchy. The Dukedom also played a key role in the Wars of the Roses, with the Lancasters going on to triumph when Henry VII won the Battle of Bosworth Hill. Today, the 18,454ha estate includes a number of London properties, the majority of which are close to the Savoy in central London and were amassed by John of Gaunt - the royal scion who built the original Savoy Palace. The younger of the two royal duchies, Cornwall was established in 1337 by Edward VIII to provide funding for his son, Edward, Prince of Wales or, as he is better known, the 'Black Prince'. Comprised of a significant chunk of Cornwall, parts of Devon and Dorset, and the Isles of Scilly, it is automatically passed on to each successive Prince of Wales. When  Charles becomes king, he will also take on the title Duke of Lancaster while Prince William takes Duke of Cornwall. In theory, Prince Harry should then become Duke of York, the title traditionally given to a monarch's second son, although whether or not that will happen is yet to be decided.","The majority want to stop funding 'minor royals' such as Prince Andrew .
Most royals are funded by Sovereign Grant and Duchy of Lancaster .
Charles, Camilla, Harry and Cambridges also funded by Duchy of Cornwall .

"'Forced out': Former police call handler Lisa Hewitt said she was given a warning over her red dye job . A former police call handler has quit after a decade's service claiming she was 'picked on' for her auburn hair colour. Lisa Hewitt, 42, refused to change her 'distinctive style' despite being given a formal warning by Warwickshire Police last year - 16 months after having the dye job. She resigned from the force and worked her last day three weeks ago, saying she was fed up of the threat of disciplinary action. Mrs Hewitt, who lives with her husband Martin, 44, and two children in the village of Kineton, Warwickshire, dealt with 101 and internal calls at the force headquarters. She was happy in her job, she insisted, until she began being 'bullied' before receiving a warning on October 8. According to the mother-of-two, it ordered her to change her hair colour or face 'potential dismissal'. 'I believe I was singled out,' she said. 'For what reason I really don't know, [but] I felt I was picked on and bullied while others with bright hair and nails were not. 'I think they were trying to save on a redundancy payment. I've heard there are redundancies coming. 'I was not being awkward, but when they asked me to change my hair colour, I refused. My distinctive style is part of my personality.' Mrs Hewitt also took more than two months off sick last summer, which she said was caused by stress brought on by a lack of staff. She said workers who left were not replaced and she sometimes had to run Warwickshire's 101 non-emergency hotline on her own. 'Many a time I was on my own on an eight-hour weekend shift,' she said. 'On some weekdays I was left to run all of Warwickshire 101 calls on my own for four to five hours. Claims: Mrs Hewitt pictured with previous hair styles. The 42-year-old, who also took two months off sick last year, claimed there were not enough staff to handle 101 non-emergency calls from the public . Employment: Mrs Hewitt handled 101 calls in the Warwickshire Police control room, pictured (file image) 'People were complaining that they could not get through on 101 and were calling 999. 'I asked for help but was told I had to cope. They were putting so much work on me and I just could not cope.' Warwickshire Police and its partner West Mercia Police have almost finished a three-year plan to cut spending by £30million. 'Our appearance is essential, as perceptions are quickly formed based on first impressions. We will present a positive and professional image at all times. 'All staff must keep their hair clean, neat and tidy. Hairstyle, colour and cut should look discreet and natural. Individuals with long hair have a duty to ensure that the length does not put them or others at risk. 'Make-up should be discreet and in keeping with the organisation’s professional business-like image. Strong colours and contrast should be avoided. 'Nails must be kept to an appropriate length so as to comply with Heath and Safety, and to maintain a business like appearance. The length should not hinder expected work activities. Officers and staff who come into contact with the public will only wear natural or clear coloured nail varnish. Strong colours and contrast should be avoided. 'Failure to comply with this policy may instigate management activities linked with misconduct, and poor or unsatisfactory performance.' New consultation is now under way on another £30million of cuts between 2015 and 2018. Mrs Hewitt added: 'I had never had complaints about my work. I was always well-dressed. I did a good job and my hair colour should not affect it. 'I did not like going in but I did to serve my notice and act professionally. I loved that job. They have lost ten years of knowledge and experience.' It is not yet known whether Mrs Hewitt is intending to pursue her claims to an employment tribunal. The force's head of services Tania Coppola said: 'We treat the employment of our workforce very seriously and have an organisational change policy to ensure we treat everyone fairly. 'The welfare of our staff is of utmost importance and a priority. 'Warwickshire Police and West Mercia Police have high standards for their workforce and we have a number of policies, including a dress and appearance policy, which includes clear rules and guidance on dress code. 'We follow our policies and challenge officers and staff where appropriate.. 'It is not appropriate for us to comment on individual employees, regardless of whether they are a current or previous employee.' The force did not directly address Mrs Hewitt's claims that she had to work alone, but Superintendent David Gardner said in a statement: 'Warwickshire Police and West Mercia Police operate three control rooms across the alliance area, with over 300 employees working in a range of roles including switchboard operators and call handlers. 'In our control rooms, it is a priority to answer and deal with calls as quickly and effectively as possible, to enable us to protect people from harm.'","Lisa Hewitt said she was given warning 16 months after adopting colour .

"The former producer and ex-boyfriend of Lady Gaga must pay a Hollywood songwriter who discovered the pop star $7.3million after he promised to split profits with her, a federal judge ruled. Producer Rob Fusari’s argument to reduce the amount the jury awarded to songwriter Wendy Starland last year was ruled against by U.S. District court judge Jose Linares on Wednesday. Starland testified during the trial that Fusari, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, had asked her to find an ‘edgy, bold, confident, charismatic’ performer and ‘someone that you can't take your eyes off of’. Rob Fusari (left), the former producer and ex-boyfriend of Lady Gaga, owes songwriter Wendy Starland (right) $7.3million, a federal judge ruled. The songwriter discovered the pop star at a New York performance in 2006 . Lady Gaga said in a deposition in 2011 that she believed Starland, who wrote songs with her, and Fusari had a verbal agreement to split their share from her career . She added that Fusari asked her to go out and find him a 'unique female singer, under the age of 25, who could be the female equivalent of the lead singer of the band The Strokes.' The songwriter brought back Lady Gaga after spotting her during a New York City performance at The Cutting Room in 2006, when the pop star went by her given name, Stefani Germanotta. Lady Gaga said in a deposition in 2011 that she believed Starland, who wrote songs with her, and Fusari had a verbal agreement to split their share from her career. ‘My understanding was that Wendy and him had initially agreed upon 50/50 perhaps before Wendy ever found me, and after I was signed to Rob and made music, Rob began to change his mind,’ said Lady Gaga, whose hits have included Poker Face and Bad Romance. Fusari, a Grammy Award-winning producer whose credits include work for Beyonce, Whitney Houston and Will Smith, previously sued Lady Gaga for $35million in court in New York, but that lawsuit was dropped. Lady Gaga said in a disposition that she believed Starland and Fusari (right) had agreed on a 50/50 split before she was discovered. She said that after she signed with Fusari he 'began to change his mind' Starland said Fusari asked her to find him a 'unique female singer, under the age of 25, who could be the female equivalent of the lead singer of the band The Strokes'","Producer Rob Fusari argued amount jury awarded to songwriter Wendy Starland last year should be reduced but court ruled against him .

"An Alaska man who attempted to walk 50 miles between two villages in minus-35 degree weather was found in good shape with only four miles left in his trip. Lawrence James, 52, began the journey at around 7pm Monday and walked about 46 miles in 15 hours in below freezing temperatures before a family member caught up to him, Alaska Dispatch News reports. 'I've been wanting to do this for a while, so I just made up my mind and did it,' James told the Dispatch. An Alaska man attempted to walk 50 miles in minus 35 degree weather from the Interior Alaska community of Birch Creek to Fort Yukon . James told Michael Ivie Fort Yukon police officer, that he had a cousin who made the trek from the Interior Alaska community of Birch Creek to Fort Yukon a few years ago and he wanted to try it. James had been drinking when he decided to embark on the journey risking encounter with moose and wolves. So, James' family alerted authorities after James left Birch Creek. 'He said his last drink kind of gave him that urge, that oomph,' Ivie told the News Miner. James, a Birch Creek native, told the Dispatch that he knew what he was getting himself into when he decided to begin the long journey in the harsh weather. Risks: James had been drinking when he decided to embark on the journey risking encounter with moose and wolves . He brought a .22 rifle and a sled stocked with tea, water, sandwiches, a bag of jolly ranchers, and extra outerwear. 'Our issue is that it was -30 or below, and he was by himself, and he was only carrying a little .22 rifle,' Ivie said, according to the Huffington Post. 'There were all sorts of possibilities that might have happened. 'He could have been trampled by a moose or [attacked by] wolves.' But, when James' cousin Weston Balaam caught up to him on his snowmachine, he found the man completely fine. Balam said he set out to find James at 10.30am Tuesday, more than 15 hours after James' began the journey. James was still walking when Balaam approached. Balaam spotted James about four miles from Fort Yukon and the two rode on Balaam's snow machine the rest of the way. James was then taken to a medical clinic and was found to be uninjured.

"The funeral of married mother-of-three Ellen Brody, the driver of an SUV which was hit by a train on Tuesday in Valhalla, New York, took place on Friday. She and five others died in the horrific collision . The SUV driver involved in a train wreck that claimed six lives was 'a beautiful soul' who always took a genuine interest in others, her rabbi said on Friday outside her funeral. Many young adults were among the mourners at the Dobbs Ferry, New York funeral for Ellen Brody, a 49-year-old mother of three daughters in their teens and 20s. 'I was looking through our archives last night. We have dozens of pictures of Ellen,' Rabbi Benjy Silverman said before the service. 'And in each one, without fail, she has a huge smile, a warm smile. We call it the Ellen Smile.' She was 'a beautiful soul' who also found beauty in others, Silverman said. 'She adored her daughters and husband. She was their biggest fan and supporter.' Brody's husband, daughters and brother spoke at the 'sad and moving' service, said Greenburgh Town Supervisor Paul Feiner, a family friend. The service was 'a celebration of her life. ... Everyone said she was upbeat. 'There was a universal description of her life as a very warm, caring, compassionate, kind, giving person'. Family and friends had gathered to remember Mrs Brody at 10am at the Chabad of the Rivertowns. A large floral tribute was also seen being carried into the synagogue. Mrs Brody was killed along with five passengers on Tuesday night when the train crashed into her SUV on the tracks at a railroad crossing in the Westchester County town of Valhalla. Scroll down for video . Husband Alan Brody (left) and Mrs Brody's brother, Jeff Schaeffer, second left, arrive for the funeral at the synagogue on Friday. Mrs Brody was one of six victims in the Metro-North train crash on Tuesday . Chabad Rabbi Benji Silverman spoke to the media before the service where he said Mrs Brody was a much loved member of the community . The casket of Ellen Brody, carried by her brother (center) and other mourners, is carried to a hearse after her funeral at Chabad of the Rivertowns in Dobbs Ferry, New York on Friday . Her family said on Thursday that they were devastated. 'She was a warm, vivacious and dynamic presence in our lives, and the most loving and nurturing mother, wife, daughter and sister,' a statement read. The private funeral of Eric Vandercar, another victim of the train crash, was taking place on Friday afternoon in Mount Kisco, New York. His devastated wife and young children thanked those who had shown them support following the tragic loss of the 53-year-old. Passengers on the train which plowed into the SUV - in the worst tragedy on the network in more than 30 years -  returned to the busy commuter service feeling 'lucky and scared' on Thursday. According to investigators' preliminary findings, Mrs Brody's car was in the danger zone inside railroad crossing gates for about half a minute before the train hit. Mrs Brody got ahead of the crossing gate in inching traffic, then got out of her car to examine it after the gate came down and hit the back of it, a witness has said. But then she got back in, seeming unhurried, and advanced onto the track, the witness told news outlets and investigators. The train's engineer also told investigators that he saw the Mercedes SUV moving onto the tracks. Mrs Brody's friends rushed to her rushed to her defense saying that she was a careful driver who would not have taken any risks. A flower arrangement arrives for the funeral of Mrs Brody, who leaves a husband and three daughters . Mourners carry the mother-of-three's casket out of the synagogue on Friday morning following her funeral . Data recorders also show the Metro-North Railroad train's engineer hit the emergency brakes and sounded the horn as the train bore down on the Valhalla crossing, traveling 58 mph in a 60 mph zone, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Thursday. Flashing warning lights at the crossing illuminated 39 seconds before the crash, and the gates came down a few seconds later, Mr Sumwalt said. That would leave about 30 seconds that the SUV was inside the gates. Investigators haven't found any problems with the warning signals or the nearby traffic lights, which are synchronised to let drivers clear the crossing when a train is coming, Mr Sumwalt said. The crossing also had painted warnings on its pavement, and a sign 65 feet from the rail warns drivers not to stop on the tracks, he noted. The agency hasn't mapped out how far before the crossing the engineer hit the emergency brakes on the train, which takes about 950 feet and 30 seconds to stop, Sumwalt said. After the impact, flames enveloped the SUV and part of the train, and the electrified third rail pierced them. Hundreds of passengers scrambled through spreading smoke and fear, some helping each other to escape despite their own injuries. Trains hit cars on the tracks many times a year, but such crashes rarely kill train riders. Investigators have emphasized that they want to figure out why this one did, becoming the deadliest accident in the 32-year history of one of the nation's busiest commuter railroads. Investigators are looking for any elements that may have intensified the fire, which they believe was ignited by the SUV's gas tank. The NTSB has been examining such factors as the adequacy of emergency exits, the  train cars and the unusual design of the Metro-North line's third rail. The agency also is looking into how familiar Brody was with her car and her route, whether she was using a cellphone and whether the backed-up traffic played a role.","Ellen Brody, a mother-of-three was killed along with five rail passengers on Tuesday in the horrific crash in Valhalla, New York .

A 23-year-old Brazilian man travelling with him was also allegedly found to be carrying the drug. Two Brazilian men have been charged with drug smuggling at Brisbane Airport after being arrested on Wednesday . They had been selected by the Border Protection officers for a baggage examination after arriving from Auckland, according to customs. 'During the examination, officers noticed an abnormal bulge located in the vicinity of the 26-year-old’s groin and a frisk search was conducted, which allegedly revealed a concealment of cocaine,' Customs said in a statement. Acting Regional Commander Queensland John Ikin said Customs and Border Protection is committed to preventing illegal drugs from entering Australia. 'Our officers are specialists at detecting drug concealments,' Mr Ikin said. 'If people think they can smuggle illegal substances into Australia past Customs and Border Protection they are sorely mistaken. Almost five kilograms of cocaine were allegedly found to have been stuffed down a 26-year-old Brazilian man's pants during a frisk search . 'Importers of illicit drugs can face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 'Smuggling drugs is simply not worth the risk.' Both men were referred to the Australian Federal Police and faced the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday, according to The Courier Mail. They will remain in custody until the matter is resumed on March 19.

"The men and women who lost their life in the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood will be awarded Purple Hearts. Major Nidal Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, opened fire on November 5, 2009, killing 13 men and women at the military post in Killeen, Texas, injuring 30 others before he was taken down after being shot himself. Now, due to an amendment to the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that expands the eligibility for the honor, those military members who were killed will receive the Purple Heart while the civilian victims will receive the Defense of Freedom Medal.

Major Nidal Hasan (above) opened fire on November 5, 2009, killing 13 men and women at the military post . This also comes almost one year after FBI Director James Comey testified that he believed the attack was motivated by al-Qaeda. Comey also stated that he believed Hasan was inspired by Al Qaeda to conduct that attack. Prior to the event being considered a terrorist attack, the victims were not eligible for these honors, and their families could not receive the same benefits and payments given to those whose family members die in the line of duty. The new amendment tio the NDAA make the Purple Heart available to  those who die in an attack where 'the individual or entity was in communication with the foreign terrorist organization before the attack,' and where 'the attack was inspired or motivated by the foreign terrorist organization.' The amendment was sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz who, according to CNN, said last December; 'It's long past time to call the Fort Hood attack what it was: radical Islamic terrorism.' He then added; 'And, this recognition for Fort Hood terrorist victims is overdue. The victims and their families deserve our prayers and support, and this legislation rightly honors them for defending our nation in the face of a heinous act of terror.' FBI Director James Comey (above) testified that he believed the attack was motivated by al-Qaeda last May . It is now known that prior to the attack, Hasan had exchanged emails with  Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda spokesman. Al-Awlaki praised Hasan's actions after the shooting, writing; 'Nidal Hassan is a hero. He is a man of conscience who could not bear living the contradiction of being a Muslim and serving in an army that is fighting against his own people. ... The U.S. is leading the war against terrorism which in reality is a war against Islam.' Hasan was convicted by a military judge in 2013 in the killings, and he recommended the death penalty.","The men and women who lost their life in the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood will be awarded Purple Hearts .

"Parents in the United States should vaccinate their children to prevent the further spread of measles, a leading autism research group has said. In a statement, Autism Speaks said scientific and medical research had repeatedly confirmed that there was no link between vaccinations and autism, despite previous speculation. The advice comes during an unfolding measles outbreak in the United States, which has so far infected more than one hundred people across 14 different states in the country. Scroll down for video . Recommended: A doctor in Miami administers the measles vaccine to a four-year-old girl. Parents have been reluctant to vaccinate their children due to rumors of a link between vaccinations and autism . Rob Ring, the group's chief science officer, told America's ABC News: 'Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. 'The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.' Authorities say unvaccinated children are putting the whole population at risk and leading to the reemergence of the disease. The outbreak renewed a debate over the so-called anti-vaccination movement in which fears about potential side effects of vaccines - fueled by  research since proved false that suggested a link to autism - have led a minority of parents to not have their children innoculated. Dose: A vial of the measles-mumps-rubella virus vaccine, which is being distributed around the US to prevent further spread of the disease . Measles vaccines were first introduced in 1963 and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention declared the disease eradicated from the country in 2000. But last year, the United States had 644 cases registered in 27 states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can be fatal in some cases. It is is one of the most infectious diseases known, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has described it as the 'most deadly of all childhood rash/fever ilnesses'. The myth about vaccines and autism began in a now debunked study from 1998, authored by Andrew Wakefield published in the Lancet medical journal . The Lancet later retracted the publication of the study, conceding that it was 'utterly false'. It was later revealed that Mr Wakefield stood to gain financially from the study because he was involved in a lawsuit against the makers of the vaccine at the time of its publication, the Lancet said in an editorial at the time. Mr Wakefield subsequently lost his medical licence over the issue. Another study which also claimed to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was retracted this summer in the US after concerns over 'possible undeclared competing interests' of its author. The outbreak sweeping across the US is believed to be linked to Disneyland, where at least 40 people contracted the highly contagious virus last December after coming into contact with someone who had the virus. The debate over whether vaccines work has also become a political issue in the race for the White House after potential Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie made an off-the-cuff rematk supporting 'a measure of choice' as to whether parents immunise their children. That led to Hillary Clinton, possible Democrat nomination, to post a pro-vaccine comment on Twitter that read: 'The science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids.'","Autism Speaks group again deny claims that vaccines can cause condition .

"Bill Bratton called for the state to change resisting arrest to a felony charge; he is pictured above speaking at a police foundation about 'the state of the NYPD' event last week . New York should change resisting arrest to a felony charge so criminals who do so face harsher penalties, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said today. Increasing the punishment for the crime that can lead to 'potential injuries to the officer', was one of several recommendations Mr Bratton made to a joint hearing of four State Senate Committees. Resisting arrest is currently a misdemeanor carrying a maximum punishment of one year. Mr Bratton argued that wasn't a significant enough penalty to deter the 2,000 criminals that resist arrest each year. 'I think a felony would be very helpful in terms of raising the bar significantly in the penalty for the resistance of arrest,' Mr Bratton told the Observer. He said when criminals resisted arrest it could lead to both police and civilians getting injured. 'We need to get around this idea that you can resist arrest. You can't. You just can't do it. It results in potential injuries to the officer, to the suspect. And we need to change that, and the way to change that is to start penalties for it.' In pushing for the change, Mr Bratton acknowledged that the charge was sometimes misused, saying 'the vast majority might end up being dismissed'. Advocates say the charge is often the only one someone is facing, regardless of whether they actually resisted arrest, because other charges have been dismissed or dropped. But the commissioner said part of the push was also to get district attorneys to treat the charge 'more seriously'. He said the charge would be better tracked to see how often it was being dropped. About 2,000 criminals a year resist arrest which Mr Bratton said led to both officers and civilians being injured . Mr Bratton also called for harsher penalties for fatally assaulting an officer, school safety agent or auxiliary officer. Improved safety measures called for by the commissioner included bulletproof glass for police cars, stiffer penalties for publicizing an officer's personal details and tighter controls around motorists tinting their windows.","About 2,000 criminals are charged each year with resisting arrest .

"The Islamic State militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria, a human rights monitoring group has claimed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict, said reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe, which is from Deir al-Zor province. The conflict between Islamic State and the al-Sheitaat tribe, who number about 70,000, flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. 'Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat,' Observatory director Rami Abdelrahman said by telephone from Britain. 'Some were arrested, judged and killed.' Scroll down for video . This file picture allegedly shows militants of the Islamic State  executing dozens of captured Iraqi security forces members at an unknown location in the Salaheddin province . The reports from Syria cannot be independently verified   due to security conditions and reporting restrictions. Proclaiming a 'caliphate' straddling parts of Iraq and Syria, Islamic State has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks, pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims, Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes, prompting the first U.S. air strikes in Iraq since the withdrawal of American troops in 2011. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in Syria, of which they now control roughly a third, mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zor who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij, one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland, when Islamic State stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zor said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. 'Those who were executed during the storming of the al-Sheitaat area are around 300. The rest were killed in the course of the battles,' he told Reuters on condition of anonymity to protect his identity.

Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq, he said. More than 170,000 people have been killed in Syria's civil war, which pits overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, a member of the Shi'ite-derived Alawite minority, backed by Shi'ite militias from Iraq and Lebanon. The insurgency is split between competing factions in Syria, with Islamic State emerging as the most powerful. Tribal powers in Syria and Iraq have had to make the choice between fighting Islamic State or pledging allegiance. On Friday, a video posted on YouTube showed men who said they were from the al-Sheitaat towns of Kishkeih and Abu Hammam pledging full support for Islamic State. 'We say that what Islamic State stands for is justice,' a tribal member sitting in a room with dozens of other men said in a statement that was read out. The head of the al-Sheitaat tribe, Sheikh Rafaa Aakla al-Raju, called in a video message for other tribes to join them in the fight against the militants. 'We appeal to the other tribes to stand by us because it will be their turn next ... If (Islamic State) are done with us the other tribes will be targeted after al-Sheitaat. They are the next target,' he said in the video, posted on YouTube. Islamic State was condemned on Friday in a U.N.

"A housekeeper who conned John Lewis out of more than £30,000 by claiming refunds for items of clothing she had shoplifted has been jailed for 19 months. Laima Butke, 55, visited branches of the department store all over the UK over a period of more than 18 months, stealing a total of £32,254. During sentencing, the judge described her as 'thoroughly dishonest' to take money from the 'national institution'. Butke, 55, visited branches of John Lewis all over the UK over a period of 20 months, stealing £32,254 . Explaining how she obtained the money, prosecutor Charles Falk told Aylesbury Crown Court: 'This is quite a clever fraud. 'The technique is this: she goes into John Lewis, purchases some goods. 'She then returns to the store the next day claiming not to have been given a receipt and obtains a refund on the grounds that her daughter didn't want them because they were the wrong size or something.' The next phase of the scam saw Butke visit another John Lewis branch. Mr Falk said: 'She takes the refund she did get and shoplifts the same items on the receipt and gets another refund using that receipt.' The court heard Butke's activities were carried out in 'chunks' between May 2013 and December last year. She visited branches of the department store in London, Cambridge, Southampton, Leicester, High Wycombe and Kingston Upon Thames. In the space of just a few weeks at the end of last year she pocketed almost £6,000 by using the tactics on eight occasions. The fraud was detected by John Lewis investigators who noticed unusual activity on credit cards registered to Butke and she was finally arrested in December. Butke visited John Lewis stores, including the shop in Cambridge (pictured) and stole more than £30,000 . She also stole money from the John Lewis in High Wycombe - and has now been jailed for 19 months . She pleaded guilty to nine counts of fraud by false representation at a previous hearing. Sentencing her, Judge Francis Sheridan said: 'You are thoroughly dishonest. It hurts decent companies. They (John Lewis) are a decent company. Some might think they are a national institution.' Butke, a housekeeper originally from Lithuania, claims that in fact she carried out the fraud by buying items reduced in the sale and claiming refunds at the full price. But the judge said:' Your barrister mitigates that this was not sophisticated. If it's not sophisticated then it's more devious.' Butke's barrister Lee Harris said she had not lived a 'lavish' lifestyle as a result of her actions, sending money back to Lithuania to her daughter and sick mother. Butke, of no fixed abode, appeared from prison via video link and wept as she was sentenced. Butke would mainly use items of clothes to carry out the scam, the court heard, pocketing refunds of several hundred pounds each time.","Laima Butke, 55, visited John Lewis stores over UK over 20 month period .

Each destination's score is based on over 140 million hotel reviews and aggregated ratings. With all that considered, it was the Chinese city that received top honours as having the most liked hotels in the world. Sanya boasts many high-rise resort hotels and offers very good value for money per night . 1. Sanya (China) - Index: 86.95% - Average hotel price per night: £86 . 2.

The city on Hainan Island has become a popular tourist destination in recent years, due to its tropical climate. The destination contains a large number of high-rise resort hotels, often praised for their value, excellent facilities, friendly service and beautiful location. The value for money consideration seems to be a common factor among the top 10 destinations, with eight boasting an average price per night of less than £100. The Vietnamese city averages a hotel price of £39 per night, while offering stunning views of the river . Hanoi, which comes in second, for example, has an average hotel price per night of just £39.

"This is the dramatic moment a captive golden eagle was knocked out of the skies after straying into the airspace of its wild cousins in Scotland. The 15-year-old trained raptor was hunting in the Grampian mountains with its owner when a pair of wild golden eagles pounced. The aerial battle erupted at 1,500ft and ended with the trained golden eagle crash-landing in the snow. Attack: This is the dramatic moment a captive golden eagle (bottom) was attacked by a wild female in the Grampian mountains in Scotland. A wild male had already just pounced . Owner Barry Blyther was forced to intervene to rescue his golden eagle from the talons and beaks of the wild pair. The trained bird, a female weighing 4.5kgs and with a wingspan of 2.1m, escaped unhurt. She managed to fend off an attack by the wild male  but was no match for the female of the pair. Barry, who owns Elite Falconry in Cluny, Fife, said the experience was 'terrifying'. He said: 'I've owned this bird from when she was just a chick and she's been with us for 15 years.

Sent spinning: The wild female dives into the smaller trained male, who is sent tumbling through the air . Moves in for second attack: As the 4.5kg captive bird struggles to regain its composure, the wild golden eagle prepares to launch another assault .

'Luckily, she seemed absolutely fine and after about 20 minutes she was up and hunting again.' There are over 400 pairs of wild golden eagles in Scotland, and their territory can range in size from three to 100 square miles. Adults will aggressively defend their territory and ward off any rival birds who come near. The male will usually begin the attack, and if he is unsuccessful then the female will intervene. Hot pursuit: The captive bird, who had already managed to fend off a wild male, is struggling to cope with the wild female's relentless chase . Crash-landing: Much to the dismay of owner Barry Blyther, his trained eagle hits the snow at speed in its desperate attempt to escape .

The tweet, which was deleted shortly after being posted this afternoon, read: 'South Yorkshire police says PC Hassan Ali who was under investigation in relation to child abuse in Rotherham has died in a car crash KARMA!'. PC Ali, 44, was under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) after it was alleged he twice asked a victim out on a date. Four complaints in total were made against the officer South Yorkshire Police by two members of the public. But PC Ali was fatally injured after being struck by a car in Darnall, Sheffield at around 10.15pm last Wednesday. He died with his family at his bedside yesterday morning. Ukip blamed volunteers running the page for the tweet. A spokesman said: 'The UKIP Plymouth account is run by a team of volunteers, and it seems the tweet was made by one of them without permission. 'Once it was tweeted it was deleted almost immediately. The content of the tweet does not reflect the views of the branch, its candidates or indeed the wider party. The matter is being investigated.' PC Ali was a neighbourhood policing officer based in Rotherham and had been placed on 'restricted duties', while the IPCC assessed whether to launch a full investigation into him.

Death: PC Ali was fatally injured after being struck by a car in Darnall, Sheffield, last week . One of the complainants, who is now an adult, said PC Ali had first asked her out when she was 17 and then did so again four years later when she was 21. The woman said the officer had been involved with her case and was aware she had been a victim of sustained abuse between the ages of 14 and 17. At the time he first asked her on a date, she had a one-year-old son, who had been born after she was made pregnant by her abuser when she was 15. The woman said the officer's behaviour had been 'inappropriate and totally unprofessional'. The nature of the other complaints made against him are not known.

"Irate parents have confronted Myleene Klass in the playground at her daughter's private school after she mocked them online in a  row over donations towards birthday gifts. The DJ and musician was harangued by other middle-class mothers on the school run who accused her 'betraying' them by leaking private emails online. Miss Klass, 36, had revealed a parent had asked  others to donate a 'suggested £10' to buy their children birthday gifts, including a Kindle, and leave the cash in the child's school bag. But when she arrived to pick up  daughter Ava, seven, from her school in north London yesterday  afternoon the broadcaster was berated by mothers who said her criticism was a 'cheap-shot'. Scroll down for video . Joke: Myleene Klass, left  today, and right with her childre, mocked parents at her daughter's school for soliciting donations towards children's birthday presents - but has been berated by other parents . A fellow parent, whose daughter was the subject of the email, called across the playground to her: 'Why did you do it, Myleene? Why?' Miss Klass then shouted back: 'If you've got a problem with it, talk to me in private.' Other furious parents have written and emailed the headteacher of the £5,000-a-term school accusing her of using the personal emails of fellow parents to get press attention. 'It was a very distasteful and cheap shot,' wrote one. One furious mother, who asked not to be named, said: 'She has betrayed our confidences and belittled us so publicly. Lots of people have complained.' Another said: 'It is so out of order. She isn't going to have any friends left.' Another defended the present arrangement saying: 'It is to make it easier for parents so they don't buy expensive presents that nobody wants. 'There is no obligation. Myleene has misunderstood the school's community spirit.' Many are baffled why the star would tweet the emails over a year after they were sent. One said: 'It is bang out of order. These are old class emails from a year ago.' The emails posted by Miss Klass did not have dates on them but stated the party is due to take place on February 9th. Last night several parents claimed they were a year old. Today Miss Klass did not drop her daughter at school. Mockery: Ms Klass posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response . Problems began after 36-year-old Miss Klass, the former pop star turned Classic FM presenter, posted on social media two emails she had received 'from some school mums', after first changing the names. Gift-giving has become a big business in many top private schools as parents vie to curry favour with teachers. Tatler magazine reported last year that some teachers had been given presents as lavish as £1,000 handbags, diamond necklaces and cases of vintage wine. At one school, parents even offered teachers the chance to use their private jet. A mother at a London prep school said that she was emotionally blackmailed into donating £90 - the minimum amount acceptable - to a fund for teachers' gifts. Some schools have had to introduce new rules capping the value of presents teachers can accept - at Stowe, for example, staff must declare any gifts above £50 . The first email read: 'Jane and Hannah would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year. Sarah would like a Kindle and Lola a desk (very studious choices!) so if you would like to join in, please can I collect a suggested £10 from you before the party on February 9. 'If you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [sic] school bag, marked for Jane/me that works too. I will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party. Thanx [sic] and no obligation of course.' A second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £10 would be a 'popular amount' to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £200 – but adds: 'Feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift.' Shortly after, Miss Klass published her stinging reply in which she said she was collecting 'unicorn money' towards a 'real, live unicorn' for Ava. Warming to her theme, she added: 'I'd like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too.' And making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners, she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com. Mother: Ms Klass was making fun of parents whose children attend the same school as her daughter Ava . Miss Klass, who lives in North London, entitled her reply 'Let's put the fun back into Bdays!' and shared it with her 459,200 followers on Twitter and 75,000 on Instagram. Hours later, she was confronted in the playground as she picked up Ava from her school. On parenting website Mumsnet, opinion was divided. One wrote: 'Well good on her for shaming these grabby idiots. It's crass and rude to ask for money instead of a gift.' Another posted: 'One of the mums asked to do this at our school! I think it's so rude!' But others sided with the parents asking for money. One wrote: 'What's wrong with asking for contributions towards a larger present?

"Men who claim to like eating extremely hot chillis are only doing it to prove their masculinity, according to a new study. Food scientists found that while women appear to eat chilli for the sensation of the burn in their mouth, men are seeking a 'social reward'. This comes from the macho cultural associations that accompany being able to withstand the fire of the hottest chilli peppers. The findings follow another recent study that found men who eat the spiciest foods tend to have higher levels of testosterone. It suggests that men may be using the spiciness of food as a way of asserting their dominance over the competition. The heat of chilli peppers is commonly measured using the Scoville heat unit scale. This is a measure of how much chilli extract can be diluted in sugar syrup before it becomes undetectable to tasters. Pure capsaicin, the chemical in chilli peppers that gives them their heat, measures at 16 million SHU. Some scientists are investigating whether this chemical can be used to help people in chronic pain due to the way it binds to nerve cells. The world's hottest chilli is the Carolina Reaper, which is rated at 2.2 million SHU, according to the Guinness Book of Records. Some of those who have tried it report taking up to 14 hours to recover from its devastating heat. The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion is rated at 2 million SHU while the Bhut Jolokia is rated at 1.58 million SHU. The new study also suggests that many men actually do not enjoy the stinging sensation that accompany's spicy food, while women do. Nadia Byrnes, a sensory evaluation scientists at Pennsylvania State University and lead author of the latest study, said: 'Interestingly, the relationships between perceived burning/stinging, yearly intake of chilli-containing foods, the liking of spicy foods, and personality, were markedly different between men and women. 'Overall, men showed stronger negative correlations between perceived burning/stinging intensity and liking of spicy foods, suggesting that burning/stinging is more of a deterrent in men. 'In women, stronger positive relationships were noted between liking of spicy foods and yearly intake of chili-containing foods.' In the study, which is published in the journal Food Quality and Preference, the researchers asked participants to rate a number of foods on a scale to assess their preference for spiciness. They were then given a number of liquid samples containing either sugar, quinine, salt or capsaicin, the chemical that gives chillis their heat. They were asked to rate the sensation they experienced upon swirling these in their mouths and the results were compared to a personality test to see whether they had sensation seeking or reward seeking personalities. Women who tended to prefer the spicier foods tended to be interested in sensations while the men who preferred hotter foods tended to be those that were more reward orientated. Physiologists at the University of Grenoble, in France, have found that men with a taste for spicy foods tend to have higher levels of the hormone testosterone. The researchers tested 114 men between the ages of 18 and 44 from from Grenoble after advertising for participants to take part in food tasting panel for a food research company. They were asked to indicate their preferences regarding spicy food and had the levels of testosterone in their saliva measured. They were then asked to season a sample of mashed potatoes with Tabasco hot pepper sauce and salt before then evaluate the spiciness of the meal. The researchers found that those with higher levels of testosterone tended to put more chili sauce on their potato while there did not seem to be any correlation with salt. The scientists said it could be that the higher levels of testosterone are leading men to seek thrills and take risks by eating hotter food. Testosterone is known to make men more adventurous, aggressive and sexually active. Those with the highest levels tend to be more dominant, or the alpha male, of a group. The researchers believe that by eating hot curries, men may also be boosting their hormone levels as chili peppers have been shown to increase testosterone levels in rats. Capsaicin, responsible for giving chilli peppers their heat, is highly concentrated in chilli powder (above) The new study found that men and women eat spicy foods like the curry above for very different reasons . It suggests that men are merely attempting to show off when eating chillis while women may actually be enjoying the experience of the heat they produce. The chemical in chilli peppers that creates heat is called capsaicin and binds with the pain receptor to produce the characteristic burning sensation. This is known to cause physiological changes in the body, raising the heart rate, increasing perspiration and releasing endorphins and adrenalin. It is this that produces the uncontrollable sweating  that can sometimes accompany eating really hot food but some research has also shown it can trigger the release of hormones involved in happiness. Miss Byrnes said: 'It is possible that the cultural association of consuming spicy foods with strength and machismo has created a learned social reward for men. 'Conversely, for women these social forces are not present, and thus intrinsic factors remain as the primary motivation for consuming spicy foods.'","Researchers at Penn State University found differences in the personalities of men and women who like to eat spicy foods containing hot chilli peppers .
Women who liked chillis seemed to be seeking the enjoyment of the burn .
Men who liked chilli peppers had personalities that sought social rewards .
Scientists say these men may be driven by macho cultural associations ."
"A widow who faked her husband's will to cut his daughters out of their share of his £1million estate has been jailed for 21 months - despite falling pregnant at the age of 47. Legal secretary Dawn Smith drew up the bogus document in her office two years before the death of her wealthy 61-year-old husband, Harvey. In her phony document, she made her and her son sole beneficiaries of the fortune - leaving her late husband's two daughters distraught and confused as to why they had been cut out. Jailed: Pregnant widow Dawn Smith was sentenced to 21 months behind bars for faking her husband's will to cut his daughters out of his £1million estate . She has since married again - to a waiter in the Turkish resort of Marmaris - and is now working as a bailiff for a debt company. Smith has left debts against her late husband's name by not settling the £3,600 bill for his funeral, police revealed. She also sold family heirlooms destined for Mr Smith's daughters to fund her trips to Turkey. It emerged she has visited Turkey almost once a month between the death of Mr Smith and her first court appearance in February. At Teeside Crown Court, Judge John Walford told Smith, of Carmel Road North, Darlington, a suspended sentence was not suitable. He said: 'If I had only you and your unborn child to consider, I might have been able to consider that option, but in my judgement to do anything other than pass an immediate custodial sentence would be an affront to your step-daughters who you so cruelly deceived by your actions.' Smith admitted drawing up the false will before his death, forging his signature and those of witnesses. She falsely swore an oath that the document was legal. Judge Walford sentenced her to 21 months, saying: 'I am conscious this will be your first custodial sentence and I cannot ignore the fact that you are pregnant but there will be a sentence of some length to mark the seriousness of this offending.' Forgery: Dawn Smith, left, drew up the bogus document two years before the death of her wealthy 61-year-old husband, Harvey (right) in 2012. She claimed that he wanted her and her son to be given his £1million fortune . Earlier in the sentencing exercise, he questioned the timing of her falling pregnant. It was understood she was 18 weeks pregnant, dating back to her last visit to Turkey, a source said. The judge said: 'There must be a suspicion, to put it no higher, that she has deliberately become pregnant in order to gain an advantage in the sentencing process.' Caroline Goodwin, defending, told him: 'It came as a complete and utter shock to her.' She also read out her client's statement of apology telling the court: 'I can never undo the wrong and how do I say I am sorry when words alone are not enough?' It is understood that her unborn baby is fathered by her new husband, a Turkish waiter, who was not present in court. Miss Goodwin said the pregnancy was also a surprise to her partner. The court heard how Mr Smith's family found it very hard to accept that his widow had remarried so soon after his death. Describing the full ordeal, Mr Smith's daughter Karen Harwood, 43, said: 'I've not even grieved for his death yet as this has been so upsetting. 'It is hard not knowing what my dad's final wishes were. She took that away.' In a victim impact statement read out in open court, she added: 'After dad died, I welcomed Dawn Smith into our family and took her to see my daughter Alice in a play, four days before she was arrested. Cut out: The daughters of Harvey Smith, Karen Harwood (left) and Zoe Traherne, read a statement outside court today speaking about their horrendous ordeal . 'Because of her actions, it made me think, what have I done to make Dad think this of me? 'It made me think why my dad would turn his back on his daughter and his grandchildren for a woman he had known less than a quarter of my life.' Miss Harwood also spoke of how the family had spent £20,000 in court costs trying to contest the will and to clear Mr Smith's name of debt. Astonishingly, as Mr Smith's spouse, she is still entitled to his £490,000 pension, despite her deceit. Her father Harvey Smith, who owned an engineering firm, was given an MBE for services to industry in 1986. Smith faked the signatures of her husband, another legal secretary and a solicitor on the bogus document she drew up in 2010. After his death in November 2012, she told his family she didn't believe he had a last will and testament. But she later produced the paperwork - back-dated to February 2011 - which left their £500,000 house in Darlington and £420,000 pension to her. It excluded Karen and included explicit instructions that her sister Zoe, 25, should not receive anything at all. Her deception was uncovered when a partner at the Darlington law firm of Hewitts, where Smith had worked, thought it suspicious the women were overlooked while Dawn Smith's son was included. Moving on: Smith has since remarried to a Turkish waiter, pictured together, who works in the resort of Marmaris. She sold her late husband's family heirlooms in order to pay for trips to Turkey after his death . The lawyer - a personal friend of Mr Smith - raised concerns and staff spotted basic errors. One of the supposed witnesses had left the firm at the time they were said to have signed it, and the other had changed offices. Police were alerted and a handwriting expert concluded that Mr Smith's signature was not the same as legitimate ones provided by detectives.","Dawn Smith forged her husband Harvey's will two years before his death .

"A phone call from Julie Bishop to Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week ahead of his address at the National Press Club set in motion the breakdown of their relationship, it has been revealed. After returning from Afghanistan last week Ms Bishop called Mr Abbott of assure him of her support, and offered assistance on putting together his crucial address amid rumors of turmoil within the Liberal party, Fairfax reported. But the prime minister was said to be suspicious of her motives, and tense and angry conversation followed creating a rift between the two. Mr Abbott rejected the help of his deputy. These revelations come as it was revealed Ms Bishop would not stand on a ticket with Mr Abbott, despite his claims that the two would 'stand together to defeat the motion', according to Fairfax. Scroll down for video . A phone call between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Julie Bishop is said to have spelled the end of their relationship . Ms Bishop allegedly rang Mr Abbott to assure him she wasn't vying for his spot and to offer help ahead of his address at the National Press Club . Despite this Mr Abbott said on Friday he and his deputy Julie Bishop will fight to hold their positions, apparently without the approval of Ms Bishop . On Friday her loyalty came under question again after she released a weak statement where she appeared to be keeping her options open. In a fiery address, a clearly angered Mr Abbott said: 'We are not the Labor Party. We are not going to repeat the chaos and instability of the Labor years. 'I have spoken to deputy leader Julie Bishop and we will stand together to urge the party room to defeat this particular motion.' But Ms Bishop, who did not appear with Mr Abbott, would only issue a short and very qualified statement of support. 'I agreed with the Prime Minister that due to cabinet solidarity and my position as Deputy Leader there should be support for current leadership in spill motion,' she said. Mr Abbott appeared decidedly happier visiting a factory on Friday morning . Motion: Luke Simpkins, pictured with potential leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull, has announced he will move for a federal Liberal leadership spill . Text: This is the full email Luke Simpkins sent to all of his parliamentary colleagues . Ms Bishop's support could be pivotal to the Liberal leadership. Scott Morrison has ruled himself out of the top job but Malcolm Turnbull has not. Mr Abbott said the MPs who called for the spill - Mr Simpkins and fellow backbencher Don Randall - were perfectly entitled to call for a challenge. However, he said: 'They are asking the Party Room to vote out the people that the electorate voted in in September 2013.' Mr Simpkins, a little-known West Australian MP, announced he had moved a motion to topple the Prime Minister in an email to his Liberal colleagues earlier this afternoon. He said that the knighthood of Prince Philip, issued by Mr Abbott on Australia Day, was the final straw for him. In his email to his Liberal colleagues he wrote: 'The knighthood issue was for many the final proof of a disconnection with the people,' Simpkins wrote in the email. 'I think that we must bring this to a head, and test the support of the leadership in the party room. 'I have therefore submitted to the Chief Government Whip a motion to spill the leadership positions of the Federal Parliamentary Liberal party.' Chief Government Whip Phillip Ruddock said the matter had been listed for discussion for the Tuesday party room meeting. Trouble: Prime Minister Tony Abbott will reportedly face a leadership challenge on Tuesday in Canberra . Prime Minister Tony Abbott was taking a selfie with worker Emerson Smith during his visit the Timbermate factory in the Melbourne suburb of Mitcham on Friday while some MPs plotted a spill . Meanwhile, Tasmanian Liberal MP Andrew Nikolic has branded the move to challenge Mr Tony Abbott as disappointing and divisive. In an email to backbench colleague Mr Simpkins,  Mr Nikolic dismissed the move as the 'ill-disciplined and self-interested behaviours that the Australian people explicitly rejected in 2013'. The email was copied to other coalition MPs and senators. The note reportedly reads: 'Luke, Your actions are disappointing and divisive. 'In my view you are repeating the ill-disciplined and self-interested behaviours that the Australian people explicitly rejected in 2013. 'You do not have my support for this. 'I will be arguing strongly against your motion and in support of what I believe is a clear majority of colleagues and constituents who prefer stability and unity of purpose.' Big lift: Mr Abbott will face a leadership challenge at the Liberal Party room meeting on Tuesday . The leadership spill has been motioned ahead of the first major party room meeting of 2015 on Tuesday . It's the first Liberal leadership challenge since 2009. After the internal fallout from the-then Liberal Party and Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull’s support for the Rudd Government’s ETS plan in 2009 (which split the Coalition because of the National Party’s opposition to it) there was a three-way spill, involving Mr Turnbull, Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey. In the end, Abbott claiming the leadership by one vote over Turnbull, 42 votes to 41. No one has put up their hand to contest Mr Abbott, but Mr Turnbull would not rule out a challenge on Thursday evening. During in an appearance on the Today Show on Friday morning, Education Minister Christopher Pyne said he 'hoped' Mr Abbott would have the votes. He later put his comments down to a slip of the tongue because he was ‘tired’, during a second interview on Sky News once he had returned to his home city of Adelaide. Federal opposition leader Bill Shorten during a visit to Dolphins Long Day Care Centre in Brighton-Le-Sands, Sydney . Shorten spent part of today playing with children and at the day care centre amid . Pyne said: ‘I don’t know well there could a vote every Tuesday… I don’t know if there will be a vote on Tuesday.’ ‘My job is to find out what my colleagues are thinking… I’ve been talking to people, obviously there are some people who think there should be a vote,’ he added. ‘I can’t rule it out. I can tell you this though I will not be moving a vote on Tuesday in the party room.’ Probed by host Karl Stefanovic on whether the Prime Minister still has the numbers to retain leadership, Pyne said: ‘I assume the party room knows the worst thing we could possibly do is change the leadership now we have to support the Prime Minister. He later tried to clarify what he said. 'At the first available opportunity I've come straight to your studios from the airport, I am clearing up what I think is an unfortunate misinterpretation of remarks that I made this morning,' he said. 'Perhaps because I'm usually so ebullient, because it was six o'clock in the morning and I was tired rather than effusive and ebullient maybe people have misinterpreted my position,' he said. Senior Labor figure Anthony Albanese, who was also on the show, retorted: ‘When you start having senior people who can’t say that the Prime Minister has the numbers then it’s over.’ As politics remained focussed on the government’s leadership crisis, Labor Opposition Leader Bill Shorten spent part of today playing with children and toys at a day care centre in Sydney. Tony Abbott has reportedly been warned to dump his chief of staff Peta Credlin if he wants to salvage his position . Three Liberal Ministers reportedly confirmed the spill to Sky News journalist Kieran Gilbert . Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull was reportedly left 'underwhelmed' after a meeting with the PM .

"Bobbi Kristina could have been submerged for as long as 15 minutes before she was found face-down in a bathtub on Saturday, according to reports. The 21-year-old daughter of Whitney Houston remains in a coma in Emory University Hospital after she was found unconscious by her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home. 'It seems like it might've been 10 or 15 minutes that she must have been alone,' Lomas' attorney Ashleigh Merhant told E! News. 'But we don't know at what point she actually ended up in the tub during that time.' Tragic: Bobbi Kristina, pictured with her partner Nick Gordon, was found unconscious on Saturday morning . 'The odds are against her': Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on his Instagram page on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change' in her condition as he called for prayers . Lomas found Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said. She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update. 'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off. 'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said. It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn. Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter. 'This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,' he said in a statement on Thursday. Denial: Bobby Brown, pictured leaving Emory University Hospital on Thursday, has denied reports that the family is preparing for the worst. On Thursday, a police source said her life support had been removed . Staying positive: Brown, seen giving a 'thumbs up', has remained hopeful that his daughter will pull through . Support network: Bobby Brown, right, and his wife Alicia Etheredge, left, leave the hospital on Thursday . 'If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.' The last official word on Bobbi's condition from the family came on Tuesday when they said in a statement that she was 'fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family'. On Thursday, he briefly told Access Hollywood that his daughter was 'good'. He appeared tired and his eyes were red as if he had been crying, the program reported. 'We're praying,' he added. Bobbi's 'devastated' grandmother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, mother of Whitney, was also seen arriving at the hospital, according to Radar Online, having flown in from her New Jersey home. 'Cissy was so traumatized losing Whitney and the pain is still raw from that,' a source told the website. 'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.' Vigil: Gordon was pictured outside the North Fulton Hospital, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken, on Sunday . Scene: Bobbi Kristina was found in the bathtub at this townhouse in Roswell, Georgia on Saturday morning . Meanwhile, Houston's mentor Clive Davis says he's been in touch the family and is praying for Bobbi. Davis said he's offered his support and and 'they're so grateful.' 'Of course it's heartbreaking to see the family go through this pain once again,' Davis said at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where Houston died in 2012 and where he will hold a pre-Grammy gala Saturday. 'They just ask that the public respect their privacy.' Houston died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned. Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning. Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. Police said she was found by her purported husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend, Max Lomas. Lomas' lawyer has since said he was the one who found Bobbi Kristina and started CPR. Missed: Bobbi's mother Whitney Houston, pictured together in 2007, died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances . Bobby Brown spoke out earlier this week to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon. Bobbi Kristina and Gordon were brought up like brother and sister after Houston took Gordon in when he was 12. But following her death, the duo announced they were in a relationship. Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media. But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.' 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC. Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.","An attorney for the friend who found Bobbi Kristina on Saturday says she had been on her own for 15 minutes before he checked on her .

"An 18-year-old Good Samaritan has told how a man he tried to help beat him so savagely his own mother thought he was dead. Angus Gallacher had 13 skull fractures, three broken fingers, fractured ribs and eardrum damage and needed a titanium plate behind his right eye after the  assault by 25-year-old Brian Ramsay. His family reacted with fury today as Ramsay, who dragged the teenager to his house to continue his attack, was jailed for 18 months - and he could be free in just six. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Injuries: Good Samaritan Angus Gallacher (left) had 13 skull fractures, three broken fingers, fractured ribs and eardrum damage and needed a titanium plate behind his eye after an assault by Brian Ramsay (right) Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard the teenager, who restores classic cars for a living, was unable to work for three months and is now afraid to leave his home in Newtongrange, Midlothian. He was walking home from a night out with friends in nearby Gorebridge in October when he discovered  Ramsay lying on his back in a petrol station forecourt. The young mechanic helped him to his feet, took him to a shop to get some food and then helped him across the road - but then Ramsay unexpectedly turned on him. He subjected Angus to a brutal and sustained assault in the street before dragging him to a nearby house where he attacked him again. Appalling: A selfie which the teenager took to show the damage immediately after the beating . Shocked neighbours heard the attack and called police, who found the  teenager lying unconscious in the street. 'He just turned on me,' said Mr Gallacher. 'My mind went a bit blank and all I thought was ""I should protect myself as much as I can"". 'He must have realised what he had done because he dragged me to his house to get me cleaned up. Then he hit me again in the garden and I have no recollection after that.' The teenager spent a week in hospital, where doctors discovered he had suffered such bad damage to his right eye that he had to have a titanium plate implanted behind his eyebrow. The youngest of three boys, he woke up in a hospital bed disorientated and disfigured. 'I was really confused when I woke up,' he said. 'I couldn't open my eyes as they were swollen shut. 'It has changed everything. You get all paranoid. I try to avoid going out on my own at night now. It would definitely make me think twice about helping somebody now.' Mr Gallacher's family attacked Ramsay's sentence after he was jailed for 18 months yesterday after admitting assault causing severe injuries, permanent disfigurement and danger of life. Because the 25-year-old had already been in custody since October 27, he could be free in fewer than six months. Mr Gallacher's parents Amanda, 53, and Henry, 56, branded the sentence  'disgusting' and called for better treatment of victims. 'He just turned on me,' said Mr Gallacher, who spent a week in hospital (pictured). 'My mind went a bit blank and all I thought was ""I should protect myself as much as I can""... I have no recollection after that' Crime scene: The petrol station where the mechanic said he helped his attacker to his feet on a night out . Mrs Gallacher said: 'My husband and I are totally shocked and think it's disgusting. 'I don't know the definition of a long time but 18 months doesn't seem to be very long. It's not justice. He was only helping someone and this was his reward.' When police came to their door in the middle of the night, Mrs Gallacher said she thought her son was dead. She added: 'When we were taken to the resuscitation unit where Angus was, my husband couldn't walk through the door. 'He just gripped my arm and said 'My God, what have they done to my boy'. I couldn't recognise him. Afraid: The 18-year-old has been left nervous about leaving his home in Newtongrange, Midlothian . 'His head was about five times the size it should have been. He was covered in blood. 'The police photographer who came along said she had never seen such damage before in her life. 'That's why we are so upset with what we heard in court.' Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced this week that serious offenders will no longer be automatically released after two-thirds of their sentences, but the rules do not apply to shorter jail terms. Conservative councillor Cameron Rose, a former police officer, suggested prosecutors should appeal against the sentence for being too lenient. 'It's absolutely appalling', he told MailOnline. 'It adds to the feeling that justice hasn't been done, and we know that for the culprit 18 months doesn't mean 18 months. 'It's time for the Scottish government to bring transparency to the justice system to make a sentence mean what it says. 'The more I see of the detail of this case the more I think the Crown Office should be appealing the sentence.'","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Dressed as his namesake Rupert the Bear in a red jumper and yellow scarf, the dog sits with his favourite story book . 'It had been a few years since we had a puppy. I didn't put him straight in with the other whippets so I had a cardboard box at the side of my bed so I could comfort him during the night. 'Rupert had a habit of jumping up and putting his feet up to look at what I was doing. 'I just say 'hop' and he puts his feet up again. His facial expression looks like he is concentrating on the job, like he knows what he is doing. 'I had only took pictures of pets because my children had grown up. Rupert replaces the human in the pictures. He doesn't mind wearing the outfits because whippets wear little jackets in the winter. The magic comes from his expressions.' Mrs Burton, who captures the incredible photographs of her iPad, says Rupert loves taking part in the pictures.

The mother-of-two, who says her and husband Paul, 55, have always owned animals, said Rupert's pictures were so popular, he even had his own social media pages. She said: 'We just have fun with the pictures and they are a small snapshot of Rupert's day. 'I was receiving so many messages from people enjoying the photos so we created a Facebook page just for his own pictures.' Janet, a retired nurse, said the most touching compliment Rupert received was from across the pond when an American man told her the images had helped cheer up his mother who was having a bad day fighting her breast cancer.

Rupert has also starred in his own calendar which sold to fans in Hawaii, South Africa, Iceland, Australia and America. Janet, of Oaken, Staffordshire, said the pampered pooch still sleeps beside her bed and the last words he hears before drifting off to sleep are: 'Love you Rupert.'

"A man claims he has only 100 orgasms before he loses his ability to get an erection forever. The 34-year-old, known only as ‘RLS’, says doctors have diagnosed him with a rare condition which means each time he ejaculates, scar tissue will form in his penis. Eventually, the build up of scar tissue will mean he will no longer be able to achieve an erection, he says. He claims he has seen a range of doctors who are unable to explain the cause of his condition. A man claims doctors have said he only has 100 orgasms left before he loses his ability to get an erection forever. He apparently has a condition where hard scar tissue forms in his penis each time he is aroused, which will eventually make it impossible for his penis to become erect. Posed by model . They have called it ‘idiopathic fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa’ – which essentially means unexplained fibrous tissue - hard, scar tissue - forming in the penis. However, doctors have told MailOnline that while fibrosis – the build up of scar tissue – in the penis which leads to impotence is possible, it would be impossible to predict the exact number of orgasms a man would have before his penis ‘stopped working’. In a post on the website BroBible, RLS, who lives in the U.S., said he has now seen the ‘full battery of experts’ and specialists. He said: ‘Basically, there’s a reservoir in your penis that fills with blood when you have an erection. 'In my case, every time I get one, it causes an autoimmune reaction [where the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy tissue by mistake] which causes a scar tissue build-up in the reservoir. ‘Ultimately, the scar tissue will make it impossible to ever get [an erection] again.' He has apparently been told he is the first case anyone has ever seen - and has left doctors baffled. Fibrosis of the penis is a symptom of a rare condition called Peyronie’s disease, which usually affects men over 40 years old – although it can happen to men of any age. A thickened area or one or more hard lumps form in the shaft of the penis. As a result, it can become curved, and men can experience pain during an erection, or are sometimes unable to get one. Doctors do not exactly what causes Peyronie’s disease, but it has been linked to an injury or repeated blows to the penis, and is associated with low testosterone levels. But RLS says these explanations don’t apply to him. The man says he has not worn briefs or experienced an injury to his genitalia, so doctors are baffled as to what is causing the build up of scar tissue . He says he doesn’t wear briefs or use saunas, and has experienced no blunt force to his genitals - and so his case has baffled doctors. In his post, RLS says he has now accepted he will eventually lose his ability to get an erection, after trying every therapy possible. He said: ‘I’m 34 years old and I have a finite amount of real, working, orgasm-capable erections remaining. They estimate I have about a hundred nuts left.’ Despite trying every conceivable therapy and medication available, nothing works, he says. Therefore, he says he has been through the ‘five stages of grief’ and accepted he will be impotent in future. But while he is able to accept his fate, he says he still doesn’t know how to cope with it. He has to refrain from masturbation, and feels he needs to be selective with women. He said: ‘Lately, I’m terrified of sex itself. I slept with one woman since the diagnosis, but when she wanted to go for a second round, a wave of incredible panic swept over me. ‘I burst into a cold sweat and my chest felt like it was gonna cave in on itself. ‘Since then I’ve been chaste as a nun, but I toss and turn all night with crazy, disturbing sex dreams, and now I’m worried that I’ll lose a nut to a wet dream.’ He is now searching for others that might be suffering from the same condition, and wants to start a dialogue about how men can cope with the knowledge they might be impotent in the near future. But doctors contacted by MailOnline said they were sceptical about RLS’ diagnosis. Professor Raj Persad, a consultant urologist at Bristol Royal Infirmary, said he was not convinced. He told MailOnline: ‘“Idiopathic” means “unexplained”. There are conditions like fibrosis which makes blood flow to the penis impossible. ‘But there are lots of causes of fibrosis, such as trauma. ‘There would always be a cause of fibrosis in such a young man, and doctors should be able to find it. ‘It sounds like his problem is either psychogenic, or he’s suffering from Peyronie’s disease.’ Another urologist told MailOnline it would be ‘impossible’ to predict how many times a man with fibrosis could ejaculate before suffering erectile dysfunction. And Dr Ian Eardley, a consultant urologist at Leeds Teaching Hospital Trust and a spokesperson for The Urology Foundation, said RLS’ diagnosis sounded ‘implausible’. He told MailOnline: 'You can get fibrosis and scarring, usually caused by blood flow problems to the penis. ‘But it wouldn’t stop him ejaculating as that’s a different mechanism. ‘Blood flow isn’t related to usage – fibrosis wouldn’t be made worse by sex, in fact it might improve. ‘There is blood flow through the penis all the time. 'Therefore it's difficult to conceive why getting an erection would cause an autoimmune reaction to blood, when it’s flowing through the penis all the time. ‘Ejaculation and erection are two separate mechanisms. If you get fibrosis you may lose an erection. There are men with fibrosis who can climax and ejaculate but they can’t get an erection. ‘It’s possible he has Peyronie’s disease, but that’s normally in much older men and it’s very rare. 'However there is a theory that Peyronie’s disease has an autoimmune function.'","U.S. man, 34, known as RLS, says  his condition has baffled doctors .

"A mass brawl involving patients, visitors and doctors broke out in a Chinese hospital after a new mother was refused porridge. An hour after Jiang Li Feng, 25, had been given a Caesarean section, she complained that she was hungry. She told staff nurse Shi Ying, 27, to fetch her some porridge at the hospital in Dongning county, in north-eastern China's Heilongjiang province. But her hunger quickly turned to anger when the nurse explained that it would be dangerous for her to eat anything and she should drink some water instead. Scroll down for video .

"Dionne Warwick was hospitalized for 'almost two weeks after she slipped and fell in her shower.' The 74-year-old singer, who is the cousin of Whitney Houston and Bobbi Kristina Brown, had her own bathroom incident on January 24, exactly one week before 21-year-old Bobbi Kristina was found unresponsive in a bathtub. The five-time Grammy winner was released from a New Jersey hospital on Thursday following ankle surgery, according to a new report from TMZ. Scroll down for video . Another unfortunate incident: Dionne Warwick was taken to the hospital on January 24 after slipping and falling in her shower, according to TMZ (pictured in November 2014) Dionne 'was at her home in South Orange, New Jersey when she fell' and was 'taken by ambulance to a local hospital.' The gossip site noted an eerie coincidence: 'The 911 call for Dionne came in at 10.19am on Saturday, January 24. The 911 call for Bobbi Kristina came in exactly a week later at 10.25am on January 31.' On Friday, Dionne took to her Twitter account to thank fans for their continued support during the difficult time. 'On behalf of my family, I would like to thank you for all of your kind words. All in God's plan. - Dionne,' she wrote. Thanking her fans for all the support: 'On behalf of my family, I would like to thank you for all of your kind words.

Few details about Bobbi Kristina's condition have been released. Her family has said she was fighting for her life after being rushed to a hospital in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell on January 31. Police said they responded to Bobbi Kristina's home in reference to a drowning. Her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas found her unresponsive in the tub and performed CPR until help arrived, police said. Three generations: Whitney Houston and Bobbi Kristina Brown are cousins with the five-time Grammy winner (pictured at a 2011 pre-Grammy party in February 2011) Houston, a six-time Grammy Award winner and actress who battled substance abuse, drowned in a hotel bathtub three years ago in Beverly Hills, California, on Feb. 11, 2012. Authorities said cocaine use and heart disease contributed to her death at age 48. Her daughter is currently receiving treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, according to CNN and other media outlets. The hospital would not confirm she was a patient there, but the hospital in Roswell that initially provided treatment said she was no longer under its care. 'Though it seems the odds are against her, though doctors don't see any hope for change ... though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK,' Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram and Facebook on Thursday.

"Mr Justice Wood ruled that boy, two, should be allowed to stay close to his biological father as he is likely to struggle with his identity as he grows up . A woman trying to move to Hong Kong with her IVF son has been barred from taking the boy abroad so he can be close to his English father. The father, a dance instructor in his 40s, is the boy's only biological parent because the child was conceived using his sperm and an egg donated by another woman. The woman, a specialist asset manager in her 50s, had been trying to take the two-year-old to Hong Kong to find work, but the father objected. Giving his ruling today, Senior Family Division judge Mr. Justice Roderic Wood said the boy would likely start to grapple with his identity in the coming years, and needed his biological father around in order to help. The couple, who cannot be named for legal reasons, lived in London and first met in 2007 when she was married to somebody else. She got a divorce from her partner in 2009, and while the new couple never married, they decided to try for a child using IVF treatment. The baby boy was born in August 2012, but the pair split just a year later. She currently has custody of the child, while the father is able to visit. Mr Wood said when the boy became older he would need his father in case he struggled with the knowledge he is not related to his mother by blood. He added: 'It is a fact he will have to grapple with, probably in six or seven years time. He will at that point learn that his mother is not related to him, except by law. 'It is his mother’s inability to recognise the value to the boy of having his father in his life which has weighed with me, along with the inevitable harm to him especially given the history of his conception and the value of having his father in his life when he is struggling with that part of his identity.' The mother said she needed to move back to Hong Kong to find work, but the judge dismissed her concerns, saying he was satisfied she could get a job in England. Mr Wood said the father has the greater claim as he is the boy's only biological parent. The child was conceived using the father's sperm and donor eggs, meaning he has none of his mother's DNA . He added: 'I have no doubt that this mother will be disappointed. But she is a resilient character. I have no doubt that she will turn her shoulder to the wheel.' IVF treatment using donor eggs is usually recommended for post-menopausal women, those whose reproductive organs have been damaged, or those who have had repeated miscarriages. The egg, which is taken from an anonymous donor, is fertilised using the father's sperm and is then typically inserted into the mother using traditional IVF techniques. Up to two of the best-quality embryos will be inserted directly into her womb which has been prepared using hormone treatment. The rest may be frozen to use again, should the first try fail. The legal mother then carries the child to term and gives birth to it, but will not be related to it biologically. The process has a success rate of between 25 and 40 per cent.","Father, in his 40s, and mother, in her 50s, had baby in 2012 using IVF .

"If you leave your phone lying around when you leave the room, chances are your partner will take the opportunity to snoop through your texts, emails and internet searches. According to a new survey, four in ten adults regularly check their partner's device behind their back to keep an eye on them - with women most likely to snoop. The fairer sex is also the most suspicious with 44 per cent of women admitting to checking their other halves' phones compared to 36 per cent of men. Six in 10 snoops have caught their partner cheating on them or talking to someone they shouldn't be . Researchers also found 34 per cent know their partner's mobile PIN, 39 per cent know their email account password and 26 per cent know their Facebook password. Some 31 per cent don't know their significant other's PINS or passwords and are happy with that but more than half (54 per cent) would be suspicious if this wasn't the case for them. In fact, just over half believe sharing your mobile PIN or social media passwords is a modern sign of true love and commitment. While six in 10 snoops have caught their partner cheating on them or talking to someone they shouldn't be, more than a third have scuppered a romantic surprise their loved one was planning. The study of 2,000 Britons, commissioned by Samsung, found almost half have gone through a partner's phone in at least one relationship they've been in, with 16 per cent admitting they have done this with pretty much everyone they have been with. Furthermore, 40 per cent regularly snoop through their current partner's mobile to keep an eye on what they are doing or who they are talking to. Women are the most likely to check a partner's phone compared to men, with 44 per cent admitting to it . It doesn't always go to plan though as 34 per cent have ended up ruining a surprise their partner is planning for them, stumbling across their plans for a holiday, weekend away, gift or even a proposal, plus 44 per cent of said snoops have been caught in the act when going through their partner's phone. Text messages are most likely to be checked, followed by their call history, Facebook private messages, emails and even their photo gallery. Internet history and Twitter conversations are also among the things looked at by suspicious people. 1. Text messages . 2. Call history . 3. Facebook private messages . 4. Emails . 5. Photo gallery . 6. Internet history . 7. WhatsApp history . 8. Twitter private messages . 9. Viber history . 10. Skype history . But six in 10 of those who snoop have found inappropriate text messages, Facebook messages, phone calls or internet searches on at least one of their partner's mobiles. When it comes to confessing about their find, 32 per cent would confront their other half even if it meant owning up to their snooping, while a clever 18 per cent would find a way to bring it up without having to admit how they found out. Whilst 23 per cent would keep it to themselves, but keep a closer eye on their partner, 17 per cent would try and forget about it as they shouldn't have been snooping in the first place. Almost one in 20 would break up with their partner immediately. While 27 per cent said their other half wasn't bothered, as they had nothing to hide, 40 per cent said they were angry and 24 per cent said they broke up with them there and then. The phone company commissioned the research for the new Samsung Galaxy A-Series smartphone range. A spokesperson for Samsung Electronics UK & Ireland said: . 'Rather amusingly this research shows that suspicious partners seem to be using them quite regularly to check up on their other half on a regular basis. 'As we head towards the Valentine's season however, it's worth bearing in mind that you might discover something your partner is trying to keep hidden for all the right reasons, such as a secret weekend away they are planning, a special gift or perhaps even a marriage proposal!'","Sharing mobile or online passwords is a modern sign of true love, say 56% .

"A woman whose neighbor broke into her home and attempted to rape and kill her, is suing the local police department for failing to protect her. Savannah Fuchs of North Ogden, Utah, survived the attack on April 1, 2014, when Todd Alan Barber, 54, broke into the townhouse Fuchs shares with her six-year-old son in the early hours of the morning. He entered her bedroom and she woke to find him standing there. '[He had] a gun, bags and duct tape, and he had zip ties and he came in to rape me and kill me and my son. And I survived. There were so many miracles,' Fuchs said on Wednesday. Barber held Fuchs hostage, at times firing his gun at her and pistol whipping her head and face. She later required 50 stitches and 60 staples. Barber eventually called 911 himself and requested an ambulance and police. When officers arrived he shot himself in the head inside Fuchs' home. Neighbor Todd Barber held Savannah Fuchs (pictured here in August 2014) hostage in her home, at times firing his gun at her and pistol whipping her head and face. She later required 50 stitches and 60 staples . Fuchs said that the warning signs were there but North Ogden police had kept assuring her that it would be OK, and that they couldn't help her because Barber did not have a criminal record. Robert Sykes, Fuchs' attorney, found in his research that in 1990 Barber was convicted in Georgia of possession of a firearm during a crime. '[They] should have done their homework and found out about his record. That changes the whole game here,' he said. He added that even if Barber couldn't have been arrested for harassment or trespassing, they shouldn't have kept reassuring Fuchs, but instead should have warned her to take steps to protect herself as she may be at risk. City officials, responding to the civil lawsuit filed against the City of North Ogden and at least three police officers by Fuchs and her attorney, say that she was given options on how to deal with her neighbor, but she did not act on them. North Ogden mayor, Brent Taylor, told KSL.com on Wednesday that his police department did nothing wrong and said his city is being 'dragged through the mud'. 'It's absolutely outrageous that Mr. Sykes and his client think that the citizens of North Ogden owe her a large cash payout for a terrible tragedy committed by an evil man. That's what frustrates me,' he said. Fuchs said that the warning signs were there but North Ogden police had kept assuring her that things would be OK. A complaint to her landlord led to Barber's being asked to move and that brought things to a head . Robert Sykes (right), Savannah Fuchs' attorney, argued: 'This never would have happened had the police done their duty' after he discovered Barber had a previous firearm conviction . 'I've reviewed the documents extensively, personally, that pertained to the case. And I feel our officers acted very responsibly, very professionally,' he said. He cited one report in which an officer 'told Savannah she could get a protective order against Todd if she felt her or her son's safety was at risk'. Taylor said that options were presented that she chose not to pursue, but admits that 'looking back, we could be critical of everyone's actions. Fuchs has said that she didn't pursue the protective order because Barber lived in the adjoining townhouse sharing a dividing wall,so she was not sure it would have helped. For nearly a year Fuchs endured harassment from her neighbor, much of which was religious in nature. Fuchs is Jewish and Barber, a Christian, would write Biblical passages in chalk on her porch. He once climbed a ladder and put a Christian fish symbol on her bedroom window, and also scratched the symbol into her car. In a report filed after the harrowing incident at Fuchs' home that led to Barber's suicide, officers noted that the messages were not threatening, just 'odd'. One message said: 'Pray for forgiveness'. In April of 2013 Fuchs filed a report saying that she had seen Barber 'looking into her window at weird times of the day and night'. She told police that she was afraid of him and wanted him to leave her alone. On January 12, 2014, another report called Barber's harassment of Fuchs 'an ongoing problem' after she once again called police. The report said that Fuchs claimed to have called them six times regarding Barber, through police refute that having documented three calls. Fuchs maintains that every time she contacted police they would speak to Barber and assure her that everything would be OK. 'They would come over and they would come into my house and they would sit down and we would talk and I would just kind of explain I didn't feel safe. And they would go next door and talk with him. And then they would come back and reassure me and let me know everything would be OK,' she said. Things came to a head when Fuchs complained to their landlord who told Barber to move out. The day of his eviction was the day he broke into her house to murder her - April 1, 2014. Speaking on Wednesday, Sykes said: 'This never would have happened had the police done their duty.' Acknowledging that police are not usually liable for criminal conduct, he said that this case is different because of the 'special relationship' of trust that had developed between Fuchs and officers. Taylor acknowledges that what happened was a tragedy and his heart goes out to all the victims. Taylor said that this a case of 'an evil person [that] chose to do an evil crime' and was not the result of inaction by his police department. Taylor added that the city will not seek any type of out-of-court settlement.","Savannah Fuchs told police about being continually harassed by her neighbor, Todd Barber, for a year .

"Andy Murray is set to tie the knot with Kim Sears at the £1.8million luxury hotel he owns in Scotland. The couple are understood to be arranging the private service for April 11 at the five-star Cromlix House Hotel, close to his home town of Dunblane. But just last summer the hotel's restaurant, which is run by renowned chef Albert Roux, failed a hygiene inspection and was issued with an 'improvement required' rating by Food Standards Agency at Stirling Council. The issue was swiftly rectified by hotel bosses. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray and Kim Sears, pictured yesterday, are set to say 'I do' at the star's luxury Scottish hotel in April . Andy Murray bought the five-star hotel near his hometown of Dunblane in 2013 . The tennis ace proposed to his 27-year-old girlfriend of nine years with a jaw dropping three-carat diamond engagement ring, believed to be worth around £200,000, in November. Ahead of his proposal Murray, who became the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles title in 2013 since 1936, was repeatedly forced to bat off questions about when he would ask Miss Sears to marry him. The usually tight lipped star opened up about his wedding plans in an on-court interview at the recent Australian Open that he might wear a kilt with no underwear at their wedding. Miss Sears will be able to walk down the aisle in the £1.8 million hotel's own private chapel . Murray presented Miss Sears with a diamond engagement ring which is believed to be worth £200,000 . Murray bought Cromlix in 2013 for £1.8 million and it opened last year after a refurbishment. The privacy conscious couple will be able to say 'I do' away from prying eyes, as the hotel boasts its very own private chapel. The wedding party will also have 10 bedrooms and five suites to chose from, each of which is named after a great Scot, including Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, Robert Burns and even fellow sporting legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Chris Hoy. Several of the luxury suites feature hand-painted freestanding gold, silver and copper baths and the rooms’ 32in televisions screens are disguised as mirrors. The hotel overlooks 34-acres of secluded woodland, manicured grounds and tennis courts. Mr Murray and Miss Sears will also be following in the footsteps of the star's older brother, Jamie ,who also got married at Cromlix. He wed Alejandra Guitierrez in a 2010 ceremony, in which Mr Murray acted as best man. Last month Jamie revealed he had not yet been asked to return the favour. Just weeks after it opened its doors to guests the hotel, where guests can expect to pay up to £595 a night during peak season, was named Scottish hotel of the year. With just over two months until their big day the couple appeared relaxed as they walked their dogs near their Surrey home yesterday . The happy couple will be following in the footsteps of Murray's older brother Jamie, who wed Alejandra Gutierrez, at the same venue in 2010 .

Days later for the final Miss Sears poked fun at the row when she appeared court-side wearing a jumper that humorously declared: 'parental advisory: explicit content.' Miss Sears is the Sussex-born daughter of the former Lawn Tennis Association Head of Women's Tennis Nigel Sears. The couple met at the US Open in 2005 when Miss Sears was just 17 and studying for her A Level exams . Their relationship became public when Murray, who grew up in Dunblane, Scotland, won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to kiss Miss Sears .

After winning the Wimbledon titled in 2013 Murray celebrated by climbing through the crowd to share a kiss with Miss Sears . Murray has credited his girlfriend of nine years with helping to control his fiery temper and improving his dress sense . She is also credited with having helped control his temper on the court and with smartening up his appearance. ‘I work better in a relationship,' he has previously said of his relationship in 2009. 'At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff,.' Andy Murray revealed in a post match interview after the Australian Open, pictured playing in the tournament, that he might wear a kilt with no underwear on the big day. Miss Sears, pictured right, caused controversy at the event after being captured on camera repeatedly swearing . The couple live in a £5.6million house in Oxshott, Surrey, with their two Border terriers, Rusty and Maggie May. In his 2013 memoir Seventy-Seven: My Road to Wimbledon Glory, he wrote: ‘I would like to start a family and try to be a good father. That’s important to me.

By the time authorities showed up at the scene, the woman behind the wheel already got out, according to the website. Yahoo News! reported that authorities continue to investigate, and that the 37-year-old woman 'told authorities she did not know how she had lost control of the car.' Images of the car sticking straight up in the snow appeared Wednesday afternoon on the Facebook page for the New Hampshire Trooper's Association. Along with the images, the Trooper's Association wrote 'Trooper Preneveau investigated this crash on Route 101 westbound in Exeter this morning. Operating too fast for the conditions?' Several people made humorous comments about the position the car ended up in, among them Bill Ganley. Yahoo! News pointed out  Ganley's observation that a car in 2011 also wound up standing straight in the air in Salem. Kristine Wilber Peckham wrote on Facebook that the car 'Nailed that landing!' Several other users offered 'scores' for the car involved in the accident. Jennifer Dispensa said 'I'd give them a perfect 10, but only after investigating for performance enhancing drugs.' Kathy Barte was more critical, however, writing 'This rates a score of 8.' Tony Ferraro even posted a shot of judges from the ABC reality show competition  'Dancing with the Stars' all holding up signs of 10, indicating a perfect score. 'Nailed it...' Ferraro wrote.

"Two callous thieves were caught on camera using homemade scoops to dip into into a wishing well filled with donations meant for sick children with cancer. The heartless pair targeted the wishing well at the Wookey Hole tourist spot in Somerset, which each year collects thousands for charity Children with Leukaemia. It is not known exactly how much they got away with, but Chris Goodchild, the owner of the popular attraction, is now offering a £500 reward to catch the thieves. 'It's just the lowest of the low,' he said. 'Stealing from charity. It's sick. You don't get any lower than that.' CCTV - installed after staff at Wookey Hole noticed there wasn't as much money as usual in the wishing well - captured the two stealing coins meant for children with cancer . The duo were captured on CCTV after staff noticed there weren't as many coins in the well as usual last November. They soon caught the thieves in the act, watching them fishing into the disused well to get the change. But the pair got wise to being watched, and stole the camera from the wall. Mr Goodchild said: 'We noticed the difference in money and put up the cameras and less than a month later we saw them taking the money. 'Because it's a charity thing we don't know how much is in there until they come to collect it. I'd say there was a few hundred pounds that has gone missing though.

"A glass of red wine or a handful of peanuts could help prevent memory loss because they both contain a crucial antioxidant, new research has revealed. Experts believe a compound found in common foods such as red grapes could even prove vital in the battle against  Alzheimer's disease. Both peanuts and red grapes as well as red wine and some berries contain an antioxidant that is capable of protecting cells from age-related damage, researchers say. A glass of red wine or a handful of peanuts could help prevent memory loss because they both contain a crucial antioxidant, new research has revealed (file picture) Resveratrol has been widely touted for its potential to prevent heart disease, but a team of American scientists  believe it also has positive effects on the hippocampus, an area of the brain that is critical to functions such as memory, learning and mood. The latest research was led by Ashok K. Shetty, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Medicine and Director of Neurosciences at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine in Texas. Because both humans and animals show a decline in cognitive capacity after middle age, the findings may have implications for treating memory loss in the elderly. Resveratrol may even be able to help people afflicted with severe neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. In a study published online in Scientific Reports, Shetty and his research team members reported that treatment with resveratrol had apparent benefits in terms of learning, memory and mood function in aged rats. Both peanuts and red grapes as well as red wine and some berries contain an antioxidant that is capable of protecting cells from age-related damage, researchers say . 'The results of the study were striking,' Professor Shetty said. 'They indicated that for the control rats who did not receive resveratrol, spatial learning ability was largely maintained but ability to make new spatial memories significantly declined between 22 and 25 months. 'By contrast, both spatial learning and memory improved in the resveratrol-treated rats.' Shetty said neurogenesis - the growth and development of neurons - approximately doubled in the rats given resveratrol compared to the control rats. The resveratrol-treated rats also had significantly improved microvasculature, indicating improved blood flow, and had a lower level of chronic inflammation in the hippocampus. 'The study provides novel evidence that resveratrol treatment in late middle age can help improve memory and mood function in old age,' Shetty said.","Compound in red grapes key in battle against Alzheimer's, study finds .

"A woman who didn't even know she was pregnant until her third trimester gave birth to a 14-pound baby boy on January 29. Maxxandra's Ford's baby Avery Denton is the largest baby to ever be born at St. Joseph’s Women's Hospital in Tampa and is one of the largest babies ever to be born in Florida. WFLA.com reports that Maxxandra Ford was putting on the pounds last fall and went to the doctor because she thought she may have some kind of medical issue. Big welcome: Maxxandra Ford gave birth to Avery Denton weighing 14-lb, the heaviest baby born at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa Bay . Had no idea she was pregnant: Maxxandra Ford went to the doctor during her third trimester because she was putting on a  lot of weight and doctors told her she was 35 weeks pregnant . Baby fat: The average weight of a baby is 7 pounds 7.5 ounces which is half the size of 14lb baby Avery . The doctor told her she was 35 weeks pregnant and that she had just a few weeks to prepare for her new family member. Ford grew quite large during her pregnancy and thought she may be carrying twins because she was a twin herself. When Ford gave birth naturally to her 14.1 pound baby boy she realized she did not have twins just an abnormally large baby the size of two average babies. Ford also has a one-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter at home. Most large babies are delivered by cesarean section in the United States because large babies can cause complications during childbirth for both the baby and the mother. Pediatrics expert Dr. Vincent Lannelli told The New York Daily News that the average weight of a baby is 7 pounds 7.5 ounces. Big surprise: Maxxandra Ford thought she might be giving birth to twins because she put on so much weight during her pregnancy but she naturally gave birth to just one huge 14lb baby boy . Hungry?: Avery is an abnormally large baby and while he is healthy, his mother will need to monitor his diet to prevent him from becoming obese later in life . Big plan: Maxxandra Ford thought she was merely gaining lots of weight but when a doctor told her she was pregnant she welcomed her new baby boy with loving arms . Babies that weigh over 8 pounds and 8 ounces are considered to be on the heavier end of the spectrum. 14 pounds is certainly a lot of weight for a baby, but nothing tops the Guinness World Record's biggest birth of 22 pounds 8 oz. in South Africa. Christina Samane gave birth to the large child with Weaver's Syndrome, a disease that causes excessive growth in children due to genetic abnormalities. Evidencebasedbirth.com reports that having an abnormally large baby may be linked to a mother's high blood sugar if not a genetic disorder. Around 1 in 10 women in the U.S. will have a baby that weighs more than 9 pounds. Avery is currently healthy but his mother will have to monitor his diet if she doesn't want to risk the child becoming obese later in life.

"A tiny sea creature that was found by a mother in a tin of tuna chunks is a tongue-eating parasite, experts have claimed. Zoe Butler, 28, was horrified when she opened the tin of Princes tuna to discover the tiny species' black eyes staring back at her. After appealing to experts, scientists at the Natural History Museum believe they have identified the creature as a Cymothoa exigua, or tongue-eating louse, which live inside fish. Scroll down for video . Tin monster: This is the mystery sea creature that Zoe Butler found in the can of Princes tuna . Typically it enters a fish's body through the gills and attaches itself to the tongue. 'From what I can see I would support the head of a Tongue-eating louse, Cymothoa exigua or similar, Stuart Hine, Identifcation and Advisory Service manager at the Museum told the Telegraph. 'I think these are associates of smaller fish than Tuna and fish that tuna eat.' It is not the first time the parasite has almost made its way onto the plate in Britain, with a Morrisons customer shocked to discover an adult Cymothoa in a fillet of sea bass. Paul Poli, 62, was about to tuck into his dinner when he spotted the gruesome yellow creature inside the fish. He took it back to the Morrisons supermarket in Llanelli, where he had bought the sea bass from the fishmonger's counter. Ms Butler, who lives in Nottingham, discovered the species' tiny head last week after opening the can of tuna she bought in Asda. Previously experts said they thought the head may have belonged to a  juvenile crab. Right, the can of tuna in which it was found . 'I opened the top of the lid and saw a purple thing, a gut sack or intestine - then I turned it round and pushed it with a fork and saw it looking back at me,' said the 28-year-old. Cymothoa Exigua is more commonly known as the tongue-eating louse and is a parasite, which attaches itself to the tongue of a fish. It enters the fish through its gills before attaching itself to the tongue. It then replaces the tongue and feeds on the blood of the fish as well as any other food that it takes in. The parasite can bite humans but is not thought to be harmful to them in any other way. 'It's got like a spiny tail along the bottom - it's quite grim. I dropped the fork, jumped back, screamed a bit and shouted for my nan to come and have a look.' After conducting their own investigation, Princes however said the creature is more likely to be a juvenile crab than the tongue-eating parasite. Dr Hany Elsheikha, associate professor of veterinary parasitology at the University of Nottingham, previously said it could be some form of crustacean. He said: 'All I can see from the picture is a body and the eyes are very prominent. 'The legs have been chopped off during the process.' An Asda spokeswoman said they were awaiting the outcome of the investigation.

She had his face covered up and hospital authorities wouldn't let me see him or my wife,' he told ABC News. 'When the doctor came out, he said ""there’s a real problem with your son"".' Samuel said he was shocked when doctors initially told him of Leo's Down syndrome, but it never crossed his mind to abandon him. 'They took me in to see him and I looked at this guy and I said, he's beautiful, he's perfect and I'm absolutely keeping him,' he said. Samuel is now desperately trying to crowd fund to flee the eastern European country so he can raise Leo back in his native New Zealand . He has already far exceeded his target - with donations flooding in from throughout the world . When he carried Leo in to meet his wife, she threatened to leave him if he kept his son. 'What happens when a baby like this is born here, they will tell you that you don't have to keep them,' he told ABC News. 'My wife had already decided, so all of this was done behind my back.' Samuel's wife filed for divorce a week later. The couple had only been married for 18 months when little Leo was born in January . The extra money raised for Leo will be shared with an Armenian orphanage which takes in children with Down syndrome . People have been touched by the devotion Samuel has shown towards his son, calling him 'inspriational' The first-time father is now desperately trying to crowd fund to flee the eastern European country so he can raise Leo back in his native New Zealand . The first-time father is now desperately trying to crowd fund to flee the eastern European country so he can raise Leo back in his native New Zealand. The fundraising page, titled Bring Leo Home, has already raised more than $100,000 in less than 24 hours. Samuel has been left stunned by the outpouring of support. 'Leo and I found out in the wee hours of the morning that we had crossed our target. He is a lucky guy to have the support of thousands of friends  around the world,' he said. The money will be used find a house in Auckland and to give Leo education opportunities. Samuel also plans to use some of the funds to support parents in Armenia who are raising children with disabilities. 'We’d also like to share the surplus funds with the only orphanage in Armenia that regularly takes abandoned Down syndrome babies as well as other organisations that can help these children,' he said. The initial goal for Samuel and Leo was to raise enough for a year so he could get part-time work and care for his son.

"A New York woman has filed a discrimination lawsuit against Kuwait Airways after the airline refused to allow her to fly on one of its planes because she is an Israeli citizen. Iris Eliazrov, who moved to the U.S at the age of 11 and is now 26, was barred from the flight at John F. Kennedy International Airport because of a Kuwait Airways policy that prevents Israeli citizens from flying with the airline. The mother-of-four's lawsuit has gained momentum in recent days after Federal Judge Roslynn Mauskopf ordered Brooklyn attorney U.S. general Loretta Lynch and Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to consider its merits. Kuwait Airways' policy of not allowing Israeli citizens to fly on its planes has come under fire from an enraged mother-of-four from Brooklyn . Mrs Eliazrov and her husband David Nektalov - who flies on a U.S. passport - were due to fly to London on November 1. But the company policy meant she had to re-book with another flying operator while her husband went ahead. Mr Nektalov told the New York Daily News: 'I didn’t think a discrimination like this could exist in America, in JFK (Airport), in New York City. Sixty years ago blacks weren’t allowed to ride buses. This is not about money.' His wife's lawsuit claims the policy is reminiscent of the Holocaust and the Civil Rights movement. Lawyer John Maggio, representing the airline, claimed Mrs Eliazrov's claim was baseless because the company's policy centred on citizenship, not religion, adding that a Muslim with an Israeli passport would not be allowed to fly. He likened the policy to the U.S. embargo on its companies undertaking business dealings with Iran. However, Mrs Eliazrov's lawsuit is not the first time Kuwait Airways has come under fire for a policy many label as discriminatory. Mrs Eliazrov's husband David Nektalov said he was astounded such 'discrimination' could exist at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (pictured) A similar situation unfolded in September last year when a 32-year-old Israeli woman was denied her seat on a Kuwait Airways plane to London. At the time, lawyers for Kuwait Airways said that the ban was required by the country's law because it has no diplomatic relations with Israel. They clarified that they were happy for Jewish passengers to fly - just not Israeli citizens, Fox News reported. Kuwait Airways have not commented on the lawsuit.","Iris Eliazrov was prevented from boarding flight because of Israeli passport .

"A city lawyer died at his own 29th birthday party after falling down a disused rubbish chute in a block of flats. Gary O'Donoghue, a solicitor at EMW Law firm, disappeared during a celebration friends had thrown for him at an apartment in Shoreditch, east London, at around 6am. His body lay undiscovered for 24 hours, but was found by police at the bottom of the chute after officers searched the building. Friends and teammates have paid tribute to the talented footballer who played for UCL Academicals in the Amateur Football Combination, saying he will be  'sorely missed'. Gary O'Donoghue died at his own 29th birthday party after falling down a disused rubbish chute in a block of flats . He was last seen at around in the early hours of January 25 at the flat in Quaker Street, off Commercial Street in Spitalfields and friends hunted for 12 hours before calling police. Police are treating Mr O'Donoghue's death as unexplained but at this stage do not believe there to be any suspicious circumstances. Mr O'Donoghue had worked as a solicitor specialising in corporate finance at EMW Law firm, based in Chancery Lane, for more than five years. He had previously attended Nottingham Law School and took his undergraduate degree in law at the University of East Anglia. In a testimonial on the firm's website, he described his passion for his job, saying: 'I joined the firm in 2009 as a trainee and have not looked back since.' He was last seen at around in the early hours of January 25 at the flat in Quaker Street, east London and friends hunted for 12 hours before calling police . Mr O'Donoghue's family were today too distressed to comment on their son's death. Stuart Richards paid tribute on Facebook saying: 'I lost a pal this week - one of my football boys. Twenty-eight years old. Went missing after a birthday night out and then found dead a day later. 'The sadness comes in surreal waves. One minute I'm all punning on him being a left-winger - haha, politics - the next I'm pulling over on the side of the road in tears. 'It's like a glitch in my day-to-day thought continuum. A state of affairs that despite the very real, conscious acceptance of his death, just doesn't quite compute when you stop properly reflecting and let things be. 'I didn't even know him that well, but he was someone who as skipper I expected to turn up every week. Almost still do. Without exception he'd create a goal or bag himself. His friend David Hagan wrote: 'I will sorely miss Gaz.' Egbertian FC ‏tweeted: 'Our condolences to friends, teammates and family of @UCLAccies player Gary O'Donoghue who passed away last week. RIP' A Met Police spokesman said: 'We were called to Quaker Street on January 25 at 6pm after a man was reported missing. We searched the property and the man's body was found. We are treating the death as unexplained.'","Gary O'Donoghue, 29, disappeared during party friends had thrown for him .

"This time last year, Tahysn was a happily married father of two little boys aged three and four and lived close to his large, extended family in the village of Shangal in Iraq's Nineveh province. Now, home is a ramshackle refugee camp under the protection of Kurdish peshmerga fighters  and he is grieving the loss of his wife and sons. His story is far from unique. Like so many other Yazidis, his family were massacred by ISIS jihadis as they swept through northern Iraq in August. Like them, Tahysn has lost everything. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Tahsyn shows a photo of his two little boys. It is all he has left of them after they were murdered by IS . 'When the Daesh (a local slang term for ISIS) came to our village, I was not there but called my family and told them to leave. It was a big shock for everybody. 'They managed to escape the village but on the way to Mount Sinjar, they met Daesh. All of them were killed.' His eyes glistening with tears, he adds: 'My older brother, my father, my mother, my wife and even my two kids were killed. All I have left of them is just one picture on my mobile phone. 'The Daesh are just savages. They do not respect religion or humanity. They are not humans - even animals have more pity.' The first inkling that his formerly peaceful existence was coming to an end arrived  when Mosul fell to the jihadis on June 10. As ISIS cut a swathe through the local population, forcing Christians to flee and killing anyone who resisted, the Yazidis watched uneasily. Gone: Nasser, from the village of Kocho near Sinjar, shows a photo of his small nephew who was killed . Grieving: Sefan, 16, is now without his father (pictured) and three brothers - all of whom were murdered . All that's left: This man's brother was killed by the jihadis. This photo is all he has to remember him by . Alone: Just eight years old, Azin has been forced to fend for herself after her parents were killed by ISIS . Their unease was justified for less than two months after the fall of Mosul, the fanatics were bearing down on their own doorsteps. The onslaught began on the 3rd August, when ISIS fighters surrounded the Kurdish town of Sinjar, which was once home to thousands of Yazidi families. Many ran but more still were murdered as the jihadis advanced. Some were offered the chance to convert to Islam. Women were kidnapped and raped, as were children. Others escaped to the top of Mount Sinjar, where, surrounded by jihadi forces, they faced death by starvation and exposure or at the hands of ISIS. It was only when the international community, spurred into action by harrowing photos of their plight, launched airstrikes and air drops of relief supplies, that they were saved. But for many, Tahysn among them, the horrors of the ISIS advance remain fresh - and the wounds all too raw. Bleak: This family was forced to walk for seven days to reach Zohar. The baby was named Nojin - New Life . Tough: The Yazidis living in Zohar have tents and some food but worry about what winter will bring . Grim: The camp sits in the middle of a bleak stretch of wilderness, valuable only for what lies beneath . Temptation: A flaring oil well just behind the camp hints at the financial reason for the ISIS onslaught . Azin, an eight-year-old girl now living in a school in the town of Zohar, is another Yazidi who lost everything when the jihadis attacked. Her parents were captured by the jihadis as they attempted to escape, while Azin herself was forced to endure a trek that lasted seven days. 'My father and my mother are no longer with me,' she says, heartbreakingly matter-of-fact. 'They were caught by Daesh on the day we left Sinjar. I escaped on my own.' The eight-year-old has no idea where her family might be or even if they are still alive. But she remembers the men who tore her world apart all too well. 'The men from Daesh had long beards and big weapons,' she remembers. 'I walked for seven days in the hills to escape them. I do not know if my parents are still alive.' Others, who were forced to leave their homes so quickly that they could take nothing with them, complain that their children have been left impoverished and hungry. Survivor: This boy is one of thousands who have fled to Zohar and Lalesh in the face of the ISIS advance . Escape: This lady told MailOnline that she would rather die than be enslaved by ISIS . Destitute: Resho was forced to leave behind all his goats - and the bodies of 45 family members . Alone: Rezal (left) has been left to care for her grandchildren while this lady (right) saw babies being killed . Others, such as grandmother Rezal, who also comes from Sinjar, have been left to bring up orphaned children and mourn others for whom the hot and dusty journey up the side of the mountain proved too much. 'When we left Sinjar, the kids suffered a lot,' says Rezal. 'They cried a lot because we needed to walk day and night. 'Many men from our village died, many women have been captured. I saw some kids dying because of the heat - it was nearly 50 degrees. 'The Daesh caught my brother and seven members of my family, including one who was 90. I do not have any news. I do not know whether any of them are still alive.' Now living in a refugee camp in Lalesh, a village that holds special significance for the Yazidi and the location of their holiest religious site, she worries about the privations that winter might bring. 'In Lalesh, the weather is cold,' she frets. 'Winter is coming and we are in a terrible state of health and mind. 'We do not own anything anymore, we had leave everything. We have no clothes, no furniture, no ornaments…Nothing.' Memories: The surviving members of one family look at photos of their lost loved ones . Brave: Many of the refugees living in the two camps are terribly traumatised children . Lucky: Two of this mother's children were injured as they fled. Both have been flown to Paris for treatment . 'We have left Sinjar through the hills,' adds another mother, who did not want to be named. 'We walked for seven days and seven nights. We had no food and no water. 'The Daesh caught my two sons, my father and two of my sisters. I  have no news from them and I do not know if they are even alive. 'Daesh are crazy people,' she adds. 'They even cut the throats of the babies. They want us, the Yazidis, to convert to Islam, but we refuse. 'As long as we are not in their hands, we survive. We prefer to die instead of being their slaves.' Although the refugees have been provided with food and tents, it is the psychological scars - particularly among the younger children - that will take longest to fix. Like Azin, Hassan, 13, was forced to flee alone and is now living in a refugee camp. He has no idea where his parents are and says many of his friends were murdered, . Scarred: Hassan, 13, saw 100 boys from his village murdered by ISIS, among them best friend Kasi, nine . Horrors: Like Hassan, this little girl witnessed the murder of her friends and family . Hiding: Many families have taken refuge in the Yazidi temple at Lalesh . Revenge: This little boy has vowed revenge on ISIS and wants to make them suffer as his family has . 'The Daesh came suddenly into my village with many men,' he recounts. 'I didn't understand what was happening and I was so scared. 'I ran but many of my friends were killed. I lost my best friend Kasi - he was nine. The Daesh killed nearly 100 kids from my village.' 'When I grow up, I will beat the Daesh,' adds another camp resident, a young boy who waves a small pistol in the air as he does so. 'I will kill them all. I will take revenge for all the Yazidi people. I want the Daesh to live through what we suffered because of them.'","An estimated 200,000 Yazidi were forced to flee as ISIS advanced .

"A food tycoon's son who left a baby paralysed and brain damaged in a horror car crash is facing jail for a second time over a bar brawl that left a man blinded. Antonio Boparan, 28, pleaded guilty to inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder after two men were punched, kicked and hit with broken bottles at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar. He has already served 21 months in jail for causing horrific injuries to one-year-old Cerys Edwards in a crash while speeding at 72mph on the wrong side of a 30mph road in November 2006. Antonio Boparan, 28, is facing jail for a second time over a bar brawl, pictured with his millionaire father Ranjit Singh Boparan (left) outside Birmingham Crown Court, pictured in 2008 . Now the charity founder from Sutton Coldfield and three other men are facing jail after the two men were attacked - leaving one with a fractured eye socket who has since lost the use of an eye. Nathan Pringle, 32, from Erdington and Edward Ansah, 24, from Sutton Coldfield both admitted violent disorder at Birmingham Crown Court following the attack in April last year. Theadore Mullings-Fairweather, 25, from Selly Oak, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent and all four will now be sentenced in March. Boparan is the son of Ranjit Singh Boparan, who owns Harry Ramsden's and has an estimated fortune of £800million along with his wife Baljinder. He served 21 months in jail for causing horrific injuries to one-year-old Cerys Edwards in a crash which left her paralysed and brain damaged . He crashed his parents' Range Rover in 2006 while speeding at 72mph on the wrong side of a 30mph road . The family business - 2 Sisters Food Group – has a turnover of more than £3.4billion. Boparan was 19 when he crashed his parents' Range Rover in Sutton Coldfield, leaving Cerys paralysed, brain damaged and needing round-the-clock care. The impact of the crash was so severe that Cerys - now nine-years-old - was ripped from her baby seat and her spine was fractured. She was left unable to talk and walk and still requires a ventilator just to keep her alive . Her father Gareth, 50, said: 'He practically killed Cerys that night and now he has been caught up in an incident which left another person permanently disabled. 'Sadly, I can't say I'm surprised. Even when he was on bail for dangerous driving in Cerys's case, the court was told that he was caught speeding at 95mph on the Aston Expressway. The youngster, now nine-years-old,  was left unable to talk and walk and still requires a ventilator just to keep her alive . The impact of the crash was so severe that Cerys was ripped from her baby seat and her spine was fractured . 'He does not care what damage he inflicts on other people. These latest victims could have been left brain damaged or paralysed, just like Cerys. 'He ruined our lives, but has done nothing to help Cerys. His father handed over £200,000 towards her house and the insurers paid out for her ongoing care after a five-year battle, but he has never even had the guts to meet her and she is now nine-years-old. Ranjit Singh Boparan owns 2 Sisters Food Group - a Birmingham-based food-manufacturing company. Established in 1993 as a frozen retail cutting operation, it has grown rapidly and expanded to cover 36 manufacturing sites in the UK, eight in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and one in Poland. The group employs 23,000 people, and has annual sales of £3.4billion. It is listed 14th on the 2014 Sunday Times Top Track 100. The company is now the third largest food company in the UK by turnover. Brands include Fox's Biscuits, Goodfella's, Donegal Catch and Green Isle. Harry Ramsden's was told to Boparan Ventures Ltd in 2010, the private investment branch of his business empire. If Cerys had been killed in the crash, Boparan would have faced up to 14 years in jail for causing death by dangerous driving. The outrage over his short sentence sparked a nationwide campaign which resulted a change in the law to ensure anyone convicted of causing serious injury by dangerous driving faces up to five years in prison instead of the previous maximum of two. Labour's former Justice Minister Jack Straw called the family himself to give them the news about what became known as 'Cerys's Law'. Ranjit Singh's family business was built from 'a small-scale frozen retail cutting operation' and now controls about 20 per cent of the UK poultry market. Mr Singh is the fifth richest person in the Midlands and fifth richest Asian in the UK as the director of some 50 companies and subsidiaries. The father-of-five is also the chairman of Northern Foods, the company behind Goodfellas pizzas and Fox's Biscuits, which 2 Sisters acquired in 2011 for nearly £350million. Cerys was awarded £5million compensation in 2012 along with a guaranteed annual payout of £450,000 for the rest of her life. The long battle to secure compensation from the insurers took more than five years. At the time Judge Martin McKenna, sitting at Birmingham County Court, described it as the 'saddest and most tragic case' he had come across. Two men were punched, kicked and hit with broken bottles at in the attack last April at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar .

"A former member of a New Jersey church group testified on Thursday that a deli worker accused of kidnapping and murdering of Etan Patz in 1979 confessed the crimes to him during a religious retreat later that year. Pedro Hernandez is accused of the kidnapping and murder of the 6-year-old boy who vanished on May 25, 1979 while walking to a school bus stop in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood. It was his first day of going to school by himself. His body was never found, but in 2001 he was declared legally dead. Ramon Rodriguez, 75, told a Manhattan court on Thursday that Pedros Hernandez, left, admitted to the kidnapping and murder of Etan Patz, right, on a 1979 religious retreat in New Jersey . The case ignited a national movement to find missing children, and Patz was one of the first missing children whose picture appeared on a milk carton. Hernandez, 54, was arrested in 2012 after police got a tip that he had confessed at a church group. He then confessed to police that he lured Patz to the basement of a Soho deli where he worked, strangled him and dumped him in an alley. His defense attorneys say the confession was coerced and he is mentally ill and suffers hallucinations. Testifying at Hernandez' trial in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Ramon Rodriguez, 75, said Hernandez admitted to the kidnapping and murder on a 1979 religious retreat in New Jersey. Hernandez said he was working at a grocery store in New York City and told Rodriguez 'I took him to the basement, and then I took a stick and I shove him a lot of times,' he testified. He said Hernandez admitted sexually abusing the boy. Hernandez' defense disputed Rodriguez' credibility, saying he had previously said he had heard no such confession and focusing on inconsistencies in his story. Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said Rodriguez earlier had made statements that Hernandez had not admitted to sexual abuse and that Rodriguez had changed his account more than once. The original missing poster following Etan Patz's disappearance in 1979, left,  the young was one of the first missing children whose picture appeared on milk cartons, right . Rodriguez, a retiree who lives in Puerto Rico, said he belonged to a charismatic church group that was attended by Hernandez and his brother-in-law, Jose Lopez. Lopez tipped off police in 2012, saying he had heard about an alleged confession, although he recalled it may have been in the 1980s. Rodriguez said he never reported what he had heard to police. Two other members of the church group were expected to testify when the trial resumes on Friday. Earlier in the week Etan's best friend Chelsea Altman had recalled in court how she saved the six-year-old boy a seat on the bus on the morning he vanished but he never turned up. Now an actress and Brooklyn restaurant owner, Altman wept as she testified. Altman, whose family lived opposite the Patz family on Prince Street in SoHo, took the stand on Monday and recalled the morning of May 25, 1979, when Patz failed to get on the bus. When she returned home from school that day, she picked up a call from Etan's worried mother, Julie Patz, and told her that she didn't know where the boy was. 'She was shocked,' she told Manhattan Supreme Court, DNAinfo reported. 'She was very upset.' Emotional: Chelsea Altman, who was best friends with Etan Patz at the time he vanished in 1979, wept as she recounted how he failed to get on the bus for school the day that he vanished . Altman, who is now a mother herself, recalled how Etan was 'very curious and sweet, a little mischievous but not rebellious' and how excited they both were that their families were planning on taking a vacation together. She added how Etan had spoken about taking a trip with a friend called Johnny, who he said had a van and candy, but she said she believed this was just an imaginary friend. She also testified how Susan Harrington, who was paid to walk her and Etan home on occasion, would sometimes meet them with a man - but she denied he looked like Jose Ramos, a long-time suspect in the case and a convicted pedophile. Altman, who owns restaurants Olea and Allswell in Brooklyn, took the stand on the second day of testimony in the murder trial for Hernandez, who had worked in a shop in the area at the time. Earlier that day, Etan's mother, 72-year-old Julie Patz, had described the moment she saw her son for the last time 35 years ago. She told the jury the youngster was trusting but also scared of being lost or alone and broke into tears when describing her feelings when she realized her son was missing. Her testimony was the only time she will appear in court because she cannot bear to go through the trial and be reminded of what happened. Memories: Altman, who is now a mother herself, said that Etan had spoken about taking a trip with a man who had a van and candy - but that she always thought he was talking about an imaginary friend . She arrived at the court separately for her husband Stan, who turned up with his daughter Shira, and was not wearing a wedding ring. Mrs Patz recounted her time living in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood when her son, Etan, was little and how he vanished after she allowed him to walk to school alone for the first time. 'That was the last time I saw him. I watched him walk one block away. I turned around and went back upstairs and that was the last time.' Etan had asked his mother if he could walk to catch the school bus on his own. She initially said no but capitulated. On the day he went missing she told him to go straight to the bodega and get a drink with money he had been saving up. 'I reminded him to come directly home from school, no side trips anywhere,' she said. She told the court how the store, where Hernandez worked as a youngster, was dark, dirty and poorly stocked. However because of the location other parents in the neighborhood would often tell the children to meet there in an emergency. The boy was 'totally outgoing and trusting of everyone — totally nonjudgmental about people,' his mother said. 'Everyone that he met once was his friend and was a nice person.' But while Etan craved independence and was eager to become a grown-up, Patz said, 'at the same time he was very fearful of being lost or left alone by himself.' Testimony: Julie Patz, mother of Etan Patz, (pictured arriving at court) told said her son was 'trusting' and terrified of being alone as she took to the stand at his alleged killer's murder trial in Manhattan . Painful memories: Etan Patz's mother Julie, center, described the moment she saw her son for the last time 35 years ago at the murder trial of his alleged killer Pedro Hernandez, right . Family support: Shira Patz, Etan's sister (center) and Stan Patz, his father, arrive at court on Monday . Mrs Patz cried when talking about how she felt in the hours after she learned Etan was missing. 'I don't remember a thing about that night and the next day, quite honestly,' she said. She recalls only having 'very rubbery legs,' an upset stomach and difficulty walking, thinking and talking. 'Our home became police headquarters. Global command. It was very strange.' 'It was not fun,' she added. 'Our children were handed off to neighbors and friends because our house was a madhouse. It's been more like a circus than anything else.' Asking questions from prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, she said women in her neighborhood criticized her for playing and laughing with her children just months after Etan vanished. She also became emotional when she started describing the impact the case which has spanned three decades has had on her children. 'My daughter and my son, this has been almost their entire lives,' she said. 'It's very difficult to continuously try to regain a sense of normalcy in your daily life (while having it) constantly being pulled out from under you with new developments in the case, new leads or whatever,' she said. After the coverage surrounding her son's disappearance died down in the 1980's she shied away from the spotlight. Her husband Stan started making most of the appearances in public. A look back: In this March 1980 photo, Stan and Julie Patz stand on the  fire escape of their loft in SoHo. Below them runs Prince Street, along which Etan, their six-year-old son, set off to school on May 25, 1979 . Harrowing: Mrs Patz recounted how she watched Etan walk to school on his own for the first time from their Soho apartment (pictured). It was the last time she saw him . She has only been seen at a handful of court dates. Hernandez said in his videotaped confession that he had lured the youngster into the basement of the store and strangled him. During the investigation in 1979, New York police jotted down his name among those of many people they met during their feverish search. But it wasn't until 2012 that Hernandez emerged as a suspect. The apparent breakthrough in the case was based on a tip and a videotaped confession that prosecutors say was foreshadowed by remarks he made to friends and relatives in the 1980s. His defense hinges on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years. Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day. The trial is expected to last up to three months. Witnesses are expected to include psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect.","Ramon Rodriguez, 75, told a Manhattan court on Thursday that Pedros Hernandez had admitted to the kidnapping and murder of Etan Patz .

But if genuine, the recruitment of a young, white man could be viewed as a major coup for the terrorist group. Haras Rafiq, of counter-extremism think-tank Quilliam, said the group was examining the image’s authenticity. ‘I have not come across this picture before,’ he said. ‘It is also strange that one post has called him “Jonathan Edwards” rather than him taking on an Islamic name. But having said that, I am not going to discount it.’ Abu Abdel Malik Al-Britani's death was announced on social media . He added that IS had access to ‘very sophisticated’ editing software used by Hollywood special effects experts. Comments left by Twitter users suggest it has been doctored. Another source said there were no known white converts in Syria and the photo had not been shared and ‘celebrated’ by IS. ‘If he’s happy to sit there with his face uncovered, we’d have seen it in a bigger propaganda hit,’ said the source. Most fighters who have travelled to join extremists in Syria and Iraq are of Asian or African heritage, with around 60 Australians and about 500 Britons. But Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, has suggested the figure for Britons was a fourfold underestimate.

The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases. It said: 'The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, even for humanitarian reasons, is putting themselves in considerable danger of harm.' It follows news that a jihadist calling himself Abu Abdel Malik al-Britani became the 35th Briton to have been killed while fighting for ISIS in Syria this week. He was pictured smiling as he posed with an M16 assault rifle outside a sports shop. In the image the militant is seen wearing camouflage gear as he proudly brandishes the weapon on a shopping street. He is understood to have been killed alongside two Canadian jihadis during fierce clashes in the Syrian desert town of Dabiq. Jihadi: Rashid Amani, 19, had been fighting for Islamic State in the besieged Syrian town of Kobane when he suffered serious wounds from a US air strike . He is just the latest in a steady flow of British militants to be killed fighting for ISIS in the Middle East - a figure that has grown dramatically towards the end of the year as American-led airstrikes target the group's strongholds and Kurdish YPG and Peshmerga forces retake land from the terrorists. Today it was revealed that US-led air strikes in Syria and Iraq have killed more than 1,000 jihadis in the past three months, nearly all of them from the Islamic State. 'At least 1,171 have been killed in the Arab and international air strikes [since September 23], including 1,119 jihadists of the Islamic State group and Al-Nusra Front,' said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists and medics across the war-ravaged country for its information. Among the dead were 1,046 members of IS, which has seized large chunks of Iraq and Syria and is the main target of the air campaign. Seventy-two of those killed were members of Al-Qaeda's branch in Syria, the Al-Nusra Front, while another was a jihadist prisoner whose affiliation was unknown, an Observatory statement said. The remaining 52 were civilians. Abu Abdel Malik's death was announced on social media by a fighter of Algerian origin who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Musab and who claims to have trained alongside the militant in Syria. He said the Briton was killed in Dabiq alongside two militants of Canadian origin named Abu Ibrahim Al-Canadi & Abu Abdullah Al-Canadi. ISIS supporters on social media raised the possibility that the pair could be Calgary-raised brothers Collin and Greg Gordon, who joined ISIS in August having only recently converted to Islam. Details of Abu Abdel Malik's true identity are not known and reports of his death could not be independently verified. The Foreign Office said it was aware of reports of the death of a British national, but could not confirm their legitimacy due to the lack of consular presence in Syria. He is just the latest in a long line of British killed fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq in recent months - many of them having travelled to join the group after its declaration of a so-called caliphate in the vast swaths of territory it controls, and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's self-appointment as a caliph. The number of British deaths has risen dramatically towards the end of the year, as the fighter's naive expectations of Call of Duty-style warfare are replaced by the brutal reality of fierce battles with the group's enemies: Al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, the Free Syrian Army, Syrian and Iraqi regime armies, Sunni tribes, Shia militias, and a number of other rebel groups in the area. Sick: Former supervisor at Primark, 25-year-old Muhammad Hamidur Rahman (left), was one of four Portsmouth jihadis killed fighting in Syria. In November Kabir Ahmed (right), a 30-year-old father of three from Derby, blew himself up in Iraq killing eight people and injuring 15 others . Their fight is made even harder by near constant airstrikes from warplanes sent by the U.S. and its Arab allies in Syria; and from America, Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands, Australia and of course Britain itself in neighbouring Iraq. The greatest number of Britons killed fighting for ISIS, however, have been killed in street battles with Kurdish YPG and Peshmerga troops, who have been making huge gains in northern Syria and western Iraq since September, having lost vast swaths of territory to ISIS earlier in the year. In recent weeks there have been a number of reports of British militants expressing their desire to return to Britain having grown disillusioned with the reality of fighting for ISIS. Professor Peter Neumann from King's College London's International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation says he was contacted by a man representing a group of up to 30 British militants, all of whom wanted to return to the UK but were worried about being arrested on their return. He believes as many as a fifth of British fighters in the country could be trying to find a way out of their current situation and claimed less-hardened jihadists could be used to show would-be recruits that the reality of battle may not match the image presented by ISIS propaganda.","Young man appeared in T-shirt in a Twitter photo holding assault rifle .

"ISIS is urging supporters in the West to kill civilians by any means possible - including using Ebola as a chemical weapon and stabbing people with poisoned needles, a senior Spanish politician claims. Francisco Martinez, Spain's state secretary for security, said he is taking the threats seriously after uncovering conversations in which jihadis discuss carrying out so-called 'lone wolf' attacks. Speaking before lawmakers in parliament yesterday, Mr Martinez said would-be militants are using chat rooms to explore the best ways to carry out terror attacks, adding that the conversations prove ISIS considers the internet to be 'an extension of the battlefield'. Terrorists: Spanish investigators have identified 'many examples' of Islamic State sympathisers discussing the use of the deadly Ebola virus as a chemical weapon . Mr Martinez, the second in command in Spain's interior ministry, said investigators had identified 'many examples' of threats to use Ebola  as a chemical weapon. He pointed out three specific cases in which aspiring jihadis 'linked to ISIS' had used internet chat rooms to seriously discuss the viability of harnessing the deadly virus and other toxins as part of a new terrorism offensive, according to Spain's RTVE media company. One conversation, identified as having taken place between ISIS sympathisers in mid-September, referred to 'the use of Ebola as a poisonous weapon against the United States,' he claimed. Another conversation reportedly saw militants working out how best to employ 'deadly chemical products' they had stolen from laboratories. Investigation: Francisco Martinez (centre) - Spain's secretary of state for security - said ISIS is urging its supporters in the West to kill civilians by any means possible - including using Ebola as a chemical weapon . Threat: Members of a medical team  carry the body of an Ebola victim in Sierra Leone. Would-be terrorists are now using the internet to discuss how to harness the virus for use in terrorist attacks, it has been claimed . Mr Martinez went on to say that a spokesman for the terror group had also taken to the internet to urge supporters to kill Westerners by any means possible - adding that he had suggested 'poisonous injections' as a possible method. Islamic State militants view the internet as 'an extension of the battlefield', according to Mr Martinez. He said the terror group has identified six benefits to having a strong online presence: 'Threatening enemies through propaganda, preparing operations, exchanging information, ideological training, recruiting new members and acquiring finance'. Earlier this month, Jeh Johnson - US Homeland Security Secretary- dismissed suggestions ISIS could be planning to use the Ebola virus to attack the United States. 'We've seen no specific credible intelligence that [Isis] is attempting to use any sort of disease or virus to attack our homeland,' he said in a speech to the Association of the United States Army. A harrowing video has emerged showing the charred and dismembered bodies of up to 75 people killed when a Syrian regime helicopter dropped two barrel bombs on a refugee camp yesterday. The graphic footage - filmed at a displaced persons camp in the northern province of Idlib - shows the bloodied corpses of women and children, while passers-by scramble to save the wounded. 'It's a massacre of refugees,' a voice off camera can be heard saying, while tents that act as makeshift homes burn all around him and dazed children wander the camp looking for relatives. Barrel bombs, which are banned by international law, are crudely made containers filled with nails, metal shrapnel and explosive material that are dropped from low altitude. Horror: The graphic footage - filmed at a displaced persons camp in the northern province of Idlib - shows the bloodied corpses of women and children, while passers-by scramble to save the wounded . The video begins with the cameraman racing up to the bombed camp on a motorcycle and finding a scene of total devastation. 'Let the whole world see this, they are displaced people. Look at them, they are civilians, displaced civilians. They fled the bombardment,' he said. The man runs into the camp and screams at others to pick up the bodies, trying to convince them that the people on the ground with limbs missing might still survive if taken to hospital. 'This one's good! This one's good!' he shouts, telling two men to carry a limp body with one leg hanging from strips of flesh to a nearby pickup truck. 'Pick him up from the stomach not the leg,' he screams. Victims: Witnesses and paramedics scramble to save the lives of those injured in the twin blasts . Harrowing: 'It's a massacre of refugees,' a voice off camera can be heard saying, while tents that act as makeshift homes burn all around him and dazed children wander the camp looking for relatives . A man in another video of the Abedin camp, which houses people who had escaped fighting in neighbouring Hama province, said as many as 75 people had died. Syrian state media did not mention the bombing. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks violence in the civil war, said it heard reports that 10 civilians had been killed. Details of the attack could not be independently confirmed. Human rights groups say the Assad regime has previously dropped barrel bombs on densely populated neighbourhoods. These acts are in defiance of a U.N. Security Council resolution banning their use.","Francisco Martinez said Spain is taking threats made online seriously .

"Free to go: Law firm worker Sarah Willis was cleared of killing her boyfriend at Preston Crown Court today . A teenage Muslim covert accused of knifing her Asian boyfriend to death after rows over her 'tight and short clothing' has been cleared of his killing. Law firm worker Sarah Willis, 19, insisted BT engineer Bilal Saddique accidentally stabbed himself during the final row of their turbulent relationship. Mr Saddique, a strict Muslim, had kept their relationship a secret and had referred to his girlfriend as a 'bitch' and a 'slag', Preston Crown Court. On the night of his death during a vicious argument between the pair Ms Willis said Mr Saddique pulled her by her hair and taunted her by saying he had been having sex with someone else. When she started collecting her possessions, including knives, to leave their shared home he goaded her and dared her to stab him, saying 'come on hit me, come on f****** stab me, if you hate me'. As the vicious row ensued Willis said the engineer grabbed her hand, which was holding a knife, and stabbed himself in the thigh  - with the knife almost entirely severing an artery. He died at Royal Blackburn Hospital an hour later from his injuries. Willis, who converted to Islam when she was at school, regularly talked about her boyfriend according to colleagues. She sometimes told them he had bought her expensive handbags and makeup but at other times would complain about him being too controlling. Asma Day, a colleague, described Ms Willis as having a split personality - sometimes being loud and disruptive and other times withdrawn. She said: 'He wanted her to cover up because other men looked at her. She wore Western clothing but always covered her arms and legs. She said she had never been introduced to Bilal's mother and she was conservative and wouldn't accept her. She said they loved each other and were going to get married. He didn't like her wearing tight clothing and short clothes.' After a week-long trial at Preston Crown Court the jury were ordered to find her not guilty of murder by the judge Mr Justice Timothy Holroyde and after a day's deliberations she was found not guilty of manslaughter today. During the court case Ms Willis told of a series of rows between her and Mr Saddique including one in which he bit and dragged her around by the hair and another when he became enraged at her opening a Facebook account. On one occasion when Mr Saddique was away in Pakistan Ms Willis was seen wearing 'bright lips' and more revealing and glamorous clothes and had appeared happy and 'less disruptive.' Ms Willis claimed Mr Saddique was controlling and the court heard he had kept their relationship private . He would refer to Ms Willis as 'slag' and 'bi**h' and from time to time would block contact with her on his phone. He also became suspicious of her platonic friendship with a male work colleague after they were photographed together at the office Christmas party in 2013 and he found text messages and read her Facebook account. The court was told last August's tragedy was the climax of the couple's stormy three year on-off relationship which began after Ms Willis converted to Islam when she was a schoolgirl. Mr Saddique who came from a strict Muslim family had been very private about his relationship with her and although he planned to marry her, one friend was unaware of him dating a white girl. Scene: Mr Saddique, 29, died during when he was stabbed in the leg at the home he shared with Sarah Willis  in Blackburn, Lancashire . Describing the moment Mr Saddique stabbed himself, Ms Willis told officers, 'I started to cry and he pulled me towards him. I said ""f***ing hell what have you done"". I don't think he meant to do it. 'He said ""Sarah I feel like I'm going to faint"". I was screaming Bilal Bilal what have you done. I was shouting ""somebody please help"". I think he just did it to scare me I don't think he meant to go that far.' When she was asked by officers what had been her intention she said: 'Nothing just to put the knife in the box and get all my stuff and go, I hate fighting. 'I'm not going to be able to live without him. We have our ups and downs but I love him. I didn't murder Bilal. We were supposed to go on holiday on Friday.' Claim: During bust ups she claimed Mr Saddique told her she needed to 'dress better' and accused her of dressing 'like a slag' Earlier Mr Saddique's former girlfriend Rebecca Hamilton-Drullard said his relationship with Ms Willis was 'very much on off' - although he did want to marry her. In a statement she said: 'He would call her a slag because she was getting lifts from Asian guys. Bilal told me he talked about the possibility of marriage but had not introduced her to his family. 'He was upset because she told her mother and friends that they were engaged. He said she was possessive, manipulative and controlling and deluded for making things up. 'While in Pakistan she said she couldn't eat and lost a stone and couldn't eat without him. She was accusing him of getting married whilst in Pakistan and didn't trust him. He bought her a black Punto so she wouldn't need to get lifts home.'

"The Department of Homeland Security quickly denied claims on Friday from a watchdog group that the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has militants stationed in Juarez, Mexico who plan an 'imminent' attack against the United States. A DHS spokesman was bewildered, telling MailOnline that 'we are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim' made by Judicial Watch, a center-right group. 'In Mexico?' the official said on the phone. 'I haven't seen that at all.' An hour before Judicial Watch's report surfaced, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said publicly that his agency and the FBI 'are unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland' from the terror network. And during a late-morning media briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said flatly that 'the most detailed intelligence assessment that I can offer from here is that there is no evidence or indication right now that [ISIS] is actively plotting to attack the United States homeland. That’s true right now.' Scroll down for video . Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, shown this week in an unrelated TV interview, said his organization had credible information suggesting that the terror group ISIS is planning car-bomb attacks in the US . 'Unaware of any specific, credible threat': Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Friday that the US doesn't have any intelligence supporting an ISIS-threat theory, but Fitton insisted 'you could drive a truck bomb through' loopholes in his denial . But Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in an interview that his sources were 'golden' and called the government's insistence 'so dishonest.' 'It's a non-denial denial,' he told MailOnline. Citing Johnson's use of words like 'credible' and 'specific,' Fitton said, 'You could drive a truck bomb through that loophole. DHS has not denied our story.' Judicial Watch reported Friday, based on sources that it would not identify to MailOnline out of concern for their safety, that ISIS terrorists are 'planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.' The group said a 'warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack' had been issued to 'agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies,'instructing them 'to aggressively work all possible leads and sources' to prevent it. It also claimed the commander of Fort Bliss, a U.S. Army base near the Juarez border crossing, has been briefed on the threat. 'This is dire,' Fitton said. 'Look, this needs to be – It's impossible for me to overstate the seriousness of the threat.' 'The president calls ISIS a Jayvee terror organization, and now we have a report they're in Juarez, planning attacks with al-Qaeda.' Fitton predicted that the federal government may be playing a stalling game, with the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks approaching in less than two weeks. 'This may be a case of them saying two weeks from now that they took care of the threat the Judicial Watch was saying [was there],' he said. Later in the afternoon the Fox News Channel and Breitbart.com both published  stories about a situation report distributed to law enforcement agencies by the Texas Department of Public Safety. Fox didn't respond to questions about whether the documents were the same, but a Breitbart reporter said they were. Fitton said Judicial Watch did not base its reporting on the same bulletin they cited. Map: The Department of Homeland Security quickly denied claims on Friday from a watchdog group that the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has militants stationed in Juarez, Mexico . ISIS, a fearsome and deadly terror group that dominates much of Iraq and Syria, now includes some militants with passports from the US and other Western nations, a fact that worries American intelligence agencies . Nope: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said US intelligence services have 'no evidence or indication right now that [ISIS] is actively plotting to attack the United States homeland' 'The Texas bulletin is not inconsistent with our information,' he said, but 'our story highlights more specific and imminent warnings.' 'It would not surprise us if it turns out the Texas bulletin is a watered-down-for-public-consumption-version of what our sources report.' Fox News described a 'three-page bulletin, entitled ""ISIS Interest on the US Southwest Border"".' 'Social media account holders believed to be ISIS militants and propagandists have called for unspecified border operations,' the bulletin read, according to Fox, 'or they have sought to raise awareness that illegal entry through Mexico is a viable option.' Breitbart had published its own report two hours earlier, reproducing a portion of one page. That page showed a recent video stunt in which conservative filmmaker James O'Keefe demonstrated the ease with which a terrorist could cross the Rio Grande River by donning an Osama bin Laden mask and wading from Mexico into Texas. Neither news outlet claimed the law enforcement bulletin articulated any warnings about an imminent terror attack. Cuidad Juarez: The crime-ridden Mexican border town opposite El Paso, Texas has become a staging ground for illegal immigrants – including drug cartel members and narcotics smugglers – to enter the US illegally . Judicial Watch claimed the commander of Fort Bliss, an Army base in Texas, has been briefed on . But Fitton stuck to his guns, insisting that the threat of an ISIS incursion into Texas – Juarez abuts El Paso with just the Rio Grande in between – is real. 'We take it seriously,' he said. 'We didn't put it out there lightly.' In a nod to his organization's frequent alarms about border security in America's southwest, he suggested that if the Obama administration was waving reporters away from the story, it was in order to draw attention away from illegal immigration concerns. 'I can't say who in Washington knows about this,' Fitton said. 'But to be sure, this is exactly the type of information that this administration would have an interest in minimizing, downplaying and withholding, to distract from the disaster on the border and the national security threat there.' Earnest, President Barack Obama's chief spokesman, told reporters on Friday that America's border crisis is over 'for now.'","Three online reports warned Friday of ISIS involvement south of the border, including one from Judicial Watch that cited 'imminent' car-bomb attacks .

"Celebrities are well-known for their gruelling fitness regimes and healthy-eating lifestyles. So it comes as little surprise that A-list events such as the BAFTAs will have various dietary whims to cater for. In fact, organisers at this year’s awards dinner have revealed they will now be serving a vegan menu, for stars who are meat-free. The 'plant-based' meal will feature a starter of quinoa salad with radishes, broad beans, asparagus, peas and a lemon and olive oil dressing. Best leading actor Bafta nominees Benedict Cumberbatch for The Imitation Game and Eddie Redmayne for The Theory of Everything will be attending the awards dinner at Grosvenor House Hotel on February 8 . The Bafta banquet table at London's Grosvenor House Hotel will seat eight people . Next up will be a roasted butternut squash and sun-blushed tomato lasagne with wilted spinach, roasted pepper and sage as the main course. Details of the dessert have not been revealed. The menu also has bespoke gluten and dairy-free dishes for those on dietary restrictions. The BAFTA dinner, which takes place on Sunday 8 February at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London was created by Grosvenor House's executive chef Nigel Boschetti and BAFTA head chef Anton Manganaro. PETA director Mimi Bekhechi said: 'Interest in vegan eating is skyrocketing in the UK and beyond. The BAFTA organisers have created a meat-free menu for vegan celebrities . ‘With some of the world's best chefs, including Jamie Oliver and Wolfgang Puck, getting creative with cruelty-free cooking, we're sure that guests attending the BAFTAs are in for a treat.' Karin Ridgers, founder of VeggieVision.tv, said: ‘It’s great that the BAFTAs are going vegan with so many celebrities now cutting out meat and dairy. ‘As more awareness is being created the celebrities know that they want the best and healthiest food choice so they can remain in the best shape, give the best performances and look amazing too. ‘A vegan diet is bursting with great fresh foods and provides everything our bodies need to thrive. ‘The menu sounds delicious, fresh vegetables packed with vitamins, quinoa and peas packed with protein and oils too. A low fat, no cholesterol energy-boosting choice that I feel will be chosen by many celebrities vegan or not,' she added. While vegans are tucking into meat-free delights, nominees including Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne, Jake Gyllenhaaal, and Reese Witherspoon are some of the guests who will be feasting on mouth-watering dishes including salmon and crab terrine and braised short rib at the event.

"In the Nineties, Sara Cox gained a reputation for being a loudmouth ladette who enjoyed staying out partying and drinking pints. But these days the Radio 2 DJ is more likely to be seen running round the park with her Maltese Terrier, Beano, than falling out of a bar with Zoe Ball. Sara told MailOnline she couldn't be happier with life as a married mother-of-three and now she prefers hitting the gym rather than a night club. Scroll down for video . Sara Cox, pictured with her Maltese Terrier, Beano, said she's fitter and healthier as she turns 40 thanks to taking him for walks and runs, while she also loves hitting the gym . She said: 'I like feeling fit, I don't drink much anymore unless it's a special occasion. I love the gym buzz I get from a workout.' She added that she eats healthily and doesn't diet as she wants to promote eating well to her children - Lola, 10, Isaac, six, and Renee, four. 'Once you have kids you need to have broccoli knocking about. You can't have a rock n' roll fridge full of vodka, that's not real life. I eat well and the kids eat well too,' she said, . 'But I'm not dieting nibbling on a wafer, you have to be careful about that when you have daughters. I want them to see that I go to the gym and then come back and eat healthily rather than dieting.' Sara, who married Ben Cyzer, the father of her two youngest children in 2013, turned 40 last December and admitted she's indifferent to the fuss made over the milestone. The DJ had a reputation for staying out late drinking in her twenties, pictured right with wine in hand in 1998, but she said now she only drinks on special occasions, pictured left this week with Beano . 'Turning 40 is always made a thing of for women, it's quite sexist as it isn't like that for men,' she said. 'I feel like women are made to feel it's a big deal. They should either put on a brave face or rush to Google the nearest Botox clinic.' For Sara, turning 40 was 'the best birthday I ever had' as she had fun at a party and then went away with her family for a few days where she visited a spa and went horse riding. She added that age has brought her more self-confidence as well as domestic bliss. 'My career is going well, I have three healthy kids and a lovely husband so it is easy for me to feel pleased with my lot whether I am 40 or not,' she said. 'I am in happy place, I'm lucky. 'As you get older, you care less about what people think and have more confidence, I'm also fitter and healthy now.' Sara, pictured at an event in London this week, said celebrations for her 40th last December were the 'best birthday I ever had' as she had a party and a weekend away with her husband and three children . Now she loves keeping fit, Sara is passionate about keeping her family active too. She said one of the best ways to do this is for everyone to take Beano for a walk in the park. 'Once you get the kids out the door and to the park they have a brilliant time away from TV and iPad screens,' she said. Dog lover Sara had Basset Hound Snoop till his death in 2013 and then got Beano - who she loves to take everywhere with her (he's even passed his BBC health and safety test so he can join her at work). He gets plenty of exercise on family dog walks and joins Sara on a weekly five mile run - but many pets aren't so lucky. Research has found that almost half (43 per cent) of the UK's dog population is now classed as overweight. Dog lover Sara, pictured with her first dog Snoop who died in 2013, is a brand ambassador for Pedigree . The study by Pedigree found that two thirds of owners with overweight dogs didn't realise their pet's health was at risk because of their size, and more than a third of owners admitted to making excuses for not meeting their dog's recommended levels of exercise. As a brand ambassador for Pedigree, Sara is now helping them launch their Pedigree Tracks App which gives owners an exercise and eating plan based on their dog's breed, age and weight. Sara said: 'Some owners can love their dogs too much and give them too many treats. And in the winter it can be hard to get out and take them for a walk. This is a fun way to keep your dog healthy.' Sara Cox and her dog Beano are working with Pedigree to launch the new Pedigree Tracks App, a personalised simple and effective tool to help owners understand their dog's exercise and nutritional requirements.

"Tragic Bobbi Kristina Brown was on the run from authorities when she was discovered unconscious in the bath, Daily Mail Online can reveal exclusively. A warrant for Whitney Houston’s fragile daughter was issued on 28th January by the Alpharetta Municipal Court because she had failed to attend a court hearing two weeks earlier. Bobbi Kristina had been stopped by traffic officers on September 9 last year because she was driving her luxury Lexus IS250 sports car with an expired registration in Alpharetta, Georgia. The 21-year-old was ordered to attend a court on January 14 to answer the charges – a minor offence that carries a maximum penalty of a $2,500 fine, as well as having the car impounded. Repeat offenders face up to 12-months in jail. Scroll down for video . Under cover: Two days before Bobbi Kristina Brown was found unconscious in her tub, a warrant  was issued on January 28 by the Alpharetta Municipal Court because she had failed to attend a court hearing two weeks earlier . Drive: Bobbi Kristina behind the wheel of the recently smashed up Lexis on January 19.  her partner Nick Gordon had been driving the car. She was supposed to be in court on January 14 to answer charges that she was driving with an expired registration . The Lexus allegedly wrecked by Bobbi Kristina's partner Nick Gordon. Cops say Gordon smashed up the luxury grey sports sedan's front end in a nasty accident near their home in Roswell, Georgia in early January. Bobbi Kristina was a passenger at the time and drove the vehicle home while her beau was arrested on a failure to appear warrant in an unrelated case. The car's badly crumpled hood can be seen in these exclusive photos . But Miss Brown failed to appear at the Alpharetta Municipal Court and the judge, the Honorable Lee Whiteside, issued the bench warrant for her immediate arrest. The warrant for Bobbi K Brown, and directed to ‘all the Sheriffs, Deputy Sheriffs, Constables, Coroners, and Police Officers’, states: ‘An accusation has been filed under oath in the Municipal Court of Alpharetta against the above said for; Failure To Appear. ‘Whereas, upon the call of said case in its order on I/14/2015 in open court the said defendant Failed To Appear and the bond given in the said case was forfeited. ‘Now, therefore, you and each of you are commanded in the state, to apprehend the said defendant and bring him/her before me to be dealt with as the law directs and to make a diligent search for all and singular, both real and personal, of the said defendant, or so much thereof as may be sufficient for the payment of all legal cost and expenses that will be incurred.’ Upon arrest Whitney Houston’s daughter would have been immediately put in jail and would spend up to 72 hours behind bars until a hearing could be set for her to answer the charges. A source with knowledge of the charges told Daily Mail Online the warrant was issued for Bobbi Kristina Brown at the end of January. ‘She failed to show up in court for a traffic offence. She was driving with expired registration. ‘It is a minor charge but not appearing in court is a serious offence. ‘Because she never showed up she would have been sent straight to jail when she was arrested.’ The warrant has now been dismissed due to ‘recent events’, Alpharetta Police Department confirmed in a statement issued on February 5. Spokesman George Gordon said: ‘I confirm the Alpharetta Department of Public Safety had an active warrant from Ms Bobbi Kristina Brown. ‘The warrant was issued because she failed to show up for a mandatory court appearance after being cited for operating a motor vehicle with expired tag registration. ‘The warrant was issued due to her failure to appear in court at the mandated date and time. ‘In light of recent events involving Ms Bobbi Kristina Brown, we are not focused on the warrant issue. In fact, we requested the court to recall the warrant and dismiss it – which they did. ‘The important issue is we hope her friends and family find a measure of comfort during this difficult period.’ The warrant provides further evidence of the chaotic lifestyle the 21-year-old was leading in the time up to her current crisis. In 2012 she was involved in three car crashes, one of which totaled her partner Nick Gordon’s Chevrolet Camaro. Ms Brown rammed the $24,000 sports car, causing severe damage to front of the vehicle, as she tried to back into a parking space. Police issued Ms Brown with a traffic citation for ‘failure to maintain lane’ following another incident. She lost control of her car, hitting several small trees and drove over a curb, when she roared out of her apartment complex in Alpharetta, Georgia. Bobbi Kristina's partner Nick Gordon is due in court in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday to answer charges of driving recklessly. Bobbi and Nick Gordon looked very happy together. Then tragedy struck . Bobbi Kristina miraculously escaped unscathed after allegedly wrecking Nick's Chevy Camaro in 2012. Police conducted an official accident investigation and believe Bobbi Kristina lost control of her car while making a turn out of her Alpharetta, Georgia apartment complex . Gordon, 25, was caught driving at over twice the speed limit along a suburban road in November 2012. He was doing 82 miles an hour in a 35 miles an hour zone near to his home in Alpharetta, Georgia. Now Gordon must appear at the Fulton County State Court to answer the charges. The indictment states: 'I, Carmen D Smith, Solicitor General for the County of Fulton, State of Georgia, in the name and on behalf of the citizens of Georgia do hereby charge and accuse Nicholas Gordon with the offense of Speeding, a misdemeanor, for that said accused in the County of Fulton, State of Georgia did on or about November 28, 2012, while on the operation of a motor vehicle drive said vehicle at a speed of 82 miles per hour, the lawful maximum speed limit on said highway being 35, in violation of O.C.G.A 40-6-181, contrary to the laws of this State, the good order, peace and dignity thereof.'","A warrant for Bobbi Kristina Brown was issued on January 28 - just two days before she was found in her tub unconscious .

"An 1892 painting by Paul Gauguin of two Tahitan girls has sold for almost £200million - the largest amount ever paid for a single work of art. Qatar is understood to have bought  Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?) from the Swiss Rudolf Staechelin Family Trust to be hung in its state-run museums. But the oil-rich country is yet to confirm the purchase, reported in the Wall Street Journal. Paul Gauguin's 1892 painting Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When will you marry ?) has sold to Qatar for almost £200million, it has been reported . Rudolf Starchelin, a retired Sotheby's executive who lives in Basel, Switzerland, where the painting has been kept in a museum for the lastfew decades, refused to be drawn on to who or for how much the painting had been sold. But, if the reported value is true, it will mean Qatar has broken its own world record. in 2011, it spent £160million on Paul Cezanne's Two Card Players, after winning a bidding war. At the time, it was the most ever spent on a single artwork, beating the previous record of £89million (worth £99million today) handed over for Jackson Pollock’s painting, No 5, 1948, which sold during a boom in the art market in 2006. The Cezanne has remained out of view since it was bought, however. The oil-rich Gulf state previously spent £160million on Paul Cezanne's Two Card Players (pictured), which was the world's most expensive until its latest purchase . The Gauguin sold this week, which depicts two young women in a landscape of vivid colours, has been interpreted to represent the conflict between the two realms of European convention and Polynesian custom. Oil-rich Qatar has acquired many Western works of art in recent years, including modern pieces by Mark Rothko and Damien Hirst. Philip Hoffman, chief executive of London-based consultancy organisation, the Fine Art Fund Group, said: ‘It is an amazing picture but this seems a huge amount of money. But in the Impressionist market a few “megapictures” will always fetch over $100million (£65million).’ Mr Hoffman added that such art works sell to a select group of as few as 20 people, who compete around the world to buy the most expensive pieces. The buyer of the Gauguin was identified as Qatar Museums by two art dealers in the New York Times. The emirate’s museum has spent more than $1billion (£650million) on prestigious works. Mr Hoffman said: ‘We’re seeing a huge amount of build-up of private wealth, and we’re seeing those people allocate funds disproportionately to art collections. People think if they buy the best you’ll never lose money. It has become the ultimate status symbol to be surrounded by $500million or $1billion worth of art which no one else can have.’ Ben Street, an art historian, said: ‘This is an iconic Gauguin; it’s beautiful. He is certainly among the most sought-after painters in the world.’ Qatar's museums are headed by Sheikha Al Mayassa Bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Tani, pictured, the sister of the Emir . Its acquisition is a coup for Qatar: the country, which is preparing to host the football World Cup in 2022, has developed a reputation for buying expensive art work over the last few years. Its museum service is headed by Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the U.S.-educated sister of the Emir of Qatar. She is understood to be keen to expand her country's artistic portfolio, revealing in an interview last year with the Qatar Museums: 'What always remains from the greatest civilisations and histories is their buildings and artefacts.'","Nafea Faa Ipoipo (When Will You Marry?) reportedly bought by Qatar .

"The ex-girlfriend of Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle has asked a judge for a protective order against him after claiming he pointed a gun at her friend in front of their young son. Dalia Jacobs called 911 from a hotel in Wichita on Tuesday to report that her ex was 'out of control' and the following day, she filed a petition for a protective order in Sedgwick County, Kansas. In the petition, she explained that ahead of the 911 call, Randle had become angry with her in front of their son, Daniel, walked to his car, retrieved a handgun and pointed it at her friend. 'He told me at this point that he was going to ""blast the vehicle"",' Jacobs wrote in the filing seen by the Dallas News - but instead he allegedly smashed the car window with his fist. Scroll down for video . Accusations: Joseph Randle of the Dallas Cowboys became angry and violent during a recent argument with his ex-girlfriend in front of their son, she has claimed in a court petition . 'Glass splatters everywhere,' Jacobs told KWCH as she became tearful as she recounted the fight. 'There's glass in my son's hair. It hit him and that's when he starts crying. I just grab my son and I'm like, ""I hope you're okay baby"". I thought he got cut or something.' In the filing, she added: 'The defendant has a violent temper and gets angry quickly... [he] has a history of being both physically and emotionally abusive towards me.' She told KWCH that the incident came after Randle has repeatedly failed to pay child support. Wichita Police did not find a weapon inside Randle's hotel room when they arrived, but suggested that another person might have left with it. But they did find 'a small amount of green botanical substance' in the hotel room and initially charged the football player with unlawful possession of a controlled substance. But the charges have now been dropped because police received 'inconsistent stories', Police Lieutenant James Espinoza told the Dallas News - but the investigation is not over. Fears: Dalia Jacobs became emotional as she recounted how Randle smashed a car window over her son . Anger: Jacobs, pictured with her ex-boyfriend, has also accused him of failing to pay child support . Scene: Police were called to their hotel, pictured, on Tuesday but officers did not find a gun. He was cited for having a controlled substance but the charges have since been dropped . 'We're still actively investigating this incident. We take domestic violence very serious,' Espinoza said. 'We want to have time to put all the facts together and to present it to the DA's office for all the charges that could be filed.' On Thursday, Randle tweeted that he's 'learning the value of a good lawyer each day' before adding that he should watch out for the company he keeps - but this was later deleted. Randle's agent, Erik Burkhardt, said that Randle had not been arrested but was merely given a ticket before officers left, the Dallas News reported. 'There was zero 'violence' of any kind, domestic or otherwise. He was asking 3 ppl to exit his room, who didn't want to leave,' he wrote online. 'There was zero 'violence' of any kind, domestic or otherwise. He was asking 3 ppl to exit his room, who didn't want to leave.' A hearing for the protective order is scheduled for February 19.

"The first stars twinkled into life some 100 million years later than was previously thought, new research suggests. Data from Esa's Planck space telescope indicates that star formation began about 550 million years after the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe. This is based on observing the universe's earliest light, and it could alter our understanding of how the cosmos as we know it today came to be. Europe's Planck satellite has revealed the first stars were 100 million years younger than thought, nbased on data from the Planck satellite. Shown is the interaction between interstellar dust in the Milky Way and the structure of our Galaxy’s magnetic field, as detected by Esa's Planck satellite over the entire sky . Before the stars began to form, described as the 'reionisation' epoch, the cosmos occupied a dark age devoid of visible light. Reionisation refers to the way energetic ultraviolet light from the first stars split hydrogen atoms into their component protons and electrons. The Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago was when matter, space and even time exploded into existence. Previously scientists had thought that the first stars began to shine 440 million years after the Big Bang. The new results, still to be confirmed by further measurements, suggest that they are actually 100 million years younger. Planck, launched in 2009, was designed to study the 'cosmic microwave background' (CMB) - the faint radiation echo left by the Big Bang - with unprecedented accuracy. It was decommissioned in 2013 after exhausting its supply of liquid helium coolant. 'According to Planck's observations, stars may be younger than believed, in bearing with other independent astrophysical indicators, and this finding may have major consequences on our attempts to understand the dark components of the universe,' said senior scientist Dr Carlo Baccigalupi, from the International School of Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy. The 'dark components' consist of invisible dark matter and dark energy, both of which are still unsolved mysteries whose natures are unknown. Before the first stars began to form (illustration shown), described as the 'reionisation' epoch, the cosmos occupied a dark age devoid of visible light. Reionisation refers to the way energetic ultraviolet light from the first stars split hydrogen atoms into their component protons and electrons . Light is polarised when it vibrates in a preferred direction, something that may arise as a result of photons - the particles of light - bouncing off other particles. This is exactly what happened when the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation originated in the early universe. Initially, photons were trapped in a hot, dense soup of particles that, by the time the universe was a few seconds old, consisted mainly of electrons, protons and neutrinos. Owing to the high density, electrons and photons collided with one another so frequently that light could not travel any significant distant before bumping into another electron, making the early universe extremely ‘foggy’. Slowly but surely, as the cosmos expanded and cooled, photons and the other particles grew farther apart, and collisions became less frequent. This had two consequences: electrons and protons could finally combine and form neutral atoms without them being torn apart again by an incoming photon, and photons had enough room to travel, being no longer trapped in the cosmic fog. Once freed from the fog, the light was set on its cosmic journey that would take it all the way to the present day, where telescopes like Planck detect it as the CMB. But the light also retains a memory of its last encounter with the electrons, captured in its polarisation. The scientists, who report their findings in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, said more Planck data was still to be analysed that should provide a clearer picture of the evidence. Scientists from the Planck collaboration have published the results from the analysis of these data in a large number of scientific papers over the past two years, confirming the standard cosmological picture of our universe with ever greater accuracy. Recently, data from Planck was used to discredit the Bicep2 results, which had initially been thought to have found evidence for the cosmic inflation of the universe. 'But there is more: the CMB carries additional clues about our cosmic history that are encoded in its 'polarisation',' explains Jan Tauber, ESA's Planck project scientist. 'Planck has measured this signal for the first time at high resolution over the entire sky, producing the unique maps released today.' This is a visualisation of the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB, as detected by Esa's Planck satellite. Credit: Esa and the Planck Collaboration . Planck, launched in 2009, was designed to study the 'cosmic microwave background' (CMB) - the faint radiation echo left by the Big Bang - with unprecedented accuracy. It was decommissioned in 2013 after exhausting its supply of liquid helium coolant. Shown is an illustration of the satellite . Shown is a visualisation of the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background, or CMB, as detected by Esa's Planck satellite on a small patch of the sky measuring 20º across . Planck's polarisation data confirm the details of the standard cosmological picture determined from its measurement of the CMB temperature fluctuations, but add an important new answer to a fundamental question: when were the first stars born? 'After the CMB was released, the universe was still very different from the one we live in today, and it took a long time until the first stars were able to form,' explains Dr Marco Bersanelli of Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy. 'Planck's observations of the CMB polarisation now tell us that these 'Dark Ages' ended some 550 million years after the Big Bang - more than 100 million years later than previously thought.' The Dark Ages ended as the first stars began to shine. And as their light interacted with gas in the universe, more and more of the atoms were turned back into their constituent particles: electrons and protons. This key phase in the history of the cosmos is known as the 'epoch of reionisation'. Dr Bersanelli added: 'While these 100 million years may seem negligible compared to the universe's age of almost 14 billion years, they make a significant difference when it comes to the formation of the first stars.' In March last year, scientists believed they had glimpsed - for the first time - the rapid expansion of the universe just after the Big Bang, a theory called cosmic inflation. But since then, the Bicep2 findings have been repeatedly called in to question, with many saying they did not show what they appeared to. And now the final nail has been put in the coffin, as new data this month revealed that the initial finding was due to the effects of dust in our galaxy - and not cosmic inflation. The latest revelations were made using data from Esa’s Planck satellite. The findings were not entirely a surprise - but will still be a disappointment for anyone holding out hope that Bicep2 was correct. The initial results were made using an extremely sensitive detector on an Antarctic telescope. The team thought they had found a polarisation of light that would have proved the theory of cosmic inflation. To make sure the signal they were detecting was correct, the team subtracted the lensing effect of massive galaxies. But at the time, some scientists said the team had not correctly accounted for interstellar dust in our galaxy. And now, using data from the Planck satellite, which characterised dust in the galaxy, it seems this fear has been confirmed.","Europe's Planck satellite reveals the first stars were younger than thought .

"NBC News anchor Brian Williams' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism in the wake of his own admission on Wednesday that he lied about being aboard a helicopter that was hit by enemy fire during the Iraq war. Despite a swift apology on his Nightly News program, Williams is at the center of a media firestorm after it emerged that his old war story that he has retold numerous times over the past 12 years has become increasingly exaggerated. Williams was forced to apologize this week after claiming in a report on Friday that the chinook he was aboard in Iraq had been hit by enemy fire. Scroll down for video . NBC News anchor Brian Williams' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism after he admitted to lying over an old Iraq war story . New Orleans' famous French Quarter escaped flooding during Hurricane Katrina as it is located on the highest part of the city . On Wednesday Williams blamed his mistake on the 'fog of memory over 12 years', but evidence has emerged since that Williams has repeatedly mis-told the story including to late night host David Letterman in 2013. The anchor's previous credibility as a highly regarded journalist is based partly on his reporting from inside the New Orleans Superdome in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005. The major story broke just months after Williams replaced Tom Brokaw as NBC News' anchor and his reporting from the devastation of New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award. In the wake of the scandal over William's war story apology, attention is now turning to comments he made about what exactly he witnessed in New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina. 'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country...I beat that storm. I was there before it arrived. 'I rode it out with people who later died in the Superdome,' he said in an interview in 2006, just a year after the hurricane. The story was first broken by the GotNews.com news blog. Williams' reporting from New Orleans received countless plaudits and helped earn NBC a Peabody Award but is now being reevaluated with some skepticism following his Iraq war story climb down . According to the New Orleans Advocate, Williams claim isn't accurate as the French Quarter of the city – one of the highest parts of the city – was never flooded. The Advocate has also taken Williams to task over another Katrina-related claim that he made in an interview last year with her predecessor Brokaw. In the interview Williams claims that he had caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters during his stay in New Orleans. 'My week, two weeks there was not helped by the fact that I accidentally ingested some of the floodwater,' he said. 'I became very sick with dysentery, our hotel was overrun with gangs, I was rescued in the stairwell of a five-star hotel in New Orleans by a young police officer. We are friends to this day. And uh, it just was uh, I look back at total agony.' Those claims have also had cold water poured on them. The anchor is also in trouble over claims that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters while reporting on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 . 'I saw a lot of people with cuts and bruises and such, but I don't recall a single, solitary case of gastroenteritis during Katrina or in the whole month afterward,' Dr. Brobson Lutz, a former city health director told the Advocate. A spokeswoman from the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said contaminated water sources are a possible 'transmission points' for dysentery, but that the agency doesn't track it. Elsewhere, conservative blog, SooperMexican, posted video clips on Thursday that apparently showed Williams telling two completely different stories about a New Orleans man who committed suicide during the Katrina. One clip from the Brokaw interview has Williams claim that he personally witnessed the death, while in a second clip, Williams said he 'heard the story of a man killing himself falling from the upper deck' of the New Orleans Superdome. In the same interview with Brokaw, he praised Williams, saying that with his reporting during Katrina, Williams 'took ownership, if you will, of the anchor chair' following a longtime stint as Brokaw's understudy. In a 2014 interview with Tom Brokaw, right, Williams claimed that he caught dysentery from drinking floodwaters in New Orleans - a claim that experts have said is highly unlikely .","Williams' 2006 claim that he saw a dead body float past his hotel window during Hurricane Katrina is drawing fresh skepticism .

"The radical preacher accused of recruiting two Austrian teenage girls to join ISIS has now been blamed for a husband and wife taking their three young daughters to join the terror group. Unemployed benefits claimant Ebu Tejma, 33, was arrested in Vienna in December over claims he is a terror mastermind who helped more than 160 local people join ISIS - including the young jihadi 'poster girls' Samra Kesinovic, 17, and Sabina Selimovic, 16. It was alleged that he had targeted attractive young women in particular so they could become brides for the militants fighting under the Islamic State's chilling black banner. Now Ebu Tejma, whose real name is Mirsad Omerovic, is accused of helping a family of five travel to Syria and join ISIS after relatives reported them missing shortly after the preacher's arrest.

According to local media, Skalic who has Bosnian roots and is known to Austria's counter-terrorism agency for being part of a 'West Balkans fighter' circle, which has links to radical preacher Ebu Tejma . Michaela Subasic converted to Islam after marrying Skalic. Just before disappearing their middle daughter wrote an entry in her school diary in which she said she wanted to visit Mecca and wear a headscarf . The couple are thought to have gone to Syria with their three daughters, Sarah, 11, Ajla, nine, and Enisa, two . Austrian police believe they have now established a link between Ebu Tejma, who remains in custody, and a local family of five who have disappeared and are believed to now be in Syria. Self-employed carpenter Enes Skalic, 35, his wife Michaela, 36, and their three daughters Sarah, 11, Ajla, 9, and Enisa, 2, were reported missing by Michaela's sister after they disappeared from their home in the town of Bregenz in western Austria. Police believe the family may have joined the terrorist group Isis after uncovering the father's links to Islamic extremism. According to local media, Skalic who has Bosnian roots is known to Austria's counter-terrorism agency, the BVT, for being part of a 'West Balkans fighter' circle which has links to Tejma. Skalic's wife converted to Islam after they married and just before disappearing their middle daughter wrote an entry in her school diary in which she said she wanted to make a pilgrimage to Mecca and wear a headscarf. The family were described by local major Helmut Kriegel as 'very discreet' but were struggling to make a living and had put their house up for sale last autumn. Interpol has now issued an international arrest warrant. Radical: Unemployed benefits claimant Ebu Tejma, 33, (pictured) was arrested in Vienna in December over claims he is a terror mastermind who helped more than 160 local people join ISIS . Poster girls: Samra Kesinovic, 17, (left) and Sabina Selimovic, 16, (right) became radicalised through the cell led by unemployed benefits claimant Ebu Tejma . A picture believed to show Sabina Selimovic, 15, with jihadi fighters in Syria: An interview given by the Austrian teenager saying how she feels 'she can really be free' among the extremists may have been given at gunpoint. It is claimed they both later wanted to return home but one was killed and the other vanished . Ebu Tejma was arrested in December, with prosecutors claiming he had recruited hundreds of young people on behalf of the Islamic State terror group. It was claimed that Ebu Tejma had specifically targeted middle class young women of Balkans origin like Kesinovic and Selimovic as prospective brides for the militants. Kesinovic was just 16 and her friend Selimovic 15 when they vanished from their homes in Vienna in April last year. They later posted images of themselves online, showing them both in Syria branding Kalashnikov rifles, and in some cases surrounded by armed men. It is though they first flew to the Turkish capital Ankara before travelling on to southern Turkey. Security officials believe there is a large network of ISIS activists operating in the south of the country helping would-be jihadis to cross into Syria along well-trodden smugglers routes. In December, UN counter-terror officials said intelligence suggests that one of the girls is likely to have been killed, although it wasn't clear which one. The other girl is believed to have gone missing. Vanished: The Austrian girls disappeared one day and just left notes to their parents in their bedrooms. 'Don't look for us, we have gone to fight in the holy war', they read . Horror: In December, UN counter-terror officials said intelligence suggests that one of the girls is likely to have been killed, although it wasn't clear which one. The other girl is believed to have gone missing . Security experts said that Tejma, 33, who lived with his pregnant wife and five children in a council provided flat in Vienna, specialised in targeting young women like Kesinovic and Selimovic. He is accused of standing outside mosques asking men if they had daughters of marriageable age which could be provided to good young men as wives. A security insider also said that ISIS was promising parents with daughters much better social security payments under ISIS than they would get if they remained in Austria. The insider said that with anti-terror activists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ebu Tejma not only recruited the two girls who became the public face of jihad, but was also involved in a further 166 defections of youngsters from Austria to fight for the Islamic State. This is in addition to his alleged fundraising activities that provided a significant sum of money for the terrorists' coffers.","Radical preacher Ebu Tejma, 33, was arrested in Vienna in December .

"It seems a week doesn’t go by without a firm claiming to have designed a Back to the Future-style hoverboard, but the latest device takes this a step further. Dubbed AirBoard, it takes inspiration from Marty McFly’s iconic board, as well as the Segway and even drones to create what its creator calls an ‘all electric personal air vehicle.’ Riders ‘fly’ up to five feet (1.5 metres) in the air on this stand-on craft that moves by reacting to shift’s in the user’s weight. Scroll down for video . AirBoard (pictured) was designed by Latvian-based Elviss Straupenieks and his prototype can carry a person weighing up to 220lbs (100kg) without losing stability. Riders ‘fly’ up to five feet (1.5 metres) in the air on this stand-on craft. Mr Staupenieks is expected to launch the $13,000 (£8,485) AirBoard next year . It can also be remotely controlled using a smartphone app. AirBoard was designed by Latvian-based Elviss Straupenieks and his prototype can carry a person weighing up to 220lbs (100kg) without losing stability.

Dimensions (folder): 30 inches (80cm) by 40 inches (110cm) Maximum weight: 220lbs (100kg) Maximum altitude: Five feet (1.5 metres) Release date: 2016 . Price: $13,000 (£8,485) He told James Day at the Metro that the production model should be able to withstand up to 264lbs (120kg) without losing stability. In theory the board can also be used with heavier weights ‘but it gets shaky’, continued Mr Straupenieks. The board ‘flies’ thanks to four propellers fitted either side of the foot panels. These are powered by four separate electric motors, and each propeller is covered by a metal mesh, for safety reasons. Like a Segway, the board moves in reaction to shifts in the rider’s weight and flight altitude is controlled by an app. Users can also remotely control AirBoard using this app that has been designed to work with the board’s built-in GPS and gyroscope.

The firm didn’t reveal how much the board weighs but said it is made from lightweight aluminium and titanium. AirBoard is expected to cost $13,000 (£8,485) and the app comes with a built-in, location-based security alarm to deter thieves. The firm said AirBoard would be ideal for moving in extreme environments, such as over water and snow or in a desert. It added that military and emergency services could use it for search and rescue missions, or photographers could use it to film shots from the air. It's not to be confused with the AirBoard, from London-based firm AirWheel, which was released last month. A device with the same name was released last month, by London-based firm AirWheel. Its AirBoard costs £499 ($755) and is a self-balancing electric board that remains stationary until a user steps on it. Riders then power the device by leaning forward, and the AirBoard reaches speeds of up to 12mph (19km/h). The AirBoard uses similar technology to that seen on certain eco-friendly cars, and when travelling downhill or slowing, the battery charges itself. The gyroscope in the AirBoard means the spinning wheels are axle-free, so they can move in any direction while also keeping the device constantly balanced. Plus, as soon as user steps down from the waterproof board, it stops moving. AirBoards are available to buy online, or from Harrods.

"A confectionery giant was out Smartie-d by a seven-year-old schoolgirl who spotted an embarrassing spelling blunder on a tube of sweets. Eva Ball was enjoying her favourite chocolate treat when she saw the gaffe on the packaging. The question on the tube read: 'What T might you look at the stars trough?' Makers Nestlé congratulated the youngster after she rightly spotted they had missed out an 'h'. Eva Ball, seven, spotted the embarrassing spelling gaffe on a tube of chocolate Smarties . 'She came running in saying “I've found a spelling mistake,”’ said mother-of-four Allison, 45. 'I thought she couldn't be right but when I looked she was. 'It should be ""through"" - they've missed the ""h"" out. Not a good advert for spelling on children's sweets. 'Eva loves her Smarties and she also loves to read. She is fantastic at it and reads above her age level. 'She reads all kinds of packaging including things like the tomato sauce bottle. 'She was overjoyed when she found it. She was so chuffed with herself. She has still got the tube and won't eat the Smarties.' The schoolgirl from Sheffield, South Yorkshire wrote to chocolate giants Nestlé and received a reply littered with adult business jargon. 'They sent a very corporate letter back,' said Mrs Ball. Nestlé incorrectly printed 'trough' instead of 'through' on the packaging of this tube of Smarties . 'I thought they might have taken a bit more time and written it more for a seven-year-old.' Nestlé has since sent the schoolgirl a £2 voucher to thank her for her efforts, but managed to spell her mother's name wrong in the letter. Eva's father David, a motorcycle dealer, said: 'Eva's a little bookworm. The school have put her on the register for the gifted and talented so it's been recognised that she's very talented in that area. She's very clever.' A spokesman for Nestlé said: 'A good spot from Eva. The tube was corrected at the end of last year and the updated packs should be in stores now. 'Smarties may have all the answers but not necessarily the right questions.' Nestlé are not the only ones to make embarrassing spelling errors. In December last year police chiefs in South Yorkshire were left embarrassed after taking delivery of a new patrol car with POLCE emblazoned on the side. In April 2013 council workmen somehow managed to spell 'school' wrong outside Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon, in Scotland. They painted 'sckool' on the road instead.

"The mother and grandparents of a 7-year-old boy who was so malnourished that one doctor said he looked like a Holocaust survivor pleaded guilty Friday to aggravated assault for failing to seek timely medical attention for him. The boy's mother, 28-year-old Mary Rader, and grandmother, 48-year-old Deana Beighley, acknowledged 'recklessly causing serious bodily injury' to the boy, who weighed 25 pounds when child welfare workers took him from his home in Greenville in June. The boy lived there with the three adult defendants and his three siblings. In cahoots: The boy's mother, 28-year-old Mary Rader, and grandmother, 48-year-old Deana Beighley pleaded guilty Friday to aggravated assault for failing to seek timely medical attention for the young boy . Tragic: Deana Beighley, left, and Mary Rader, right have pleaded guilty to starving and beating the 7-year-old boy. He was so malnourished that one doctor said he looked like a Holocaust survivor . Mercer County Judge Christopher St. John ruled this week that the boy's step-grandfather, 59-year-old Dennis Beighley, wasn't directly involved in the boy's care. The judge dismissed more serious charges against Dennis Beighley, who pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a child. District Attorney Robert Kochems had argued the adults purposely withheld food from the boy at his grandmother's urging because she didn't like him. His siblings were well-fed and healthy, the DA said. The boy was removed from the home after a neighbor saw him outside and reported a 'walking skeleton' to authorities. He was taken to Greenville Medical Center, where a doctor reported: 'The young man is so emaciated he looks like a Holocaust survivor,' police said. Another doctor said the boy was one month from dying. House of horrors: Police say the boy was never let out of the house except to sit on the porch, where he would catch and eat bugs . Prisoner: Police say the boy was never allowed to leave the house after his mother took him out of school in August 2013 . Like mother, like daughter: The boy's mother, 28-year-old Mary Rader, and grandmother, 48-year-old Deana Beighley, acknowledged 'recklessly causing serious bodily injury' to the boy, who weighed 25 pounds . But Deana Beighley's attorney, Neil Rothschild, said the adults loved and cared for the boy and blamed his condition on a growth hormone problem. 'The factual basis for the plea is the boy lost a good bit of weight due to some health problems and eating issues, and they neglected to get him medical attention because they feared, correctly, that if he saw a health care professional, he'd be removed from the home,' Rothschild said. The step-grandfather's attorney, Matthew Parson, said his client 'probably, in the end, realizes he could have done more by at least calling the doctor or the hospital.' Parson said the man cares about the boy and regrets not doing more. The attorney for the boy's mother didn't immediately return calls seeking comment Friday. How could she? Mary C. Rader, center, is led from the courthouse at photographed in August 2014. Her son was removed from his home last June when a neighbor noticed his 'skeletal' appearance . At a preliminary hearing in August, a district judge had ordered all three to stand trial on charges including conspiracy to commit attempted murder. The DA said the prosecution hasn't budged from its theory despite agreeing to dismiss the attempted murder conspiracy charges and others in crafting a plea bargain at Friday's pretrial conference. The adults had been scheduled to stand trial next month. Kochems said Deana Beighley faces five to 10 years in prison when the defendants return to court April 27. That's the same sentence she would have faced if convicted on the attempted murder charge, Kochems said, explaining why he was comfortable dropping that count. Rader likely faces a minimum sentence of three to 4 1/2 years in prison, while Dennis Beighley could get less than two years in prison and serve his time in county jail instead of state prison, the attorneys said.","Mary Rader, 28, and her parents, Deana Beighley, 48; and, Dennis Beighley, 59 have pleased guilty to charges of aggravated assault .

"The family of American aid worker Kayla Jean Mueller who has reportedly been killed in a Jordanian air strike said she spent her life helping those in need and was devoted to the people of Syria. ISIS militants have released a statement claiming Miss Mueller, 26, died in an attack outside the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa in Syria. Miss Mueller, who was taken hostage in August 2013 as she left a Doctors Without Borders hospital in the Syrian city of Aleppo, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the terror group, which has been demanding $6.6 million for her release. Her death has not yet been verified by independent sources and could easily be a propaganda move by the terror group to lay blame for the woman's death at the door of Jordan. Victim: Kayla Jean Mueller is believed to have been captured by ISIS scouts in Aleppo in August 2013 along with a number of Syrian aid workers, including her boyfriend . Family: Miss Mueller (left) pictured with her mother Marsha Mueller. Her family have described her as someone who spent her life helping those in need and was devoted to the people of Syria . Tragic: Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the terror group, which had been demanding $6.6 million for her release . In a statement to NPR radio station in the U.S., Miss Mueller's family described her as someone who was recognised for her academic abilities and her commitment to philanthropy. It read: 'Kayla has spent her adult life traveling the world and helping those in need. 'After graduating from college, she spent more than one year living and working with humanitarian aid groups in northern India, Israel and Palestine. 'She returned home to Arizona in 2011, and worked for one year at an HIV/AIDS clinic while volunteering at a women's shelter at night. 'In December 2011, she traveled to France to be an au pair so she could learn French in preparation for work in Africa. 'War sidetracked Kayla's Africa plans as she was drawn to alleviate the suffering of Syrian refugees.' According to her family, Miss Mueller moved to the Turkish/Syrian border in December 2012 and began working with Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council to help people who had been forced to flee their homes. 'Kayla found this work heartbreaking but compelling; she was extremely devoted to the people of Syria,' her family added. 'The common thread of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others.' Miss Mueller is from Prescott, Arizona - a small town in the mid-west where her father runs a car repair garage - and graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009. Her parents, both in their early 60s, have a large detached home on the side of a hill in a rural area of the state. Miss Mueller takes part in a march in Arizona in 2007, promoting aid to the Darfur region of Sudan. She was a High school senior when this picture was taken . Shocking: American officials said they were looking into the reports of Kayla Jean Mueller's death. The White House said it did not have immediate comment . Ms Mueller's family described her as someone who was recognised for her academic abilities and her commitment to philanthropy . The university graduate was a determined activist as a young woman who volunteered for three years with a coalition battling genocide in war torn African nations. The young humanitarian conducted two silent walks in her hometown to raise awareness surrounding the issue. She also wrote letters and placed calls to members of Congress to push for a change in US policy. Her efforts landed her with several youth awards and she went on to dedicate her life to humanitarian aid. Shortly after arriving in Aleppo, Miss Mueller and her Syrian boyfriend were believed to have been kidnapped by Islamic State militants and taken to Raqqa. She had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in her local newspaper. She told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria. ‘For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,’ she said. ‘It’s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.’ Blast: ISIS released images of this badly damaged building in which they claimed Kayla Jean Mueller had been killed during an Jordanian airstrike .

"Bobbi Kristina could have been submerged for as long as 15 minutes before she was found face-down in a bathtub on Saturday, according to reports. The 21-year-old daughter of Whitney Houston remains in a coma in Emory University Hospital after she was found unconscious by her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home. 'It seems like it might've been 10 or 15 minutes that she must have been alone,' Lomas' attorney Ashleigh Merhant told E! News. 'But we don't know at what point she actually ended up in the tub during that time.' Tragic: Bobbi Kristina, pictured with her partner Nick Gordon, was found unconscious on Saturday morning . 'The odds are against her': Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on his Instagram page on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change' in her condition as he called for prayers . Lomas found Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said. She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update. 'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off. 'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said. It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn. Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter. 'This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,' he said in a statement on Thursday. Denial: Bobby Brown, pictured leaving Emory University Hospital on Thursday, has denied reports that the family is preparing for the worst. On Thursday, a police source said her life support had been removed . Staying positive: Brown, seen giving a 'thumbs up', has remained hopeful that his daughter will pull through . Support network: Bobby Brown, right, and his wife Alicia Etheredge, left, leave the hospital on Thursday . 'If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.' The last official word on Bobbi's condition from the family came on Tuesday when they said in a statement that she was 'fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family'. On Thursday, he briefly told Access Hollywood that his daughter was 'good'. He appeared tired and his eyes were red as if he had been crying, the program reported. 'We're praying,' he added. Bobbi's 'devastated' grandmother, gospel singer Cissy Houston, mother of Whitney, was also seen arriving at the hospital, according to Radar Online, having flown in from her New Jersey home. 'Cissy was so traumatized losing Whitney and the pain is still raw from that,' a source told the website. 'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.' Vigil: Gordon was pictured outside the North Fulton Hospital, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken, on Sunday . Scene: Bobbi Kristina was found in the bathtub at this townhouse in Roswell, Georgia on Saturday morning . Meanwhile, Houston's mentor Clive Davis says he's been in touch the family and is praying for Bobbi. Davis said he's offered his support and and 'they're so grateful.' 'Of course it's heartbreaking to see the family go through this pain once again,' Davis said at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where Houston died in 2012 and where he will hold a pre-Grammy gala Saturday. 'They just ask that the public respect their privacy.' Houston died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned. Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning. Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. Police said she was found by her purported husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend, Max Lomas. Lomas' lawyer has since said he was the one who found Bobbi Kristina and started CPR. Missed: Bobbi's mother Whitney Houston, pictured together in 2007, died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances . Bobby Brown spoke out earlier this week to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon. Bobbi Kristina and Gordon were brought up like brother and sister after Houston took Gordon in when he was 12. But following her death, the duo announced they were in a relationship. Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media. But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.' 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC. Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston.","An attorney for the friend who found Bobbi Kristina on Saturday says she had been on her own for 15 minutes before he checked on her .

"Jailed: Imran Khawaja, 27, originally from west London, who posed with a severed head and spent six months in Syria, faces 12 years in prison . A British extremist who  faked his own death in Syria so he could return to Britain to recruit new jihadists has been jailed for 12 years today. Imran Khawaja, 27, became a jihadi recruitment 'poster boy' and was filmed posing with severed heads and repeatedly encouraged other Muslims to join him in the war-torn country. Khawaja  spent six months fighting in Syria last year but fled a terrorist training camp because of a lack of 'war booty'. The Londoner, who was nicknamed 'Barbie' and has a extremely low IQ, complained about 'having enough' of jihad without cocoa butter, toothpaste, moisturiser, and toilet paper. His family, who said he had shown no real commitment to Islam before he went to Syria, sent him pictures of them eating at Nandos chicken restaurant in the hope he would come home. Today he was jailed for 12 years with a further five years on licence after that. Judge Mr Justice Baker told him he poses 'a significant risk of serious harm' to the public and believes he was returning to the UK to recruit others. Woolwich Crown Court heard he  received firearms training at a base run by associates of British fanatics affiliated to ISIS. The bodybuilder entered the warzone after buying a flight to Kurdistan on January 26 last year. Khawaja, also known as Abu Daigham al Baritani, was then reported as being killed in action on June 3 by the terrorist group Rayat al-Tawheed. But it was a ruse and on the same day he was arrested after returning to Britain. He had asked his taxi driver cousin Tahir Bhatti to drive to Bulgaria, pick him up and then drive him back to the UK, avoiding the well-worn jihadist route via flights to and from Turkey. While on his way back to Britain he spread rumours of his own death. But Khawaja and Bhatti were arrested by police as they reached the UK port of Dover in Kent. Khawaja admitted preparation of terrorist acts on or before January 26 last year as well as attending a terrorism training camp between January and June 4 last year. Sentencing: Imran Khawaja gestured to his family in the public gallery today as he started his 12-year jail term . Poster boy: British extremist Imran Khawaja, 27, pictured posing on a propaganda video with a pair of machine guns, has been jailed for 12 years today . The 27-year-old trained at a terrorist camp with an extremist group linked to ISIS, where he was even pictured holding the severed head of a man (pictured) Co-accused: Tahir Bhatti, the older cousin of Imran Khawaja, was given a 21-month sentence picking him up from Bulgariia, while friend Asim Ali, 33, got the same sentence after he admitted assisting and offender and funding terrorism respectively . He has also admitted receiving weapons training and possessing a firearm for terrorist use during a hearing at the Old Bailey. Asim Ali, 33, from Ealing, west London has pleaded guilty to making £300 available to Khawaja while knowing or having reason to suspect it might be used for the purposes of terrorism. And Bhatti, 44, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty assisting an offender. Ali was handed a 21-month custodial term for entering into a funding arrangement for the purposes of terrorism.  The judge said the offence was serious enough to warrant an immediate jail term, despite the £300 donation representing a relatively small sum. Bhatti was also given a 21-month sentence for assisting an offender. His term was reduced to 95 days after time spent in custody awaiting the trial was taken into account. Members of the defendants’ families gasped as the sentences were delivered. Ruse: Khawaja's fake death was announced on the same day he arrived in Britain and was arrested . Conspiracy: Khawaja was arrested at Dover last June a short time after his militant group posted a bogus message claiming he had been killed in fighting . At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Mark Dawson said that by March 18 last year, Bhatti, who was referred to in a coded message as 'butterbean', was well aware Khawaja was in Syria and that he was clearly training with a view to fighting in Syria. The court was shown three photographs from Khawaja's phone that allegedly reflected what Bhatti knew about his activities. The first showed Khawaja in battlefield clothes and a balaclava sitting on a tank with a rifle. Another showed him with a child sporting a very distinctive tassled hat - the same hat and clothing worn in a number of postings by a terrorist group. The last photo showed the defendant at a training camp with an assault rifle, the court heard. By June last year, Bhatti had convinced his cousin to return to the UK saying his parents were not well and he should come home. The 27-year-old, pictured with a child recruit, spent six months among foreign fighters on the Syrian frontline and left just weeks before Jihadi John began his spree of hostage beheadings . Khawaja is believed to have close ties to masked executioner Jihadi John, pictured with hostages Kenji Goto Jogo (left) and Haruna Yukawa (right) The three men are expected to be handed jail sentences today. The court was told Ali withdrew £300 two days before Khawaja left the UK. After promising - but never delivering - more money, Ali then received messages that Khawaja needed toiletries and toilet tissue while in Syria. The court heard Ali sent a message to a friend saying Khawaja 'needs cocoa butter, toothpaste, soap and condoms for the war booty'. Prosecutor Brian Altman said messages between Khawaja and Ali hinted that he was returning to the UK to help with fundraising as his friends back home had failed to do so. Mr Altman said it was suggested by Khawaja that Ali would later return to Syria with him. Former Serco immigration worker with IQ in lowest 12% of country turned into jihadi who posed with beheaded ISIS victims in Syria . He was the bodybuilding frontman of a terror group designed to inspire and recruit impressionable young Britons by posing with dead bodies and the weaponry of war. But in private, Imran Khawaja was a gentle family man with a very low IQ, nicknamed Barbie, whose brief time in Syria was blighted by his longing for toothpaste, toilet roll and moisturiser. The 27-year-old had himself become indoctrinated in the years leading up to his departure for Syria in January 2014, having, his family said, demonstrated no previous serious commitment to Islam. Khawaja in fact spent the majority of his spare time in the gym and would video himself doing so. Change: Bodybuilder Imran Khawaja demonstrated no previous serious commitment to Islam but by January last year was in Syria appearing in propaganda films encouraging others to join him . During his sentencing at Woolwich Crown Court, Khawaja looked on proudly as footage of him panting while sparring with a partner was played. It was one of the few films shown in the court which did not require a content warning from counsel. Khawaja had spent five years working at a Serco immigration centre but became depressed in 2010 and appeared withdrawn. It was a surprise to his family, the court heard, that Khawaja's foreign adventure was actually a well-planned trip to a terrorist training camp. Covering his tracks with brief stints in continental Europe, Khawaja eventually made his way to Syria where he was considered the face of several videos for Rayat al-Tawheed, a group of insurgents designed to raise the profile of Islamic State. He posed with the severed head of a fighter loyal to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, fired fully-automatic weapons and spoke of the sacrifices his brothers had made - although it was not suggested Khawaja had been responsible for any murders himself. To his closest friends in the UK, however, he complained about a lack of toiletries. He also wanted condoms, ""for the war booty"". Latching on to any hint of discontent, Khawaja's family - many of whom were in the public gallery to watch him get sentenced today - attempted to lure him back to the UK with images of them eating at Nandos chicken restaurant. At one stage, his sister Azmeena threatened to fly out to Syria and fetch him if he did not return. The British jihadist (left and right) faked his own death after spending six months training at a ISIS-linked terrorism camp in Syria . Eventually, his cousin Tahir Bhatti, 45, drove to Europe in a desperate last attempt to rescue him. Bhatti, later jailed after he initially lied about the nature of the trip, told border staff his cousin always wanted to be a ""real life GI Joe"". Yesterday, with his head bowed, Khawaja told the judge he was seduced by propaganda and begged young British Muslims not to follow his path - a path which today ended in a lengthy jail term.","Jihadi 'poster boy' Imran Khawaja, 27, will serve a minimum of eight years .

"Elon Musk's SpaceX is set to try again with its ambitious plan to return a rocket to Earth and land it on a barge. The firm is targeting a 6:10 p.m. ET launch on Sunday of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. After the launch, SpaceX again will try to land the Falcon 9 rocket booster an ocean platform. Scroll down for video . Elon Musk has released footage of the moment a SpaceX rocket crashed into a barge. The company's founder unveiled the images after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack . The mission is a collaboration between NASA, the Air Force and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Earleir this month the company's founder unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following its launch on Saturday. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. SpaceX has been developing technology to land the largest stage of its Falcon 9 rocket back on Earth after it takes its supplies to the ISS. Last Saturday's mission was the group's first attempt to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs. While the launch went well, a failure in its hydraulic control fins brought the rocket down at the wrong angle. Earlier today Musk tweeted: 'Next rocket landing on drone ship in two to three weeks away more hydraulic fluid. At least it should explode for a different reason.' Saturday's mission was the group's first to put the stage on an autonomous landing platform at sea, which was held in position using deep-sea oil rigs. Pictured is an image of the fuel and oxygen combining in an explosion . Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. SpaceX has been developing technology to land the largest stage of its Falcon 9 rocket back on Earth after it takes its supplies to the ISS . Recovering the rocket involved re-lighting its engines on re-entry for a series of three burns. The first were two adjusted the predicted landing point and reduce its speed from 4,265ft per second to 820ft per second. A final 'landing burn' slowed the speed further to around 6.5ft per second as the rocket lowers its landing legs. Four 'hypersonic grid fins' placed around the rocket were meant to deploye on re-entry. Each fin moves independently to help control roll, pitch and yaw. However, these malfunctioned, causing the crash. The modified barge - nearly the size of a football field - was positioned a couple hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast. The uncrewed platform was spared serious damage from the impact, although some equipment on deck will need to be replaced, according to Musk . Initially, Musk had insisted that the company didn't get good video of the impact, and that the team would have to piece together information from 'telemetry and … actual pieces'. In the weeks preceding the landing test, Musk had estimated there was a 50-50 chance, at best, that the Falcon's first-stage booster would land vertically on the platform. A pair of attempts last year to bring boosters down vertically on the open ocean went well, but company officials conceded before Saturday's try that a platform touchdown was considerably more challenging. Once separated from the upper stage of the rocket Saturday, the main booster re-ignited as planned for the fly back, according to SpaceX.

He issued the pictured after prompts from gaming pioneerjohn Carmack (right) SpaceX successfully launched a supply rocket to the International Space Station on Saturday, the sixth mission by the aerospace contractor to the station since 2012. However the landing wasn't as smooth . Automatic engine firings maneuvered the booster down toward the autonomous, modified barge. The Air Force maintained the ability, as always, to destroy the booster if it strayed off course. SpaceX's primary mission was delivering more than 5,000 pounds of station supplies ordered up by Nasa, including hasty replacements for experiments and equipment lost in the destruction of another company's cargo ships. The company, headquartered in Hawthorne, California, also has been contracted by Nasa to develop beefed-up Dragons for astronaut rides to the space station, beginning as early as 2017. Boeing also is hard at work on a manned capsule. In the meantime, Nasa is paying tens of millions of dollars to Russia for each U.S. astronaut launched aboard the Soyuz spacecraft. A barge floating off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, was supposed to recover the leftover booster, but components came down too hard and broke apart, according to SpaceX founder Elon Musk . Onlookers and photographers watched the trajectory of the Falcon 9 rocket, which lit up the sky over Cape Canaveral, Florida on Saturday .","Footage was tweeted after persuasion by game pioneer, John Carmack .

"TLC's My 600-lb Life facilitated another victory with its latest star Amber Rachdi, who lost 267lbs from her former 660lb frame over the course of a year, as last night's episode chronicled. When she joined the show, Amber, 24, was all but housebound and living at home in Troutdale, Oregon, with her parents and boyfriend - all textbook 'enablers' - unable to stand for more than half an hour at a time and describing herself as a 'nasty monster'. It took gastric bypass surgery to reduce Amber's enlarged stomach from the size of a 'football' to the size of a 'baseball', as well as a concerted effort on her part to stop emotional eating, for her to shed the stubborn weight. Scroll down for video . Success: TLC's My 600-lb Life facilitated another victory with its latest star Amber Rachdi, who lost 267lbs from her former 660lb frame over the course of a year. Pictured, Amber before (left) and after (right) Amber is at her wits end when she joins the show, having dropped out of college some years ago and been unemployed ever since. Her parents cook her meals and she eats massive quantities of it four to five times a day. 'I have a lot of anxiety and I am at peace when I eat,' she admits. Her mother Patty concurs and says it 'calms her down'. Amber insists she is 'always hungry' and 'never full', a sensation she's felt her entire life. She was already obese when she was five years old. 'I could be stuffed sick but I would still want to eat something if it was put in front of me,' she says. Slimmed down: It took gastric bypass surgery to reduce Amber's enlarged stomach from the size of a 'football' to the size of a 'baseball', as well as a concerted effort on her part to stop emotional eating . Dangerously obese: When she joined the show, Amber, 24, was all but housebound (pictured) and living at home in Troutdale, Oregon, with her parents and boyfriend - all textbook 'enablers' Lover: Rowdy (pictured) is Amber's live-in boyfriend of two years, and 'prefers bigger women' but is 'very sexually frustrated' because the couple can't be intimate due to her size . The only time Amber leaves the house is to go with her boyfriend Rowdy, who she's been dating for two years, to buy more food; and to do that she has to cruise the supermarket aisles using a mobility scooter. 'I do feel guilty,' Rowdy says about feeding his girlfriend's habit. 'But what else do you do when you love someone?' '[Rowdy] is the kind of guy that prefers bigger women,' Amber explains. Still, her size makes it impossible for them to 'be intimate' and leaves Rowdy 'very sexually frustrated'. Amber estimates she has gained more than 200lbs since she started dating Rowdy. Shopping: The only time Amber (left) leaves the house is to go with Rowdy (right) to buy more food, and to do that she has to cruise the supermarket aisles using a mobility scooter . Lifelong struggle: Amber, pictured as a child (left) and a teen (right), insists she is 'always hungry' and 'never full', a sensation she's felt her entire life . Smooches: Amber (right) estimates she has gained more than 200lbs since she started dating Rowdy (left) 'I've tried so hard, so many times, to change the way I eat. But I can't,' she says reproachfully. 'I'm already such a failure. Why not just keep failing?' Amber is aware, however, that if she doesn't take drastic action, she will likely be dead before her 30th birthday. With that in mind, she makes the arduous trip to Houston, Texas, with Rowdy and her parents to plead with the show's resident weight-loss surgeon Dr Nowzaradan for a gastric bypass. Uh-oh: On their way to Houston to meet with a gastric bypass surgeon, Amber's weight crushes her own wheelchair just outside the airport, rendering it broken (pictured) Resourceful: Her father Abe (left) manages to find an oversized luggage cart, and wheels her through the airport on that instead . Stuck: Amber has to purchase two seats on the airplane, and still has a tough time squeezing into the row . Concerned: Once she's finally in front of Dr Nowzaradan (left) with her mom and dad (pictured) his prognosis is bleak. 'This is a bad situation,' he says. 'Amber is surrounded by enablers' Before even walking through the airport doors, there's a problem. Amber is so heavy that she breaks her wheelchair as soon as she sits on it. Her father Abe manages to find an oversized luggage cart, and wheels her through the airport on that instead. Several passers-by stop to take photos of the spectacle. 'I am so humiliated,' Amber laments. 'I hate being in public. I feel like a sideshow.' Amber has to purchase two seats on the airplane, and still has a tough time squeezing into the row. The rest of her journey leaves her so 'overwhelmed' with anxiety that she vomits several times. Ready: Amber loses 17lbs over the course of three months, a slower pace than Dr Nowzaradan had challenged her with, but upon reviewing her progress, he agrees to schedule the surgery (pictured) Recovery: The surgery is a success and Amber goes home, but three days later, she is rushed back to hospital with severe chest pains (pictured) - the result of an anxiety attack . Once she's finally in front of Dr Nowzaradan, his prognosis is bleak. 'This is a bad situation,' he says. 'Amber is surrounded by enablers.' Dr Nowzaradan tells his patient and her family that she must lose 20lbs before he will 'even consider' performing surgery on her. Finally taking the situation seriously, Amber's family pack up and move from Oregon to Houston so she can be close to Dr Nowzaradan. Determined to qualify for the surgery, Amber takes matters into her own hands. She cooks her own healthy meal - chicken and vegetables - the first night, and manages to resist temptation as Rowdy tucks into a fast food feast across the table from her. She also takes up some gentle exercise. 'Starting to walk again has been difficult,' she says. 'It hurts and it's hard.' Improved: Seven months into her journey, Amber has lost 92lbs and dropped a lot of fluid from her legs (pictured) Retail therapy: By month nine, she has lost a total of 145lbs, and is able to go clothes shopping for the first time in years (pictured) Amber loses 17lbs over the course of three months, a slower pace than Dr Nowzaradan had challenged her with, but upon reviewing her progress, he agrees to schedule the surgery. The surgery is a success and Amber goes home, but three days later, she is rushed back to hospital with severe chest pains. Dr Nowzaradan speculates that she could be suffering a heart attack, but it turns out instead to be an anxiety attack. Over the next few months, Amber sees a councillor to help her manage her chronic anxiety in healthier ways, now that comfort eating is off the table. Determined: Amber keeps up with her new healthy lifestyle, regularly working out (left) and leaving the house more often (right) Triumph: Amber and Rowdy go to see Dr Nowzaradan at the 12 month mark (pictured) and find she has lost 267lbs overall, now weighing in at 390lbs . By month seven of her journey, Amber has lost 92lbs and dropped a lot of fluid from her legs. She can finally fit behind the wheel of a car, and being able to drive again affords Amber some much-needed independence. By month nine, she has lost a total of 145lbs, and is able to go clothes shopping for the first time in years. 'I'm now a 2X not a 6X,' she says as she tries on outfits at a plus-size store. Happy ending: 'I surprised myself,' concludes Amber, pictured before (left) and (after) her weight loss . Amber goes to see Dr Nowzaradan at the 12 month mark, and nervously steps onto the scales. Overall, she has lost 267lbs and weighs in at 390lbs. Amber's family move back to Oregon leaving her alone with Rowdy. With Amber mobile again, the pair are finally able to go on their second ever date together, and take a trip to the zoo. 'I surprised myself,' Amber concludes. 'I'm shopping for myself, I'm eating healthy and I'm working out. I've taken control of my life.' Dr Nowzaradan is willing to perform surgery to remove her excess skin once she reaches 250lbs. After that, Amber hopes to finish college, return to work, get married and start a family.

"A rape victim who met the man who attacked her on a Christian dating website is filing a lawsuit against him and his family. Katie Kuhlman, 24, is suing Sean Patrick Burns, who she met on ChristianMingle, for the sex attack and his mother for defamation after she sent a Facebook message to her brother last year indicating she had lied about the rape. According to the complaint, the message read: 'I'm wondering if you are aware of your sister, Katie's accusation that she was raped in November 2012 and that she testified in a trial this summer which has sent an innocent man to prison?' Scroll down for video . Suing: Rape victim Katie Kuhlman is suing Sean Patrick Burns for the attack and his mother Cheryl for defamation. She was accused of lying about the attack in a Facebook message sent to her brother . The lawsuit was filed last week in San Diego Superior Court. Sean Patrick Banks, a former lieutenant in the United States Navy, was convicted of two counts of forced penetration, one count of forcible rape, and one count of rape of an intoxicated woman. An El Cajon jury found Banks, who was 39, guilty of raping two women, including Kuhlman, in 2012 and 2009. He was sentenced to 37 years to life in prison. During the sentencing phase of his trial, Banks said he would waive his right to appeal if the women whose testimony led to his conviction would submit to a polygraph test.

Guilty: Sean Patrick Burns, a former lieutenant in the United States Navy, was sentenced to 37 years for attacks on two women. He is now being sued by one victim . Gloria Allred, the attorney for one of his victims, said: 'To now suggest that the victims should take a polygraph test after they endured cross examination and the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that Banks was guilty is insulting to the jury and the victims.' But Ms Kuhlman did submit to a test — and passed. 'I was more interested in taking it because of the comment he made about dropping his appeal if I would pass a lie detector test,' she said. 'I passed my test. I don't know if he's going to drop his appeal.' The result did not stop Banks' family from contacting her. His mother, Cheryl, sent Kuhlman's brother a message on Facebook that read, 'we pray every day that Katie will feel convicted by the Holy Spirit and tell the truth about what happened.

Her lawyer, Dan Gilleon, told NBC 7 that 'it was outrageous and despicable the way she reached out to a victim of rape, her family and said 'Your sister is lying.' He said the message not only accuses Kuhlman of perjury, but also questioned her faith. 'This mother is exploiting the name of God to really try to hurt my client, just like her son did,' Gilleon said. She is seeking damages for rape, false imprisonment, hate violence and defamation.","Former US navy lieutenant sentenced to 37 years' jail for attacks .

"A train company has admitted receiving up to 5,000 complaints a day. Southern trains made the surprising confession yesterday after an irate passenger tweeted asking how many complaints it had notched up. The company replied: ‘We are currently receiving between 2,000 to 5,000 tweets a day.’ Confession: Southern Trains admitted to receiving up to 5,000 complaints a day from frustrated customers . The online admission provoked a storm of criticism on social media, with a wave of angry commuters weighing in. One person wrote: ‘Something to be proud of, huh?’, while another tweeted: ‘Which really demonstrates the level of dissatisfaction that we all have with the way you run the trains. Awful.’ Among the tweets Southern trains received yesterday was a flurry of complaints about its poor Friday morning service. One commuter posted: ‘Another bad start to a day. Not late enough to reclaim a tiny bit of my ticket but late enough to annoy my bosses.’ Another wearily tweeted: ‘Another morning. Another cancelled Southern train to Victoria. Another subsequently packed and annoying later train. Same old....’ A similarly frustrated passenger posted: ‘8:06 from Streatham Hill cancelled. 15 min wait then next train so packed some didn’t get on. Far from unusual.’ Rail watchdog Passenger Focus said the latest Twitter outcry amplified the findings of its own survey, in which Southern was ranked as one of the worst train companies for customer satisfaction. Flooded with complaints: Three customers make their feelings about Southern trains clear on Twitter . Annoyed passengers: In a recently-published passenger satisfaction report from rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, Southern was found near the bottom of the rankings . The only train firm with a lower figure in last autumn’s poll was Southeastern at 74 per cent, with Southern and Govia Thameslink scoring just 77 per cent. By contrast, the companies with the best scores were the Heathrow Express and Grand Central – both with 94 per cent. The average score was 81 per cent. Here is a list of train operators along with the percentage of customers who say they are satisfied with their services. The figures come from a survey by Passenger Focus published on January 27 this year. Heathrow Express: 94 per cent . Chiltern Railways: 91 per cent . Merseyrail: 90 per cent . First Hull Trains: 89 per cent . London Overground: 88 per cent . First Great Western: 81 per cent . South West Tarins: 80 per cent . Southern: 77 per cent . Southeastern: 74 per cent . Southern’s lowest scores in the Passenger Focus study were for how it deals with delays and availability of staff where only just over a third – 36 per cent – of passengers were satisfied. Passenger satisfaction with punctuality and reliability of the service fell 5 percentage points in one year to 68 per cent. Less than half were happy with the toilets provided, or the amount of space for luggage, while satisfaction with the helpfulness of staff fell to 53 per cent. The watchdog’s director David Sidebottom said: ‘Our last survey showed that less than four in ten Southern passengers were satisfied with how the company manages delays. The increasing number of Twitter queries adds weight to this finding – it is now up to Southern to make sure it is communicating service problems clearly and accurately across all channels that its passengers use.’ Southern services have been one of many rail firms going to the capital struggling with continuing disruption caused by refurbishment at London Bridge station. One Network Rail boss admitted he was ‘ashamed’ by the chaos affecting thousands of delayed and frustrated passengers. Rail minister Claire Perry also branded the delays there this week as ‘clearly unacceptable’. A Southern trains spokesman said there were a higher number of complaints than usual, with the problems at London Bridge station ‘probably a factor’. He added: ‘The figure of 2,000 to 5,000 a day referred to all tweets and included requests for information.’","Firm disclosed embarrassing figure in response to a passenger on Twitter .

"Two prominent black Democrats in the House of Representatives are vowing to skip Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress next month, a move that a White House insider says was put in motion by the Obama administration. John Lewis of Georgia and G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina both said Friday that they disapproved when House Speaker John Boehner invited the Israeli leader to address a joint session of Congress on March 3 without consulting President Barack Obama first. That disapproval apparently was orchestrated, or at least strongly encouraged, by the White House through comamunications with lawmakers connected to the Congressional Black Caucus. 'I'm not saying the president called anyone personally,' a current White House staffer told Daily Mail Online. 'But yeah, the White House sent a message to some at the CBC that they should suddenly be very upset about the speech.' 'BACK CHANNELS': The Obama administration is nudging black Democrats on Capitol Hill away from attending a March 3 address by ISraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, a White House aide says . Georgia Rep. John Lewis says he won't attend, but his spokeswoman won't deny that the White House played a part in the decision . Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress in May 2011, and he's coming back in March – but Vice President Joe Biden (left) won't be there . The source said it was a 'back-channel' arrangement that did not involve the higher echelons of the West Wing. Butterfield's spokeswoman Kezmiché Atterbury denied it on Friday afternoon, saying he 'was not asked by anyone at the White House or otherwise' to skip Netanyahu's planned address. The North Carolinian is the CBC's chairman. he told the Associated Press that a growing boycott 'is not an organized effort.' But Lewis's spokeswoman Brenda Jones wouldn't deny it after repeated requests. 'I have no comment for you,' she finally said in an email, adding separately that 'my boss does not speak for the CBC.' Jones vented in another email, suggesting that journalists were out to get Rep. Lewis. 'Why are they off on this erroneous quest to make more of something than there is(?)' she wrote. 'Don’t you think the public would benefit from more depth about the Obama-Netanyahu relationship or the dynamics of this snub(?)' And Candace Randle, the CBC's spokeswoman, left open the possibility that the White House could be placing its thumb on the scale. 'I’m unaware of such a request,' Randle said in a brief email, 'and am unable to confirm.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to provide new information, referring Daily Mail Online to his comments during a reporters' briefing on Thursday. President Obama 'does believe it is up to individual members of Congress to make their own decision about whether or not to attend,' Earnest said then. The White House also said Vice President Joe Biden may not attend Netanyahu's speech, which is expected to focus on Iran's potential to swiftly develop a nuclear weapon. The New York Times all but confirmed on Friday that Biden will be out of town when the prime minister arrives. 'We are not ready to announce details of his trip yet, and normally our office wouldn’t announce this early,' one official told the Times, 'but the planning process has been underway for a while.' Biden's office confirmed on Friday that the vice president expects to be abroad on March 3. No details about his trip have been made available. North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, and says the White House wasn't behind his decision to slip the Israeli PM's speech, but the CBC's spokeswoman sould only say she was 'unaware' of contacts between the organization and the Obama administration . Josh Earnest, the president's chief spokesman, has insisted that Obama thinks congressmen and woman should make up their own mind, a position that now looks shaky . House Speaker John Boehner (right) is taking heat from Democrats for going around the White House and inviting Netanyahu (left) to speak about the global threat of a nuclear-armed Iran . If Biden is absent, it's likely that Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, would preside along with  Boehner, sitting in the vice president's place – provided he attends. Lewis, a hero of the civil rights movement, said Thursday that the speaker's unilateral invitation to Netanyahu was 'an affront to the president and the State Department' that cannot be ignored. Butterfield, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Thursday he was 'very disappointed that the speaker would cause such a ruckus' among members of Congress. He called the speaker's actions 'unprecedented.' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online that 'support for Israel has always been a bipartisan issue, and it always should be.' Butterfield also criticized Netanyahu, saying that by accepting Boehner's invitation without talking to Obama, the prime minister had 'politicized' his visit to the United States.","Congressional Black Caucus chairman G.K.

"From their hairy bodies  to their rippling legs, spiders can strike terror into even the the most seasoned nature lover. Now a new video showing a giant parasitic worm bursting from the body of a huge Australian arachnid may push arachnophobes over the edge. The disgusting spectacle was filmed by YouTube member BaskWith2 in Australia, who was shocked to see the writhing worm after spraying the spider with insecticide. Scroll down for video . The disgusting sight of a giant parasitic worm bursting from the body of a huge Australian arachnid (pictured), may push arachnophobes over the edge. It was filmed by YouTube member BaskWith2 in Australia . His video seems to show a giant parasitic nematode, or roundworm, erupting from the dead spider’s body in a spiral shape, before unfurling to look like a strand of wriggling wholemeal spaghetti. It appears to be over 15 times longer than the spider’s body and around the same size as the arachnid’s abdomen. Once the parasite is wriggling in a foamy sea of insecticide, the disgusted cameraman blasts it with more poison, as the video cuts out. BaskWith2 writes on his YouTube page : ‘Ok so I was just editing my latest montage and this huge spider came out, so I sprayed it and killed it, then this f*****n alien worm came out of it!’ Comments include: 'Just what in the sweet, holy, blessed reaches of sacred heaven is this???!! ' and 'Kill it with fire'. There is some conjecture as to exactly what the parasite is. The video seems to show a giant parasitic nematode worm erupting from the dead spider’s body in a spiral shape, before unfurling to look like a strange of wriggling wholemeal spaghetti. An expert from ZSL London Zoo told MailOnline that it is a a Mermithid nematode worm, which infects arthropods, such as spiders . A Mermithid nematode worm is a parasite of arthropods. Mermithidae is an old family of nematode worms that live in arthropods such as crabs and spiders. A specimen is even preserved in a 40 million-year-old piece of amber. They are wire-like and smooth, with a tubular digestive tract with openings at each end. Their larvae is eaten by an unfortunate arthropod and the parasite drinks its body fluids and east its digestive glands and muscles to grow. The host becomes less mobile but stays alive because its vital organs are not eaten. The 'zombie' worm may take control of its host's nervous system to guide to towards somewhere with water, to ensure the aquatic parasite's survival. It bursts through its host's body, eventually killing it. Dave Clarke, Head of Invertebrates at ZSL London Zoo told MailOnline: ‘This is a Mermithid nematode worm, a parasite of arthropods. ‘The worm would have emerged at some point soon anyway but was obviously annoyed by the spraying of the spider. ‘The size of the worm is shockingly large in proportion to the body size of the host.’ The worm has also been identified as a hairworm, which looks similar to the untrained eye and can also infects spiders. Mermithidae is an old family of nematode worms that live in arthropods such as crabs and spiders. A specimen is even preserved in a 40 million-year-old piece of amber. The worms are wire-like and smooth, with a tubular digestive tract with openings at each end. The unfortunate spider likely ate its larvae, which then feasted on its host’s body fluids, digestive glands, sexual organs and muscles to grow into a sizeable worm, ABC reported. The spider would have become less mobile but because its vital organs were not eaten, probably remained alive, despite the parasite filling its abdomen and cephalothorax (mid-section). Even without the insecticide, the spider would likely have met a grisly end, because the Mermithid nematode worm would have burst out of the creature’s body, killing it. The parasite (pictured) appears to be over 15 times longer than the spider’s body and around the same size as the arachnid’s abdomen. Mermithidae is an old family of nematode worms that live in arthropods such as crabs and spiders - a specimen is even preserved in a 40 million-year-old piece of amber . Ingeniously, the aquatic parasite may also have taken control of its host’s nervous system, causing the probably thirsty spider to seek out water and possibly drown in it, so that the parasite could continue to survive in liquid. The video may prove even more unpalatable for some, because humans can be infected with thousands of tiny nematodes too. Dr Brian Farrell, an entomologist at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post: ‘Most have no obvious effect on us, and we are mostly unaware of their presence, but a few are large enough to cause diseases such as trichinosis.’ There are plenty of examples of zombiism in the animal kingdom. A fungus called Cordyceps takes over the minds of insects. It starts life as a spore that lands on an ant, which slowly stops performing its usual role in a colony, so it’s thrown out by more diligent worker ants. The fungus takes control of the ganglion cells that make up the insect’s brain, forcing it to bite down hard on a leaf with its mandibles. At this point, Cordyceps kills its host, causing a stalk to erupt through the ant’s head and release more zombie spores to secure the fungus’ grisly existence. Zombiism can be seen in the natural world: A fungus called Cordyceps takes over the minds of insects. It controls the mind of its host ant, before killing it and releasing spores through its body (pictured) Similarly, a tiny thorny-headed worm of the phylum Ancantho cephalia, burrows into the brain of a tiny crustacean, Gammarus lacustris, to take control of its nervous system. It forces the crab to swim towards the ocean’s surface where it will be attacked by predators. In humans, tapeworms can make its way into the brain to change our behaviour, but a microbe called Toxo plasma gondii (T.gondii) goes a step further. Found in cat faeces, it can infect humans and stop them fearing risky behaviour, with tragic results. People can get roundworm, for example from swallowing microscopic eggs in food and water, or by touching contaminated soil. While it can be treated with medication – and some 80 cases are reported in the UK every year – symptoms include a persistent dry cough and fever.","Terrifying footage was filmed by YouTube member BaskWith2 in Australia .

"They may have a reputation for committing suicide, but it appears that lemmings actually have a powerful survival mechanism. Biologists have found that the furry Scandinavian rodents use their multicoloured fur and emit loud screams to scare away predators. They say that the rodents employ a form of aposematism - the use of colours and other signals to warn that an animal is toxic or dangerous. Scroll down to see videos of lemmings taking on a bullmastiff, cats and even humans . The distinctive black, white and yellow fur of this lemming, combined with screams, says 'don't mess with me' However, in the case of Norwegian lemmings, they back up the message from their yellow, brown and white fur and loud barking calls with some aggressive biting. The lemming, a small arctic rodent, has become synonymous with self-destructive behaviour, due to its alleged propensity to throw itself off cliffs by following the herd. While it is true that lemmings migrate in large numbers, and these migrations might, in theory, lead to riverbanks, they are in fact good swimmers. The myth is said to have arisen thanks to a 1958 Disney nature documentary called White Wilderness, which appeared to show suicidal lemmings leaping into a river. This idea was then not helped by the popularity of a 1991 computer game that required players to rescue the tiny creatures as they plodded to their death. There is in fact no scientific evidence that these animals commit suicide. Unlike other rodents, the creatures are known to fight back against attackers with loud screams, lunges and biting with their sharp teeth. Indeed there is anecdotal evidence of Norwegian lemmings taking on animals that are much larger than them, including cats, birds of prey and even large dogs like bull mastifs. Professor Malte Andersson, a biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who conducted the research, said the lemmings appear to use its distinctive colours and aggressive behaviour to ensure predators can tell it apart from other rodents such as voles. He said: 'Distinctive, contrast-rich colouration, anti-predator calls and threat postures of the Norwegian lemming form a multimodal suit of posematic traits, warning predators that this is a more dangerous prey than the smaller sympatric voles. 'The traits immediately announce species identity - powerful lemming, not weaker vole - and may therefore increase the chances of surviving encounters with predators.' In the study, which is published in the journal Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology, Professor Andersson compared the behaviour of the colourful Norwegian lemmings with the dull brown Alaskan lemmings when threatened. They found the Norwegian lemmings gave loud calls in 32 per cent of encounters with predators and most called and lunged if surprised. The distinctive patterns on the fur of Norwegian lemmings (above) is intended to warn off potential predators . However, just two per cent of the Alaskan lemmings called when confronted with a predator and most froze if surprised. Professor Andersson found in a separate study that compared to grey voles, the Norwegian lemmings would also aggressively resist attacks by predators. When threatened the Norwegian lemmings tended to rise up, scream and lunge at the predator, its white cheeks and chin contrasting with the black front and cap of the creature. Professor Andersson believes the colouration may direct attention towards the lemmings main defence weapon - the sharp teeth. This, he says, is a similar approach used by the patterns on badgers. He added: 'Black and white or yellow is a classic aposematic colouration, avoidance of which does not require learning in some birds. 'Black and white facial colouration is often combined with sharp teeth or other weapons for example in terrestrial small carnivores.' 'Also, small juvenile lemmings use threat calls towards predators, a possible example of auto-mimicry of more powerful adults by small juveniles.' Norweigain lemmings produce louds barks when threatened (above) and lunge at predators to scare them off . Alaskan lemmings, like this one being carried by this snowy owl, have a less aggressive approach to threats .","Norwegian lemmings will attack much larger predators when threatened .

"Nigel Farage was holed up in a Ukip office for almost two hours today after it became surrounded by protesters. After police told the Ukip leader not to leave the office in Rotherham, he complained the protests were 'undemocratic' and blamed unions for mobilising opposition to his party. It follows his outspoken criticism of the way the grooming scandal in the town had been handled by the local council, but the Labour party accused him of trying to use child abuse to score political points. Scroll down for video . Police advised Nigel Farage not to leave the office in Rotherham, which is the HQ of the election campaign of local candidate Jane Collins . Outside the office one woman was seen breastfeeding, after Mr Farage said mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding . Protesters gathered outside the office waving placards saying 'Ukip not wanted here',  'Reject Ukip lies' and 'Hands off Rotherham' Mr Farage had hoped to cut the ribbon to declare the new office open before going on a walkabout around the town . The Ukip leader was holed up in the office for almost two hours, after protesters gathered outside . Mr Farage stayed inside, from where he gave a live TV interview in which he blamed unions for mobilising opposition against Ukip . After spending almost two hours holed up in the office, Mr Farage was led to safety by police under a large red umbrella. Mr Farage was due to cut the ribbon on the campaign office of Ukip's general election candidate Jane Collins, but his team said he was not coming out on police advice. Around 40 demonstrators gathered on a narrow pavement outside, along with a similar number of media. His visit comes in the wake of the withering Casey report into way Rotherham Council failed to deal with child sexual exploitation in the town. The party has 10 councillors in the town which is one of its main target seats in the north. The protesters were peaceful, but noisy, many of them carrying placards saying 'Reject Ukip lies', and shouting that the Ukip leader was not welcome in the town. Others said 'your wife is an immigrant' - a reference to Mr Farage's German-born wife Kirsten. Outside the office one woman was seen breastfeeding, after Mr Farage said mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding. But giving a live TV interview from inside the office, Mr Farage sought to blame trade unions. After spending almost two hours holed up in the office, Mr Farage was led to safety by police under a large red umbrella . Mr Farage complained that everywhere he goes there are attempts to 'stop us engaging with the public' The incident echoed when Mr Farage was trapped in a pub in Edinburgh in 2013 after being surrounded by protesters . After finally managing to escape from the office, Mr Farage was driven away while the police looked on . Ostentatious breastfeeding . Nigel Farage sparked controversy when he backed Claridge's in telling a breastfeeding customer to cover-up : 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.' Immigrants causing traffic jams . The Ukip leader missed a party event in Wales after getting stuck in traffic. His excuse? 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here... What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.' Rate an immigrant game . Ukip is criticised for a game which asks supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella. In defence of saying 'poofter' and 'Chinky' South Basildon candidate Kerry Smith was forced to quit  after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters', joking about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'. Mr Farage later defended him,saying he felt sorry for 'loutish' Kerry Smith, who was a 'rough diamond' and meant no 'malice' with the comments, which were not considered offensive in TV shows like Only Fools and Horses. He told BBC Two's Daily Politics: 'It's the same as the rest of the country, to be honest with you, there is a trade-union attempt to stop Ukip speaking... 'Everywhere we go there is an attempt to stop us engaging with the public.' He added: 'If you look, in fact you will see the two biggest unions in the country both directly contribute towards this campaign and, interestingly, amongst the protesters outside there are a couple of people who were Labour councillors until they lost their seats to Ukip.' He complained that the protest was 'not only undemocratic, it's very anti-British'. However, Ukip has been accused of trying to use the Rotherham abuse scandal to score political points, with repeated attacks on 'multiculturalism'. Writing in The Independent today, Mr Farage said: 'I shall be visiting Rotherham today, and alongside Ukip's representatives and candidates will call for immediate, wholesale change for the area, including elections for the entirety of the council on 7 May. 'As for the crimes and the criminals themselves, I do hope – though I won't hold my breath – that the political elite that steered us blindly into this multiculturalism experiment have learned the lessons of what they think is 'tolerance' but what is actually complicity. 'There's nothing 'tolerant' about looking the other way when mass rape and grooming is occurring, and in fact it does a great injustice to the law-abiding immigrants who get blamed, attacked or simply feel guilt through association.' But local Labour MP Sarah Champion said she thought it was 'hilarious' that Mr Farage had been confronted by protesters unhappy at Ukip's presence in the town. She told BBC Two: 'He came here to try and point score. It's like some sort of voyeuristic tourism tourism that's going on. 'I'm very keen that we address the issue rather than point score. The fact that he came here with his circus and has ended up barricaded in his shop with people in Rotherham who are saying this is absolutely disgusting. 'We don't want you coming and trying to get elected off the back of the abuse that's been going on in our town. 'I do find that funny because the people of Rotherham know what's right and what's wrong.' Mr Farage complained that the protest was organised by unions and was  'not only undemocratic, it's very anti-British' While Mr Farage remained inside, Ukip candidate Jane Collin went out to speak to the protesters . Labour have accused Ukip of trying to use the child abuse scandal in Rotherham to score political points . Rotherham Borough Council's entire cabinet resigned this week in the wake of a damning report by Louise Casey into its handling of allegations of abuse and grooming in the town . Rotherham Borough Council's entire cabinet resigned this week in the wake of a damning report by Louise Casey into its handling of allegations of abuse and grooming in the town. The inspection report painted a picture of a council in complete denial about the issue and a culture of bullying, 'misplaced political correctness' and silencing whistle-blowers. Parliamentary candidate Jane Collins hopes to take the seat from Labour in May's election . The report had been ordered in the wake of the revelation that 1,400 children had been subjected to rape, violence and trafficking by gangs of mainly Asian men . Mr Pickles made his announcement just moments after the authority's entire cabinet announced its intention to resign in the wake of the Casey Report. Council leader Paul Lakin, who only took up post last year after the previous leader resigned in the wake of the scandal, stepped down with immediate effect. Mr Farage repeated his party's call for the whole of Rotherham Council to face re-election in May, rather than waiting until next year. A Ukip statement said: 'These protesters aren't the real people of Rotherham. This is the Labour Party running scared and trying to shut down any voice of opposition. 'They are just people who are trying to stifle democratic debate. Surely they should be directing their anger at those who presided over the industrial scale of abuse in this town, rather than those who are trying to change it for the better. 'They are more interested in keeping power than serving the people, which is what led to the cover-up.' In May 2013, Mr Farage had to be locked in a Scottish pub for his own safety after being surrounded by a hostile crowd. The Ukip leader and his entourage were first heckled as they attempted to hold a press conference in The Canons' Gait in Edinburgh by protesters shouting 'racist scumbag' and 'scum'.","Ukip leader told by police not to leave the party's new office in town .

"The leaders of France and Germany sat down with Vladimir Putin today to try and hammer out a peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis, as fears grew that their approach to solving the conflict is threatening Europe's relationship with the U.S. Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel were pictured seated around a table with the Russian president this afternoon, but no UK or U.S. officials were at the meeting in Moscow. Britain's former top Nato commander General Sir Richard Shirreff said the UK should be playing a larger role in the efforts to resolve the crisis amid fears that it could lead to an all-out European war. Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande joined Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss the escalating crisis in Ukraine . Round table discussion: The Russian President talks with Merkel during their meeting at the Kremlin this afternoon . The three leaders met to hold crisis talks on the clashes in Ukraine, which have left nearly 5,400 people dead since April last year, but there were no UK or U.S. officials present . He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is the most serious crisis to have faced Europe, arguably, since the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. There is a threat of total war. 'The UK is a major Nato member, it is a major EU member, it is a member of the UN Security Council, and it is unfortunate that the weight that the British Prime Minister could bring to efforts to resolve this crisis appear to be absent.' Meanwhile U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has warned that America must stand together with Europe to stop escalating Russian military involvement amid reports of transatlantic divisions over whether to send weapons to support the Western-backed Kiev government. 'We, the U.S. and Europe as a whole, have to stand with Ukraine at this moment,' Biden said. 'Russia cannot be allowed to redraw the map of Europe.' Biden also accused Putin of riding roughshod over peace efforts. 'Ukraine is fighting for their very survival right now. Russia continues to escalate the conflict by sending mercenaries and tanks and, as we euphemistically say in the United states, little green men, without patches, very sophisticated special operations soldiers. 'President Putin continues to call for new peace plans as his troops roll through the Ukrainian countryside, and he absolutely ignores every agreement his country has signed in the past.' French President Francois Hollande arrived in the Russian capital earlier today to discuss the situation in Ukraine with Putin . Merkel and Hollande, both pictured as they arrived in Moscow today, believe a ceasefire remains the first step in achieving peace in Ukraine .

EU officials said yesterday that the bloc will blacklist more Russian individuals over Ukraine, but divisions within the 28-nation bloc, particularly with the new Greek government, have prevented further broad economic sanctions. And in an apparent warning to  Merkel and  Hollande as they visit Moscow, EU president Donald Tusk warned against any deal with Moscow that would break up Ukraine. 'We cannot compromise on Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,' he said. Hollande says all parties pushing for a new peace plan for eastern Ukraine see a cease-fire as the first step but must go further to find a lasting accord. Hollande spoke today before he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel headed to Moscow to discuss a new European peace plan with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The top-level diplomatic dash came a day after Merkel and Hollande met with the Ukrainian government in Kiev to discuss how to salvage a peace plan agreed upon last year in Minsk, Belarus. 'Everyone is aware that the first step must be the cease-fire, but that it cannot suffice. We must seek a global solution,' Hollande said. 'We should have hope (in this new initiative).'

Ukrainian army servicemen take part in training drills near the city of Mariupol, in eastern Ukraine. A ceasefire signed several months ago has not been adhered to, with both sides continuing to do battle . Fighting between Russian-backed rebels and the government in Kiev has surged in the last month in eastern Ukraine, fueling fears the conflict is threatening Europe's overall security. Russia has vehemently denied backing the rebels with troops and weapons but the top NATO commander, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, said yesterday that Russia continues to supply the separatists with heavy, state-of-the-art weapons, air defences and fighters. In Berlin, Merkel said she and Hollande would use 'all our power with direct visits to Kiev and to Moscow today to stop the bloodshed as soon as possible and to fill the Minsk agreement with life'. She rejected reports that she and Hollande were prepared to offer more territory to the Ukraine separatists, adding: 'I will never deal with territorial questions over another country.' The diplomatic blitz comes amid fierce fighting which has prompted Washington to consider providing the beleaguered Ukrainian military with lethal weapons, an option that Germany and other European nations reject. 'We are convinced that there's no military solution to this conflict,' Merkel added. 'But we also know that it's completely open whether we will manage to achieve a cease-fire with these talks. 'We don't know if this will happen today or whether further talks are necessary, whether these will be long or short talks in Moscow.' Merkel told reporters that she and Hollande are traveling in a bid to safeguard 'national self-determination, which is part of the European order'. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has said he fully supports German and French attempts to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Pictured are Ukrainian soldiers undergoing a training drill .

"The U.S. female hostage whom ISIS claimed today has been killed in a Jordanian air strike has been identified as a college grad from small town America with a passion for helping those in some of the world's most volatile regions. Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, from Prescott, Arizona, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the extremists who were demanding $6.6million for her release. Miss Mueller, who graduated from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, appears to have been committed to helping those most in need since she was a teenager. Scroll down for video . Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, from Prescott, Arizona, has been a committed activist to helping those in some of the world's most dangerous places since she was a teenager . She volunteered for three years with the Save Darfur Coalition, battling genocide in the war-torn African region. Her parents, Marsha and Carl Mueller, who are both in their early 60s, have a large, detached hillside home in a rural area of Prescott. Mr Mueller runs an auto-body repair shop. Miss Mueller graduated from Prescott's Tri-City College Prep High School in 2007. From a young age, Kayla was passionate about global affairs and other cultures, working to raise awareness of the genocide  in the Darfur region of Sudan in rural Arizona. The young humanitarian conducted two silent protest marches in her hometown to raise awareness surrounding the issue in 2007. She also wrote letters and placed calls to members of Congress to push for a change in U.S. policy. Her efforts landed her with several youth awards and she went on to dedicate her life to humanitarian aid. As a teenager, she gave an interview to her local newspaper, The Daily Courier, where she said: 'I always feel that no matter how much I give, I always get back more through these projects.' Kayla with her mother Marsha. The 26-year-old's family received a ransom note from ISIS demanding millions after she was believed to have been captured by extremists while working in a hospital in Aleppo, Syria . Kayla, with her father Carl Mueller, celebrating the birth of a baby in the family at home in Arizona in 2011 . Miss Mueller's home town of Prescott has seen its own share of tragedy, when the area lost 19 elite 'Hotshot' firefighters in a ferocious wild fire in 2013. The 26-year-old aid worker disappeared in August 2013 after she had driven into the Syrian city of Aleppo with her Syrian boyfriend. In May of that year, she had been at home in Prescott, where she shared stories from the front-line with a club where her father is a member. She told the Kiwanis Club of Prescott that she had reunited a man with a six-year-old relative after their refugee camp in Turkey was bombed, The Daily Courier reported. In July 2013, Miss Mueller posted a verse by Persian poet and Islamic scholar on social media, which  read: 'Who looks out with my eyes? What is the soul?/I cannot stop asking./If I could taste one sip of an answer, I could break out of this prison for drunks./I didn't come here of my own accord, and I can't leave that way./Whoever brought me here, will have to take me home.' The following month, she was working at a hospital when she was taken hostage by the brutal extremists, according to reports. Miss Mueller's family later received proof-of-life evidence as well as a ransom demanding millions of dollars - to be paid by mid-August. The young woman was reportedly shown in a video, covered by a burqa and begging for her life. Miss Mueller, pictured in 2007, as she headed to college in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Miss Mueller allegedly died during an hour-long bombardment on the jihadis' north Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, according to an unverified statement on a website commonly used by the terror group. There were no images of Miss Mueller herself and ISIS' claim could not be independently verified.  Her death  could easily be a propaganda move by the terror group to lay blame for the woman's death at the door of Jordan. In a statement to NPR radio station in the U.S., Miss Mueller's family described her as someone who was recognized for her academic abilities and her commitment to philanthropy. It read: 'Kayla has spent her adult life traveling the world and helping those in need. 'After graduating from college, she spent more than one year living and working with humanitarian aid groups in northern India, Israel and Palestine. She returned home to Arizona in 2011, and worked for one year at an HIV/AIDS clinic while volunteering at a women's shelter at night. 'In December 2011, she traveled to France to be an au pair so she could learn French in preparation for work in Africa. 'War sidetracked Kayla's Africa plans as she was drawn to alleviate the suffering of Syrian refugees.' According to her family, Miss Mueller moved to the Turkish/Syrian border in December 2012 and began working with Support to Life and the Danish Refugee Council to help people who had been forced to flee their homes. 'Kayla found this work heartbreaking but compelling; she was extremely devoted to the people of Syria,' her family added. American officials said they were looking into the reports of Miss Mueller's death. The White House did not have immediate comment. If her death is confirmed, the Arizona native would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. ISIS has executed five British and American aid workers and journalists in recent months. Nicolas Henin, a French journalist who was held hostage by ISIS, had been held hostage with Miss Mueller. Mr Henin was freed in April 2014 after the French government negotiated with ISIS. Mr Henin tweeted on Friday: 'Kayla Mueller was among the very last of my former cellmates still detained. I was full of hope she could have a way out.' He refused to comment further on the 26-year-old American. From a young age,  Miss Mueller (pictured in 2013 in Prescott, Arizona) became passionate about global affairs and worked to raise awareness of the genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan .","Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, from Prescott, Arizona, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by ISIS .

"China has dismissed 'groundless' claims it was behind a hacking attack which resulted in data from up to 80 million customers being stolen from US health insurance giant Anthem. The company revealed it suspected information belonging to tens of millions of current and former customers, as well as employees, has been stolen in the cyber attack. Sources close to the investigation are reported to have said the breach bore the hallmarks of previous attacks blamed on Chinese hackers. Under attack: US health insurance giant Anthem was hacked with data of 80m Americans stolen . Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry,  told a briefing in Beijing that America should not be making allegations. 'The US side should not make groundless accusations against China,' he said. 'It is unreasonable to make an accusation without enough evidence.' The cyber attack is the latest where US investigators say evidence points to China. In October, James Comey, the FBI director, said it was at the 'top of the list' of countries launching cyberattacks on US firms. 'It is very difficult to determine the source of hacking activities, especially when it is carried out across borders,' Hong said. Last year, five members of a Chinese army hacking team known as Unit 61398 were indicted by US federal prosecutors on charges of stealing information from companies, including nuclear plant manufacturer Westinghouse, SolarWorld and US Steel. The information stolen from Anthem includes names, birth dates, social security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment information, the company said. President Barack Obama's cybersecurity adviser, Michael Daniel, speaking at a seminar in Washington, called the data breach 'quite concerning' and warned consumers to change their passwords and monitor their credit scores. Attorneys general of Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Arkansas and North Carolina are now looking into the breach, according to representatives of their offices and internal documents. California's Department of Insurance said it will review Anthem's response to the data attack. Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen asked Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish to provide  detailed information about the cyberattack, the company's security practices and privacy policies by March 4, according to a letter obtained by Reuters. 'We hope and expect to work in close coordination with other attorneys general,' said Jaclyn Falkowski, a spokeswoman for Jepsen. Anthem HQ: The company revealed information including names, birth dates, social security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment details have been stolen . Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported that while the investigation into the attack was in its early stages, there were indications it could be part of a broader spying campaign rather than profit-driven identity theft. With details about a person's medical records, for example, cyber spies could craft emails that appeared legitimate to business or government agency workers but were rigged with malicious software to gain access to their employers' computers networks.","Information belonging to tens of millions of customers taken .

"A celebrated Kurdish female fighter who bravely commanded an all-female resistance force against ISIS in the besieged city of Kobane is believed to have been killed by the militant group. Hebun Sinya, also known as Hebun Dêrik, was a prominent figure within the YPJ - the woman-only offshoot of the Kurdish YPG group that has proved so effective in defending Kobane since the city was first attacked by Islamic State terrorists last September. Last month the Kurdish troops were able to push the final ISIS militants out of Kobane, but official YPG/YPJ sources have now said that Sinya was among four  fighters tragically killed in the process. Scroll down for video . Brave: Hebun Sinya, also known as Hebun Dêrik, was a prominent figure within the YPJ - the woman-only offshoot of the Kurdish YPG group that has proved so effective in defending Kobane . Interviewed: Hebun Sinya (centre) is believed to have been killed alongside a young male fighter named Ywan Zaghrws, and two others who have yet to be identified . Sinya appeared in numerous motivational videos and photographs used by the YPG/YPJ to inspire their fighters to continue defending Kobane from the ISIS terrorists attempting to seize control. At numerous points in the four month siege it appeared the city was close to falling, with Kurdish troops trapped in the centre and surrounded on all sides by the militants, who raped and massacred their way through the suburbs towards the end of last year. The arrival of Kurdish peshmerga support squadrons from neighbouring Iraq boosted the fightback, however, and by early January the YPG/YPJ had pinned ISIS back into small pockets of the city. The fearlessness of the Kurdish fighters in the face of ISIS' uncompromising brutality was such that some militants are said to have defied their commanders' orders to continue the fight in Kobane as it had been little more than  death trap for them. Hero: Hebun Sinya is believed to have been killed in the final push to rid Kobane of ISIS militants . However it was in the final push to completely clear Kobane of terrorists that Sinya, a young male fighter named Ywan Zaghrws, and two as yet unidentified others are understood to have been killed. YPJ is short for Yekîneyên Parastina Jinê, which means Women's Protection Units in Kurdish. The group was established in 2012 as a branch of the YPG (People's Protection Unit) and is believed to have anything between 7,000 and 10,000 members - mostly in Syria and Iraq. The majority of these female fighters have spent the past six months battling ISIS and have had great success in pinning the terror group back and liberating towns and cities under the militants' control. The fact the YPJ is an all-female group has had another unexpected benefit as ISIS militants are said to believe that if they are killed by a woman, they will not be rewarded with 72 virgins in the afterlife. 'These [ISIS] soldiers apparently believed that if they were killed in battle, they went to paradise as long as they were killed by a man,' Ed Royce, who chairs the U.S. House International Relations Committee, told The New York Post last September. 'And these female soldiers were communicating their satisfaction with the fact that they had taken the fight to ISIL and had stopped the advance, turned back the advance - slayed a number of these fighters, who would then run away,' he added. As a result ISIS militants have been reluctant to enter battles with the YPJ, reportedly leading to descent within the ranks of the terrorists and hastening their retreat from battles in places like Kobane. Well-known: Hebun Sinya appeared in numerous motivational videos and photographs used by the YPG/YPJ to inspire their fighters to continue defending Kobane from the ISIS terrorists attempting to seize control . Happy: Kurdish YPG fighters are seen dancing in celebration last month after the last ISIS fighters were finally pushed out of Kobane following a four month siege. Sadly Hebun Sinya was killed in the battle . The destroyed eastern part of the Syrian town of Kobane is pictured after the final battle to clear it of ISIS . Destruction: A car is seen covered in rubble in the centre of the now liberated Syrian city of Kobane . Kurds are celebrating after flushing Islamic State militants out of the town of Kobane, but victory is not yet certain in their campaign to cement hard-won autonomy in northern Syria. Hundreds of U.S.-led coalition air strikes have devastated the town, which is adrift in an Islamic State-controlled sea. Objections to autonomy from neighbouring Turkey and the United States could also make it hard for them to sustain their gains. The retaking by  last week of the predominantly Kurdish town after a four-month siege by Islamic State was a major defeat for the Sunni fundamentalist group that controls a 20,000-square mile arc of Syria and Iraq. For the Kurds, it is a bittersweet victory, as some 200,000 people, almost the entire population of Koran province, are still sheltering in Turkey. But many were exuberant. Dozens of men waiting at the Turkish crossing to return to Koran province late last week shouted and danced for joy, unframed by the wrecked city of Kobane looming behind them. Most of Kobane is destroyed, with unexplored shells and twisted hunks of cars strewn along the streets. Members of the all-female YPJ force prepare to go out on patrol to ensure ISIS militants are not in the city . Carnage: The centre of Kobane is in total ruins following clashes with ISIS and coalition air strikes . Kurds are  starting to return to Kobane after the city was cleared of ISIS militants following a four month siege . Liberated: A Kurdish YPG fighter walks with his child in the center of the Syrian border town of Kobane . The battle for Kobane weakened Islamic State, its best fighters perishing and much of its heavy weaponry depleted, Anwar Muslim, the top official in the town told Reuters at Freedom Square, where a statue of an eagle is surrounded by flattened tower blocks and cratered streets. 'They will attack again ... The coalition has supported us with weapons and air strikes. We are hopeful they will continue so we can eradicate ISIS,' Muslim said, adding that Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga and a few Free Syrian Army brigades remain in Kobane. The FSA cooperation marks a turnaround after earlier clashes between them and the Kurds. Last month, Syrian government forces also battled Kurds, breaking a tacit agreement between the two sides to focus on other enemies in the war. The Kurds, who espouse socialism and promote gender equality, first captured Koran province in 2012 after Assad's forces withdrew, dubbing it the Rojas, or western, Revolution. Two other non-contiguous Kurdish-dominated regions of Syria, Arvin and Jaeger, are also under their control. Kurds say it is home to about 4 million people. The Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011, has killed 200,000 people and turned 3 million more into refugees.","Hebun Sinya bravely led an all-female YPJ brigade defending Syrian city .

"Keeping your beloved pet happy and occupied can be demanding. But photographer Sally Turner, 53, found a novel way of ensuring her ten-year-old border collie, Brac, didn’t get bored. Using nothing more than a few simple commands and a bit of patience, she trained him to balance a stunning array of objects on his head. From sausages and bacon to oranges and even three eggs on spoons, it seems there is nothing Brac can't balance on his head or hold in his mouth. Scroll down for video . Stay: Sally Turner, 53, has trained her ten-year-old border collie Brac to hold a stunning array of objects - including a stack of sausages and bacon - on his nose . Patience: Mrs Turner began the training as a joke to keep her dog occupied, but he can now hold eggs and spoons in his mouth and keep glass of wine on his head . Good boy: Border collies are famously intelligent and pick up commands easily. Brac could already turn on the TV and close doors behind people before he began the balancing act . Mrs Turner, 53, who lives with husband Paul, 55, a management consultant, in Wilmington, Kent, trained Brac to stand perfectly still when she says the word 'steady'. He will remain in that position until she says 'what a good dog', at which point he knows she is about to remove the object and reward him with a biscuit. Bred for use as sheep dogs, border collies are very intelligent and are known for their ability to pick up commands extremely quickly. They are also full of energy and become bored easily, and so need to be kept constantly occupied. Stock still: Mrs Turner uses the command 'stay', meaning Brac will freeze until she says 'what a good dog', at which point he knows she is about to remove the objects and give him a treat . Say cheese: Mrs Turner, a photographer, lives with husband Paul, 55, a management consultant, in Wilmington, Kent, along with the endlessly obedient Brac . Festive: Brac is also a hit at any Christmas party, after being trained to balance mince pies and a fully decorated miniature Christmas tree on his head . Mrs Turner had already trained him to turn on her television and close the door behind her, before beginning the balancing act. She said: 'Border collies are working dogs and like to be kept busy. Brac always wants to be doing something and he likes to help us. 'When he was six months old he could already recongnise the names of all his toys and since then he has learned so many commands I have lost count. 'We were just messing about when we started balancing things on him. He loves to please - plus he always gets a treat afterwards. 'Teaching him such tricks is just one way of keeping him busy, and it's a bit of fun. He enjoys being the centre of attention. Plus there's nothing worse than a bored border collie.' What a cracker: Mrs Turner said teaching Brac the balancing tricks are a god way to keep him busy, adding that 'there's nothing worse than a bored border collie' Intelligent: Mrs Turner says Brac learned the names of his favourite toys when he was just a few months old and has learned so many commands since then 'I've lost count' Obedient: Mrs Turner said Brac loves performing his tricks because he wants to be the centre of attention .","Sally Turner, 53, began balancing act to keep border collie Brac occupied .

"It may sound like something from pirate tales of old, but around the world there are more than a dozen treasure troves just waiting to be uncovered. From the missing Irish Crown Jewels taken in 1907 to lost Fabergé Eggs and looted 16th century Peruvian gold, designers have plotted their rumoured locations on an interactive map. In addition to the real riches, the map also features the location of mythical and fictional treasure in books and films. Hover your mouse over an X on the map below to reveal more about the buried treasure . The map (pictured) was created for California-based eBay and features the possible locations of 35 real, mythical and fictional buried treasures around the world. Hovering a mouse over each location shows the year the treasure went missing and the details surrounding its disappearance, plus its estimated value . The map was created for California-based eBay and features 35 buried treasures around the world. Hovering a mouse over each location shows the year the treasure went missing and the details surrounding its disappearance, plus its estimated value. One location marked on the map is the Amber Room, plotted in Konigsberg, Germany. Designed by sculptor Andreas Schlüter, it was started in 1701, and was originally installed in Charlottenburg Palace. During a state visit, the room caught the eye of Peter the Great and the Prussian monarch, Frederick William I donated the room to the Russian Tsar. It was moved to the Winter House in St Petersburg, then installed at the Summer Palace in 1755. After renovations, it remained undisturbed until the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Despite attempts by the Russians to hide the panels behind wallpaper, the Germans found the Amber Room and tore it down within just 36 hours. It was then shipped to Konigsberg Castle, where it is said to have met its fate. Although it is widely believed the panels were destroyed in a fire at Konigsberg Castle in April 1945, there has never been any definitive proof of this. Over the decades, there have been countless investigations into its whereabouts. Dubbed one of the most outstanding pieces of art ever created, today it would be worth more than $142 million (£92.8 million). Fabergé eggs are limited edition jewelled eggs created by Peter Carl Fabergé between 1885 and 1917. Many were made for Russian Tsars including Alexander III and Nicholas II. In total, the House of Fabergé made 50 eggs and during the Russian revolution these eggs were sold. The majority of these are now in private and public collections, such as the Rose Trellis at the Walters Art Museum in Maryland. But seven are still missing including the Royal Danish egg, made in 1903, and the Alexander III Commemorative egg produced in 1909. Their estimated value is $210 million (£137 million).

In 1907, unknown thieves captured the Irish Crown Jewels from Dublin Castle, and this is also plotted on the map. Many believe Sir Arthur Vicars, who was the keeper of the jewels and Ulster King of Arms at the time, knew the exact location and took it to his grave when he was assassinated in 1921 by the IRA. The police issued posters showing what the jewels look like, but they have never been found. The jewels are said to be worth $8.4 million (£5.4 million). More recently, a group of bandits named The School of Turin raided the underground vault of the Antwerp Diamond Centre in 2003 and took more than $100 million (£652,800) worth of jewellery. The group was later arrested but refused to give up the location of the stolen jewels. One location marked on the buried treasure map is the Amber Room, plotted in Konigsberg, Germany (pictured).

There have since been investigations into its whereabouts. A recreation of the room at Catherine Palace in St Petersburg is pictured right . Another heist that features on the map is the 1934 bank robbery carried out by John Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson. After going on the run from the FBI, the gang sought refuge at the Little Bohemia Lodge in Mercer, Winsconsin. When agents discovered their hideout the criminals escaped and Mr Dillinger supposedly buried $200,000 (£130,500) inside a suitcase a few hundred yards north of the lodge. The map also shows the approximate location of gold coins that went missing during the second Anglo-Boer War, tonnes of gold hidden in the side of Mount Akagi in Japan in 1886, and a loot of treasure abandoned on the island of Tahiti in 1589 after being stolen from the Pisco Church in Peru.

These jewels are said to be worth $8.4 million (£5.4 million) Elsewhere, in 1901 the SS Islander sank after hitting an iceberg off the coast of Alaska. It is thought to have contained $250 million (£163 million) worth of gold. Among the mythical treasure on the map is a stash of $300 million (£196 million) buried by Benito ‘Bloody Sword’ Bonito on the Cocos Island in Australia. While a fictional treasure trove is the loot robbed in 1970 film Kelly’s Heroes. During the film, a group of WWI soldiers go absent without leave to rob a bank behind enemy lines when Lieutenant Kelly encounters a captured SS soldier who unveils the location of this loot. Ebay also created a flipbook that reveals how much people could buy if they found these missing treasures. For example, the gold buried on the SS Islander could buy seven World Cup stadiums, while Mr Dillinger’s buried stash would pay for a private island.

"He started out modestly enough — by just wanting a different nose. In the end, after up to 100 procedures, he was desperately trying to repair the damage done by reckless and botched operations and injections. Michael Jackson, surely the most infamous example of the perils of cosmetic surgery, spent 30 years trying to achieve his idea of perfection. Some friends said he was modelling himself on Diana Ross, others that he just wanted to obliterate all resemblance to his hated father. 1977, left: Only 19, Michael is the star of the Jackson Five and about to launch himself as a solo performer. Despite this success, he loathes his appearance, as he recalled years later: ‘I had pimples so badly it used to make me so shy. I cried every day.’ Indeed, the misery is written all over his face. According to La Toya, Michael was especially distressed by his nose and would say: ‘It’s too big, I want to get it done.’ 1979, right: An apparently confident 20-year-old Jackson shows off his new nose. Ashamed to admit he just wanted a smaller nose, he claimed he’d had an operation after breaking it during a dance rehearsal. However, he wasn’t satisfied with this result — Dr Steven Hoefflin, who performed a second nose job to correct the original operation, said that he was left with breathing difficulties and ‘required further work’ 1983, left: Publicising his best-selling album Thriller, Michael has got rid of his teenage afro and is wearing skin-lightening make-up. His nose seems to have been thinned again and cheek implants have been inserted. He liked the effect so much he had a third nose job the following year, increased the size of the cheek implants and had his eyelids ‘lifted’, which reduces bagginess and removes excess skin. 1991, right: Now 33 and living a reclusive life. After a fourth or fifth nose job, his nostrils have started to assume a triangular look. (In 1992 he was spotted wearing a prosthetic nose tip to try to cover up the botched results of the surgery.) He has a new dimple in his chin and has had chin implants to make it larger. He has started to look whiter — he later claimed this was a consequence of the skin condition vitiligo . A new TV documentary about his surgery addiction reveals he was so nervous about the initial rhinoplasty (nose job) that he persuaded his older sister La Toya to act as a guinea pig. Miss Jackson, 58, said: ‘He wanted to get his nose done . . . he kept saying: “What do you think? What do you think?” I said: “Michael, if that’s what you want, if it’s gonna make you feel better, get it done.” ‘He asked me: “Can you be the guinea pig for me? Can you get your nose done and let me see how it looks, and if it hurts?” ’ Once satisfied with the results of La Toya’s operation, Michael went ahead with it himself in 1979. 1995, left: Jackson, 37, is extremely pale thanks to frequent skin bleaching by a dermatologist and heavy use of make-up. He has also started to wear wigs. His friend, illusionist Uri Geller, asked why he was changing his appearance. Geller says he replied: ‘I don’t want to look like my father.’ By now Michael was married to Elvis’s daughter Lisa Marie Presley. They separated the following year. 2002, right: He has taped his nose, apparently to stop fluid from botched surgery from leaking into his mouth. He wore the tape at all times during this period. Leading rhinoplasty surgeon Dr Pamela Lipkin said: ‘I think something in his nose, a graft, an implant, has now come out through the skin and that’s why he’s probably got a hole in his skin. He has what we call an end-stage nose, one that’s beyond the point of no return’ 2003, left: Looking more feminine shortly after the birth of his third child, Blanket. In a controversial documentary made by Martin Bashir, he claimed: ‘I’ve had no plastic surgery on my face, just my nose. It helped me breathe better so I can hit higher notes. I am telling you the honest truth, I didn’t do anything to my face.’ He also said he’d be happier on stage ‘wearing a mask’. 2009, right: Jackson, 50, was in debt to the tune of £350 million. He announced a surprise tour called This Is It. His friend Dr Allen Klein said: ‘It got to the point where his nose was far too thin. It didn’t look natural to me. I rebuilt it using fillers.’ He is missing part of his ear — the cartilage having been used to rebuild his face. He died of a cardiac arrest in June before the tour after being given drugs to help him sleep . A computer-generated image of how Michael Jackson would have looked today without surgery . Seven years later, he also persuaded a friend and fellow plastic surgery devotee, Hollywood hair stylist Steve Erhardt, to be the first to experiment with a cleft chin operation. Erhardt claims Michael’s plastic surgeon told the singer that he needed a chin ‘like Kirk Douglas, something very masculine’. After Erhardt’s new chin was revealed, Jackson went on to have this operation several times. Despite his initial nerves, Michael also had Botox, fillers, bleached his skin, had cheek implants and lip augmentation. He changed the shape of his nose to the point that it was so narrow the airways were blocked. Body dysmorphic disorder expert Dr Eda Gorbis — who believes Jackson was suffering from the illness, where sufferers have a distorted view of their appearance — has claimed he had as many as 100 procedures. Eventually his original features were almost completely obliterated, as was his ethnicity. But the documentary’s most heartbreaking revelation is a computer-generated image of how the star could have looked had he left his face alone — an attractive, contented black man with a warm smile.

"Researchers have been left baffled as hundreds of sick and starving sea lion pups continue to wash up on California beaches in what is proving to be a particularly deadly winter for the pinnipeds. In January, rescuers netted more than 250 frail pups from San Diego to San Francisco Bay, mostly seven-month-olds that should have been nursing with their mothers in the Channel Islands or Mexico. Although this is the third year of mass die-offs of pups, the 2015 figures are the worst so far. They have even prompted the National Marine Fisheries Service to declare a rare 'unusual mortality event'. The reason behind the increasing die-offs is unknown. Many scientists believe warmer-than-average waters are forcing mother sea lions to venture farther out for food, leaving their offspring behind. Rescued: Researchers have been left baffled as hundreds of sick and starving sea lion pups continue to wash up on California beaches. Above, rescued pups are pictured in a pen at Sea World San Diego in California . Undernourished: In January, rescuers netted more than 250 frail pups from San Diego to San Francisco Bay, mostly seven-month-olds that should have been nursing with their mothers in the Channel Islands or Mexico . Examination: Although this is the third year of mass die-offs of pups, the 2015 figures are the worst so far. Above, a vet at Sea World San Diego is seen examining a sick pup that was rescued from a nearby beach . Others say the fish the seals eat may be feeding farther from the islands than in the past, leading to the same problem. And some theorize the pups may be suffering from an unidentified disease. Speaking of the sick pups, Erica Donnelly-Greenan, who manages the Sausalito-based Marine Mammal Center’s rescue station, said: 'They just look very emaciated, very underweight.' She added: 'You can see the bones under their skin. You can get a visual of their ribs.' Dozens of wayward pups have been found at the center, situated along Monterey Bay.The nonprofit  responded to 120 pups in the first five or six weeks of 2015, the San Jose Mercury News reported. It is currently treating the pups - many of which washed ashore weighing just 15 or 16 pounds compared to a healthy 40 pounds - with antibiotics. The sickest are being force-fed with tubes. Recovery: The reason behind the increasing die-offs is unknown. Many scientists believe warmer-than-average waters are forcing mother sea lions to venture farther out for food, leaving their offspring behind .

And others theorize the pups may be suffering from an unidentified disease . 'Our numbers are twice what they were in 2013,' said David Bard, operations director of the San Pedro center. 'In 2013, we saw an unprecedented number of rescues, it was a record then.' Meanwhile, more than 50 malnourished sea lion pups have been placed in a holding pen at Sea World San Diego since the beginning of the year after being rescued on beaches along the city's coast. 'When they came in, they couldn't raise their heads, so to see them start grooming and barking, that means they're feeling much better, much more themselves,' SeaWorld vet Dr. Hendrik Rollens said. 'They are ready to go back to the wild.' Rescued pups: Dozens of wayward pups have been found at the center, situated along Monterey Bay. The nonprofit responded to 120 pups in the first five or six weeks of 2015. Above, more rescued sea lion pups . Undergoing treatment: Speaking of the sick pups, Erica Donnelly-Greenan, who manages the Sausalito-based Marine Mammal Center’s rescue station in California, said: 'They just look very emaciated, very underweight' Saved: A SeaWorld vet cares for a sick sea lion pup (left) while a pair of pups bathe in the sun at a California rescue center (right) Young sea lions typically do not wean off their mothers until they are 10 or 11 months . Because young sea lions typically do not wean off their mothers until they are 10 or 11 months old, they could struggle for survival if left by their mothers while they search farther afield for food. 'The pups are desperate and starving, so they just jump in the water and swim and get pulled to the coastline,' said Shawn Johnson, director of veterinary medicine for the Marine Mammal Center. Speaking to SFGate, she added: 'This is the third year that we’ve seen these mass die-offs, but this is the worst so far. If this continues, there will be some long-term effects on the sea lion population.' Justin Viezbicke, stranding network coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, said the population of sea lions might have reached its  capacity in the animals' environment, sparking the mass die-offs. A welcome meal: A rescued California sea lion pup enjoys a fish during feeding time at Sea World San Diego . Swimming: Despite the die-offs, sea lions in California have been relatively healthy in recent decades, with the population at 300,000 today. Above, the same pup is seen eating the fish while swimming at the center . 'These animals are a puzzle piece for us,' Mr Viezbicke said. 'They provide insight into what’s going on in the environment... These things could come back and affect humans.' Despite the current situation, sea lions in California have been relatively healthy in recent decades, with the population at 300,000 today, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. In 1972, Marine Mammal Protection Act  helped boost the pinnipeds' numbers by banning hunters from killing the animals for their hide and blubber. NOAA is investigating the mass die-offs. Treated for toxicity: Blarney McCresty, an adult male California sea lion, was treated for domoic acid toxicity during his rehabilitation at The Marine Mammal Center. He is now believed to be recovering at the facility .","In January, over 250 pups rescued from San Diego to San Francisco Bay .

"When it comes to eating for Carpet Pythons, it’s about getting while the getting’s good. Astonishing images have surfaced this week from a property in Queensland of a three-metre python devouring a possum whole while hanging from a tree. The pictures, taken on Wednesday, illustrate the dramatic feeding methods of the enormous serpent. Scroll down for video . A three-metre python devours a possum whole while hanging from a tree . Pythons are opportunistic feeders, meaning they seize any opening for a large meal by attempting to take it all in one go . Jasmine Kerr, who captured the photographs, said her mother stumbled upon the incredible scene. ‘My mum was moving some horses on her property in Gunalda. She was petrified, and told me to come down immediately.’ Kerr said she was comfortable getting up close to the Carpet Python since she owns her own as a pet. ‘I was happy to get up close and just observe. It was pretty astonishing in person.’ Stuart Mckenzie, snake catcher at Sunshine Coast Snake and Reptile removal, said it was one of the largest snakes he had ever come across. ‘Occasionally we get a call from farms where snakes had broken into the chicken coop and eaten one of the birds, but this was pretty unusual.

"A company offering  Harry Potter live role-play experiences is set to buy a castle in Poland. In April, the College of Wizardry will rent out a stunning castle in Czocha, Poland, so that Harry Potter fans can dress up as their favourite characters and enjoy a four-day adventure. After the first experience sold out in just 90 seconds, the company behind the fan event has now announced it wants to buy a castle to be able to host more experiences throughout the year. Scroll down for video . The project coordinator for the College of Wizardry hopes to raise enough money to buy a Polish castle and continue the Harry Potter role-playing days . This year's role-playing festival in Poland sold out in just 90 seconds as people from all over the world come together to celebrate Harry Potter . Up to 200 fans will join together in April to recreate their favourite scenes from the popular book and film series after paying around £220 for the trip. The Live Action Role Playing festival (LARP) is run via a collaboration between Danish company Rollespilsfabrikken and Polish organisation Liveform, both not-for-profit organisations. Project coordinator of the College of Wizardry Claus Raasted announced the ambitious plans to raise enough money to buy a castle on a crowdfunding website. 'If we raise more money, we can do more events, Raasted told MailOnline Travel. 'And if we manage to raise one million dollars, then we'll buy our own castle in Poland. That's the dream.' Raasted and his team of volunteers from Liveform and Rollespilsfabrikken are creating an original story world for College of Wizardry to take place in, and are launching an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign with the aim of creating more larp events. While the two April events are set in the Harry Potter world by agreement with Warner Bros, the future will see Raasted and co develop their own story world and host 'wizard school events.' Students will get to test out some potions, under the watchful eye of their professors . The modest goal is to raise at least $50,000. The campaign goes live on February 23. Enrollment at the College of Wizardry opened on December 1, 2014, with sessions in April selling out in just 90 seconds. Mixing potions, discovering the woodland and even broomstick practice (though that won't involve going airborne) are all part of the mystical stayover. Harry Potter fans can act out their fantasies by attending Poland's version of Hogwarts . Broomstick training, plus a bit of game playing, will take place in the playground . Attendees will be given a school robe and a book. The rules are fairly simple - the majority of LARP players are students, and so are expected to behave appropriately as you would at any school. There are also a number of staff roles up for grabs - including the professors, the groundskeeper and the janitors. The professors will be expected to lecture, the groundskeeper is responsible for the woods around the castle and the janitors run the school, they are the law and their word is final. A number of roles are filled at the role-playing festival, including the important role of the professors . It's hard work reaching the levels expected as a student at Hogwarts . There are  players from all over Europe, with Scandinavian fans historically making up a large number. But obviously the main attraction is the playground - hidden passageways, a room of mirrors, a tower, dungeons and cellars, great halls and dark hallways ensure, just like the young wizard does at Hogwarts.

"Heather Mack, the pregnant teenager on trial in Bali charged with murdering her mother, was rushed to hospital from her prison today. Sources inside Kerobokan Jail told the Daily Mail Online the 19-year-old prisoner had collapsed with stomach pain and had started bleeding. According to a prison source, Miss Mack cried out in pain at lunch time and after a check by the prison doctor it was decided she needed immediate hospital treatment. She was taken to Bali's Sanglah Hospital, the main medical centre in Denpasar, where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated. Hospital officials later said Miss Mack's baby was safe but she had been taken to hospital for an immediate check-up because she was in pain and had lost blood. Scroll down for video . Medical emergency: Pregnant Heather Mack, 19, collapsed with stomach pain and had started bleeding inside Kerobokan prison following a doctor's check-up . It is not known whether she was going into labour, had a miscarriage, or was suffering from some other medical problem . The U.S. teenager is not expecting her baby daughter - which she has named Stella - for another two months . Response: She was taken to Bali's Sanglah Hospital, the main medical centre in Denpasar, where tourists and other foreigners are usually treated . Co-defendent: Her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer is jointly charged with the murder of Sheila von Wiese-Mack . But her condition was regarded as serious enough for an ambulance to be called to take her quickly to hospital. The US teenager is not expecting her baby daughter - which she has named Stella - for another two months. Mack her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and then stuffing her body inside a suitcase. If convicted the pair could be killed by firing squad. A spokesman at Bali's Sanglah Hospital later said: 'She has not lost the baby. The baby is alright.' She was expected to remain in hospital overnight and perhaps longer. Once given the all clear, Miss Mack will be returned to her cell at Kerobokan prison to await the next hearing in her murder trial, scheduled for next week. Miss Mack has been receiving help from two women volunteers who have been buying food for her and taking it to the jail to supplement the basic rice and vegetables that Kerobokan provides to inmates. She has revealed that she intends to keep the child with her in her cell - which she is sharing with up to 10 other women. Prisoners who give birth are allowed to keep their babies for two years, after which the youngsters have to be passed to local carers or to relatives. The court was shown the suitcase that Sheila von Wiese-Mack's body was allegedly found stuffed inside, along with a set of blood stained sheets . However, it has been reported by women visiting the jail that they have learned the other women in Miss Mack's cell are not happy about her raising a child in their presence. The other prisoners have reportedly complained that a young baby will keep them awake. On Thursday she reportedly made a desperate phone call to a US judge  because she had no Indonesian attorney to represent her. In addition her US lawyer withdrew from the case over a 'breakdown in communication,' according to the Chicago Tribune. The pair have pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder and their cases are being tried separately in the Denpasar District Court in Bali. As Mack's trial got underway, the strain was visible on her face as she followed proceedings through an Indonesian interpreter. When the silver-coloured suitcase in which the folded body of Sheila Von-Wiese Mack is alleged to have been placed was shown to the three judges, it was revealed that her Indonesian lawyer had received only a part-payment from the trust fund. Within hours, Mack's US civil attorney Anthony Scifo, filed a motion to voluntarily withdraw from her case, citing a 'substantial breakdown in communication,' the Tribune reported. Heather Mack, second right, listens intently to an Indonesian translator as the case against her begins at Denpasar District Court, Bali . The paper said that in three phone calls, a woman claiming to be Mack, told a law clerk in the office of Cook County judge Neil Cohen she needed help. The judge had previously said she could use some of the money her murdered mother has left in a trust fund for her. Mack reportedly said she had fired her attorneys and explained that she currently has no attorneys and doesn't know how to speak to the judge, the law clerk said in a written statement read to the Cook County court. 'She asked how she could get another attorney to represent her or to speak to the (Cook County) judge,' the Tribune reported the clerk as telling the court. Heather Mack, 19, appeared emotional as she cradled her growing baby bump ahead of the start of her trial . 'I told her that I could not give her legal advice and the conversation ended.' But in a third call, the woman claiming to be Mack 'mentioned that she was in Indonesia and has no money, no-one to call and no attorneys and doesn't know what to do.' Bali lawyer Ary Soenardi said that he was still acting for her and was continuing to work on her defence. A court spokesman in Bali said no notification had been given that he had removed himself from the case, which has been adjourned until next week. It is then that the first of the prosecution witnesses will be called. Among the witness will be staff from the St Regis Hotel - where the murder occurred - police and forensic experts. Ahead of the start of the trial against her Mack revealed that she misses her socialite mother  'everyday' and loved her 'with all my heart.' She said she was petrified ahead of her trial, but that her fears were ‘more for my daughter than me,’ according to the Chicago Tribune. If the young lovers are found guilty they will face a firing squad. 'I loved my mom with all my heart and miss her every day,’ the newspaper reported Mack as saying. She reportedly added that ‘If I allow myself to grieve whatsoever I’m in a complete state of depression. ‘The smile (seen in photos of her arriving at court) is actually a disguise I wear to survive here.’ But she said she was receiving help from ‘good Samaritans who helped to get her food and vitamins and her baby, Stella, named after Schaefer’s great-grandmother, was healthy. Referring to the baby, she told the paper: ‘She’s healthy and it is completely safe here and (a) completely fair country.’ Mack also revealed that she believed her lawyer would prove her innocence and asked ‘that the public reserve judgment on my case until the judges passes his verdict.’ Earlier this week three judges rejected a last-ditch attempt by the Chicago couple's defence teams to have the case thrown out. They had  claimed that there were 'inaccuracies' on the indictment and it should be annulled at the hearing in Denpasar. The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of their trials. They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua. Heavily pregnant Heather Mack, pictured with Tommy Schaefer, arriving at court ahead of her trial. Heather Mack, left, and co-accused Tommy Schaefer, right, boarding the  prison van to take them to court . They were charged with premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty. Prosecutors have alleged that the couple sent text messages about their initial plan to disguise a murder as suicide on the beach. In their indictment, prosecutors alleged that the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not approve of their relationship and that Mack had once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000. They further alleged that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and Schaefer then battered her with a fruit bowl handle. Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, according to the indictment. They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did, it was alleged. The pair are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured, and stuffing her body in a suitcase . Behind bars: Mack and Schaefer, pictured earlier this week, face a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty.","Heather Mack, 19, was transported to Bali's Sanglah Hospital .

"Wrestling legend Jake 'The Snake' Roberts was all but ready to give up on life when three years ago a friend pulled him from the brink. By the time Roberts' former protege Diamond Dallas Page, the founder of DDP Yoga, tracked down the 59-year-old Hall of Famer, Roberts hit rock bottom with drug and alcohol addiction, and as far as he was concerned, there was no way out for him. 'I had given up on life completely; I was just waiting to die. I was praying it would happen soon,' Roberts recalls in a new documentary The Resurrection of Jake The Snake Roberts, which tells the story of how, against overwhelming odds, the former WWF celebrity was able to turn his life around. Glory days: Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, pictured in his heyday as a WWF superstar . Older and wiser: Roberts, 59. pictured last month during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival in Utah . True to life: A new documentary The Resurrection of Jake The Snake Roberts, which premiered in Utah in January, tells the story of how the former WWF celebrity was able to turn his life around . The film, created by Roberts' friend Page and director Steve Yu, premiered last month at the Slamdance Film Festival in Utah. Speaking to ABC News about his three-year struggle to overcome addiction, Roberts said his dependence on alcohol, pills and crack cocaine had made him feel worthless and alone in the world. 'I’ve been to jail and rehab, I’ve never heard anybody say ""When I was younger, my dream was to become an addict or alcoholic,""' Roberts said in the interview last month. 'It’s not something anyone wants for themselves.' Roberts, born Aurelian Smith, had the deck stacked against him from the outset. The son of a teenage mother who became pregnant with him at age 12 and famed wrestler Grizzly Smith, the future Hall of Famer suffered severe trauma as a child, including domestic abuse and the kidnapping and murder of his sister. Roberts embarked on his wrestling career in 1974 in Louisiana. A little over a decade later, he made his debut with the World Wrestling Federation, which remained his home, on and off, until 1997 when he was fired. He continued taking part in championships and bouts until 2011, when Roberts announced his retirement from the sport. Legend: Roberts, born Aurelian Smith, launched his wrestling career in 1974 in Louisiana before joining WWF a decade later . Signature move: Roberts' wrestling character was known to throw pythons on his vanquished opponents . Nothing fake about that: Diamond Dallas Page, Roberts' one-time wrestling protege-turned-yoga guru, said that most people think that what they do in the ring is fake, but in fact, it takes a very really physical toll on the performers . That same year, Jake Roberts was the odds-on favorite to be the next retired wrestler to die, according to Diamond Dallas Page, himself a former WWF star who knew firsthand how physically and mentally taxing the brutal sport can be. 'When you look at football players, hockey players and wrestlers, we take the most beating out of any of them, because we do it 270 nights a year,' Page explained. 'It was brutal and you don’t realize it when you are living the dream.' He added: 'As for people who say wrestling is fake, you can’t fake gravity. We are out there putting on a show. We are rock 'n' roll stuntmen gladiators.' The Snake's savior: By the time Page, the founder of DDP yoga, tracked down Roberts in 2011, the retired WWF star was on the brink of death from drug addiction, alcoholism and obesity . By the time they retire after spending years being thrashed about in the ring for the entertainment of millions, many wrestlers come out the other side feeling broken and lost because they don't know how to do anything else. As their life begins to crumble, often compounded by martial or financial problems, that is when addiction comes into play, Page said. That was the bleak reality Jake 'The Snake' Roberts, the one-time charismatic, python-flinging star of WWF and the inventor of the notorious DDT wrestling maneuver, found himself when he hung up his dukes. When in 2011 Dallas Page decided to track down his old mentor, the two had not spoken for five years. 'The only reason I was a three-time champion, was because of what Jake Roberts taught me. I always wanted to repay him,' Page explained. The former wrestler-turned-founder of a specialized yoga program assumed that Roberts was clean. Nothing could prepare Page for the sight of a 300-lbs pill-popping, crack-smoking alcoholic who answered the door. ‘My father was an alcoholic, who finally stopped drinking in his 70s,’ Page said. ‘Jake’s a great guy, he just made a lot of bad decisions. I saw so much of my dad in him.’ Diamond Dallas Page turned out to be uniquely qualified to help Roberts. His yoga program is tailored to help former wrestlers and military veterans get back on their feet with a special fitness routine and healthy diet. Grueling work: It took Roberts (pictured in Atlanta in May 2013) three years of dieting and exercise to get his life back on track by restoring his health . For Page, the first order of business was to change Roberts' diet by replacing junk food with wholesome organic meals so he could 'feel alive again.' The next step was to put Roberts on a workout regimen to begin rebuilding his battered body. Page even moved Roberts into his home in Atlanta so he could keep him on track at all times. At first, the 59-year-old grossly overweight former wrestler could hardly get through five minutes of exercise without wheezing and screaming in pain. But little by little, he began regaining his strength. 'I can remember when I lost the first 10 pounds, because it was so long since I had a victory under my name,' Roberts recalled with pride to ABC. After three years of grueling work on his body and mind - a process punctuated by setbacks, shouting matches with Page and a bout with cancer - Roberts emerged sober and 80lbs lighter. ‘I’m feeling better than I’ve felt in 25 years. Not just mentally but physically,' he said. 'The things that I’ve regained are endless – friends, family and work relationships.’ New lease on life: Now 80lbs lighter and sober, Roberts (left) says he's been able to reconnect with his children and grandchildren, and he is now excited to live . Once estranged from his children because of his many demons, the twice-divorced WWF legend has found his way back into their lives. This past Christmas, he got to spend time with his brood, including his 10 grandkids. Jake Roberts said the biggest change for him was that now he was able to dream again and wake up feeling excited to live. The former wrestler also has found a new calling in life at age 59 - helping others like him by inspiring them to make a change. ‘The real treasure is when a guy walks up to you with his daughter, wife and son, and begins thanking me ""for giving them all back to me,”’ Roberts said.","Former WWF legend Jake 'The Snake' Roberts is the subject of a new documentary chronicling his battle with addiction .

"The Roman Catholic archbishop of San Francisco has unveiled a controversial document that instructs  staff at Catholic high schools to refrain from saying or doing anything publicly that contradicts church doctrine. Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone's new faculty handbook describes homosexuality, same-sex marriage, abortion, birth control, sex outside of marriage, the viewing of pornography and masturbation as 'evil.' The handbook additions would take effect in the 2015-16 school year at Archbishop Riordan and Sacred Heart Cathedral Prep in San Francisco, Marin Catholic in Kentfield, and Junipero Serra in San Mateo County. Scroll down for video . Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone's new faculty handbook describes homosexuality, same-sex marriage, abortion, birth control, sex outside of marriage, the viewing of pornography and masturbation as 'evil' The Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Religion and Faith Program said the 'moral clauses' proposed by Archbishop Cordileone 'stand in stark relief to the message of inclusion being promoted by Pope Francis' Archbishop  Cordileone (right) is greeted after receiving the sacred pallium from Pope Francis (seated) at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican in June . Lisbeth Melendez Rivera, a director of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Religion and Faith Program, said: 'The new ""moral clauses"" proposed by Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone stand in stark relief to the message of inclusion being promoted by Pope Francis.' The handbook clarifies that even though California allows same-sex marriages, holy matrimony can only take place between a man and a woman. Cordileone's document calls sperm donation, the use of a surrogate and other forms of 'artificial reproductive technology' evil as well, the San Francisco Gate reported. Should the Supreme Court Overturn Gay Marriage Ban? Should the Supreme Court Overturn Gay Marriage Ban? Now share your opinion . The archbishop stressed the handbook additions are meant to provide clarity for teachers and not to target any educators for dismissal. Cordileone said in a in a YouTube video: 'The intention is certainly not to pry into the private lives of the teachers. 'We certainly aren't going to do that. 'People are entitled to their private lives, but teachers also have to respect the mission of the school in the way they live their public lives.' Archdiocesan Federation of Teachers President Lisa Dole, a social studies teacher at Marin Catholic, said union members were still digesting what Cordileone had to say. Union leaders said in a statement: 'We are pleased that the document acknowledges that the teachers in our high school are not all the same, like many Catholics around the world who struggle with their adherence to some of the teachings of the church. 'However, there are still concerns with the proposed language and some key issues that the union and archbishop are hopeful that we will be able to work out.' The US Supreme Court has exempted churches and religious schools from having to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws for employees in 'ministerial roles.' Confusion about the Church's stance is prevalent in areas of sexual morality and religious discipline. For this reason, the statements for inclusion in the faculty handbook focus on these two areas. This focus does not imply lesser importance to Catholic teachings on social justice, which in fact are widely accepted and well interpreted in Catholic educational institutions. The areas requiring clarification are in Catholic teachings on sexual morality and religious practice. Having clear statements especially about 'hot button issues' related to faith and morals is important to teachers for two reasons. The first is that a forthright statement of the Church's position on these issues helps teachers provide good perspectives to their students who often struggle in these areas. The second reason is that candid formulation of Church doctrine protects those teachers who don't agree with the statements. That sounds counterintuitive, but it is indeed the case. In a society in which confusion reigns about Church teachings, highlighting the controversial issues alerts teachers to avoid contradicting Church teaching on these issues either in the school or in some public way outside the classroom.

"A single mother who fell pregnant at 13 says she wishes she had been given a contraceptive implant when she was 10. Megan Oakley, now 19, from Portsmouth, spoke out following a report in the MailOnline that revealed children have been given the implant by some NHS Trusts. Megan, who has a four-year-old son, said on today's This Morning that her life would turned out differently had she been given the treatment. Scroll down for video . Teen mother Megan Oakley, 19, pictured on today's This Morning with her son Ashton-Tyler, four . She said: 'At 13 I didn't have much sex education, I knew briefly about some contraception but all I was taught at school was about personal hygiene.' Megan started having sex with schoolboy Lucas Cragg, when she was 13. He was 15 at the time but she said he was equally clueless about contraception. 'He was a bit older but we were both so young, we didn't have a clue. We didn't think it would happen to us,' she told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. The teenager only realised she was pregnant months later thanks to doing an internet search as she wasn't aware missing a period was a sign. She explained: 'I started feeling tired. I was so young I didn't understand about period cycles. I only realised when I Googled my symptoms and it came up with pregnant. 'I thought ""is this really happening?""' Megan told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford she was clueless about sex education and didn't think she would get pregnant when she started having sex with a 15-year-old boyfriend when she was 13 . By then she had split up with Lucas but she knew straight away that she wanted to keep the baby. She nervously told her mother, Helen, 45, who had become a single mother herself when Megan's father had walked out on them when she was a baby. Megan said: 'She didn't know I had been having sex but when I told her I needed to talk to her she guessed what was up. She has been brilliant and supported me all the way.' The young mother said it was difficult to carry on at school during and after her pregnancy but she was determined to finish her education. She said: 'It was really scary, and at 13 you don't know how to deal with people's comments. 'Everyone knew me as girl who was pregnant or the girl with the baby so I did get abusive remarks. 'All eyes were often on me and people were talking and whispering about me. But I stayed and got my GCSEs.' After a 'traumatic birth' her son, Ashton-Tyler, was born weighing 10lb 6oz. Megan, left, thinks there should be better sex education in schools and children should be told how they can access contraception to prevent other teen pregnancies, file photo right . While Megan loves her son and credits him for making her work harder at school (before he was born she said she often 'bunked off') she thinks other teen pregnancies could be prevented if children had better access to contraception. She said: 'I'm not saying 10-year-olds should have sex but if they are sexually active they should be offered contraception to prevent teen pregnancies and STDs.' A total of 61 NHS Trusts across England admitted they had fitted the implants in minors (file photo) Megan is now a 'peer educator' and voluntarily visits schools to talk to pupils about contraception and how they can get it. 'Some students don't have clue, it's quite shocking,' she said. 'There should be more education about how they can access contraception and they should have knowledge of where they can go to get it.' Last week, MailOnline reported how East Lancashire NHS Trust, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust and Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, in Liverpool, each gave the contraceptive implant to a 10-year-old during the last five years. Meanwhile South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, based in Torbay, gave the contraceptive device to a 10 or 11-year-old. During the last five years, at least 53 12-year-olds were given the implant, as well as a minimum of 281 13-year-olds. More than 3,000 14-year-olds and at least 6,300 girls aged 15 were also given the device, which releases the hormone progesterone to prevent pregnancy, inserted under the skin in their arms. A total of 61 NHS Trusts across England admitted they had fitted the implants in minors after a series of Freedom of Information Act requests by MailOnline. Source: NHS Choices . The numbers are likely to be even higher, as dozens of Trusts did not or were unable to provide full figures. While Megan thinks it is a good idea if it prevents teen pregnancies like hers, others have disagreed. Viewers took to This Morning's Facebook page to debate the issue. Emma Jones wrote: 'My daughter is 10 and I would never dream of giving this to her. She is a little girl and at that age they don't need to know about this stuff, kids should be allowed to be kids.' Donna Greenhalgh agreed. She said: 'Seriously why would a 10 year old even be sexually active and which parent in the right mind would even take their 10 year old for the contraceptive? This is just diabolical and disgusting.' Samantha Johnson added: 'Would rather we taught girls to respect their bodies and their minds and realise sex is not something you just give away! Don't put young girls on the pill!' But Claire Jones thinks Megan has a point. She said: 'My daughter is 12 and if she thought she was old enough to have sex, then she would be old enough to use contraception, this even applies for kids as young as 10 because, as sad as it, is they are maturing younger now than we ever did.'","Megan Oakley, now 19, from Portsmouth, fell pregnant at 13 .

"On trial: Nurse Claire Jones was allegedly strangled by her half-naked husband Royston in front of her terrified patients on the intensive care ward where she worked . A jealous husband who was high on drugs tried to murder his nurse wife on the ward where she worked because he was convinced she was having an affair, a court heard. Royston Jones, 39, was naked from the waist-up and said he had a hand grenade as he strangled his wife Claire in front of seven patients she was treating in intensive care, it is alleged. An unconscious Mrs Jones was only saved after her 'heroic' colleagues at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, hit him with a chair and managed to drag him off, the jury was told. Newport Crown Court heard after being arrested he told police: 'I'll do two years for this. The court better not let me out or I'll finish the job. I won't be in jail forever.' Jones, who denies attempted murder, was described in court as 'jealous, possessive, and aggressive' towards his wife. Before the alleged murder attempt Mrs Jones had moved back with her mother but on one occasion he rushed into the property shouting: 'I'm going to kill her,' it was said. Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'He was a man who was convinced his estranged wife was in another relationship. 'He had his hands around her throat and there's no doubt he was trying to kill her by strangling her. 'Other members of staff tried to pull him away. He was too strong however and continued to try to kill her. 'Were it not for the heroic intervention of staff at that hospital, he would undoubtedly have succeeded.' One member of staff tried to hit him with a chair - while a consultant was kneed in the head. The court heard how Mrs Jones, 35, told police about what happened that day. The mother-of-three said: 'He was like a man possessed. Marching towards me, seething and glaring at me. 'All he said to me was: ""You've done it now."" And I said: ""What have I done?"" 'He put both his hands around my throat and neck and I was aware of colleagues screaming and shouting around me. They were shouting: ""Get off her, get off her!'' 'I lost consciousness and the next thing I remember is being dragged into an office and a colleague telling me you're alright now. My colleagues were looking at me in horror.' Attack: An unconscious Mrs Jones was only saved after her 'heroic' colleagues at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, hit him with a chair and managed to drag him off, the jury was told . Mrs Jones was then taken to the nearby accident and emergency unit where she was treated for a swollen neck and throat, elbow and back injuries. She told the police in her interview: 'I feel confused why he did this. He thought I was with someone that day but I wasn't. 'He's very paranoid, thinking I have someone with me.' Newport Crown Court heard Jones had a history of drug abuse - and had taken drugs that day with the intent of killing his wife. The jury heard a recording of a phone call between a police officer and Claire in the seconds leading up to the attack - before screams could be heard. In another recording heard in court, a staff member told police that patients at the intensive care unit were 'terrified' as the attack unfolded. Jones, of Brynmawr, Gwent, denies attempted murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Royston Jones, 39, denies attempted murder of wife Claire in her hospital .

"Victim: Raja Fayad, a graduate director and expert in colon cancer, was gunned down at the University of South Carolina's Public Health Research Center . A Lebanese cancer researcher was has been identified as the victim of a murder suicide on the University of South Carolina's campus. Raja Fayad, a graduate director and expert in colon cancer, was gunned down at the Public Health Research Center in the first multiple shooting on the site in 30 years. Neighbors said the 45-year-old, who completed his MD in Syria before moving to the United States, recently ended a 'stormy relationship' with a woman he was living with, described as his girlfriend. Fathi Elsahli told The State the situation had deteriorated when he moved out to be with another woman. Fayad and his ex are believed to have moved from Chicago, where Fayad had been teaching. She settled in August after getting a job, but then lost it, the paper reported. Helena Sanford, who lives next door, said the Faya's ex girlfriend told her that Internet service and electricity had been cut off at the home. She told the paper: 'It's devastating. It's a terrible waste of life.' Fayad came to USC in 2008 from the University of Illinois-Chicago as an associate professor in the Arnold School of Public Health, according to his online biographical information. He earned his MD at Aleppo University School of Medicine in Syria in 1995. Many students rated Fayad highly before his death, suggesting he made Exercise Science 223, a anatomy and physiology course, bearable. On the anonymous review site Rate My Professor Fayad earned a 4.7 on a 5.0 scale. Some of the comments included were: 'Dr. Fayad is the man. He is super laid back and loves the material he teaches. ... One of the best professors I’ve had. Lockdown: Heavily armed and armored police from Columbia, South Carolina swarmed the campus on Thursday afternoon after a gunman opened fire . Precautions: There was no longer any active danger almost immediately following what many reports have called a murder-suicide . Another read: 'Take this professor. He is awesome! He knows what he is teaching and seems interested in his research.' Much of the campus remained on a complete lockdown in the aftermath of the shooting even though police said danger from the 'very isolated' incident was over. A perimeter was set up around the public health building, where police carrying AR-15s and wearing SWAT gear ushered students out and across the street. At 2:15pm, the school's Carolina Alert system sent a second message out telling students and staff there was no longer a threat. 'There was no active shooter other than the two deceased,' said State Law Enforcement Division spokesman Thom Berry. According to The State reporter Amanda Coyne, some professors even taught through the lockdown. The shooting happened a couple of blocks from the Statehouse and two blocks from the university's basketball arena. The street is one of the city's busiest. Sirens could be heard as more police officers arrived at the public health building. Shots fired: The University of South Carolina campus in Columbia was put on lock down and students told to shelter in place following a 1:20pm shooting Thursday . Law enforcement officials gather on the campus of the University of South Carolina in Columbia after shots were fired at its new School of Public Health on Thursday . An alert was also issued to employees at the South Carolina Statehouse in Columbia, where personnel performed security sweeps as a precautionary measure. South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley also cut short a news conference over security concerns. Student Hayden Dunn, a senior from Myrtle Beach, said he was in the building about 1 p.m., getting in an elevator to change classes, when a police officer also got inside. Dunn said the officer asked whether anyone had heard gunshots, but they hadn't. Dunn said he went to class, then an alarm sounded five minutes later, and people rushed outside. Another office told him shots had been fired, he said. 'Otherwise, you wouldn't have known anything happened,' Dunn said. The shooting occurred in or near the relatively new Arnold School of Public Health as police in SWAT gear with AR-15 secured its perimeter and ushered away students .","Raja Fayad, 45, was gunned down at the Columbia campus on Thursday .

"Lynn Bennett (pictured) wanted to get revenge on her ex-boyfriend after claiming she found him in bed with another woman last Sunday . A woman who found her ex-boyfriend in bed with another woman has shamed him by decorating his house with balloons and a sign stating 'I'm a cheat'. Lynn Bennett, from Goole in East Yorkshire, said she wanted to get revenge after she became suspicious of her boyfriend of three-and-a-half years and turned up at his house unannounced. The 43-year-old cleaner spotted the car of one of his female friends outside his house and decided to knock on the door on Sunday. When he answered she claims he was acting strangely and after a search of the house she eventually entered the bedroom and found a woman in her underwear. Mrs Bennett started pulling her clothes from her 45-year-old ex-boyfriend's wardrobe and left the house in a rage, telling him the relationship was over. She decided today she wanted to get revenge and went round to his house to hang the giant banner, a smaller banner and multi-coloured balloons. She said: 'It only took ten minutes but it was the best revenge. I knew the best way to embarrass him was to make sure his neighbours knew.' Last Sunday, Lynn claims she became suspicious that her boyfriend of three and a half years was up to something and decided to drive past his house. But when she saw the car of one of his female friends nearby, she decided to knock the door. Lynn claims that the 45-year-old took ages to answer the door and behaved strangely when she went into the house. She says she searched the whole house and eventually entered the bedroom where she saw the female friend in just her underwear. In a rage, Lynn started pulling her clothes from her ex-boyfriend's wardrobe and eventually left to calm down at home telling him it was over. She returned to his house today and put up a huge sign which read 'I'm a cheat! I slept with another woman' She also put another sign on his gate and multi-coloured balloons, which she said 'added to the occasion' She returned to the house, where she claims he lives, today and rung the signs reading: 'I AM A CHEATER - I SLEPT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN' and 'I AM A CHEAT'. Crowds gathered outside the house in East Yorkshire today to take pictures and wait for the owner's return home. Mrs Bennett said: 'I did have my suspicions because he keeps some tools in this woman's shed. 'They've been in contact far too regularly for my liking. But I never thought it would come to this. 'He took ages to answer the door and then when I got up there and saw the woman I realised why - I had definitely caught them in the act. Her ex-boyfriend (pictured) was photographed returning to the house today where he tore down the signs . Mrs Bennett claims the 45-year-old, who she has been with for three-and-a-half years, had been unfaithful . 'That was it then, I screamed that it was over. I am never taking him back - good riddance! 'But I wanted to get some revenge and I knew the best way to do it was to let his neighbours know and some balloons seemed to add to the occasion. 'It was only really for the few people next door but he lives on a main road so I suppose it's got a bit more attention than I'd realised. 'At least this gave me something to laugh about - if I didn't laugh, I'd cry!'

"Whitney Houston's mother Cissy and two brothers stand to inherit the majority of her $20 million fortune if Bobbi Kristina passes away, according to reports. The singer left her fortune to her daughter, who inherited 10 per cent - around $2 million - when she turned 21 last year, the New York Daily News reported. She would inherit another 15 per cent at age 25 before receiving the remainder at 30. But if Bobbi Kristina, who is in a coma after being found face-down in a bathtub in her Georgia home on Saturday, passes away before she inherits the full amount, it will go to Cissy Houston and her sons, Michael and Gary, according to the will's terms. Scroll down for video . Family: Whitney Houston left her fortune to her daughter Bobbi Kristina, right with her partner Nick Gordon, but if she passes away, the money will go to her grandmother - Houston's mother - Cissy Houston, together left . Cissy, pictured center in August 2012, and her sons Michael and Gary, left, will inherit the money if Bobbi Kristina passes away before reaching 30, when she will receive the final sum of money . Bobbi Kristina's father, R&B star Bobby Brown, was initially included as a beneficiary in Houston's will but after he divorced the singer in 2007, he was no longer entitled to inherit any money. The family might also might face a battle with Bobbi Kristina's partner, Nick Gordon, for the money if he argues that he was married to her. Gordon, who was brought up alongside Bobbi after Whitney Houston took him in as a child, started a romantic relationship with Bobbi Kristina after Houston's death in 2012. Last year, the couple claimed they were married and shared a photo of their wedding bands online. '#HappilyMarried So #Inlove,' Bobbi Kristina wrote alongside the image. But this week, with his daughter fighting for her life, Bobby Brown released a statement saying the duo had never been married. Left out: Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown, pictured, did not receive any of Houston's estate . 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina,' his lawyer, Christopher Brown, said on Tuesday. 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon.' If Gordon, who was never legally adopted by Houston, can prove he was married to her daughter, he can inherit her estate, the Daily News reported. Of course, if Bobbi Kristina drew up her own will 'that trumps all', Atlanta legal expert Bruce Gaynes told the newspaper. When Bobbi Kristina inherited a portion of the fortune on her 21st birthday, her grandmother had expressed concern that she would dwindle it away. She also expressed concern over reports of her granddaughter's relationship with Gordon. Battle ahead? Nick Gordon, pictured outside a hospital where Bobbi Kristina was taken on Saturday, could fight her family for her money because he has claimed they are married - which relatives say is not true . On Thursday, RadarOnline reported that the 81-year-old is 'devastated' by what has happened to her granddaughter. She flew from New Jersey to join the family at Bobbi Kristina's bedside at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. 'Cissy is devastated to see Krissy in this condition,' a family source said. 'She is absolutely heartbroken to see her little grandbaby like this.'","Whitney Houston left her fortune to her daughter, who received 10 per cent - around $2 million - when she turned 21 last year .

'USDA data shows that since the new rules were implemented, 1.4 million fewer children choose school lunch each day,' according to the release, obtained by EAG.org. 'Declining student participation reduces meal program revenue for schools already stressed by higher food and labor costs under the new regulations.' In the release, the SNA suggests several fixes to the scheme. These include increasing the per-meal reimbursement for school lunches by 35 per cent, according to the site. They also include maintaining Target 1 sodium level reduction and suspending the implementation of further targets, and ensuring at least half of grains offered are whole grain rich, The Hill reported. Other suggestions include permitting school food managers to decide if students should take a fruit or vegetable as part of a reimbursable meal, and easing restrictions on a la carte food items. 'Cold bread roll': Mariah Dilbeck also uploaded a picture of her school lunch (pictured), comprising apricot slices, a piece of toast, a carton of juice, a smidgen of butter and a bread roll that was apparently 'cold'. Mrs Obama made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat. School nutritionists and food service workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a downturn in lunch sales. Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards. In a news release, SNA CEO Patricia Montague said: 'Some of USDA’s regulations under the law have unnecessarily increased costs and waste for school meal programs and caused many students to swap healthy school meals for junk food fare' Last year, Mrs Obama  vowed to fight for the current school meal restrictions 'until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'. According to Fox News, she said: 'The last thing that we can afford to do right now is play politics with our kids' health, especially when we're finally starting to see some progress on this issue.' And on Thursday, she appealed for parents to do more to help during a visit to New York. She told members of the public to 'dive into' the fight against childhood obesity - and listed a number of specific ways in which parents can help in that battle, NEWSOK reported. In March, around 1,000 school nutrition professionals from across America will descend on Capitol Hill as part of the 43rd annual Legislative Action Conference's 'Charge the Hill' campaign.","More students have posted photos online of their 'measly' school meals .
