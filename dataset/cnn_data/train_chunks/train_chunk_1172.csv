"Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, drew ministers for the first time into the row over secret courts and their treatment of vulnerable people . A senior judge yesterday accused ministers of blocking attempts to open the country’s most secretive court to public scrutiny. Appeals to the Coalition to allow the public to know what goes on in the controversial Court of Protection have ‘fallen on deaf ears’, the leading family law judge said. Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, drew ministers for the first time into the row over secret courts and their treatment of vulnerable people. Over the past year the Court of Protection – which routinely sits behind closed doors to decide on the lives of those too ill to make their own decisions – has been caught up in scandals over a secret imprisonment and a forced caesarean on an Italian woman who was then made to give up her child for adoption. Earlier this week the Daily Mail, which has campaigned vigorously against cases being held in secret, revealed how the court allowed a gardener to drain more than £200,000 from the savings of an 89-year-old woman with dementia who is in a care home. The gardener, who kept more than £60,000 of his employer’s money, was not prosecuted for fraud or theft and cannot be named on the orders of a Court of Protection judge. In recent months, Sir James has ordered that no-one should again be imprisoned in secret. He also instructed that judges should always publish their rulings in family courts – which decide whether children should be taken into care and where they should live when couples part – and in the Court of Protection. But he told the Justice Select Committee that ministers are preventing rule changes that would allow journalists to attend Court of Protection hearings. ‘I have come to the point in the transparency agenda where I have come up against the obstacle presented by the rules,’ Sir James said. A ruling by the Court of Protection allowed a gardener to take more than £200,000 from an 89-year-old woman . ‘In the family courts the media have a right of access to the court. This is not the position with the Court of Protection … I am stuck with the Court of Protection rules until they are changed.’ He added: ‘Our continuing concern is that the need for changing the rules, identified in 2010, has thus far fallen on deaf ears.’ The power to scrap court rules and bring in new ones lies with the the Lord Chief Justice, and the Justice Secretary, Chris Grayling. Court regulations which kept journalists out of family courts were altered by then Justice Secretary Jack Straw in 2009, allowing the media to attend unless a judge orders them out under special circumstances. However, reporters may not enter the Court of Protection, set up under Labour’s Mental Capacity Act in 2007, without special permission from a judge. MPs and legal experts have blasted the court's 'astonishing' ruling and called for reforms of the court . The 2007 regulations state: ‘The general rule is that a hearing is to be held in private.’ Sir James’s remarks come days after a Lords committee severely criticised the Mental Capacity Act, accusing it of leading to the wrongful imprisonment in care homes of tens of thousands of people. Peers demanded the rewriting of large sections of the law and MPs on both sides of the House echoed the call. Justice Minister Simon Hughes admitted there needed to be ‘more openness in the Court of Protection’, adding: ‘We already have plans in place to make changes to the court’s rules this year, and we have agreed … that they should take into account recommendations made by the House of Lords committee.’","Sir James Munby says the rule of the controversial court 'must change'

"A university doctoral student with acute colon cancer and his wife were refused entry on a Delta flight because of his attire, he wrote on his blog. On August 18, Arijit Guha, who is working on his PhD at Arizona State University, was at the Buffalo-Niagara Airport with his wife waiting to board his Delta flight. However, the 31-year-old student said he was told by a Delta agent that his T-shirt which read ‘Bombs ZOMG ZOMG Terrists (sic)’ was making other passengers feel uncomfortable, and he was told he could not board the flight. Booted off: Arijit Guha, right, and his wife, were not allowed on a Delta flight from New York state to Arizona because of his satirical TSA shirt, he said . ZOMG: The shirt, designed by Boing Boing blogger Cory Doctorow, reads in full: 'Bombs ZOMG ZOMG Terrists (sic) Gonna kill us all ZOMG ZOMG alert level bloodred run take off your shoes moisture . Unsafe passage: The Delta pilot refused the couple's boarding due to other passenger's discomfort with his shirt (file photo) Higher education: Mr Guha is a doctoral student at Arizona State University . Mr Guha, who wrote about the experience on his blog, said ‘Delta Airlines gave in to (sic) the fears of bigots and refused to let me board a flight out of Buffalo-Niagara Airport.’ The experience, he said, began smoothly enough. He and his wife made it through the Transportation Security Administration checkpoint without incident. They were returning back to Arizona after the funeral for his wife’s grandfather. However, at the gate for Delta flight 1176, Mr Guha said that he was stopped by a Delta agent who said the shirt was making several passengers as well as Delta employees ‘very uncomfortable.’ Mr Guha wrote: ‘I was then questioned by TSA about the significance and meaning of the shirt. I politely explained that it was “mocking the security theatre charade and over-reactions to terrorism by the general public — both of which we're seeing right now, ironically.” 'The agents inquired as to the meaning of the term “ZOMG” (which means Oh My God) and who it was that I thought was “gonna kill us all.” Without incident: Mr Guha and his wife had passed through the TSA checkpoint without incident . Protect our shores: The TSA was formed in 2002 following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks . ‘As best I could tell, they seemed to find my explanation that I didn’t think anyone would be killing us all and that I was poking fun at overwrought, irrational fears exhibited by certain members of the flying public to be satisfactory. 'And moreover, they clearly deemed my shirt to be no legitimate threat.’ The security agent then told him he would need to change his shirt, and that he and his wife would have to go through additional screening ahead of the flight. He and his wife were then re-inspected by three TSA agents, who photographed his shirt and went through their luggage again. You or me: Mr Guha was live-tweeting his experiences, saying that even after he changed his shirt, he was not allowed to board . In retrospect: He then followed up with this tweet the next day, but was let on a 10am flight back to Arizona . After the inspection, they allowed the couple to proceed. But by that point, Mr Guha said, the Delta pilot would not allow them on the flight, citing other passenger’s discomfort with the situation. He said he and his wife had to rent a car and drive four hours to a relative’s house to spend the night, as Delta didn’t offer hotel vouchers. Arriving at the airport the next morning, Mr Guha had changed his shirt to one that read: ‘Keep Calm and Poop Strong’ with a sketch of the large intestine. Poop strong: Mr Guha, who suffers from colon cancer, showed up at the airport the next morning wearing this shirt; he tweeted this picture from the airport . Departure: He and his wife were flying out of Buffalo-Niagara Airport in upstate New York following a funeral . In May, days after the killing of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, two Muslim scholars heading to a conference on American fears of Islam were pulled from a morning flight, and were later told that the pilot had refused to fly with them aboard. Masudur Rahman, a professor of Arabic at the University of Memphis, and Mohamed Zaghloul, Imam at the Islamic Association of Greater Memphis, were asked to deplane Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight 5452 from Memphis to Charlotte. They were subjected to additional security checks after the plane had pushed back from the gate, Rahman told Reuters by telephone. After additional screening, the two men were cleared by Delta representatives to re-board the plane, but were then told the pilot would not take them, Rahman said. Rahman said both men had been cleared for check-in and boarding by airline and Transportation Security Administration officials during normal pre-flight procedures. According to a TSA spokesman, the decision to remove the two passengers was made by the airline. Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a regional partner operating as a Delta Connection, apologized for any inconvenience caused, but offered no further explanation. The flight 'returned to the gate to allow for additional screening of a passenger and the passenger's companion. We take security and safety very seriously, and the event is currently under investigation,' an airline statement said. The two men were headed to a North American Imams conference where they were scheduled to lead prayers. This year's conference is discussing Islamophobia or fears of Islam and discrimination against American Muslims. -Reuters . The 31-year-old has battled advanced colon cancer, and apparently selected the shirt as a less-offensive option than the TSA screening one. Throughout the process, the doctoral student was sharing the ordeal on social media. He wrote on Twitter early in the morning on August 19th: ‘Said @Delta, “it’s not you, it’s the shirt.” Yet changing the shirt wasn’t good enough and the pilot refused to let me board.’ Wrote Mr Guha: ‘In short, security screenings and any other evidence-based assessment method have been deemed irrelevant. Whatever I do, I am suspicious. Why? Not because the shirt I’m wearing presents some sort of legitimate threat… . 'Rather, the pilot and some Delta rep can project upon me their worst fears of what I am possibly capable of.  If that’s the case, why even bother with the bloated security apparatus — since Delta pilots have discretion to kick off passengers who've passed multiple checks, after all?’ The shirt, designed by Boing Boing blogger Cory Doctorow, reads in full: ‘Bombs ZOMG ZOMG Terrists (sic) Gonna kill us all ZOMG ZOMG alert level bloodred run take off your shoes moisture’ and shows a picture of an eagle holing a pair of trainers in one talon, and a water bottle in the other. The description goes on the say that the shirt may be worn to ‘reassure your fellow citizens with a message of anxiety and suspicion,’ but warns the buyer not to wear the shirt to ‘an airport security checkpoint, or anywhere near a secure federal installation.’ Delta spokesperson Betsy Talton told MailOnline that the airline does not discriminate against any of its passengers. ‘We serve thousands of customers around the world,’ she said. ‘Delta does not condone discrimination against anyone, at the same time, providing a safe and secure operation is the primary obligation to its employees and customers.’ Mr Guha cited a landmark 1968 Supreme Court Case, Cohen v. California, in which they found a man wearing a leather jacket which read ‘F*** the Draft’ was protected under free speech. In the case, the Court found that the man was not conducting him in such a way that that would present a danger to anyone.","ASU PhD student Arijit Guha was flying from Buffalo, New York to Arizona wearing shirt poking fun at TSA .

"Hillary Clinton has said that she will make sleep, exercise and relaxing her priorities over the coming year. But the promise of some down-time seems to have already had a positive effect as she bids farewell to her four-year term as Secretary of State.

Gomes, 22, told Brazils Tanosite website she was the first to be told . that he daughter had died. She recalled: 'My world crashed down right then. It was the most desperate moment when all my dreams were snatched away.' Nurse Ana Claudia Oliveira, who . accompanied the birth, said she asked for the baby's body to be laid in . the hospital chapel, instead of the normal procedure of being sent to . the refrigerated morgue. She said: 'She's a little angel, a child. I just couldn't face the thought of her being sent down to the morgue.' She added that she washed and dressed the dead baby and had no doubt that she was dead. She said: 'I can assure you, the . child was dead. Her pupils didn't respond to light.

I began to shake and I couldn't speak, I was overwhelmed with happiness. 'I called a nurse who at first didn't believe it, she told us they were just spasms. But then the baby opened her eyes.' Mum Jennifer said she was still being . comforted by family members when a nurse burst into the room and . shouted: 'Your daughter's alive'.

"A new book has claimed that the Pill is in fact the tool of a capitalist patriarchy intent on altering and suppressing femininity. British author Holly Grigg-Spall has written 'Sweetening the Pill: Or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control' and believes that a number of studies proves her point that contraception is in fact controlling women. She adds that women’s unquestioning acceptance of such powerful medications is in some ways a submission to a culture steeped in hatred of the feminine. Holly Grigg-Spall has written 'Sweetening the Pill: Or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control'. She believes that a number of studies proves her point that contraception is in fact controlling women . A book review by Vice magazine writer Kelly Bourdet reveals that while Ms Grigg-Spall was on birth control she felt a distance between herself and her ‘femaleness'. Ms Grigg-Spall said: ‘Over the years [of being on the Pill] I felt no connection between my self and my body, between my self and the world around me, between my femaleness and myself.’ A 2011 study of women both on and off hormonal contraception found that the medication did affect a woman's memory. Both sets of women were shown photos and told a story about a car accident involving a young boy and his subsequent hospital visit. Studies have shown that the Pill affects both women's choice of partner and her memory . Women on the pill remembered more of the emotional aspects of the story - the boy being hurt, what happened to him at the hospital - while the women who were not on the Pill were more likely to recall the details of the scene - what things looked like and where they were placed. Ms Grigg-Spall argues that if memory contextualises our past experiences and governs our future behaviour and understanding of the world, then a drug that alters it in even a slight way might have far-reaching consequences. Indeed, the changing testosterone levels in a woman’s body has been shown to affect women’s choice of sexual partners and mates. A 2012 study revealed that women on hormonal birth control - which suppresses naturally occurring testosterone - were attracted to men with lower testosterone levels. However when women went off of the Pill, and their testosterone levels increased, their attraction to their feminine partners decreased. Reviewer Kelly Bourdet agrees that the evidence does show that the hormonal contraception has powerful and life-altering side effects. And she adds that it’s fair to wonder whether a drug that could alter our choice in long-term partners is 'too powerful for comfort'. But the reviewer says the anti-Pill activist's argument has its flaws. She says that it presumes that a woman is 'somehow entirely defined by her hormones, lack of hormones, or artificially achieved level of hormones. 'That a woman couldn’t possibly use her brain to decide to alter her hormones and that the hormonal levels once believed to rule women's behaviour in such a way to make her nervous, emotional, and hysterical, once suppressed, rule her in an entirely different way.' The book is available in the U.S. from September 7 and in the UK from September 27.","New book 'Sweetening the Pill: Or How We Got Hooked on Hormonal Birth Control' says the Pill is a capitalist tool to alter and suppress femininity .

"Two men have been killed after they jumped from a helicopter and crashed into an alpine field in a BASE jump that went horrifically wrong. New Zealander Dan Vicary, 33, and Frenchman Ludovic Woerth, 34, were killed in the accident. A third man, whose name and nationality have not been released, was seriously injured.

The two men who died: Frenchman Ludo Woerth (left) and New Zealander Dan Vicary (right) The two men were dead by the time rescue workers arrived on the scene. One of the men killed, Dan Vicary, was a celebrated wingsuit pilot and was ranked No 2 in the world for the sport. The New Zealander had moved from his native New Zealand to Switzerland, where he ran a BASE jumping supply shop with his wife Lisa Hutchins. The couple had just celebrated their third wedding anniversary. She paid tribute to her husband, whom she said was ‘amazing human being’ ‘Adventure – that is what life was with him. I always told him he lived everyday like someone left the gate open,’ she told Fairfax New Zealand. Wingsuit jumps, in which people don a suit with fabric between their legs and jump from heights of up to 6,000 feet, sees 20 people die each year . Dan Vicary is pictured here with his wife Lisa Hutchins. The pair lived in Switzerland where they ran a BASE jump supply store . The sport is inherently risking, with approximately 20 people dying while participating in it each year. But Ms Hutchins said he knew the risks and did everything he could to mitigate them. ‘I know he wouldn't change anything.’ Fans of the Vicary, who shared videos of his daring jumps on YouTube, took to social media to share tributes. ‘RIP Dan, fly free,’ was a common epitaph. ‘Happy are the ones who are willing to take the risk to see their dreams come true...Soar on Dan...RIP!’ wrote another. Wingsuits, sometimes called squirrel suits, are aerodynamically designed jumpsuits, which have fabric between the legs and under the arms to enable the wearer to glide. The jumps end with a parachute opening to allow for a safe landing. They can cover 3,000 feet in about 30 seconds and often jump from cliffs or aircraft at altitudes of up to 6,500 feet.","Three men went BASE jumping from a helicopter in Switzerland on Saturday .

"A seven-year-old is hoping to win the junior golf world  championships - despite being allergic to the sun. Ben Brown spends as much time as possible on the golf course, even though he has a rare disorder meaning he can only play for short periods of time in direct sunlight. He has been diagnosed with solar urticaria, as he breaks out in hives or a rash when he is exposed to ultraviolet light, UV radiation or sometimes even visible light. After going out in the sun he also develops migraines, feels nauseous, loses his strength and becomes lethargic. Scroll down for video . Ben Brown is determined to become a professional golfer and spends as much time on the course as possible - despite suffering a rare condition meaning he is allergic to the sun . Ben breaks out in hives and a rash (pictured left and right) within minutes of being exposed to sunlight, and also develops migraines and feels nauseous and lethargic . Ben has been diagnosed with the rare condition solar uticaria - and takes anti histamines, migraine tablets and prescription suncream. Despite his allergy, he has won prizes in a string of tournaments . Ben's condition is particularly bad at the first sign of sunlight in March and April and in the height of the summer. Every day he takes an antihistamine tablet and half a migraine tablet – as well as wearing prescription suncream. But his parents say even while taking his tablets, he struggles to last more than four hours playing golf. Despite his allergy, Ben took part in his first tournaments last year and now hopes to win the World Championships at Pinehurst, North Carolina, US. He developed a love of golf when he was just two years old, when his parents Craig and Kathryn bought him a 'Gator Golf' set for his second birthday. They noticed he had freak accuracy when putting across the living room. Mrs Brown, 27, of Stockton, Teeside, said: 'Ben started with golf when he got a Gator Golf set for his second birthday and it became like an obsession for him. 'He would spend hours walking backwards and forwards across the living room collecting his ball. Solar uticaria is a rare condition in which a person breaks out in  hives, weals and nettle rash if they are exposed to sunlight. Solar urticaria is found worldwide, and while it can start at any age, people aged between 20 and 40 who are most affected. It is caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells. Exactly how and why certain types of sunlight cause this is currently uncertain. The appearance of solar urticaria can be quite dramatic as it usually develops within just a few minutes after exposure to sunlight. The main symptoms of solar urticaria are itching, stinging and burning. Rarely, the rash is accompanied by symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and in such cases it is advisable to seek emergency treatment. Source: British Association of Dermatologists . 'We actually had to buy three sets so he had one at ours and one at each of his grandparents' to save us taking it with us wherever we went. 'For his third birthday we got Ben a set of golf clubs and began taking him to the driving range. 'It was then that we actually realised that he was a good putter. 'When he was out on the putting green people would stop and watch, surprised at his talent. 'Several times people went to get other people to come outside and see how good he actually was.' In terms of his allergy, it is not known why sunlight causes an allergic reaction in some people. Ben's family believe it could be because was  born prematurely - which has left him with a weak immune system. Mrs Brown, who works handling complaints for Barclaycard, said: 'Ben loves golf but it can be hard for him to play. 'He has a sun allergy which causes a full body rash with nausea and sickness. 'We have found a balance of two medications and a prescription suncream. 'While these don't take away the symptoms altogether, they do alleviate them enough to allow him to play golf for short periods. 'Ben was born eight weeks prematurely, weighing just 4lbs and had to spend many weeks in special care before coming home with us. 'As a result of his prematurity, we have found Ben does have a weaker immune system than most. 'It is improving now, but he has had dozens of infections - chest, ear and tonsils - and also was hospitalised with pneumonia. 'We have to be careful with him over the winter when he picks up more illnesses. 'It can mean he is late to start his golfing season or can practice less than he would in the summer.' She added that Ben knows how to manage his allergy but often tries to continue playing golf even when he is not feeling 100 per cent. Ben is now set to play in the US Kids Golf Junior World Championships in Pinehurst, North Carolina, in July. He is pictured here with his golf coach Charlie Tetlow, who he says is his inspiration . Ben has his heart set on playing golf professionally, but his parents worry he sometimes carries on playing even when he is not feeling well. His mother Kathryn said:  'For Ben giving up golf is not an option' Mrs Brown said: 'For Ben, giving up golf is not an option. 'It's all he wants to do and instead we just have to take more care over where and what time he can play. 'It does impact him when he is playing at times. He can struggle to concentrate if he has broken out in hives as they can cause constant itching. But the worst problem for him is the migraines.' Ben had a tremendous year, with highlights including finishing sixth in his age group in the Wee Wonders UK Championships at the famous Home of Golf, St Andrews, and coming second in the Tiger Club grand final at Gainsborough. The seven-year-old has now qualified to play the US Kids Golf Junior European Championships in Scotland in May and for the US Kids Golf Junior World Championships in Pinehurst, North Carolina, US, at the end of July. Mrs Brown added: 'Ben's favourite golfer is Tiger Woods, but his biggest inspiration is his golf coach Charlie Tetlow. 'When Ben was asked what he wanted to be when he grows up he told me he wanted to be Charlie, and that if he couldn't be a professional golfer he wanted to teach children to play.'","Ben Brown will compete in the  Junior World Championships in July .

The mother-of-one’s childhood nightmare means she must work close to home so she can use the only toilet she feels safe on. Scroll down for video . Phobia: Ney Decino, a 20-year-old carer, is so terrified of toilets that she has to leave the room when she flushes - scared the toilet will swallow her . The cause: Watching the character 'The Toilet Man' in the 1990's Hollywood film Look Who's Talking Too scarred Ms Decino for life . Ms Decino has been scared of using . toilets since the age of four when she saw a talking toilet in 1990s . Hollywood film Look Who’s Talking Too. In . the film the character, The Toilet Man, screams he wants the child’s . urine while posing with big eyes, sharp fangs and a creepy voice which . has stuck in Ney’s head ever since.

Phobia derives from the Greek word ‘phobos’ meaning fear, and is an anxiety disorder which means that a subject or thing terrifies a person to such extent that avoiding it affects your normal behaviour. It is the most common anxiety disorder in the UK with an estimated 10 million sufferers. If a person with a phobia comes in contact with the subject of their fear it may make them anxious or cause them to panic. There are simple and complex phobias which is diagnosed depending on how the phobia affects a person’s ability to lead a normal life . Examples of simple phobias are spiders, snakes and going to the dentist. More complex phobias include Agoraphobia (a fear of  public spaces) or severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Simple phobias usually start between the ages of four and eight and often disappear without need for treatment as the child gets older, whereas complex phobias usually start later in life. Almost all phobias can be treated through therapy or self-help and is very rarely medicated. If desperate she can use the toilet at a friend's house but only if they or a family member accompanies her. Ms Decino, who has set up a Facebook group to help fellow sufferers, admits the phobia is silly but cannot escape from the power it holds over her life. She said: ‘It . starts from the moment I enter the bathroom, there’s just a build up of . tension but it goes as soon as I leave. I just flush and run. The sound of the water sends shivers down my spine. It’s awful. 'I swear it will swallow me up. Once I’ve flushed, the sound of it and the look of the water going down, it freaks me out.' She added: ‘I . have to get out of there once it’s done and I can’t go back in for . ages. I use the kitchen to wash my hands because I can't stand being in . the room when the cistern fills back up. ‘I’ve literally sprinted out the loo hundreds of times. If I’m in the house by myself I completely freak out. The phobia also impacts her social life as she says her friends have to accompany her to the toilet when they are out in clubs. ‘Cubicles all in a row are a nightmare. That’s why I only go when out in public in an absolute emergency. ‘At school I used to go hours without going and wait until I got home, even if I was desperate. ‘It is the only loo I feel comfortable using and even then I won’t flush it if I am on my own.' Toilet terror: The mother-of-one says the phobia has such control of her life that she has wet herself in the past because she has been too scared to go to the bathroom . Her . parents Emma, 40, and Vance, 47, videotaped Look Who’s Talking Too when . she was a child because it was one of her favourite films. She watched the film dozens of times, despite her fear of The Toilet Man. Fear: Ney Decino's phobia has controlled her life since she was four years old . Ms . Decino said: 'The film really triggered the fear. From about four, to . the age of 13, I couldn’t flush the loo. Or if I did I had to have . someone with me. ‘From that . point it really got worse. I have a lot of rows with my mum and dad and . they’ve got hugely frustrated with me about it. ‘Only . my family, my best friend and my former partner know about it. They’ve . tried to encourage me to overcome the fear but it’s never really gone . away. ‘They’ve always thought I would grow out of it but I never have. ‘No one at school knew I had a problem but I was paranoid someone would find out. ‘I’d always go to the loo with a friend because girls can and no one questions it.’ Ms Decino is also fearful of water in general, avoiding swimming pools, walks next to lakes and trips to the seaside. She gave birth to nine-month-old daughter Kaydee earlier this year and admitted her pregnancy heightened her phobia because of the number of trips to the loo she had to make. The pregnancy made her phobia worse as she had to visit the toilet more often. ‘My mum and dad were a bit more . sympathetic then but they still couldn’t believe it was the thing I was . most scared of even when I was expecting.' She say the birth of her daughter has helped as it means there is always someone with her when she flushes. She hopes her Facebook group can help her improve and make her life easier as well as help others like herself.

"The woman who accused Florida State University star Jameis Winston of raping her has  come forward for a new documentary that premiered Friday at the Sundance Film Festival. Eric Kinsman, 20, speaks publicly in the film for the first time, claiming she came to after drinking at a bar to find Winston on top of her having sex in his apartment while she pleaded with him to stop. In the film, Kinsman says one of Winston's roommates also allegedly begged him to stop before the quarterback took her into the bathroom and pinned her head to the floor to continue the assault. Scroll down for video . Accuser: Erica Kinsman (right) details her account of how Jameis Winston had sex with her as she begged him to stop and forced her into the bathroom where he continued the assault . The Daily Beast reports that Kinsman is featured in Kirby Dick's documentary The Hunting Ground, which casts a critical eye on the role that fraternities, athletic departments and schools play in rape investigations on campus. Kinsman fights tears as she details her account of the  December 2012 night, when as a freshman, she remembers running into a man at a Tallahassee Potbelly's. She says someone was creepily following her around the bar throughout the night and only stopped when a second man put his arm around her and told her pursuer he was her boyfriend. Kinsman says that man then bought her a shot, after which she began to feel dizzy, though she faintly recalls taking a cab to an apartment. She says the next thing she remembers is coming to while the man on top of her penetrating her, and claims that she asked him to stop. The man allegedly ignored both her and his roommate, who Kinsman says entered the room and told him to stop, and took her into the bathroom. Acceptable conduct: Winston has avoided criminal charges, and a Florida State University conduct code hearing found there was not enough evidence to determine whether he was guilty . Stepping forward: Kinsman spoke publicly for the first time about the alleged assault in the documentary The Hunting Ground, about rape on campus, which premiered Friday at the Sundance Film Festival . Shattered: Kinsman's family has said she was an A student that had to drop out of FSU, leave Tallahassee and undergo therapy after the night she claims she was raped by Winston . Star player: A month after prosecutors decided there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges, Winston led the Seminoles to a comeback victory against Auburn in the BCS title game . There, she says, he raped her while he held her head against the tiles, and when he was finished told her 'You can leave now.' Not knowing where the apartment was, Kinsman says she took an offer for a ride on the man's scooter back to a location she recognized, fearing what would happen if he knew where she lived. According to a New York Times investigation of the ensuing police investigation, Kinsman reported the assault in the early morning immediately after it happened, but did not identify the assailant. Tallahassee Police Officer Scott Angulo wrote he 'had no real leads' until Kinsman contacted police a month later, saying she saw the man in class and heard his name called, identifying him as Winston. Dick, who also directed The Invisible War, about a lack of accountability when prosecuting sexual assault in the US military, rips into the investigation in The Hunting Ground. The film asserts Angulo, an FSU grad who had worked for the Seminole Boosters, not only failed to identify Winston, but did not obtain DNA evidence, cell phone records or interviews with witnesses. The Arizona-born documentary filmmaker has tackled America's attitude toward sex and sexuality and taken aim at powerful institutions like the Catholic Church and the US military. The 2004 film Twist of Faith depicts a man suing the parish where a priest sexually abused him as a child - and the heartbreaking reactions of his friends and family. Outrage, released in 2009, asserted closeted gay politicians help drive lobbying for anti-gay legislation. He caused a shake-up in the way the US military handled cases of sexual assault after his 2012 film The Invisible War exposed the armed services' failures to hold rapists in their ranks accountable. The officer also allegedly failed to get recordings from Potbelly's 30 security cameras or get a cell phone video Winston's roommate, football player Chris Casher, later admitted to recording of the sexual act. By the time State Attorney William Meggs took over the investigation, nine months after Tallahassee police closed it, the tapes had been recycled and the cell phone video deleted, according to the film. Meggs eventually wrapped up the investigation in December 2013 with no charges filed, though DNA on Kinsman's shorts matched that of Winston. 'I think things that happened that night were not good,' Meggs says in The Hunting Ground, though there was insufficient evidence to support criminal charges. A FOX Sports investigation reported in October that Tallahassee police helped FSU officials stay ahead of any prosecution by the state attorney. The university's chief of police received original and supplemental reports four days before the case was handed off to Meggs, according to documents obtained. These reports were then forwarded to an FSU athletics department official, who provided them to Winston's defense attorney before the case was passed to prosecutors, the investigation found. Two witnesses, football players who watched Winston engaging in a sexual act with Kinsman, spoke to Winston's lawyer and were convinced to sign affidavits in support of Winston's account of the night - before police ever interviewed them. Hunting Ground: The documentary is an expose on the way fraternities, athletic departments and universities affect rape investigations . Connect the dots: A group of activists and rape survivors are featured in the film, which reportedly asserts that colleges try to protect their brand above all else in sexual assault cases . After no criminal charges were put forward by prosecutors, the school was forced under Title IX to conduct its own investigation, ESPN reports. In a series of hearings, Winston admitted he had met Kinsman at Potbelly's and had sex with her, but that it was consensual. The quarterback said he danced with her for about 10 minutes, got her telephone number and then contacted her later that night. December 7, 2012 - Erica Kinsman files a police report claiming she was raped, though she can not identify the attacker. January 10, 2013 - She tells Tallahassee police she recognizes Winston as the assailant in a class and hears a professor call his name. November 13, 2013 - Prosecutor Willie Meggs is notified of the allegations and pushes police on an investigation, during which key witnesses are interviewed and evidence is sought. November 2013 - Kinsman drops out of FSU, later claiming she received death threats for making charges of rape. December 5, 2013 - Meggs decides against pursuing criminal charges, saying that evidence is insufficient. December 14, 2013 - Winston wins the Heisman Trophy, becoming the youngest player, at 19, to do so. January 6, 2014 - Winston and the Seminoles win the BCS championship against Auburn. December 21, 2014 - FSU clears Winston of any code of conduct violations after hearing presided over by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding. Winston said that she climbed into the taxi voluntarily and rode with him and two other football players to his apartment, where she consented to give him oral sex and then have intercourse. After being asked by retired Florida Supreme Court Justice Major Harding what he considered physical and verbal consent for sex, Winston said 'moaning.' Winston's lawyer, David Cornwell, delivered a brief to Harding that called Kinsman unreliable, bringing up that she she did not originally report the more violent episode in the bathroom to police. Kinsman responded to claims she changed her accounts by saying she tried to always give accounts as she remembered them, and said she had been harassed repeatedly. 'I was subjected to a number of death threats, and my parents' home and work addresses were posted online,' she said according to the transcript produced at the hearing. 'I have had my most horrible life experience played out and debated in local and national media that couldn't care a less about me.' Her family told the Times that it was Kinsman's dream to attend FSU, where she was studying as a pre-med, but dropped out in November after her identity was revealed. In the film, Kinsman claims she dealt with classmates at the university harassing her because she had made the accusation that pointed back at Winston. 'All these people were praising [Winston]… and calling me a slut, a whore,' she says in the film. In January 2014, Winston was standing behind center at the two-yard line and took a snap, executing a play-action pass that erased an Auburn lead in the final seconds. The final scoring drive sealed the Seminoles' fourth-quarter comeback and delivered the BCS national title to FSU. For Winston, who had become the youngest Heisman winner in December, it also capped off a history-making season that FSU and police had allowed to remain undisturbed. The Hunting Ground, produced by CNN Films and RADiUS, will be released to theaters in March as well as air on CNN.","Erica Kinsman, 20, has broken her silence on the alleged 2012 assault .

"More grim details about the terrorist attack that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans has emerged as Libya admits it is struggling to combat a growing tide of extremism in the country. Ten months after the deaths at the American diplomatic mission at Benghazi in the north African country, a frightening picture of the attack itself and the desperate security situation in Libya has emerged. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans - information management officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the US Mission in the Libyan city on September 11, for which Al Qaeda in North Africa and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia were implicated.

He said: 'I thought it was a driver or a security guy. He had a pulse and his eyes were moving. His mouth was black from all the smoke.' Damon also spoke to Dr Ziad Abu Zei, who battled to save the ambassador. He said: 'I began resuscitating him but after 45 minutes the patient gave no signs of life.'

"With its metallic gold finish, glistening alloy wheels and seats encrusted with semi-precious stones, it's little wonder that this stunning Lamborghini cost around £200,000. But you'd have to be pretty tiny to take the supercar for a spin. This is the world's most expensive model car and it's just gone on display at the Lamborghini showroom in Dubai as the car manufacturer celebrates its 50th birthday. Scroll down for video . Pricey: This is the world's most expensive replica car which is to go on display in Dubai - it cost a staggering £200,000 to make . Bling on wheels: The car is an exact model of a Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4 - but is just a prototype for an even more extravagant version . Stunning: The car is made from the same material as a Formula One car, but is coated in a wafer-thin layer of real gold . Replica: The model was designed by German mechanical engineer Robert Gülpen . Amazingly, the brilliant 1:8 scale replica of a Lamborghini Aventador LP 700-4, is just a prototype - for an even more extravagant model that will be cast from a block of solid gold. The model was designed by German mechanical engineer Robert Gülpen and sculpted from the same carbon fibre used to make Formula One cars. One shaped, the carbon fibre has been wrapped in a wafer thin thread of solid gold. Mr Gülpen said: 'I wanted to do what no-one else has done before, to build a model car that is an ""icon within an icon"". 'I wanted to create a tribute to the legend of the automobile. Crafted: Mr Gülpen, pictured, said: 'I wanted to do what no-one else has done before, to build a model car that is an ""icon within an icon""' Brilliant finish: Even the car's alloy wheels are ultra realistic and made from the highest quality material . World tour: The impressive 1:8 replica will go on display over the Christmas period and will then tour the world before being auctioned off . 'In five years time, auto technology will have changed drastically, so I wanted to say a thank you to the pioneers of the technology.' The car is a prototype for a finished product that will come complete with gold and platinum rims, seats, cockpit and steering wheel, front seats embedded with 700 precious stones and headlights made from high-quality clear diamonds. A German auction house has put a price tag of £8.6m on the final model - with £420,000 of the fee set to go to charity, although Gülpen is offering a ‘buy-it-now’ price of £4.6m. Comparison: The car is pictured next to a real Aventador, which is not much more expensive at a retail price of around £236,000 . Design process: An engineer using a computer programme to manufacture the impressive replica . Work in progress: A carbon fibre specialist works on the exterior of the replica Lamborghini in Germany . Glamorous: Even the replica's seats are pricey - they are encrusted with semi-precious stones . The prototype will take pride of place in the luxurious Dubai Mall until Christmas. It will then be taken on a mini world tour, with stops in Singapore, Shanghai and Russia, before heading to auction at some point in 2014. There have been a handful of enquiries about purchasing the finished product and the German engineer is offering a commission of $250,000 (£155,000) to anyone who helps him find a buyer. Gülpen was also keen to point out that the buyer will be able to customise the final model to meet their most decadent desires. He said: 'In the end it is the customer who will decide exactly what the most expensive and most precious model car in the world will look like - because the buyer can determine according to his preferences, what material will be used.' Intricate work: Engineers sculpt the exact shape of the Lamborghini supercar . Under the spotlight: The car will be put on show in Singapore, Shanghai and Russia . A little more expensive: The Lamborghini Veneno Roadster is a limited edition hypercar which costs more than £3.3million . Buying the replica prototype is unlikely to cost much less than a real Lamborghini Aventador, which retails at around £236,000. But the Aventador is not the manufacturer's most expensive model. The newly released Veneno Roadster, with its 750bhp V12 engine and top speed of 220mph will set you back a cool £3.36million. The car goes on display as the manufacturer celebrates its 50th birthday. At 50 some things are past their best - but after half a century Lamborghini continues to roll out cars faster, more glamorous and even more bizarre than ever. On October 30, 1963, Ferruccio Lamborghini showcased his first sports car at the Turin Motor Show. That day the Lamborghini 350 GTV, an unfinished prototype featuring a crate of ceramic tiles instead of an engine, was scorned by critics. Source of scorn: On October 30, 1963, Ferruccio Lamborghini showcased his first sports car at the Turin Motor Show . Flash: The Lamborghini 350GTS from 1965, P400 from 1965, and 350GT from 1964 all pictured outside the manufacturer's head office . Nice car: The Lamborghini Espada . But over the next 50 years the company's models - which include the Aventador, Gallardo, Murcielago and Miura - would go on to become the envy of petrol heads worldwide. Famed for their flamboyance and flair, the now-famed car company originally started out as a tractor company, Lamborghini Trattori S.p.A., in the mid-1950s. Lamborghini became one of the largest agricultural equipment manufacturers in Italy also making gas heating and air conditioning units. But it was as a car manufacturer he would make his name. Classic: The Lamborghini 350GTV.2 . Convertible: The 1998 Diablo Roadster . Following the poor showing in Turin, a year later the company turned heads when it revealed the refined 350 GT at the Geneva Motor Show - the car would go on to sell for $13,900 (£8600) or $103,000 today. After the success of the 350GT the 60s saw the company produce such other well-received, iconic roadsters as the 400GT and the Miura. In 1972, following some years of union unrest, Ferruccio sold the controlling stake in his company for $600,000 - the Italian then started to have less involvement in the company. Two years later, the company unveiled the Countach - a sleek, futuristic sports car that would go on to become the company's best-selling vehicle from 1974 to 1988. On the road: The Lamborghini Miura.1 . Unusual: The manufacturer departed from the norm with the LM002 . Ferruccio Lamborghini's vision was always to create the most beautiful - and powerful - super sports cars in the world - and the Countach epitomised this vision. In 1987, after the less-well-received Silhouette and Jalpa were released and declaring bankruptcy in 1978, the company was sold to Chrysler for $25.2 million. Following this acquisition Lamborghini began its development of faster, more-bold vehicles - the release of the Diablo, then the fastest production car in the world, helped put the company back in the limelight, acting as the company's mainstay throughout the 90s. Towards the end of that decade, in 1998, the company was sold again - this time to the AUDI AG group for $110 million. Brilliant white: The Lamborghini Silhouette . Classy: The Lamborghini Reventon model . The vision was to have a more sporty output from the Audi group and this promise lived up to expectation with the production Murcielago and later the Gallardo - or 'Baby Lamb' - which was released in 2003. Today, Lamborghini, which produced 2,197 vehicles in 2012, is headed by the Aventador, Gallardo, Sesto Elemento and Veneno. The celebrations this year have been marked by the release of plans for the Egoista concept: a one-seater supercar, described as 'hyper-sophisticated' by its designers. A Veneno Roadster, costing a cool $4.5 million, was also announced last week. The future's bright: The Lamborghini Miura 2 .","The model was designed by German mechanical engineer Robert Gülpen .

The rare purple eel goby has a face not dissimilar to the fictional chestburster alien but is much less violent and feeds on crustaceans instead of humans .

The purple eel goby can grow up to 30 centimetres long and feeds on a mixture of crustaceans, small fish and small invertebrates . The ugly fish was discovered in Taihu Lake in Yixing, eastern China's Jiangsu Province, which is unusual as the creature has previously been found in coastal waters, estuaries and rivers. It is amphidromous and regularly migrates between freshwater and the sea, but unlike similar animals, its journeys are not essential as part of a breeding ritual. An amphidromous creature reproduces in fresh water,  but spends a period of time feeding and growing at sea, usually lasting for a few months. It then returns to freshwater before a further period of . feeding and growing in freshwater, followed by reproduction there. In its lifetime, the strange creature can cover over 100 kilometres on its cyclical and predictable journeys. It is a mud-dweller that is bizarrely capable of living out of the water for a a considerable time by taking air into the bronchial chambers.

The creature looks a little like a 'chestburster' from the Alien films, which feature fictional predatory extraterrestrials which aim on propagating their species and destroying life that could pose a threat to their survival. In the film, the alien's life-cycle involves the hatching of a parasitic larvae called a 'facehugger,' which attaches itself to a living host and then grows within a human before bursting through the unfortunate person's chest. The 'chestburster' then matures into a terrifying adult which takes on some of its host's physical attributes to adapt to its new environment. The creature is amphidromous and regularly migrates between freshwater and the sea, but unlike similar animals, its journeys are not essential as part of a breeding ritual.

"An island the size of 25 football pitches has appeared seemingly out of nowhere off the coast of Germany. The landmass, which is composed of sandbanks, gradually emerged from the violent waters of the North Sea over the past few years. It lies 15 miles off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany’s far north in a stretch of coastline known as the Wattenmeer, a marine national park. 'Anything but ordinary': The new landmass has been dubbed Bird Island after its first settlers; who include gulls, eider ducks, grey geese and even peregrine falcons . Nature lovers and yachstmen noticed the appearance of Bird Island - named after the seabirds who rest, nest or feed on the sand dunes that are up to 16ft high. Winds blew seeds from across Europe, and 49 species of plants have been detected on it. 'Who needs an artificial island off the coast of Dubai?' asked the Bild newspaper, Germany’s largest, when the landmass composed of sandbanks grew, and stayed put, in the North Sea. But before locals reach for the beachtowels and sun loungers, nature might beat them to it. Landmass: The island, which is composed of sandbanks, has emerged from the waters of the North Sea off the coast of Germany over the past few years . Dunes: Nearly 50 different plant species have been discovered on the island after winds blew seeds from across Europe . Martin Stock, a biologist with the National Park Management which oversees the Wattenmeer, said; 'A strong storm flood could wipe the island out overnight. The plants do not have the roots necessary yet to bind the dunes together.' It is the first time in a quarter of a century that a discernible landmass has appeared in the coastal waters off Germany. Detlef Hansen, head of the national park, said; 'This is for us conservationists anything but ordinary.' Tidal actions unrelated to global warming or other earthly phenomena have created the island. While a boatload of tourists made it to the sands a week ago, they were under strict instructions to keep away from the gulls, grey geese, eider ducks, common ringed plovers and even peregrine falcons that use it. And, this time at least, none of them was allowed to bring a deckchair.....","The landmass, dubbed Bird Island, gradually emerged 15 miles off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein .

"We've heard of people going to long lengths to hide the fact they're planning to propose but this takes the biscuit. Parisian born Peter Ntephe, 48, spent weeks tricking his unsuspecting girlfriend Marie Akendengue, 33, into thinking she had a big job interview coming up to hide the fact that he was planning on asking her to marry him. Sneaky Peter set up the elaborate scheme convincing Marie that she was set to meet with a potential new business partner at The Gherkin, London. Scroll down for video . She said yes! Peter and Marie look happy at The Gherkin in London after his surprise proposal was a success . He even encouraged her to spend weeks preparing for the bogus meeting, helping her rehearse her questions, all the while she was total unaware that it would turn out to be the biggest day of her life. When the day of the meeting came the interviewer, played by an actor, started off with questions about Marie’s company MAK Petroleum before moving on to some more personal questions. Marie was quizzed about her taste in music, views on long distance relationships and how she feels about ‘talking to strange men on planes’ - which is how she met Peter. Before she was left alone to watch a short presentation - unaware it was a slideshow put together by Peter of their journey together. Marie was tricked into thinking she was having a job interview but Peter was secretly waiting ready to pop the question . As Marie was shown a power-point presentation that had been set up by Peter, she began to twig that something might be up with her 'business meeting' With the help of The Proposers Peter manged to completely take Marie by surprise, even reducing her to tears with his romantiscism . The Proposers team waited nervously outside the door to see whether Marie would say yes to Peter's proposal . And hopeless romantic Peter was the next surprise as he burst into the room bearing flowers and a diamond engagement band before popping the all important question - and luckily, despite Peter's trickery, she said yes. Midway through the 'interview' Peter burst in clutching a bunch of flowers, poor Marie couldn't hide her emotion bursting into tears as he entered the room . Marie was in complete shock as Peter got down on one knee in the middle of the room after spending weeks planning his perfect proposal . Marie said, 'The interviewer was so serious, I was trying to look for a smile on his face and I was thinking am I the only one who thinks the questions are weird? 'As soon as the guy asked me about long distance relationships I knew something was not quite right. 'Now I know that is why he had a smile on his face that morning when he went to work. He has put in so much preparation.' An ecstatic Marie gives Peter a kiss in a meeting room at The Gherkin . Marie couldn't believe it.

"Two million people are at risk from a toxic fog that has descended over Utah as pollution levels in Salt Lake City reach an all-time high. The icy fog has smothered the Salt Lake Valley for several weeks and trapped lung-busting soot emitted in the city underneath. The level of pollution in the city is now the highest in America according to the Environmental Protection Agency and medical experts are now urging residents to stay indoors. Health emergency: A toxic cloud caused by fog trapping pollution underneath hangs over Salt Lake City . Warning: Doctors - including Dr Gary Kunkel, pictured - are urging Utah residents to stay indoors to avoid inhaling the toxic air over . The smog over Salt Lake City has been caused by a temperature inversion - where warmer air creates a barrier above cold fog so everything underneath is trapped . The smog over Salt Lake City, which is surrounded by the Wasatch and Oquirrh mountain ranges,  has been caused by a temperature inversion where warmer air has created a barrier above cold fog so everything underneath is trapped. Snow cover on the surrounding mountains has amplified the phenomena, leaving Salt Lake City at just 18 degrees while . Park City basks in sunny 43-degree weather. The warmer air aloft has acted . like a lid on the frigid valley air, leaving it with no place to go. The pollution is now getting so bad that more than 100 Utah doctors are calling for authorities to immediately lower highway speed limits, curb industrial activity and make mass transit free for the rest of winter. Travelwise: Residents have already been asked to cut down their travel to prevent more petrol emissions adding to the pollution . Off the charts: There are now 130 micrograms of soot per cubic meter in Salt Lake City - three times the federal clean-air limit . Doctors say the microscopic soot - a . shower of combustion particles from tailpipe and other emissions - can . tax the lungs of even healthy people. 'We're in a public-health emergency for . much of the winter,' said Brian Moench, a 62-year-old anesthesiologist . and president of Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, which . delivered the petition demanding action at the Utah Capitol. The greater Salt Lake region had up to 130 micrograms of soot per cubic meter - more than three times the federal clean-air limit, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. And for two million Utah residents, there is no escape from the fog, except to the snow-capped mountains surrounding the city or resort towns like Park City, where the Sundance Film Festival is under way. Dangerous: Doctors warn the pollution levels are still toxic to people without any health issues . Capped: The polluted fog is trapped under a warmer layer of air that is acting like a lid on top of cooler air . Authorities have already prohibited wood . burning and urged people to limit driving. Vehicle emissions account . for more than half of the trapped pollutants. Utah regulators are working on a set of . plans to limit everyday emissions, including a measure to ban the sale . of aerosol deodorants and hair spray that contain hydrocarbon . propellants. Those plans, however, will take years to show results. Doctors say people - especially . pregnant women and children - should stay indoors, or at least avoid . active outdoor exercise under the sickening yellowish haze. Elderly . people with heart disease are most at risk, Moench said. The most polluted: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has singled out the greater Salt Lake region as having America's worst levels of pollution . Above the fog: The air around the mountains above Salt Lake City - on of America's top ski resorts - is completely clear . Time for change: Salt Lake City residents have already been prohibited from wood burning but doctors are calling for more stringent measures . 'If . you can see it, you don't want to breathe it. Think about what's going . into your body,' Salt Lake City pediatrician Ellie Brownstein said. 'It's . essentially like smoking. Instead of breathing clean air, you're . breathing particles that make it harder for your lungs to function and . get oxygen.' Smog is caused by a weather phenomenon known as an inversion layer. This happens when warm air mass moves over the top of an area with cooler air. The warmer air then acts like a lid on top - effectively trapping everything underneath. Over cities, this then causes a build-up of pollution as fumes and emissions have no where to escape to. Severe inversions can last for several weeks and cause respiratory problems for the inhabitants in the areas trapped underneath. A previous example of this happening was the Great Smog of London in 1952 which caused thousands of deaths. For weeks, industrialized cities in . northern China have been dealing with bouts of sickening smog several . times more toxic than Utah's. But . by U.S. standards, Utah's pollution index is off the charts with . readings routinely exceeding a scale that tops out at 70 micrograms a . cubic meter. The EPA sets a standard for clean air at no more than 35 . micrograms. 'People think the health implications are limited to asthma - that's only a drop in the bucket,' Moench said. 'For . every pregnant woman breathing this stuff, this is a threat to her . fetus through chromosome damage. 'It sets people up for a lifelong . propensity for all sorts of diseases.' Mother Michelle Francis has seen the effects of the toxic fog firsthand as her nine-year-old daughter now suffers from chronic asthma. The . air pollution is so awful in her Salt Lake City suburb that Francis . keeps her daughter indoors on many days to prevent her cough from being . aggravated. 'When you add all the gunk in the air, it's too much,' Francis said. The Utah health emergency comes as a deep arctic freeze has locked parts of the Midwest to the Northeast in their fourth day of glacial temperatures felt as low as -36F degrees. In Chicago, water froze on firefighters’ gloves almost as soon as it left their hoses as they attempted to battle a fire, while an entire façade of a building located on the city’s South Side was coated in sheets of ice. In New York's Manhattan, commuters similarly woke to temperatures around 12-degrees today, but with wind gusts of 15-20 mph, it felt more like five below as people started their work day. The cold snap arrived on Saturday night as waves of Arctic air swept south from Canada, pushing temperatures to dangerous lows and leaving a section of the country well-versed in winter's pains reeling. It is expected to last several more days. Cold snap: Trucks in Chicago are frozen in place under sheets of ice as an Arctic blast continues to grip the U.S. Midwest and Northeast . Frozen to the spot: Temperatures have dropped as low as 50 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (-46C) Tricky situation: Firefighters were attempting to tackle a blaze at this warehouse in Chicago but their water froze as soon as it left the hoses .","Health emergency declared Utah where pollution is now the worst in America .

"A jobless couple are demanding a new four-bedroom council house after having six children in their one-bedroom flat because the mother claims she is so 'super-fertile' it stops contraception working. Maggie Flisher, 26, and husband Gavin, 30, who get £27,000 a year in benefits, have not had jobs since the birth of their first child in 2005. Mrs Flisher claims she cannot help getting pregnant and says they have needed a bigger home ever since they started their family eight years ago. She blames repeated failures with the . pill, condoms, arm implants and a contraceptive injection for five out of . six of the pregnancies. Packed in: Gavin and Maggie Flisher, who are demanding a new council house, in their one bedroom flat with their six children Lacieann, eight, (centre, rear) Elektra, six, (far left) Gavin Jnr, five, (centre), Lilyrose, two, (right) and three-month-old twins Paris Nicola and Martinjames (front left and right) Mrs Flisher says she cannot work because she is depressed and has mental health problems, while  Gavin has to stay in their cramped home to look after her and their family. Their three eldest children Lacieann, eight, Elektra, six, and Gavin Jnr, five, all currently sleep in the only bedroom. Maggie and her two-year-old daughter Lilyrose sleep on a sofa bed in the lounge alongside three-month-old twins Jamesmartin and Paris Nicola, who lie in Moses baskets. Gavin, meanwhile, beds down wherever he can find a space. Problem solved: Gavin with his daughters Elektra (left), Lacieann and his son Gavin Jnr in their one bedroom, which they have now moved out of . Complaint: The family said they had no room for their family. Gavin is shown here with Lacieann in their old cramped kitchen . They couple say they have so little room they have to rent a nearby lock-up to store their childrens' toys. They currently get an annual total of £22,900 in benefits, including £540-a-month in jobseekers allowance, child benefit of £85-a-week and child tax credit of £1,000 a month. They also get housing benefit of £270-a-month to pay the rent on their flat in Maidstone, Kent. 'I've been here ten years but I've wanted to move since I had my first child and she's eight now,' Mrs Flisher said. Complaints: The fertile pair say the pill, condoms, arm implants and an injection have all failed to stop them conceiving . No fun: The lack of space meant the family have had to pay for storage for belongings and toys . 'I had the twins this April and the council knew I was pregnant because I went and told them. 'I bid for a house and they said I was top priority but another person had been on the list longer so she got it. Squeezed in: The parents, who haven't worked since 2005, say they cannot understand why the council won't rehouse them . 'My girls are literally always arguing because they want their own space and my son has a pink and yellow room. 'The four-bed homes are like gold dust. I've been told I'm a main priority but then they are given to someone else. 'I reckon they should build more four bedroom houses because all the ones they have are full. 'All my friends and family say it is disgusting and that I shouldn't be in this situation. 'I just have to keep bidding if I'm going to be given a move.' She was working in telesales when she first moved into the one-bedroom council flat in 2003 by herself. The following year she married labourer Gavin and their eldest child Lacieann was born in 2005 - and the couple haven't worked since. The 26-year-old says she begged her doctor to be sterilised but was told she was too young to be considered. She added: 'I had contraception for all the children apart from my first one. 'I had the needle, I took the pill, I had the implant and for the twins I was taking the pill and had an implant. 'The doctor just said I was really fertile and they don't know what to do. 'I am too young to get sterilised and Gavin tried using a condom as well. 'The house has no space for storage so I have to spend £137 a month for a storage space on a industrial estate.' Costly: The family rely on a total of £27,000 in benefits paid out to them and their six children, who are all under the age of eight . Maggie's midwife, health visitor and local Tory MP Hugh Robertson have all written to the authorities about the family's plight. Maidstone Council said they would not move a family into a new home if there was still going to be an issue with overcrowding. A spokesman said: 'Housing associations do not accept nominations for houses where applicants would be classed as overcrowded so applicants with a four-bed need are advised not to bid on three-bed houses. 'Social housing is scarce and bids made through the Kent Homechoice website are considered by the waiting time on the housing register. 'Where families have a need for large homes, they are offered support with looking for a house in the private sector and given information on a mutual exchange swap.'","Maggie Flisher and husband Gavin have not worked since first baby in 2005 .

"Trendy teaching methods have abandoned the tradition of imparting knowledge to allow children to chat about what they find interesting, Michael Gove claimed today. The Education Secretary attacked GCSE exam questions about why X-Factor guru Simon Cowell is rude and whether or not rapper Tinie Tempah likes eating kangaroo. He also ridiculed history lessons using plasticine models to learn about Hitler, and dismissed group work as ‘children chatting to each other’, which he claimed had seen some schools told to remove chairs and table from classrooms. Questions: English exams have include questions about Simon Cowell (left) and rapper Tinie Tempah, Michael Gove claimed in a speech on dumbing down in education . Standards: Education Secretary Michael Gove said warned against the 'sidelining' of the teacher from the activity of learning . In a major speech in central London, the senior Conservative said the work of good teachers was under attack on four fronts. He . dismissed the idea that teaching is a ‘depressing and demotivating . activity’ in decline and the claim that teaching cannot make ‘any real . difference’. He also claimed . teachers are under attack from people who think they cannot be trusted . and need outsiders ‘at every turn to monitor, police and approve their . activities’. But he saved some of his most outspoken criticism for the ‘sidelining of the teacher from the activity of learning’. Mr Gove went on: ‘Allied to these . teaching methods which have nothing to do with passing on knowledge . there has also been an emphasis on teachers having to put their own . learning aside so that work is 'relevant’ to the students. ‘This . has resulted in the dumbing of educational material down to the level . of the child – with GCSE English papers that ask students about Tinie .

The questions set by the WJEC/CBAC exam board, included: 'Simon Cowell admits he’s rude. What explanations does he give for his behaviour?' In another test, set by the AQA exam . board, pupils had to read an interview with rapper Tinie Tempah about . his favourite food from The Guardian. Asked to 'list four things you learn . about Tinie Tempah from the article', markers were told to award points . for answers including 'he works in the music business' and 'he didn't . like eating kangaroo'. Celebrity: An English Language GCSE in 2011 exam paper by the WJEC/CBAC exam board included questions about an article on Simon Cowell . Rapper: In 2012 GCSE English language students were asked to answer questions about Tinie Tempah. This is an extract from the guidelines given to markers by the AQA exam board . Michael Gove gave a string of examples of what he called dumbing down in the classroom, including: . Re-enacting the battle of . Hastings on a field with softballs . Spending three . lessons making castles out of cardboard boxes . Making plasticine models . to learn about Hitler . Recreating life on a slave . ship by making pupils gather under their desks . A-Level English students drawing faces of literary . characters on a paper plate . GCSE English papers that ask students about Tinie Tempah or Simon Cowell . Schools and nurseries told to remove tables and chairs from classrooms . Children not allowed to sit still for longer than one minute for every year of their age . Mr Gove called for teachers who ‘actively pass on knowledge’, instead of leaving children to their own devices. ‘Children . naturally learn to talk; they do not naturally learn to read, or to . play the violin, or to carry out long division,’ he said. Mr Gove said: ‘It's the belief that . education should not be an activity in which the teacher imparts . knowledge to the child but a pursuit - by the child - of what it finds . interesting.’ Educational thinkers have repeatedly . argued that the importance of teaching should be downgraded, he claimed . with classrooms reorganised to reduce the teacher’s central role. ‘All too often, we’ve seen an . over-emphasis on group work – in practice, children chatting to each . other - in the belief that is a more productive way to acquire knowledge . than attending to an expert. ‘Some schools have been pressured to fit in with prevailing doctrines, even against their own instincts. ‘Some nurseries and schools in Kent, for example, reported to us that they were told to remove tables and chairs from their classrooms.’ Teachers were also told not to keep children sitting still for longer than one minute for every year of their lives, even if listening to a story. Children could not be allowed to tidy up, or be asked to put their coats on, in case it interrupted ‘child-initiated play’, Mr Gove claimed. Where teaching is marginalised, inappropriate fun activities are used in place of proper learning, the minister suggested. He . pointed to a string of examples collected by teacher Matthew Hunter, . who uses a blog a series to chronicle ‘intellectually impoverished’ schools and the content of history lessons aimed at 11 to 16-year-olds. Mr . Gove said: ‘They included studying the battle of Hastings by . re-enacting it on a field with softballs, spending three lessons making . castles out of cardboard boxes, making plasticine models to represent . Hitler’s main aims as Fuhrer and recreating life on a slave ship by . making pupils gather under their desks. ‘Another . teacher records a lesson for A-Level English students in which they . were asked to depict literary characters on a paper plate – drawing a . face on the plate - and then asked to use stickers to define the . character’s principal traits - pinning the stickers on their clothes and . mingling with other students, while they introduce themselves “in . character”.'","Education Secretary warns of risk of teachers being sidelined .

"A model which has foretold the correct results of the Electoral College selections in U.S. Presidential elections since 1980, has predicted a loss for Barack Obama and the Democratic Party. The forecast was made by two professors at the University of Colorado who used economic data and unemployment figures from each state to predict a Republican win come November. Political science professors Kenneth Bickers and Michael Berry’s study predicts 218 electoral votes for President Obama and 320 for Romney with the Republican candidate winning every seat currently considered to be on the fence. Obama loss, Romney win: The forecast model predicted disappointing results for President Obama with 218 seats to Romney's 320 with Romney taking home the crown in all current swing states . The prediction model uses economic data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, including income per capita and both state and national unemployment figures. The research concluded that U.S. voters blame Democrats for high unemployment rates but hold Republicans more responsible for low per capita income. It also showed that the advantage of holding the White House disappears for Democratic candidates  when the national unemployment rate hits 5.6 per cent. 'Based on our forecasting model, it becomes clear that the president is in electoral trouble,' Professor Bickers said. Winning? Romney, photographed on Thursday from his campaign plane in Hobbs, New Mexico, has been picked to win by Electoral College prediction model, but a new poll argues the contrary . Favourite? A new Ap/GfK poll says that most Americans believe President Obama, pictured on Wednesday in New York, will win in November . The professors’ analysis concluded that Romney would take home all swing states including Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New Hampshire and Colorado. Colorado voted for Obama in 2008 but the . current president is predicted a marginal loss at 48.1 per cent against Romney’s 51.9 per cent, although with the caveat that only the two major parties . were considered. Although . the economy has improved under Obama, Professor Berry said in a statement . that it remains to be seen whether voters will consider the economy in . relative or absolute terms. ‘If . it’s the former, the president may receive credit for the economy’s . trajectory and win a second term. In the latter case, Romney should pick . up a number of states Obama won in 2008,’ Prof Berry said. This show the latest forecast from the New York Times which predicts a win for Obama in the Electoral College selections . Although the model devised by Prof . Berry and Prof Bickers has predicted the correct results of eight . consecutive presidential elections, the data used for analysis was . collected in June. An update with figures from September is due next month which the team said could have a completely different outcome. The results of the model's . calculations are in stark contrast to current polling data. The New York . Times' latest figures for the Electoral College selections forecasts a . blue win with 282.6 electoral votes for Obama and 255.4 for Romney. Track record: This table from the UC Boulder model shows its success rate . Although . the figure is well above the 270 electoral votes President Obama needs . to hold on to his presidency, it is a decrease by 12.8 seats since the . last figures on August 15. While the race remains a dead heat, a new AP/GfK poll out today says that most Americans expect President Obama to retain the presidency. Overall, registered voters are about evenly split, with 47 per cent saying they plan to back Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and 46 per cent favoring Romney and Rep Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. About one in four voters say they are undecided or could change their minds between now and November 6. President Obama, who was all smiles yesterday as he arrived at JFK Airport in New York yesterday, ought to be worried about the forecast as it has predicted the correct outcome of the electoral votes since 1980 . The contours of the race are little changed from June, when an AP-GfK survey showed 47 per cent of voters backing Obama and 44 per cent siding with Romney, suggesting Romney's decision earlier in August to tap Ryan as his running mate was not the game-changing event he may have desired. Both campaigns have been competing fiercely for a small sweet spot in the middle of the electorate: Independent voters who say they don't lean toward either party. Romney holds a narrow lead among that group with 41 per cent, compared to 30 per cent for Obama. But few think the Romney-Ryan ticket will win in the end. On the trail: Mitt Romney met supporters at in Bettendorf, Iowa during his presidential campaign yesterday . Asked to predict the race's outcome, 58 per cent of adults say they expect Obama to be re-elected, whereas just 32 per cent say he will be voted out of office. Even among those who say they have a great deal of interest in following the campaigns' bitter back and forth, a majority expect Obama to win. Partisans generally expect their own candidate to win, though Republicans are less sure about Romney than Democrats are about Obama - 83 per cent of Democrats say Obama will be re-elected while 57 per cent of Republicans think he'll be voted out of office. Among those Republicans who think Obama may pull out a victory is Catherine Shappard, a 78-year-old from Dallas. Shappard said all of her friends agree . that Romney would be a better president, yet she's alarmed to hear even . conservative commenters say Obama has a good shot at re-election. VP pick: A new poll suggests that Romney's decision to pick Ryan, pictured Thursday in North Carolina, was not the game-changing event he may have desired . 'I think it's close,' Shappard said. 'A lot closer than I'd like it to be.' The perception that Obama has the advantage could cut both ways. On the one hand, people like to vote for a winner, so if voters think Obama will win, they may be more inclined to cast their lot with him. On the other hand, it could backfire for Obama and help Romney if it drives down turnout among Democrats. If Obama's supporters think the race is in the bag and their vote isn't necessary, they may stay home. But if, like Shappard, voters suspect the race is close, they'll be more likely to cast a ballot, said Patrick Murray, a political analyst at Monmouth University. 'It's less important who people think will win than if they think it's a close race,' said Murray. After just over one week on the campaign trail, Romney's running mate remains unknown to about a quarter of voters. Ryan is viewed favorably by 40 per cent of registered voters, while 34 per cent see him unfavorably. Obama's running mate and current Vice President Joe Biden, has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for a string of gaffes he made during campaign stops. On August 14, Biden told a Danville, Virginia, audience that included hundreds of black people: '[Romney] said in the first 100 days he’s going to let the big banks write their own rules, unchain Wall Street. They're going to put y'all back in chains.' Less than 24 hours later, Biden appeared to be off by 100 years when he asked another Virginia crowd: 'Folks, where's it written we cannot lead the world in the 20th century in making automobiles?' Gaffe: Biden, pictured on August 14, sparked outrage with his 'put y'all back in chains' speech . While Romney's campaign strategy has been to hammer at Obama on job creation and his fiscal policy, Obama has been going demographic by demographic in an effort to woo voters. The president has alternately tailored his campaign speeches and his ad campaigns to women, older voters and, most recently, new young voters who may not have been old enough to cast a ballot four years ago. In each case, Obama has used Romney and Ryan as foils, arguing that their policies would limit women's health care choices, force seniors to pay more for Medicare and cut back on student loans. A little help from my friends: A new TV ad features former President Bill Clinton speaking in support of Obama's economic plan . Obama's appeal to female voters got an unexpected boost by the eruption of dismay over Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's remarks about rape and abortion, prompting an unexpected debate on that social issue. The president's campaign also enlisted the help of former President Bill Clinton with a TV ad blitz on the economy. In the ad, Clinton speaks directly to the camera and says voters face a 'clear choice' over which candidate will return the nation to full employment. 'We need to keep going with his plan,' Clinton says of Obama in the ad, which will run in eight battleground states.","Forecast predicts loss for Obama with 218 votes versus 320 for Mitt Romney .

"Hospitals may be withholding food and drink from elderly patients so they die quicker to cut costs and save on bad spaces, leading doctors have warned. Thousands of terminally ill people are placed on a 'care pathway' every year to hasten the ends of their lives. But in a letter to the Daily Telegraph, six doctors who specialise in elderly care said hospitals across the UK could be using the controversial practice to ease the pressure on resources. Warning: Hospitals may be withholding food and drink from elderly patients so they die quicker to cut costs and save on bed spaces (file picture) The Liverpool Care Pathway, which got its name as it was developed at the Royal Liverpool Hospital in the 1990s, withholds fluids and drugs in a patient's final days and is used with 29 per cent of hospital patients at the end of their lives. The practise is backed by the Department of Health. But the six experts told the Daily Telegraph that in the elderly, natural death was more often free of pain and distress. The group warned that not all doctors were acquiring the correct consent from patients and are failing to ask about what they wanted while they were still able to decide. Claims: Experts say in the elderly natural death is more often pain free (file picture) The doctors say that this has led to an increase in patients carrying a card stating that they do not want this 'pathway' treatment in the last days of their lives. One of the letter's signatories, Dr . Gillian Craig, a retired geriatrician and former vice-chairman of the . Medical Ethics Alliance, told the newspaper: 'If you are cynical about . it, as I am, you can see it as a cost-cutting measure, if you don't want . your beds to be filled with old people.' A . Department of Health spokesman said: 'People coming to the end of their . lives should have a right to high quality, compassionate and dignified . care. 'The Liverpool Care . Pathway (LCP) is not about saving money. It is an established and . respected tool that is recommended by NICE (National Institute for . Health and Clinical Excellence) and has overwhelming support from . clinicians at home and abroad. 'The decision to use the pathway . should involve patients and family members, and a patient's condition . should be closely monitored. 'If, . as sometimes happens, a patient improves, they are taken off the LCP . and given whatever treatments best suit their new needs. 'To ensure the LCP is used properly, it is important that staff receive the appropriate training and support.'","Six doctors say the 'care pathway' practice could be being used in UK hospitals to ease pressure on resources .

"Historic Olympic events such as the triple jump and swimming races are in the line of fire after new rules were agreed by the IOC to allow more sports into future Games. The IOC will give greater flexibility to the Olympic programme to allow host cities to stage new sports - there have been calls to bring in sports such as surfing that have greater appeal to young people. It could also pave the way to baseball/softball and possibly squash and karate being included in the Tokyo 2020 Games. However, the number of athletes will be capped at 10,500 meaning that there will be pressure on the bigger sports such as track and field and swimming to agree to a cut in the number of events. Triple Jump could be one of the sports which could be cut for future Games - Phillips Idowu represented Great Britain at the 2012 London Olympics . Canada's IOC member Dick Pound believes synchronised swimming should also be chopped . Canada's IOC member Dick Pound identified triple jump, synchronised swimming and race-walking as events he believes should be dropped from the Games. Sebastian Coe, head of the British Olympic Association and IAAF vice-president, hit back saying: 'Triple jump is a sacrosanct sport in track and field.' Lord Coe also defended race-walking but conceded there will now be pressure on athletics, saying: 'There are roughly 10,500 athletes in an Olympics and we take roughly 2,200 - a fifth of all competitors and 47 different disciplines. Does that mean track and field needs to be vigilant about protecting its events then the answer is almost certainly ""yes it will"".' Other IOC members believe the situation with swimming, which allowed Michael Phelps to win eight gold medals in one Games in 2008, needs to be reformed. Julio Maglione, president of swimming's international federation FINA, said: 'I don't know what will happen, this is the truth, it's a difficult moment. 'I suppose that it's a problem we discuss in the future, we don't know what's going to happen with us, athletics, gymnastics.' In other rule changes - part of the greatest shake-up in the Olympics since 1999 - it was agreed that Games will be able to staged in more than one city or even in different countries in the future. Canada's IOC member Pound has identified triple jump, synchronised swimming and race-walking as the sports which should be chopped . Sebastian Coe hit back at Pound by jumping to the defence of triple jump and race-walking . The 127th IOC session meeting in Monaco on Monday passed recommendations on bidding for Games despite concerns being expressed that the changes could damage the atmosphere of the Olympics. The new rules will also make it less costly for cities to bid to host Games with the IOC picking up the bill for some of the costs. The rules were passed unanimously but there were some concerns expressed by IOC members about holding Olympics in different cities or countries. Denis Oswald, the Swiss IOC member who oversaw the preparations for London 2012, said: 'I am worried that the unique character of the Games could be diminished by the recommendation to allow some events to be dispersed over several locations within the same country, or even in a neighbouring country. 'The Olympic village won't look the same and for isolated athletes it will resemble more a kind of world championship without living a true Olympic experience.' IOC vice-president John Coates, who presented the changes to bidding rules, said holding events outside the host city or country would only be considered in 'exceptional circumstances'. Meanwhile, suggestions that some summer events could be held during the winter Olympics have been dismissed by the IOC. Brian Cookson, the president of cycling's governing body UCI, was among those calling for a radical overhaul of the Olympics, with indoor sports such as track cycling, judo and badminton possibly moving to the Winter Games. Sepp Blatter will have to step down from his role at the IOC in 2016 due to new age limit restrictions . The IOC also agreed to maintain an age limit of 70 for IOC members - with a few limited exceptions permitted. In February, FIFA president Sepp Blatter called the limit 'discrimination' and the 78-year-old now faces having to step down from the IOC in 2016 when he reaches the limit of 80 for members elected before 1999. Blatter was in Monaco but did not challenge the proposal on this occasion. Speaking afterwards, Blatter said he did not oppose the age limits this time as he had already made his point. 'I am a team player, I am in the IOC team and I accept what was proposed,' he said. Asked why FIFA had decided against age limits, Blatter replied: 'In FIFA we have another team.' It meant that all 40 proposals put forward as part of the Olympic Agenda 2020 were voted for unanimously and IOC president Thomas Bach told a news conference this would go down as an historic day for the Olympic movement. Bach said: 'Not in my wildest dreams did I expect this to happen so easily. I hope in 20 years I can look back to this day with satisfaction and happiness and maybe with a little bit of relief.'","The IOC will give greater flexibility to the Olympic programme .

Barrister Geoffrey Robertson added, too, that Miss Alamuddin is a 'brilliant and passionate defender of human rights' who is respected by her colleagues. And Robin Jackson, chief executive of her law firm, told Reuters: 'She brings a bright light to everything she is involved in, and I am so delighted at her happy news.' Clooney's relationship with Miss Alamuddin is a departure from the long list of actresses and models he has dated in the past. Rumours of their engagement began to circulate after she was spotted several times in the last week sporting a 'huge ring'. Entertainment Tonight reported that on Thursday, the lovers were spotted at celebrity restaurant Nobu in Malibu, California, with Clooney's friends Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber. At the dinner, Miss Alamuddin had a conspicuous ring on her left ring finger, according to an onlooker. The same ring was seen by another diner at another LA restaurant, Craig's, on Wednesday, when the pair were understood to be celebrating their engagement. A friend told People: 'George and Amal are trying to keep things very low-key but they also aren't really trying to hide this, it doesn't seem. Thrilled: Nina and Nick Clooney are pictured at the February premiere of The Monuments Men in New York. Mrs Clooney said she was 'extremely happy' at her son's engagement . Big news? George Clooney's girlfriend Amal Alamuddin, pictured here in October, was reportedly seen by multiple people showing off a ring at Nobu in Malibu, California, on Thursday. 'I think it's like they want the people they love to know that this is real, that they plan on being together for ever.' Clooney was first photographed with Miss Alamuddin last October in London. And just hours after the small screening at the White House on Tuesday, February 18, Clooney and Miss Alamuddin were pictured standing intimately together at the Round Robin and Scotch Bar at the Willard Hotel in Washington D.C. in a group that included Clooney’s pal and co-star Matt Damon and his wife Luciana, and fellow actor and co-star Bill Murray. An onlooker at the bar revealed: 'They looked very much together, George had his arm around her and she appeared to be a girlfriend . In March, they went to Tanzania, where they were photographed on safari, and they also visited the Seychelles. History repeating? While known as a diehard bachelor, George has been married before briefly to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993, pictured here in 1990 . Miss Alamuddin was once voted the 'hottest barrister in London' by a law blog, but her life could not be more removed from the celebrity world which Clooney inhabits. She comes from a prominent intellectual Lebanese family who fled war-torn Beirut when she was a child and settled in a large modern house in Buckinghamshire. Her mother, Baria, was a noted beauty when she was younger – a Liz Taylor of Lebanon, by  all accounts. Her father, Ramzi, is a retired professor of business studies at the American University of Beirut. The family are believed to belong to the Druze religious sect, an offshoot of Islam. After leaving Oxford, where she gained a 2:1 in law, Miss Alamuddin studied at the New York University School of Law. Now working out of London's Doughty Street Chambers, she specialises in international law, human rights, extradition and criminal law. Asked about the engagement news yesterday, her parents' housekeeper beamed a large smile and said: 'I don't know.'  But a neighbour said: 'I'm really happy for her – who wouldn't be happy with George Clooney as their husband?' Yesterday, Clooney's spokesman Stan Rosenfield did not deny the engagement rumours but just said: 'I do not comment on his personal life.' Clooney was married to actress Talia Balsam from 1989 to 1993. Since then he has said that although he is not completely closed off to the idea of another wedding, he is not the marrying type. Last December he told Esquire: 'I haven't had aspirations in that way, ever. I was married in 1989. I wasn't very good at it.' His previous girlfriends include British model Lisa Snowdon, former wrestler Stacy Keibler, cocktail waitress Sarah Larson, Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis and Baywatch star Krista Allen.","Bride-to-be is Amal Alamuddin, a humanitarian lawyer who represents Wikileaks founder Julian Assange .

"A six-year-old girl from Missouri, who lost part of her leg when she was run over by a lawnmower, will be able to walk again thanks to a rare surgical procedure. Isabella Smith's left leg was mangled by the mower after her grandfather accidentally went over her as she played in his garden on May 1. The damage was so severe that at first surgeons thought they may have to amputate it from the hip but, thanks to a rarely performed operation, the little girl will soon be back on her feet. Steps to recovery: Stephanie Williams, left, with her six-year-old, Isabella, who lost part of her leg when her grandfather ran over her on a mower . Isabella has had seven operations already on her leg since arriving at the University of Kansas hospital by air ambulance at the start of the month. When her grandfather, John Williams, realized he had run over the six-year-old he used his belt as a tourniquet and told Isabella's grandmother to stay away because of the shocking injuries. The mower had ripped a large hole in her leg, damaging bone and muscle and making doctors question whether they could save the limb. Eventually, they decided to use rotationplasty - an eight-hour procedure in which a section of the leg around the knee joint is removed, and the lower leg is rotated and reattached so the foot is facing backwards. Doctors say that the procedure is the best hope Isabella will have of walking again, because the ankle will work as a knee joint and fit into a prosthetic. When asked if she understood what was going to be done to her, Isabella said: 'Yeah, it means my foot is going to be in a different place ... Will I be able to run?' Brave: Stephanie, pictured with Isabella, says she has been moved by her little girl's courageous attitude as she recovers from the horrific accident . Surgery: Isabella is recovering from an operation to remove and reattach part of her leg in an effort to give her greater mobility when she has a prosthetic fitted . The little girl's courageous attitude has helped her family get through the trauma of the past few weeks. Rotationplasty is a complicated procedure in which part of the leg is removed and then reattached to the body. It is usually performed on young cancer patients because it allows tumors to be removed without the need for amputation. A section of the leg around the knee joint is removed. The lower part of the leg is then rotated and reattached to the body, so the foot is facing backwards. This allows the ankle joint to simulate the way a knee moves, making learning to walk on a prosthetic easier. Nerves in the foot also continue to send signals to the brain about movement. Inplants are added to the new top half of the leg so that the reattached limb can be adjusted as the child grows. 'I was supposed to be strong for her, but it was the other way around,' her mom, Stephanie Williams, told the Kansas City Star. 'I’ve gone through every emotion, and the one thing I’ve learned is that crying doesn’t help. I’m trying to be like her.' Ms Williams had been on the first day of a vacation to Jamaica when her daughter was injured. Her parents tried to hide the extent of Isabella's injuries from her, telling Ms Williams only that she needed to return as soon as possible. 'They didn't want us to travel all day . knowing how bad it was. They just told us that she had been in an . accident and we'd need to come right home,' Ms Williams told KSHB. The procedure Isabella is having done is usually performed on young cancer patients as a way to remove tumors without them losing their whole leg. Surgeons who carry out the complicated operation, which involves attaching the shin to the thigh, and then making sure all the nerves and muscles meet up, usually have at least a month to prepare. But in Isabella's case, they had just two days. 'We didn't have a lot to work with,' orthopedic surgeon Kim Templeton said. Surgery: A medical diagram shows how rotationplasty works, by removing an upper section of leg and then reattaching the lower half with the foot facing backwards so the ankle can replicate the knee joint . The surgeon added: 'You get to keep and use as much of the real leg as possible. It takes less energy to get used to and allows someone to be more active and functional.' Isabella is still recovering from the operation, but in about two months she will have a prosthetic fitted and begin to learn to walk again. A fund has been set up to help with her hospital and rehabilitation costs, and to pay towards the $20,000 prosthetic and alterations to the family home to help her move around more easily. A PayPal account has been set up in the family's name, and can be reached via IzzysSquad415@gmail.com.","Surgeons used rotationplasty to save Isabella Smith from having her whole limp amputated .

"If you've ever dreamed of getting away from it all with your own slice of paradise for idyllic holidays, then look no further. Tiny Dun Maraig - located just near the Isle of Skye - has a setting as beautiful as it is private and it has just gone on sale with a starting price of £10,000. But you'll need to be happy to rough it as there are no modern amenities of any kind and it is barely the size of half a football pitch. In the middle of the water to the left of the chimney on the left side of this cottage you find Dun Maraig . A rocky, grass-covered tidal island near the north-west tip of Scotland's Skye, close to the  quaint village Uig, it may also be the best chance for many of us to own our own private island. Listing agent Vladi Private Islands' senior vice president Pedro Arez confirmed Dun Maraig could sell for as little as £10,000 despite describing the opportunity to own it as 'very special'. 'With this kind of island it is very hard to say what is the right price,' Arez says of the space of about 164 by 82 feet. 'To own your own island is very special.' 'The right value is the right value. Between £10,000 and £50,000 is my feeling.' The tiny island off Skye that is half the size of a football pitch could sell for as little as £10,000 . Size and proximity are two factors driving the price down, as is the fact the property has no planning permission for any form of structure beyond the remnants of a fort that can be seen only with the keenest eyes. Dun Mariag was once connected to the shore by a causeway and listing agent Vladi Private Islands say it's still possible to walk to from the mainland at the lowest tide. Local attractions include The Fairy Glen, on the other hand, is an unusual miniature landscape of grassy, cone-shaped hills and a turret shaped rock called Ewen's castle . The island has some kitsch appear though, as 20 years ago it was given away as a prize on a German TV programme Meine Show (My Show). Winner Stefan Schluznus, from near Bremen, was 20 at the time and while he initially said he was keen to build a house there to 'enjoy the view' it's not known if he even even visited the island before it was put up for sale. On winning the island in 1994, Mr Schluznus is quoted in the Herald Scotland saying: 'I am very happy, very excited. I am jumping in the air. 'I know you have the Loch Ness monster, whisky, bagpipes, and nice scenery but that is all I know. But all that is going to change.' The small island has no structures or approval to add any, but boasts tranquility and stunning surrounds . He added: 'I have seen photographs of my island. I am told it is easy to get to in a small boat. 'I am much looking forward to it. Maybe I can build a small house on the island and sit and admire the view.' Vladi Private Islands' portfolio includes deluxe islands befitting the rich and famous in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean, but doesn't have a lot to say about Dun Maraig. 'A rocky structure, covered by grass; attentive owners may even find the remains of a fort if they look closely enough,' their promotional material states, before going on to wax lyrical about its surrounds. Singers perform on the German TV show, Meine Show, which gave Dun Maraig away as a prize in 1994 . 'The village of Uig is located close to this island for sale, offering nice walks which take in waterfalls, woodlands and cliff-tops too,' it says. 'The Fairy Glen, on the other hand, is an unusual miniature landscape of grassy, cone-shaped hills and a turret shaped rock called Ewen's castle. 'Visitors that come to this region near the Isle of Skye will be spoiled by good restaurants, a lively bar, hotels, bed and breakfast accommodation, a campsite, shops, a petrol station, and much more. Furthermore the village is served by an excellent transport network, which comprises of boat trips, a ferry service to the Western Isles and a local and mainland bus service.'","Dun Maraig is barely the size of half a football pitch at 164 by 82 feet .

"Residents of a Berkshire town are scratching their heads over the appearance of a Royal Mail letterbox - in the middle of the River Thames. An incredulous postman spotted the traditional box embedded into one of the buttresses of a brick bridge in the village of Sonning-on-Thames. As he didn't have a boat handy, he took a . photo from the riverbank to prove to his bosses just why he hadn't been . able to make this particular collection in his van. Scroll down for video . Flashback: This similar red letterbox has appeared recently on a bridge in Berkshire over the Thames . Posting a letter would be tricky too, and with the box nestled just a few feet above the water line, it would be likely to become waterlogged in the winter as this stretch of the Thames regularly floods. Even psychic Uri Geller, who lives in Sonning, admitted he was stumped by the mystery of the letter box - how it got there, who put it there and why. Mr Geller, a resident for three decades, said: 'I have never seen anything like this anywhere in the world, it's a new one on me. 'This is a very unusual village,' he added. Beware of the ducks: Local postmen said they were stumped by the box, which sits just feet above water level . 'There are many sightings of a child ghost that walks on the bridge. 'Maybe it was the ghost of a mischievous little girl.' Canal users were also puzzled and took to blogs to question why the post box was there. Some have suggested the box is part of a promotional stunt for a production of Don't Shoot The Messenger by the Mikron Theatre company in which 'a gun-toting hoodlum holds up a sleepy village Post Office'. Lost in post: Residents have pointed out that the box would be useless in winter as the river often floods . The play was performed in July this year at Sonning Lock cafe. A spokesman for the Royal Mail, Val Bodden, said: 'The recent appearance of a postbox frontage on the side of the river bridge at Sonning is a mystery to us. 'It is certainly not an operational posting facility and we have no knowledge of how it arrived at this location.'","Postmen in Sonning-on-Thames stumped by appearance of letterbox in Berkshire village bridge .

"When President Barack Obama visited the 'Door of No Return' on a Senegalese island on Thursday, he believed he was looking at where Africans were shipped across the Atlantic into slavery. But not all may be as it first seemed. Historians claim that the entrance of Slave House on Goree Island where Obama posed for a photo opportunity was most likely only used for disposing of garbage. As reported by the Telegraph, Professor Ralph Austen of the University of Chicago said: 'There are literally no historians who believe the Slave House is what they're claiming it to be, or that believe Goree was statistically significant in terms of the slave trade,' Scroll down for video . Dubious: The 'Door Of No Return' might actually have been used as a garbage dump rather than a loading base for the slave trade . Facing history: President Obama took a tour of Goree Island outside of Dakar, Senegal where slaves used to be depart on boats bound for America in the late 18th century . Historians point out that the . Atlantic Ocean at Goree Island is both shallow and rocky, which would . have made it difficult for a slave ship to load its grim cargo at that point. The role of the island in the slave trade has long been disputed, though it has become an important symbol and emotional reminder of the horrific events of the past. The Telegraph reports that many scholars now believe that people were kept at this fort, they might have been used by residents of the island rather than for mass transportation to the Americas. Many think that other locations in West Africa, like Ghana, have stronger claims to being huge staging posts for the slave trade. In . the 1990s, Philip Curtin, an emeritus professor of history at Johns . Hopkins University and the author of two dozen books on the Atlantic . slave trade, became one of the first scholars to question the . authenticity of the Slave House. Touring: President Obama was accompanied to Goree Island by his wife Michelle, their eldest daughter Malia, Michelle's mother Marian Robinson and their niece Leslie . In a discussion on an online forum for historians, he said he believed the 'hoax' was perpetrated by the charismatic Joseph Ndiaye. Ndiaye was the museum's first curator, and he ushered generations of visitors through the house, recounting the alleged horrors perpetrated there with theatrical pomp. Ndiaye initially claimed that 20 million had passed through the house, upping it to 40 million by the time Curtin visited in 1992, four times the total figure of slaves exported from Africa overall. 'A lot of people have been taken in by the Goree scam,' Curtin wrote. 'Though Goree is a picturesque place, it was marginal to the slave trade.' From 1501 to 1866, an estimated 12 . million slaves from Africa were sent to North America, according to a . database created by scholars using shipping records and plantation . registers. Of these, only 33,000 came from Goree Island, an . insignificant portion of the overall total, the database shows. Yet the plaques which grace the stone walls of the Slave House speak of the 'millions' of slaves that passed through its halls. Obama peered out at the crashing waves through the island's 'Door of No Return,' at first by himself . Big step: Mrs Obama joined him at the poignant doorway, and he said that the visit helped remind them of the importance of protecting civil rights . Meaningful: Though the Maison des Esclaves has become a popular tourist destination, it was one of the more minor slave shipping ports in Senegal . The debate over the house's place in . history has become emotionally charged and politically treacherous in . Senegal, due to the high-profile role the museum plays in attracting . tourists to the island, including celebrity visitors like Obama, Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II and former U.S presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush. On Thursday Obama described the visit as a 'very powerful moment.' and that going to the site with his family helped . them fully appreciate the magnitude of the slave trade. Obama . also said that, as an African American and an African-American . president, the trip gaves him even greater motivation to stand up for . human rights around the world, and the visit came just hours after he . clashed with his Senegalese hosts over gay rights. He said the island is a reminder of what happens when civil rights are not protected. Fatal doorway: When slaves try to escape by jumping from the walkway set up between the doorway and the awaiting ships, they would be eaten alive by sharks who swam around the island expecting the bodies of unhealthy slaves . Close hold: Mrs Obama gives Malia a hug during a tour of the island alongside her mother Mrs Robinson, who lives with the family in the White House .","President Obama and his family visited Goree Island outside of Dakar .

"Sweden's answer to the Big Issue, Situation Sthlm, has launched a new scheme allowing customers to pay using credit and debit cards. (Stock image) A magazine supporting the homeless population in Sweden is embarking on a pioneering initiative to allow customers to pay by card. The Scandinavian country's answer to the Big Issue, Situation Sthlm, has launched the new scheme with payment company iZettle. In a month-long trial five magazine sellers were sent on to the streets of Stockholm with a smartphone and special card reader, provided by iZettle, to sell issues of the £5 publication. The card reader is plugged into the phone allowing cards to be swiped and payments taken in the street. The customer is then asked to write their signature on the screen or enter their pin number in the reader. iZettle chief executive Jacob de Geer told the Guardian people living in Sweden, which is fast becoming a 'cashless society', are happy to trust their card details to homeless people due to their faith in the credit card chip system. He said: 'The banks have done a great job with the . card infrastructure so that it is so robust, secure and trusted, that . people don’t really mind where they use their cards these days with the . chip. 'It was extremely well received. All the phones . were returned safely and are still in use.' The phones and card readers are kept securely at Situation Sthlm's main offices, and are picked up each day when the sellers arrive to collect their magazines. The magazine, which is similar to the UK's Big Issue, features professional writing by people who are homeless or disadvantaged. It is the first publication of its kind to offer card payments. Chip and PIN technology was introduced in the UK in 2004 following a trial in Northampton in 2003. It replaced the magnetic swipe and signature authorisation previously used, requiring card holders to use their PIN number to allow payments to be processed. iZettle launched in the UK last year, and is a market leader for mobile payments with a Bluetooth chip and PIN card machine. The firm launched in the UK last year after meeting the 'tough' regulatory requirements. 'Simplify, simplify, simplify is our core ethos,' Mr de Geer added. 'Regulation is the biggest challenge to mobile payments in most countries – we spend a lot of time and effort meeting criteria and gaining certification. We’re regulated almost like banks.'","Situation Sthlm is first publication of its kind to offer credit card payment .

"Every February and September, Fashion Week garners numerous headlines around the world for crazy outfits, accessories and too-skinny models. So it's no mean feat to take the top spot out of London, Paris, New York and Milan as the most outrageous event of the season. But this year, thanks to numerous nipples, blackened faces and some bizarre yeti-inspired hairy slippers, Milan has bagged the title in just 24 hours. Scroll down for video . Milan Fashion Week kicked off today and has already featured furry slippers and, blackened faces and multiple nipples (Pictured above: the Claudio Cutugno show, left, and the Gucci show, centre and right) The Italian city kicked off its week of style with plenty of jaw-dropping antics from designers. Big fashion houses like Gucci guaranteed their clothes got people talking by sending scores of models down the catwalks with their nipples on show through barely-there sheer tops. They also accessorised with odd hairy-looking shoes on many of their models. The furry footwear resembled the giant slippers that were popular with teens in the 1990s. Several models bared their nipples as they walked the runway at the Gucci show during the Milan Fashion Week Autumn/Winter 2015 . While many of the models had long or mid-length skirts, they were contrasted with see-through slips . Models at the Gucci show also wore yeti-style hairy slippers on their feet . Elsewhere, new designer Claudio Cutugno appeared to paint black faces on his models using glittery make-up as part of his Next Generation show.

"The Met Police is launching an internal probe into the missing person inquiry of Alice Gross, 14, who was last seen in West London on August 28 . Scotland Yard has launched a review into the shambolic handling of the Alice Gross case. The internal probe will examine what was done in the immediate aftermath of the 14-year-old’s disappearance – the so-called ‘golden hour’ when most cases are solved. MPs have expressed grave concerns over the Metropolitan Police’s handling of the case and delays in treating it as more than a missing person inquiry. The force also faces criticism over delays in asking the Latvian authorities for help in catching prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns. Meanwhile Latvian ministers said they had been unable to stop Zalkalns from entering Britain because of EU freedom of movement laws. They insisted they had no duty to inform the UK about his past as he had already served a prison sentence. And they may be unable to stop future murderers from slipping into the UK because this would infringe their ‘human rights and civil liberties’. In other developments: . The search for Alice further descended into chaos after Edgars Strautmanis, head of the International Co-operation Bureau in Riga said Zalkalns could not be held as a European Arrest Warrant had not been issued. Scotland Yard said it had not applied for an EAW as the case did not meet the ‘evidential criteria’. The hunt for Zalkalns also took an extraordinary twist when it emerged yesterday that he had been living with a convicted paedophile. Lionel Ferris, 68, owned the house in West London where Zalkalns lived with his girlfriend and daughter before he went missing. Lionel Ferris, 68, pictured, owned the house in Ealing, West London, where prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns had been living for 18 months with his girlfriend and one-year-old daughter . Zalkalns went missing from his home on September 3. He was seen on his bike at the canal 15 minutes after Alice was last seen . Mr Ferris, who died behind bars a few weeks ago, is thought to have been recalled to prison for breaking his parole after being released halfway through a three-and-a-half year sentence. He had been jailed in 2011 after admitting 12 counts of indecent assault on a girl aged under 16. It also emerged Zalkalns was a volunteer in Latvia's army reserves between 1991 and 1993, where he was taught search and survival skills and undertook duties including guarding prisoners. Radoslav Andric, another former landlord of Zalkalns, described him as a ‘competent, practical man and a born survivor’. ‘He was quite a weird man, a little bit rough,’ he said. ‘He seemed as if he had a military background - the kind of person who was fit for anything. He could find himself anywhere and survive.’ Zalkalns killed his wife Rudite in 1997 by stabbing her through the heart. He is pictured with his wife on their wedding day in 1995 . Handcuffed to a detective, Zalkalns shows detectives where he buried his wife after stabbing her on the outskirts of Riga . Meanwhile, Latvia’s interior minister Rihards Kozlovskis hit back at critics who blamed the Baltic country for allowing a convicted murderer to slip into Britain. Zalkalns served just six-and-a-half years in prison for stabbing his wife Rudite, 22. But within two years of his release, the jobbing builder was free to move here without immigration officials or police knowing of his past. British murderers are subject to stringent supervision, having to report to probation teams and seek permission to travel abroad. The Metropolitan Police is facing criticism over its handling of the case since Alice Gross went missing . Police officers were today searching an area of shrubland close to the bank in the hunt for the missing schoolgirl . A reward of up to £20,000 is being offered for anyone who has information that leads detectives to find Alice . Police have arrived in Latvia to continue investigations into the schoolgirl's disappearance . When asked why Zalkalns was allowed to travel to the UK, Mr Kozlovskis said: ‘This person has served his sentence for the crime that he was convicted of. ‘In such a case we would not restrict a person’s freedom to move within the EU as a member country. 'Of course we understand the public’s worry, but we are still doing everything we can to investigate.’ Mr Kozlovskis said he was hoping to work with other EU countries to build up a database of criminals. But he added: ‘There is a problem as to how long someone should stay on the database because of their human rights and civil liberties. It is a challenge.’ Mr Strautmanis said he did not have a ‘crystal ball’ to help him solve the case and had no idea where Zalkalns, 41, is. He went missing from his home in Ealing, West London, on September 3. Alice was last seen on August 28 walking along the nearby Grand Union Canal, followed by Zalkalns on a bicycle 15 minutes later. A Met spokesman said: ‘Inquiries in Latvia remain but one strand of this investigation. 'At this point in time the investigation remains very firmly a missing person inquiry.’","Internal probe will examine what was done in so-called 'golden hour' of case .

"A victim of a series of sickening rapes which caused national outrage in Australia says she is fearful about the imminent release of yet another member of the gang which terrorised girls just before the Sydney Olympics. The State Parole Board of NSW has announced it will release 'H', an unidentifed member of the notorious Skaf rape gang whose degrading and racist sex crimes still shock the nation almost 14 years on. The victim was a 16-year-old when she was raped by the gang leader, Bilal Skaf, in front of 12 men in a public park and had a gun held to her head by a second man who also raped her, before kicking her in the stomach. Bilal Skaf (left) was the leader of the rape gang which terrorised Sydney teenage girls on a four week rampage by 14 young men, including Skaf's younger brother, Mohammed (right) Brotherly hate: Mohamed Sanoussi (left) and his brother Mahmoud (right) attacked young Australian women who were asked during the rapes whether they likes 'the taste of Leb c***' The release of 'H' will mean two-thirds of the the original gang, which comprised young men of Lebanese background and included two sets of brothers, has now been freed from prison. The victim's mother told MailOnline the release frightened her daughter, and the fact half the gang were 'out and roaming around' was a major concern. 'H' was one of  14 mostly Muslim Lebanese Australians who went on a four-week rampage orchestrated by gang leader Bilal Skaf, raping Australian women and teenage girls in Sydney in the lead up to the 2000 Olympics. The gang members, aged between 13 and 18 years, lured the girls from shopping centres and train stations and took them to parks and public toilet blocks. One of the victims was raped 25 times by a total of 14 men at Bankstown, in Sydney's west, in an ordeal that lasted six hours, during which the attackers subjected her to racist taunts. They called her an 'Aussie Pig', told her she would be raped 'Leb-style' and asked if 'Leb c*** tastes better than Aussie c***'. Afterwards, the rapists cleaned her down with a fire hose. Sickening degradation: nine men out of a gang of 14 young Australian s of Lebanese background were convicted for attacks in which the rapists called their victims 'Aussie pigs' Bilal Skaf left) pictured with his fiance before the rapes and after his arrest and incarceration (right) in a maximum security Australian prison . Two 16-year-old girls were raped repeatedly over five hours and told 'you deserve it because you're Australian'. When police caught the gang, the available evidence allowed only nine members go to trial. During court hearings, the men's family members abused legal and court officials. Family members spat at the media and others, and one female relative called the Crown Prosecutor, Margaret Cunneen, SC, a 'sharmoota', which means 'whore' in Arabic. A victim of the gangs rapes says she is fearful now two thirds of the gang has been freed from  prison , following the release of Mohamed Sanoussi (above) and that of 'H' who is due for parole in two weeks . In sentencing, Judge Michael Finnane described the rapes as events 'you hear about or read about only in the context of wartime atrocities'. When gang leader, Bilal Skaf, aged 18 at the time of his rapes, received a maximum 55 year sentence, there was outcry among the Lebanese Australian community. Skaf appealed and his sentence was reduced. Appeals have also reduced the compulsory jail time of the other  gang members. 'H', who was 16 years old when he participated in the rapes and who is said to have the mental age of a child, is now 30 and will walk from Sydney's Parklea Correctional Centre as early as February 18. He is the second gang member to be set free from prison in six months, and his release will mean six members of the nine men convicted have been freed, although one, Mahmoud Sanoussi, is being held in custody on charges of allegedly bashing a cleaner in southwestern Sydney. Mahmoud Sanoussi is now allegedly a member of Sydney's most notorious Middle Eastern gang, the Brothers For Life. His association with the gang meant his brother and fellow Skaf gang member, Mohamed Sanoussi, could not be released to the Sanoussi family home when paroled last year. Mohamed Sanoussi's release sparked widespread public criticism of the Australian justice system. Sanoussi, who had successfully appealed his original sentence, which was whittled down from a 21 year maximum to 12 years served, was involved in the rapes and assaults in a park on two women who were forced to give oral sex to eight males. Victims of Crime Assistance League campaigner Howard Brown said the existing parole system might prove insufficient to properly supervise Sanoussi on his release. 'As recent cases show there has been an erosion of public confidence in the justice system,' he said. 'When a [sex offender] will be released, we have to keep really close tabs on him.' As MailOnline can now reveal, Mohamed Sanoussi and now 'H', join other Skaf gang rapists who have been quietly released  into the community. Tayyab Sheikh was released to parole in June 2007, three years before the expiration of his full sentence.

Gang rapist Bilal Skaf in Australia's most secure prison, Supermax, in the visits room with his mother, Bari (right) who was banned by prison authorities after she smuggled letters from her son out of the jail . Mahmoud Chami was released to parole in April 2013 and another unnamed rapist, 'T', has also been freed. The victim's mother who spoke with MailOnine said her daughter had made a big effort to get on with her life, which was jeopardised by the new of 'yet another' release of a rape gang member. 'She has her bad days and she's not the girl she was. She has a lot of concerns about her safety and that of [her family]. 'She can be very paranoid. We hope these men will be strongly monitored in the community.' The victim's mother said it was her 'gut feeling' the two gang leaders will win early release from prison. Bilal Skaf, now aged 32, is not eligible for parole until February 11, 2033, and his younger brother Mohammed may apply for parole on July 1, 2019. It was Mohammed Skaf, who the victim thought was a friend, who took her to the public park where his brother raped her. The victim's mother said every news report about the Skafs and the other rapists brought back her horrifying ideal. 'Her life is like swimming with shoes on,' the mother said. The parole board will release 'H' later this month on 27 conditions, which include he must not communicate with anyone under the age of 16 years by text messaging or the internet, and must undergo drug and alcohol testing.","Victim of notorious Australian rapes in fear as two-thirds of gang freed .

"House prices in many regions outside London are now at record highs despite recent warnings of a slowdown. These areas are the South East, South West, West Midlands, East England and Wales. And many counties still have room for rapid growth, say property experts. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average UK house price reached £272,000 in December, which is £2,000 less than at its peak last summer but £1,000 more than the previous month. Scroll down for video . Rise up: The average UK house price reached £272,000 in December, £1,000 more than the previous month . London prices are almost double this at £502,000, although this is also some way off its record high of £514,000 last August. While prices in the capital rose by 13 per cent in the last 12 months, this is a much slower than last summer when annual house price inflation hit 20 per cent. In the surrounding counties, house price growth is rapidly catching up with London, rising by 12 per cent in the south east, 11 per cent in the east and 9 per cent in the south-west. Peter Rollings, of estate agent Marsh & Parsons, said: ‘Property price growth enjoyed a rollercoaster ride in 2014, and while the market has slowed down somewhat from the steep accelerations of the summer, it is still firmly on track and pressing forward in a steadier fashion. ‘In London, where price inflation was pushed higher and higher during the past year due to an imbalance of supply and demand, growth is still elevated above other regions, but normality is resuming.’ Some good news: The number of mortgages given to first-time buyers reached a seven-year high in 2014 . Property prices in every region across the country ended the year higher than at the start, ranging from a 4 per cent increase in Wales and the north west to a 13 per cent annual uplift in London. Strong price rises across the country mean that a typical first-time buyer paid 10 per cent more for a property in December than they would have paid a year earlier. The average price paid for a house by a first-time buyer in December was £208,000, while for those already on the property ladder the average price £314,000. Campbell Robb, of housing charity Shelter, described the house price rises as yet another blow for millions of people ‘with barely a hope of getting on the housing ladder’. Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said the Government had pledged to build more homes in a bid to ease house prices and ‘help people who work hard and want to get on the property ladder to do so’. Record low interest rates have helped some buyers to purchase their first home, with ‘mortgage wars’ breaking out among the major High Street lenders in recent weeks. Separate figures released yesterday the number of mortgages given to first-time buyers reached a seven-year high last year. More than 300,000 mortgages worth £45billion were handed out to first-time buyers in 2014, marking a 15 per cent rise on the previous year, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said. This was despite the introduction of tough new restrictions last year which forced lenders to ask probing questions to applicants to ensure they could afford their repayments in the event of a significant rise in interest rates. In 2007, the average age of someone buying their first home was 29 years old, but for the last couple of years the average first-time buyer has been 30, the CML said. Paul Smee, director general of the CML, said the industry is ‘stronger than a year ago’. He said: ‘Improving economic conditions, boosted by Government schemes like Help To Buy, saw the highest amount of first-time buyers purchase their first home for seven years.’ Help to Buy is a Government-backed scheme which allows buyers to purchase a home with a small deposit of as little as 5 per cent.","The average UK house price reached £272,000 in December .

"It is thought that up to one in 50 children globally have some form of autism, and this number continues to rise steadily each year. While there is no cure for the condition, the use of technology in autism treatment has grown in popularity in recent years, but the reasons for its success are only just being highlighted. Experts are finding that simple, carefully constructed apps are enabling affected children to feel safe and communicate more readily because the software is more predictable and ordered than human interaction. Researchers have found smartphones and tablets help autistic children develop new skills. Toca Boca, for example, create apps aimed at children aged three to six. Although the games are not specifically designed for children with autism, they have proved popular among parents who have children with the condition . Autism is a neurological disorder that affects how a person . communicates, and relates to, other people. It can also affect how they . make sense of the world around them. People . with autism typically have trouble communicating, looking people in the . eye, and can get upset by loud noises or bright lights. They may also have a sensitivity to touch, tastes, smells and colours. In particular, many autistic people like order and predictability. Autism . is a spectrum condition, which means that while all people with autism . share certain difficulties, their condition affects them in different . ways. Some people with . autism, for example, are able to live relatively independent lives but . others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need specialist . support. Asperger syndrome is a form of autism and people with the syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence. They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language. Toca Boca in Sweden, for example, creates apps aimed primarily at children aged between three and six. Toca Band encourages children to make music and learn about rhythm and tempo, while Toca Hair Salon Me lets players give their family and friends virtual haircuts. The firm calls the characters in the apps ‘digital toys’ and although the games are not specifically designed for children with autism, they have proved popular among parents who have children with the condition. Toby Price from Mississippi has a daughter called Addison, 11, who has non-verbal autism. He has noticed a marked improvement in Addison’s behaviour and skills since learning to use an iPad, and the Toca Boca apps. ‘When you have a child with autism take an interest in something, as a parent, you have to run with it,’ explained Price. ‘Addison . uses her iPad to show us things she wants, or places she would like to . go. She uses it to practice handwriting and even counting. ‘As a parent [I am] happy to have found a way to engage our kids with iPads.’ Rhiannan Walton, 32, from West London has been a speech . and language therapist for eight years. She began using technology . in her therapy sessions with autistic children approximately 18 months . ago. ‘Technology . responds in the same way every time; you press a button and it responds . how you expect it to,' Walton told MailOnline. 'This particularly appeals to autistic children . who can become scared and confused by unpredictability.' Toby Price from Mississippi has a daughter called Addison, 11, pictured, who is non-verbal and has autism. He has noticed a positive improvement in Addison's behaviour and skills since learning to use an iPad. He said she uses it to show what she wants, or places she'd like to go. She uses it to practice handwriting and counting . Speech and Language Therapist Rhiannan Walton told MailOnline: 'Technology responds in the same way every time; you press a button and it responds how you expect it to. This particularly appeals to autistic children who can become scared and confused by unpredictability.' Stock image of Apple's iOS 7 pictured . Many autistic children like trains, for . example, because they are predictable. They follow set paths along . stable tracks and their doors open and close in the same way each time. For therapy to work, Walton believes it has to be motivating and said technology . motivates children with autism in a unique way. ‘We . know therapy needs to be motivating for children in general, and . games are particularly motivating for children with autism because they’re . visually appealing. ‘Autistic children aren't motivated by wanting to please in the same way other children are. ‘Non-autistic . children think ‘this lady wants me to play this game and if I do, . she'll say well done,' but autistic children aren’t interested in that at . all. 'They need to be motivated in other ways - and technology helps . with this.' Autistic children typically have visual . ways of communicating, and as a result have a visual way of learning and . this is why apps are so effective. In a recent study, researchers from . Canada studied 12 children in six classrooms across Ontario, all of whom . have non-verbal autism spectrum disorder. These classrooms were given Apple iPads for a six-month trial. Following . the experiment, nine of the students showed a statistical improvement . ranging from mild to significant in their overall communication skills. The . devices were also found to boost motivation among 75 per cent of the . children, while also increasing their attention span and ability to . interact socially. Topcliffe . Primary School in Birmingham recently introduced touchscreen devices . into classrooms and similarly noticed an improvement among the autistic . students. ‘We watched . children with autism playing with the images on the screen in ways in . which none of the typically developing children had done, said . Topcliffe’s spectrum disorders teacher Sarah Quickenden. ‘The normal curriculum that we were offering just wasn't allowing them to demonstrate these skills to us. We never realised that the children had these skills because some of them are so locked in.’ Walton said the technology can also be used to build other communication opportunities. 'I give the children in my . therapy sessions the game, let them play it for a while before taking it . away. ‘We then work together to help the child show me that they want it back; they want to play more of the game.’ Once . this skill is developed, Walton continued, it can . be built upon to teach children about taking turns, sequencing, and so . on. It can also be generalised for other tasks, such as asking for more food or drink. Researchers from Canada recently studied children with non-verbal autism, stock image pictured, who were each Apple iPads for a six-month trial at school. Following the experiment, nine of the students showed a statistical improvement ranging from mild to significant in their overall communication skills . Walton told MailOnline that apps and games . have the added benefit of appealing to children without autism, . especially the siblings of those who do have the condition. This means families can manage the child’s condition as a group, and helps siblings play together. Price’s . son McKade, for example, recently set up a tea party with sister . Addison after she had learned the skills from the Toca Kitchen game. Autistic children typically have visual ways of communicating and learning. This is why apps such as Toca Hair Salon Me, pictured, are so effective . Walton said many of her autistic patients pick up the games quickly, and have good memory, so will remember skills they’ve learnt when at home with their parents. Vicki Clarke is the owner and president of Dynamic Therapy Associates with 18 years’ experience as a Speech Language Pathologist and Augmentative Communication Specialist in Georgia. She told Autism Speaks: ‘People are messy and computers are neat. For our friends with autism, this consistency is easy to understand and comforting. ‘The iPad puts this comfortable, predictable teaching friend right in the hands of our children with autism, regardless of where they are.’ But she continued technology isn’t a ‘miracle cure’. ‘The specific needs of the child need to be the main deciding factor on purchasing any technology,’ explained Clarke. ‘These technologies are simply another tool in our box that have the potential to help meet some of the needs of our children. ‘When deciding on technology options, teams must consider the individual needs of the child and the ability of the app to meet the comprehensive needs for which they are purchased. ‘Families should consult with the professional and personal friends who know the child and can offer input on potential needs of the child.

"Sites such as Amazon, TripAdvisor and Yelp are now the go-to destinations for customers who want to cut through advertising waffle and discover what products and services are really like. Yet, according to research that is sure to panic business owners across the world, a fifth of Americans have left online reviews for items they’ve never bought or even used. This figure is even higher (32 per cent) among parents with children under 18 and the most popular reason why online shoppers questioned did this was simply because ‘they felt like it.’ According to recent research, a fifth of Americans have left online reviews for items they've never bought or even used.

Movie site Rotten Tomatoes received 2 per cent, while Air BnB and Seamless both featured in 1 per cent of the reviews. 'Other websites' were quoted as the final 8 per cent. According to the YouGov research, 39 per cent of people have never left an online review. More than 22 per cent admitted they left a negative review because they didn’t like the idea of the product, while 19 per cent said the product received a bad review because they didn’t like the company who made it. One in ten respondents admitted to posting spoof reviews for comedy effect. This is thought to be a result of a series funny online reviews, for products including Veet and sugar-free Gummi Bears, having gone viral recently. The findings come from a YouGov Omnibus study of 1,193 American online shoppers between 18 and 20 January this year. This study also found that a quarter of online shoppers ‘always’ check reviews before making a buying decision. Among those who look at reviews, 86 . per cent said they read both positive and negative reviews, 11 per cent . said they only read positive reviews, and three per cent admitted to . concentrating on just the negative ones.

"Films could be downloaded to smartphones in just one second with new ultra-high speed mobile phone broadband technology, Samsung has claimed. The fifth-generation technology will transmit data several hundred times faster than the 4G networks being rolled out across the country, says the communications giant. Homes could have the wireless 5G system by 2020 using a vast network of masts, which may prove controversial but would mean an end to broadband cables to connect to the internet. Samsung's Galaxy S4 smartphone: The Korean giant has developed 'ultra-high speed' fifth-generation technology that could allow users to download an entire film in a second . Samsung has been able to get speeds of 1 gigabit per second - far in excess of current 4G networks, which can makage 12 megabits per seconds. According to Samsung, 'subscribers will be able to enjoy a wide range of services such as 3D movies and games, real-time streaming of ultra high-definition (UHD) content, and remote medical services.' While 4G networks speed up standard . downloads to about 13 minutes, subscribers of the new service would be . able to download massive data files ‘practically without limitation’, . enabling almost instantaneous access to games and 3D movies or the . ability to stream ultra high-definition programmes in real-time. The South Korean company claims its . technology uses high-frequency wavebands previously deemed unsuitable . for mobile networks. Central to it is the creation of what bosses say is . the world’s first transceiver capable of providing 5G to a wide area . via a phone mast. Samsung announced the breakthrough . after tests in which data was transmitted at speeds of more than one . gigabit per second over a distance of up to two kilometres. However, analysts warned that faster . downloads may mean bigger bills and raised health fears that new high . powered broadcasts will fuel so-called ‘electronic smog’. Samsung announced the development after conducting a test where data was transmitted at speeds of more than one gigabit per second over a distance of up to two kilometres. Customers using 4G services - currently provided in the UK by EE - access average speeds of between eight and 12 megabits per second (Mbps). 'The new technology sits at the core of 5G mobile communications system and will provide data transmission up to several hundred times faster than current 4G networks,' Samsung said in a blog post. Samsung has already trialled the technology over 2km distances, and found download speeds of 1 gigabit a second were possible, far higher than current 4G networks . The company believes the equipment could provide a solution to recent surges in wireless internet usage. It . added: 'Samsung’s new technology will allow users to transmit massive . data files including high-quality digital movies practically without . limitation. 'As a result, . subscribers will be able to enjoy a wide range of services such as 3D . movies and games, real-time streaming of ultra high-definition (UHD) content, and remote medical services.' In . the blog post, Samsung claims its technology uses high-frequency . wavebands which were previously deemed unsuitable for mobile networks. It said: 'The implementation of a high-speed 5G cellular network requires a broad band of frequencies, much like an increased water flow requires a wider pipe. 'While it was a recognised option, it has been long believed that the millimetre-wave bands had limitations in transmitting data over long distances due to its unfavourable propagation characteristics. 'However, Samsung’s new adaptive array transceiver technology has proved itself as a successful solution. 'It transmits data in the millimetre-wave band at a frequency of 28 GHz at a speed of up to 1.056 Gbps to a distance of up to two kilometers.'","Samsung claims system could allow live high definition 3D video to be watched in real timed .

"As respected hospital consultants at the top of their profession you might expect them to set a good example to other staff. Instead surgeon Jarrod Homer, 45, and anaesthetist Kamran Abbas, 43, went ‘toe-to-toe’ during a furious argument in a hospital corridor. The war of words escalated into an unseemly scuffle with both consultants allegedly pushing and shoving each other around. Row: Witnesses said Jarrod Homer (left) and Kamran Abbas (right) were . involved in a furious altercation which ended in one losing a tooth . Desperate to avoid a full-scale . punch-up, a nurse tried to split them up but accidentally knocked out . one doctor’s teeth. Last night hospital bosses were carrying out an . inquiry into the incident and both doctors have been told not to come . into the hospital while it is ongoing. It is understood there has been no . criminal complaint and police were not called. But the incident is a . major embarrassment for both consultants who are known for pioneering . work in their fields. Dr Abbas specialises in anaesthetising . obese people and lectures on the topic. Mr Homer is an expert in head, . neck, cancer and thyroid surgery. The scuffle began as a minor row when . Mr Homer complained about the length of time it was taking for patients . to be brought to the operating theatre.It is understood the delays in . administering anaesthetic were having a knock-on effect, with operations . repeatedly being pushed back.

Probe: Bosses at Manchester Royal Infirmary (pictured) admit they are carrying out an investigation into the incident . A senior hospital source said both . consultants were ‘shouting at the top of their voices, bellowing at each . other and pushing and shoving’. He added: ‘The surgeon was accusing . the anaesthetist of failing to bring patients down quickly enough for . their operations and very quickly it became an argument over . professional reputation. ‘There was such a ding-dong going on, . with the doctors going toe-to-toe and holding on to each other, though . no punches were thrown.  The nurse stepped in between the warring pair . to stop it but as they were pushed apart one of the doctors was struck . in the mouth. ‘He suffered quite a bad knock and was . apparently quite dazed for a bit and we heard later he had lost one of . his teeth as a result.’ It is not known which of the adversaries lost a . tooth.

Hornaday spokesman Everett Deger told WWJ Newsradio 950 that the company’s president has a love of zombie . culture – including popular shows like the Walking Dead – and was . inspired to make the bullets in honour of the cultural phenomenon. The 'bath salts' sold under the name Cloud Nine are likely to be stimulant drugs such MPDV or ephedrine. 'Bath salts' does not refer to a single chemical, but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the U.S. as long as they are not marked for human consumption – hence the misleading name. Drugs such as MPDV are highly potent stimulants, similar to some amphetamines, and in MPDV's case particularly, cause a strong compulsion to 'redose' with more of the drug. In high doses, such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour, and terrifying hallucinations – and the compulsion to take more of the drug continues, even once the 'high' has begun to make the user feel bad. Various different compounds use the name 'Cloud Nine', and it's still not confirmed which exact chemical was in the drug reported to have caused these attacks, but some reports have pointed the finger at MPDV. The chemical is already illegal in Florida – although other 'bath salts' remain perfectly legal in the state. ‘We decided just to have some fun . with a marketing plan that would allow us to create some ammunition . designed for that…fictional world,’ he told the radio station. Mr Deger noted that the bullets are some of the ammunition company’s most popular products. The news comes as two more cannibal . attacks have been reported in the US as police warn of a dangerous new . mind-altering drug called Cloud Nine. Last week Rudy Eugene - who is believed to have taken the over-the-counter ecstasy-like drug - . growled at officers as he chewed off most of a homeless man's face before being shot dead by Miami police. Since then two further incidents have been linked to the substance, which is part of a new line of 'bath salts'. The . second occurred on Saturday when a snarling homeless man, identified as . Brandon De Leon, threatened to eat two officers, echoing the Miami . attack. A third incident took place in Louisiana where Carl Jacquneaux, 43, bit off a chunk of his victim's face. Miami police have issued a warning . about Cloud Nine and told their officers to exercise extreme caution . when dealing with homeless men who appear to be acting unusually. Police . investigating the case of Rudy Eugene, who ate the face off a homeless . man, say as well as being naked, he was carrying a bible. Some pages had been ripped out of the book and were found close by, according to CBS Miami. A preliminary toxicology examination has also found that the 31-year-old had been smoked cannabis shortly before the incident. They were forced to fit 21-year-old De Leon with a Hannibal Lecter-style mask after he was arrested for disturbing the peace in North Miami Beach. When put in a police . cruiser De Leon slammed his head against the plexiglass . divider and shouted at officers, 'I'm going to eat you', NBC Miami . reported. He then growled, gnashed his teeth and tried to bite the hand of an officer attempting to treat his head wounds. 'Brandon growled and opened and closed his jaw, slamming his teeth like an animal would,' the report said. Miami police said they believe he was on a cocktail of drugs, including Cloud Nine. In a second case Carl Jacquneaux, 43, is accused of attacking Todd Credeur at his home in Scott, Louisiana, over the weekend after he became upset following a domestic issue. Victim: Todd Credeur, though in shock, managed to spray his attacker in the face with wasp spray to stop him from eating any more of his face . Scene: Todd Creneur was attacked while working on the yard outside his home in Scott, Louisiana . KATC reported that Mr Credeur was working in his front yard when he was attacked. Scott Assistant Police Chief Kert Thomas said: 'During the attack, the suspect bit a chunk of the victim's face off.' Mr Credeur reportedly managed to spray Jacquneaux in the face with wasp spray to stop him from eating any more of his face. Jacquneaux . then allegedly left the home and went to another man's home where he . held him at knife point and stole a hand gun. This is where police found . him and arrested him. A friend of the victim said she believes Jacquneaux was under the influence of Cloud Nine, which is the same drug which is believed to have been taken by the 'Miami Cannibal' Rudy Eugene. Eugene . ate the face of homeless man Ronald Poppo in Miami last week and a . police memo to officers has highlighted the dangers surrounding the . drug's use. It warned the De Leon case 'bears resemblance to an incident that occurred in the city of Miami last week, when a male ate another man's face'. 'Please be careful when dealing with the homeless population during your patrols.' Police have suggested Eugene was under the influence of the synthetic stimulant usually sold in drug paraphanelia shops. Cloud . Nine is 'addictive and dangerous', the memo said, part of a 'disturbing . trend in which new drugs are sold in the guise of household products'. The drug, which is also as Ivory Wave in the U.S., comes in harmless-looking packets, police said, adding that it is illegal in Britain and Australia. Crazed attack: Cloud Nine, which is the same drug which is believed to have been taken by the 'Miami Cannibal' Rudy Eugene (left) when he savagely attacked 65-year-old Ronald Poppo (right) The potentially addictive drug stimulates the central nervous system and symptoms include heart palpitations, nausea, hallucinations, paranoia and erratic behaviour. The series of shocking incidents began on May 26 when a naked Eugene encountered his victim, 65-year-old Ronald Poppo, who was sleeping in the shade on elevated train tracks. In surveillance footage from the . nearby Miami Herald building, Eugene was seen struggling with the naked . homeless man, throwing him to the ground and then tearing into his face . with his teeth as cars and bicycles sped by. About . 18 minutes into the attack, an officer appeared on the scene and yelled . at Eugene to stop, but the 31-year-old just growled at him and . continued chewing Poppo’s face. The officer then opened fire on Eugene, shooting him to death. Horrific attack: The spot on MacArthur Causeway when a man was killed after chewing the face off a stranger . Disfigured: Poppo, here on a stretcher, miraculously survived the attack, but was left without a nose, mouth or eyes . Poppo remains in critical condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital with his nose, mouth and eyes torn off. He faces months of treatment to rebuild his features and psychological care. Controversially this week the scene of the attack on Poppo has been Miami added to sites visited by a tourist tour's itinerary. The famous Miami Mystery & Mayhem: Crime Tour tour led by Miami-Dade College professor Dr Paul George will stop on the road that connects downtown Miami to popular South Beach. Dr Paul told the South Florida Business Journal: 'Horrible as it was, it is part of our history. Currently, our tour takes us over the causeway right past the site, so this fits well.' In a completely separate case not involving the drug, Canadian Luka Rocco Magnotta has been sent back to his country from Germany after an international manhunt. He is alleged to have killed his partner, Jun Lin, before eating parts of his body then chopping it to pieces that were then posted to different authorities. Mr Lun's head has not yet been found. Since Rudy Eugene . attacked and ate the face of homeless man Ronald Poppo on May 26 in . Miami, Florida, while allegedly high on 'bath salts' there has been a . spate of similar attacks. The . 'Miami Cannibal' case shocked the nation after police had to shoot dead . Eugene when he refused to stop eating his victim's face off. Poppo is . now recovering in hospital with horrific injuries. Brandon DeLeon, 21, was high on drugs and drunk on Four Loko on June 2 when he tried . to bite off a police officer’s hand after he was arrested for . disturbing customers in a Miami fast food restaurant. The homeless man repeatedly banged his head . against the patrol car’s Plexiglas and yelled, ‘I’m going to eat you.’ At . the police station, De Leon tried to bite the officer who was taking . his blood pressure and tending to his self-inflicted wounds. The police . report noted that he 'growled and opened and closed his jaw slamming his . teeth like an animal would.' Carl Jacquneaux, 43, is accused of attacking Todd Credeur at his home in Scott, Louisiana, over the weekend after he became upset following a domestic issue. Mr Credeur reportedly managed to spray Jacquneaux in the face with wasp spray to stop him from eating any more of his face. A friend of the victim said she believes Jacquneaux was under the influence of Cloud Nine, which is the same drug which is believed to have been taken by the 'Miami Cannibal' Rudy Eugene. Alex Kinyua, 21, a college student, used a knife to carve up Kujoe . Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie, 37, before eating his heart out and parts of his brain.

"Andy Williams, the silky-voiced singer whose recording of Moon River brought him fans all over the world, has died at the age of 84. Williams passed away on Tuesday night at his home in Branson, Missouri, following a year-long battle with bladder cancer, his publicist said. Williams revealed in November 2011 that he had been diagnosed with the disease but planned to keep performing. Until recently, he continued to appear at the Moon River Theater he built in Branson for two shows a day, six days a week, across nine months of the year. Scroll down for video . The show must go on: Andy Williams continued to perform while he fought cancer. He died on Tuesday at his home in Branson, Missouri, at the age of 84 . Timeless style: Andy Williams,  legendary singer of Moon River, has died aged 84 at his U.S. home . Tributes poured in for Williams after news of his death. Singers Tony Orlando and Jimmy Osmond . said that Williams convinced them and other performers to come to . perform at the Moon River Theater. Orlando said the . nation had lost a 'great treasure'. Singer and chat show host Kathie Lee Gifford said: 'He had perhaps the most beautiful male voice ever. Perfect pitch.' Pop star Robbie Williams tweeted: 'God bless Andy Williams. RW x.' Williams began singing with his brothers as a child, and his easy style and mellow voice led President Ronald Reagan to call him 'a national treasure'. The singer proved ideal for television. The Andy Williams Show, which lasted in various formats from 1957 to 1971, featured Williams alternately performing his stable of easy-listening ballads and bantering casually with his guest stars. He received 18 gold and three platinum albums over his long career and was nominated for five Grammy awards. He released an autobiography in 2009, Moon River And Me: A Memoir. Though his version of Moon River made him world famous, it was among his many hits, including Butterfly and Can't Get Used to Losing You. From the beginning: Andy Williams gets a hug from Wayne Osmond as he appears on stage alongside the group including Donny (right) in 2007. The Osmonds launched their career on Williams' variety show . It was on his show that Williams . introduced the world to the original four singing Osmond Brothers of . Utah. Their younger sibling Donny also made his debut on Williams' show, . in 1963 when he was six years old. Life in showbusiness: Williams, pictured in 2008, received 18 gold and three platinum albums over his long career and was nominated for five Grammys . The singer's unflappable manner on television and in concert mirrored his offstage demeanor. He once said: 'I guess I've never . really been aggressive, although almost everybody else in show business . fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be. 'My trouble is, I'm not constructed temperamentally along those lines.' Williams' clean-cut persona, which made him a popular act in conservative Branson, also carried over into his personal life. He was connected with scandal only once - indirectly - when his . ex-wife, former Las Vegas showgirl Claudine Longet, shot her lover, . skiing champion Spider Sabich, to death in 1976. The Rolling Stones . mocked the tragedy in the song Claudine. Longet, . who said it was an accident, spent only a week in jail, and Williams . provided support for her and their children, Noelle, Christian and . Robert. Born in Wall Lake, . Iowa, on December 3, 1927, Howard Andrew Williams began performing with . his older brothers Dick, Bob and Don in the local Presbyterian church . choir when he was eight years old. Their father, a postal worker, was . the choirmaster. Soon after, the Williams Brothers . Quartet landed a regular spot on Des Moines radio station WHO's Iowa . Barn Dance. The show quickly brought attention from Chicago, Cincinnati . and Hollywood. Famous friends: (left to right) Frank Sinatra, Charles Young and Andy Williams . Resolute performer: Williams (pictured in 1972, left) began his singing career at eight years old alongside his brothers and rose to global fame. He continued to perform until his death . Movie classic: Moon River was originally written for Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany's although it later became synonymous with Williams . They joined Bing Crosby in recording the hit Swinging On A Star in 1944 for Crosby's film Going My Way, and Andy, barely a teenager, was picked to dub Lauren Bacall's voice on a song for the film To Have And Have Not. 'I'll keep going until I get to the point where I can't get out on stage' Andy Williams . His voice stayed in the film until the preview, when it was cut because it didn't sound like Bacall's. Later the brothers worked with Kay Thompson, a singer who had taken a position as vocal coach at MGM studios, working with Judy Garland, June Allyson and others. After three months of training, Thompson and the Williams Brothers broke in their show at the El Rancho Room in Las Vegas to a huge ovation. They drew rave reviews in New York, Los Angeles and across the nation, earning a peak of $25,000 a week.

Williams, analyzing their success, . once said: 'Somehow we managed to work up and sustain an almost . unbearable pitch of speed and rhythm.' After . five years, the three older brothers, who were starting their own . families, had tired of the constant travel and left to pursue other . careers. Despite a long catalogue of hits, the song for which Andy Williams will forever be remembered is the timeless Moon River. Written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer in 1961, it was originally composed for the movie Breakfast At Tiffany's to be sung by Audrey Hepburn's character Holly Golightly. In the same year, Moon River won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was performed at the Oscars in 1962 by Williams who quickly became identified with the track. Although he never released it as a single, Williams' album Moon River And Other Great Movie Themes was certified gold in 1963 after grossing $1million in sales. In 1992, he opened a theatre in Branson, Missouri, named after his famous song. Andy Williams' biography, Moon River And Me, was published in October 2009. Williams initially struggled as a solo act and was so broke at one point that he resorted to eating food intended for his two dogs. 'I had no money for food, so I ate it,' he recalled in 2001, 'and it actually was damned good.' A two-year TV stint on Steve Allen's Tonight Show and a contract with Cadence Records turned things around. The Andy Williams Show followed, along with a host of gold albums and records. Among . his hit records were Canadian Sunset; The Hawaiian Wedding Song; Dear . Heart; Days Of Wine And Roses, the theme from the movie Love Story, and . Charade. Williams was also known for his political involvement and campaigned for his close friend Senator Robert Kennedy. He was in Los Angeles when the senator was shot dead and sang the Battle Hymn of the Republic at his funeral, later saying it was the 'hardest thing I've ever done'. However, Williams was not a natural Democrat and accused President Obama in 2009 of 'wanting the country to fail'. After leaving TV, . Williams headed back on the road, where his many Christmas shows and . albums made him a huge draw during the holidays. One . year in Des Moines, however, a snowstorm kept the customers away, and . the band's equipment failed to reach Chicago in time for the next . night's show, forcing the musicians to borrow instruments from a high . school band. 'No more tours,' Williams decreed. He decided to settle in Branson, the . self-proclaimed 'live entertainment capital of the country,' with its . dozens of theatres featuring live music, comedy and magic acts. Friends in high places: Andy Williams and Miss Piggy on The Muppet Show in 1980 . Life on film: Andy Williams and Sandra Dee in the film I'd Rather Be Rich in 1964 .

Williams Moon River Theater in the heart of the city's entertainment . district and performing two shows a night, six days a week, nine months . of the year. Only in recent years did he begin to cut back to one show a . night. Not surprisingly, his most popular . time of the year was Christmas, although he acknowledged that not . everyone in Hollywood accepted his move to the Midwest. 'The fact is most of my friends in LA still think I'm nuts for coming here,' he told The Associated Press in 1998.

"The frightening scene of hundreds of deer jumping to their deaths off a 120-foot bridge in Idaho is bewildering wildlife officials who are finding themselves at a loss on what to do. With motorists and state officials catching sight of the deers' tragic leap and fall off High Bridge, just east of Boise, witnesses are rallying for some way to prevent their tragic deaths. 'I've seen it myself and some of our staff have seen it too,' Evin Oneale, a manager with the Idaho Fish and Game Development told KBOI. Scroll down for video . Tragic death: A frightening scene of hundreds of deer jumping to their deaths off High Bridge east of Boise, Idaho has wildlife officials grappling to find a solution . Long way down: Not expecting a 120-foot drop on the bridge's other side, the animals are believed to leap to their doom when startled by passing cars . Mr Oneale believes it’s when the deer are crossing the bridge and are startled by an oncoming car that they take the jump. 'The first thing a deer is going to do is try and get away,' he said. 'They jump over what they think is just into the barrow pit, but it's a 120-foot fall to the river below.' Shocking photographs taken on the frozen river below show some of the animal’s bodies brutally encased in the ice. According to KBOI more than 100 died in 2004's month of January alone. Death toll: Officials say that in January of 2004 alone more than 100 deer, some seen in the area, plummeted to their deaths off the bridge . Victims: The bodies of deer encased in ice are seen after falling to their death off of High Bridge in Idaho . Hoping to stave off some of these deaths, in 2010 the Fish and Game came together with Idaho's Department of Transportation to build an underpass for the animals. It leads them directly under highway 21 instead of crossing the bridge. Fish and Game says the underpass has been successful but with colder weather bringing deer to lower elevations, motorists are pressed to take caution, traveling at slower speeds to not provoke the animals’ leap. A problem in other areas as well, shocking videos posted to YouTube have captured similar deaths of the animals even when cars are seen at crawling speeds beside them. Watch the video here: .

"Plea: Miss G wants to 'live in peace' without the intrusion of social workers from Redbridge council, but a court has blocked her from speaking out . A frail pensioner of 94 is being barred from speaking to the Press in a draconian ruling by the Court  of Protection. The former NHS midwife has been gagged after staging a street protest  and lodging a petition at Parliament, complaining about her treatment by social workers. She was silenced this week, despite begging the judge at a Court of Protection hearing to stop social workers from Redbridge, North-East London, meddling in her life. Standing up from her wheelchair, the pensioner, who can be described only as Miss G, bravely told Mr Justice Cobb at the hearing in London: ‘I am quite capable of speaking for myself. I know what I want and what I need. I am in my right senses. ‘I don’t what them (social workers) to cross my gates or come to my house. I want to be left alone by these people.’ The controversial gag, which could last her lifetime, flies in the face of demands by the top family court judge Sir James Munby for more openness in the shadowy Court of Protection, allowing those appearing there to speak out and complain about their experiences. His comments marked a victory for the Mail, which has campaigned against secrecy in the family courts. Miss G is stopped by a judge’s ruling at an earlier hearing from naming herself publicly and if she breaches that order or the one that now stops her speaking to the Press, the sanctions include the prospect of a prison sentence or the seizure of her assets. The gag on her freedom of speech will last until a psychiatrist, selected by Redbridge Council, assesses her mental capacity to give Press interviews and supplies his evidence at a hearing this summer. The hearings involving Miss G have been brought by social workers who believe her decisions are unduly influenced by her two private carers who came to live at her £350,000 house in outer London two years ago. The court has already ruled that Miss G does not have the mental capacity to decide on her living arrangements and financial affairs. Redbridge want her to pay for care from their social workers and hope to remove the couple, known as Mrs C and Mr F, from her house. But before the extraordinary court gag was imposed on Wednesday, Miss G told the Mail: ‘I do not want the council people back in my life. In the past, when they provided carers from an agency, they did not look after me. ‘I was left in a dirty house alone for hours at a time when they cut short their twice-a-day visits. ‘They did not shower me often enough and there were foxes in the garden, and insects in my bed. ‘When the carers came they put plastic covers over their shoes to protect them because they had left the carpets so filthy. It was only when I cancelled the council care plan, which I paid for, that Redbridge began to persecute me and the private carers I chose instead. I want to live in peace. I know my own mind and I want to be listened to. ‘I would like to take legal action for compensation from Redbridge Council. I think they failed to look after me properly.’ During previous hearings, the court was told that Redbridge social workers, accompanied by police, turned up at Miss G’s house 12 times in nine months after Mrs C and Mr F moved in. Miss G has complained to the Mail of the ‘frightening’ visits and the invasion of her privacy. And she says her private carers, who come from the same area of the Caribbean as Miss G, are ‘my family and look after me perfectly’. At the beginning of current hearings, she handed a signed statement to the judge begging for the names of herself and Redbridge Council to be made public. It added: ‘It is my express wish to remain in my own home, with my current 24-hours carers, and without social services intrusion.’ Redbridge – which the court has allowed to be named following a request from the  Mail – has refused to comment on details of the case.","Former midwife silenced after saying she did not want social workers .

"Steve Powell 'continues to put the community at risk' with violations of his parole, states a new report . Steve Powell - the father-in-law of Susan Powell, the Utah mother-of-two missing since 2009 – ‘continues to put the community at risk’ with violations of his parole, according to a new progress report from the Washington Department of Corrections. Powell was released from state prison in March after serving 30 months in a voyeurism case, but since his release ‘has made no attempts or shown any desire to comply with the requirements of supervision or change his behavior’ the report states. It also noted that Powell's actions and lack of cooperation with officials since being released from prison haven't allowed corrections officials to ‘thoroughly monitor his activities in order to maintain the safety of his victim(s) and the community. ‘Mr. Powell's adjustment to supervision can only be described as extremely poor,’ the report says, while further noting that his behavior ‘constituted an obvious risk to officer and community safety.’ The report recommends 60 days of ‘total confinement’ for Powell. A court hearing on his parole violations is scheduled for November 21, reports KSL. The violations mentioned in the report are the latest in a series of legal wows Powell, 64, has been involved with since his release eight months ago. In May 2012 he was convicted of 14 counts of voyeurism for taking surreptitious photos of two young neighbor girls in the bathroom of their home in Puyallup, Washington. Last month, prosecutors refiled a charge of possession of child pornography against him after an appeals court determined that the charge was wrongly dismissed during his original trial. Scroll down for video . Police found Powell in a Jack in the Box in July and he was sentenced to nine days in jail for visiting an establishment frequented by minors . A pretrial hearing on the refiled charge is scheduled for Wednesday and if convicted Powell could be sent back to prison for another five years. On his release from prison in March, Powell was ordered to complete a sexual deviancy treatment program and undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation. He was also ordered to stay away from places where juveniles are typically found such as pools, parks, playgrounds and schools. In May, Powell was given a Sexual History Disclosure Examination polygraph and some of his responses were determined to be 'not truthful,' according to the report. Utah mom Susan Powell, pictured with her two sons, has been missing since 2009 . In July, police found Powell in a Jack in the Box fast-food restaurant and he was sentenced to nine days in jail for visiting an establishment frequented by minors, the report states. In August, Powell's counselor 'terminated treatment' because Powell refused to cooperate with the psychosexual evaluation, according to the report. His parole officer determined he was being 'manipulative,' and he was sentenced to 'three days confinement.' Powell again refused to answer questions about his sexual behavior during treatment in October, according to the report. He is the father of Josh Powell, who killed himself and his two sons - 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden - in 2012 after attacking them with a hatchet and blowing up their home. Susan's husband Josh Powell killed himself and his two sons - 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden - in 2012 . Josh Powell killed himself and his two sons in 2012 after attacking them with a hatchet and blowing up their home . Josh is suspected to have killed his wife, although family members have voiced their belief that Steven was complicit in her presumed death. Thousands of images of Susan Powell were seized from the home that Steve Powell was sharing with his son in 2011 by police serving a search warrant. The images - some sexually suggestive - showed the missing Utah mother walking in public and sitting in her car - apparently unaware that someone was taking her picture. Other images seized during that search included those of the bathing young girls that were used to convict him of voyeurism charges in 2012. Other photos showed a variety of women, apparently unaware that a camera was focused on them, as they walked along sidewalks, in the park or the mall. Steve Powell has never been charged with any crimes related to images of Susan Powell, but the files show she was often the focus of his lens. Some of the images zoomed close to Susan Powell's crotch or her backside, including a set of photos taken through blinds as she's bending over and doing laundry. Child pornography charges have been reinstated and now Steve Powell faces up to five years in prison if convicted . None of the pictures, which were found on a disc in Steve Powell's bedroom, show her naked. The folder dedicated to Susan Powell contains nearly 4,500 images. In journals made public by authorities, Powell describes himself as a 'voyeur' and Susan as an 'exhibitionist.' He talked about using a mirror to spy on her under the bathroom door, and he wrote about taking sexual pleasure in looking at images of Susan Powell that he kept on his computer. Powell wrote in his journals about taking lots of video of Susan during a trip to Silver Falls in 2009, and a folder of images from the trip shows only photos of her backside as she's walking. In one entry, dated a few months before Susan Powell’s disappearance, Steve Powell wrote that he had just woken up 'from a most pleasant dream about Susan.' He described a sexually charged dream in which Susan asked him, 'Do you think I would make a good wife for you?' Anne Bremner, an attorney who represents Susan Powell's parents, said the images support the family's assertion that Steve Powell had a concerning attraction for his daughter-in-law. 'When you look at those pictures, it's clearly surreptitious. It's clearly obsessive,' Bremner said. The family believes Steve Powell knows something about Susan Powell's disappearance, and authorities have described him as uncooperative. Susan Powell, who was last seen at her West Valley City, Utah, home on Dec. 6, 2009, has never been found. Records have shown that Utah investigators handling the case focused their attention primarily on her husband. The Weekend of December 6 and 7, 2009 - Susan Powell, then 28, is last seen at the West Valley City, Utah, home she shares with her husband Josh and their two sons. Josh Powell tells police that he decided to take his boys on an impromptu camping trip that night in the middle of a blizzard but returns home to find his wife gone. December 24, 2009 - After two weeks of investigations during which Braden and Charlie confirm the camping trip, Josh Powell is named a person of interest in his wife's disappearance. Josh's father, Steve, tells the media he thinks Susan skipped town with a man from St. George, Utah, who also vanished from a party the same night she was last seen. January 2010 - Josh Powell decides to move with his two sons to Puyallup, Washington, which is where he and Susan grew up. He has now begun to tell the media his wife was 'extremely unstable' and was mentally ill. August 18, 2011 - Investigators working on a lead travel to abandoned mine shafts in Ely, Nevada, 200 miles away from West Valley. However, nothing is found. August 20, 2011 - At a remembrance service for Susan, Steve Powell and her father Chuck Cox engage in a public shouting match in which Powell calls Cox a 'liar'.

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce wants to see sin-bins brought into the Barclays Premier League to help referees avoid sending off players incorrectly. The former Bolton manager called for an improvement to refereeing standards last season and the issue came to a head last weekend when Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho criticised referee Martin Atkinson and Allardyce hit out at Jonathan Moss after West Ham's draw with Tottenham. Allardyce sees the introduction of technology as a good thing for the game, and also endorsed the idea of a time-keeper after Harry Kane's late equaliser against the Hammers on Sunday – while favouring a plan to trial sin-bins. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce believes the introduction of sin-bins will help out referees . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (right) has frequently queried the standard of refereeing this season . 'In terms of sin-bins, I certainly would (trial them),' Allardyce said. 'If you' re talking about a soft yellow and whether or not it should be a sending off I think that's a sin-bin. 'There are times when a player doesn't really deserve to be sent off. With ten minutes in the sin-bin, they come back on and (while they're off) the opposing team has got the chance to take advantage.' And Allardyce also felt that the impact of suspensions felt by soft red cards was not always in the benefit of the side facing the red-carded player. Speaking at a You Are The Ref event and discussing of using sin-bins, Allardyce said: 'The player doesn't get banned, he doesn't miss the next game. 'It might be less of an advantage to that team (their opponents) to miss the next game so you don't really gain any advantage from it.' Former referees chief Keith Hackett also confirmed that he had discussed the idea with representatives from the League Managers Association about the idea. Allardyce also backed the introduction of a timekeeper after Harry Kane's equaliser against West Ham . Former referees chief Kieth Hackett added his voice to calls that sin-bins should be given a test . 'Yellow cards are reducing the interaction between players and referees,' Hackett said. 'A referee should be saying 'I want an improvement on your behaviour, will you do that'. John Duncan (LMA Technical Manager) favours sin-bins. Whether it's in the conference or somewhere else, it should be tested.' Allardyce also supports the introduction of video replays and proposed the idea of a 'two challenge' system, similar to the system used in tennis. Under that ruling, managers would be given two opportunities per game to refer a referee's decision to a video replay if they disagreed with the original judgement.","West Ham manager Sam Allardyce thinks sin-bins will help referees .

"Dapper in a navy suit, red and blue striped tie and a pair of polished dress shoes, the Duke of Cambridge was every inch the prince as he met well-wishers in Coventry today. But there was one part of his ensemble that wasn't quite so princely - the turquoise and black loom band that peeped out from beneath his cuff. He was given the bracelet while chatting to young well-wishers, and as he put it on, even revealed he already had a stash of 200 at home. Scroll down for video . Loom band fan: Prince William greets crowds in Coventry while wearing his turquoise and purple loom band . Prince William isn't the only royal . to succumb to the loom band craze. The Duchess of Cambridge is also a . fan, after being given a red and pink band by a little girl during the . tour of Australia and New Zealand in April, as is the Duchess of Cornwall. Since the Duchess appeared in one, loom bands have become one of this summer's biggest trends, with sales rocketing by 300 per cent over the past three months - thanks in part to the Kate effect. But it wasn't all loom bands, with William using his visit to the War Memorial Park in Coventry to call for more protection from councils for memorial parks. On his . first public engagement as president of the Fields in Trust (FiT) charity, the prince highlighted the charity's Centenary . Fields programme which is run in partnership with the Royal British Legion. William, who placed a wreath at the garden’s centrepiece memorial during . his visit, said these green spaces should not be taken for granted, . describing them as 'a vital part of our national heritage'. Looking good: The loom band craze kicked off in April after the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one . Suits you! Prince William wasn't the only person to sport a loom band with many in the crowd doing the same . Ahead of his visit to Coventry, the prince had also penned an op-ed run in local publications around the country, in which he spoke of his admiration for the deeds of the soldiers whose sacrifice the parks honour. 'World War One continues to inspire us – one hundred years on – to undertake acts of remembrance for men and women otherwise long forgotten,' he wrote. 'Each moment of play or use that takes place on a memorial field is, in a way, an act of remembrance.' During his visit to the park, he also found time to speak to ex-paratroopers Lonnie Downes and Mick Murtagh who fought in Borneo in the 1960s. Afterwards, William helped a class from the city's Howes Primary School to plant poppy seeds near the park's play area. Sombre: During his visit to the War Memorial Park in Coventry, Prince William laid a wreath in remembrance . Helping out: After laying the wreath, the prince - and some local children - planted poppy seeds in the park . And action! Prince William rounded off his visit to the park with a game of tennis played with local children . But it was the royal embrace of loom bands that left well-wishers agog - a trend also picked up by A-listers such as David Beckham and Harry Styles. Also getting involved with the trend is the Middleton family which is selling the bands on their Party Pieces website. The bands have also proved lucrative for their inventor, US father-of-two Cheong Choon Ng, who came up with the idea last year. Since then, his company, Rainbow . Looms, has sold more than four million kits - including a plastic loom, . crochet hook and bands – worldwide. 'The loom bands are an absolute phenomenon,' commented Anna Protherough, senior buyer for kids at Hobbycraft. 'We began stocking the kits since they originally launched last year and since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one, they have been flying off our shelves. 'The options for what you can create are endless and these kits really can keep children entertained for hours, perfect for the summer holidays.’ With yet another royal happy to show off his love . for the plastic bracelets, it seems the loom band craze could well be here to . stay. 'World War One continues to inspire us – one hundred years on – to undertake acts of remembrance for men and women otherwise long forgotten. One of the most obvious manifestations of remembrance which continue to touch us today is the countless war memorials up and down the country. Most are typical: stone crosses or statues, surrounded by the names of the young men who never returned home. But some were more ambitious, and none more so than the plots of land which were set aside by communities as spaces of remembrance. These spaces were designed to encourage both stillness and movement, inward reflection and outward play. In short, places where freedom may be expressed with such ease. This War Memorial Park in Coventry has to be one of the most extraordinary examples of this. The stunning war memorial, and the many other memorials around the park, are dotted between places where children play football and throw frisbees, families picnic together, or walk the dog. It is a beautiful place – Coventry City Council and the people it serves have every right to be immensely proud of it. The Centenary Fields project, which I am privileged to launch today, aims to save in perpetuity scores of memorial spaces around the country.  Most will not be as large as this, but every one is valued by its community. Each moment of play or leisure that takes place on a Memorial Field is, in a way, an act of remembrance. I am delighted that Fields in Trust have identified these Centenary Fields as a vital part of our national heritage and well-being, which we cannot take for granted. Working with The Royal British Legion, Fields in Trust will encourage and cajole Local Authorities all across the country to follow Coventry’s lead to safeguard Centenary Fields in their area. I have no doubt that they will succeed, but only if they have help. I encourage Local Authorities to support this cause and to safeguard these living spaces of remembrance for generations to come. Thank you.' Style setter: Kate shows off the loom band given to her during the Royal Tour of New Zealand in April .

"A toilet has gone on sale in West London for £150,000 - more than half the price of an average house in the UK. The loo, believed to be Britain's most expensive ever, is located in a small store room between two floors in a commercial building in Kensington, opposite one of Britain's priciest streets. For the same price you could buy a new-build family home with four bedrooms in industrial towns such as Stockton-on-Tees. On sale: A toilet located between the first and second floors of this building on High Street Kensington is set to go up for auction with a guide price of £150,000 . £150,000 could even get you a two-bedroom holiday home, complete with swimming pool, on the Costa del Sol. The tiny property, billed as a 'store room with WC and wash basin' has no bedrooms, no reception rooms, no garden and just one window. It is reached from a stairwell which goes between the first and second floors of a red-brick building which has a cafe on its ground floor. The main selling point of the £150,000 toilet is its location on Kensington High Street, only a minute's walk from Hyde Park. Tiny: This store room is valued at more than half the price of an average home in Britain . The area is favoured by wealthy Arabs . and Russians, including Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who lives . opposite on Kensington Palace Gardens.

"Mean-spirited Olympics chiefs have already banned frisbees, flags and oversized hats in a list of oppressive rules to keep ticketholders under control. But now it has emerged sports fans will also be hauled out of official London 2012 venues for daring to wear a Pepsi T-shirt - simply because it is not an accredited sponsor. In the latest example of the increasing dominance of commercial sponsors in international sport, the draconian law was revealed by Olympic supremo Sebastian Coe today as he defended claims of a heavy-handed approach to protecting endorsers' rights. Fizzy-drinks fans, however, can still get past the tightly guarded turnstiles as long as they only wear T-shirts bearing the slogan of bitter rivals Coca-Cola - an 'Official Olympics Partner'. Tight security: Lord Coe, left, said Olympic ticketholders caught wearing a Pepsi T-shirt at any of the Games' official venues will be thrown out by security . There was some good news for logo . lovers, though, as Nike trainers would 'probably' be allowed through . security despite not making the list of accredited brands, he told BBC's . Today Programme. Presenter Evan Davis challenged the former gold-winning athlete on whether he would be allowed to turn up to an event in a Pepsi T-shirt. Lord Coe told him: 'No, you probably . wouldn’t be walking in with a Pepsi T-shirt because Coca-Cola are our . sponsors and they have put millions of pounds into this project but also . millions of pounds into grassroots sport. It is important to protect . those sponsors.' Asked whether he could wear Nike trainers, Lord Coe said: 'I think you probably could...' Memorable: The ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture in front of the Olympic Stadium will be a feature of the Games unlike spectators with Pepsi T-shirts . Olympic crackdown: Among the many items banned at the Games, balls, long-lens cameras, clothing with political statements, noisemakers and bottled water are just a few on the list . Pressed . to give a definite answer, the peer said: 'Let’s put some reality in . this. You probably would be able to walk through with Nike trainers. Does that satisfy you?' His comments came weeks after organisers revealed a list of restricted items banned from the Games. Frisbees are already banned, as are long-lens cameras, Che Guevara T-shirts and vuvuzelas. Security will be tight with . airport-style restrictions on liquids greater than 100ml and no more . than one soft-sided bag is allowed and must fit under the spectator’s . seat. At the 2006 FIFA World Cup in . Germany, thousands of Dutch football fans wore patriotic orange clothing . emblazoned with the name of Dutch beer Bavaria when the official . tournament sponsor was rival Budweiser. Unfortunately for them, officials . took a dim view of the protest and forced them to take off their orange lederhosen bearing the beer's name and . watch the game in their underpants. Lord Coe also hit out at the negativity surrounding the build-up to the Olympic Games. The former athlete said people were . 'overwhelmingly very positive' about the event, despite concerns over . security, transport and strict sponsorship rules. 'There are things we have done really . well,' he insisted, highlighting praise he had received from athletes . and the international media about the facilities built for the Games. Setting out the scale of the task, . Lord Coe said: 'This is really, really complicated. This is the ability . to stage in 19 days, in this city, 26 simultaneous world championships.' Lord Coe said the venues had been . 'built on time and to schedule' and the organising committee had 'raised . the bar' in terms of delivering an Olympics. But he added: 'This is a challenge, . this is a very, very tough project. No city is challenged in the way a . city is challenged when it delivers an Olympic Games.' Asked whether a 'negative narrative' was taking hold, Lord Coe said: 'I’m neither cavalier about this or . overly sanguine. It comes with the territory.' Marketing ploy: At the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, thousands of Dutch football fans wore patriotic orange clothing emblazoned with the name of Dutch beer Bavaria when the official tournament sponsor was rival Budweiser . He added: 'I’m talking to people who think they have come to a Games that has delivered in the areas that they need in a way that no Games has delivered before. 'I spent time in the village yesterday talking to athletes that were complimenting us about the Athletes’ Village we have presented. 'One Australian broadcaster came up to me - ‘I’ve been to four Games, this is by a distance the best broadcast facility’. 'Everywhere we go, the reality of it is people are overwhelmingly very positive about what we are doing.' With the build-up to the Games overshadowed by the G4S guards row, Lord Coe said: 'Believe it or not, this is not a security event with a little bit of sporting overlay... the sport will start, the torch is arriving in London today, the sport will start literally hours after the opening ceremony. 'That’s what we have spent seven years delivering and I think the teams have done a pretty good job.'","Lord Coe said Coca-Cola is allowed as an 'Official Olympics Partner'

"A Czech artist known for his anti-communist stance has floated a huge statue of a hand making an obscene gesture on Prague's main river. David Cerny's none-too-subtle artwork was paraded days before parliamentary elections that could give the Communists a taste of power almost a quarter-century after they were ousted. The artist's giant purple hand, extending an oversized middle finger, was placed on a pontoon on the Vltava river, near the famed Charles Bridge and facing Prague Castle, the seat of the presidency. Not subtle: Czech artist David Cerny has made his feelings on the looming prospect of the Communists gaining political influence with a giant purple hand making an obscene gesture . President Milos Zeman supports a plan by the leftist Social Democrats to form a minority government after the vote with tacit support from the maverick Communist Party. It would be for the first time since the 1989 anti-Communist Velvet Revolution that the party would get power, at least indirectly. In the eyes of many people in the country of 10 million people, the Communists are linked to 41 years of repression. The artwork was installed this morning, four days before the Czech early general election . But after decades on the sidelines, the party has escaped the taint of sleaze that has tarnished subsequent governments. It is unclear how long the finger will stay there. Cerny has been tight-lipped about the piece but told reporters the gesture spoke for itself. What mattered, he said, was which way it was pointing, reports the BBC. President Zeman is currently on an official visit to Ukraine and said he could not comment as he had seen it. The Czech parliament is undergoing a major upheaval and was dissolved in August. Prime Minister Petr Necas's government collapsed in June as a bribery scandal raged, and a government of technocrats, formed by President Zeman in July but heavily resisted by the main political parties resigned in August. An opinion poll conducted in August by Czech pollster SANEP gave the Social Democrats a 27 per cent share of the vote, followed by the Communists on 16.7 per cent. The Velvet Revolution that ended Communist rule over Czechoslovakia was led by dissident playwright Vaclav Havel. He was repeatedly jailed by the Soviet-allied Communist authorities in the 1970s and 80s for his activism in the Charter 77 civil rights movement and then led the nation as president from 1989 to 2003. The Velvet Revolution (pictured) in 1989 ended 41 years of Communist oppression, but now they are set to once again have a say in the future of the Czech Republic . Czech President Milos Zeman has backed a power-sharing plan with the Communists. The party's popularity has grown as they have escaped any political scandals . It started as as student protest on November 17, 1989, after fiery speeches at a university campus in Prague inspired thousands of students to march downtown toward Wenceslas Square. As darkness fell, police cracked down hard, but the crowds continued to grow, famously chanting: 'You have lost already!' They were right. Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall and communism in the region, Czechoslovakia had a new government by December.

"Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has confirmed his club's interest in signing Chelsea winger Victor Moses on a permanent deal after an impressive loan spell at the Britannia Stadium. Moses has turned out 19 times for the Potters this season since moving from London on a year-long deal in August - and the Nigerian scored the winner from the spot against Aston Villa last week. And now Hughes wants £8million-rated Moses to become a permanent part of his squad this summer - or to at least extend his loan for another season. Victor Moses celebrates after a late winner against Aston Villa, and now Stoke City want to keep him . Moses has impressed while on loan from Chelsea at the Britannia Stadium this season . 'Victor is still a Chelsea player, we're very pleased with what he's producing,' Hughes said on Friday. 'We have given him the opportunity and he's in a good place. 'We'd ideally love to be able to take him if we can but that won't be our decision. Things have to fall in place but if there was an opportunity to bring Victor next season we'd love to do it. 'It will be discussed at the end of the season, we will see how far it can go. But his profile is being raised so it is a two-edged sword. Stoke manager Mark Hughes hopes he can sign Moses on a permanent deal from his former club . Moses has made just 43 appearances since signing from Wigan Athletic in the summer of 2012 and spent last season on loan at Liverpool with little success. And Hughes suggested that Moses, who has emerged as one of the stars of a good season for Stoke, might not get the chance to play in a side that already boasts the likes of Eden Hazard, Willian and January signing Juan Cuadrado. 'Would he get the opportunity his talents deserve back at Chelsea?' Hughes questioned. 'We like to think we would be a consideration for him almost certainly.' The Nigerian winger has found opportunities limited at Chelsea which could add to the appeal of Stoke .

"David Cameron has issued a humbling apology to the Queen for letting slip her ecstatic reaction to the Scottish referendum result. The Prime Minister said he was ‘very embarrassed’ and ‘extremely sorry’ to have revealed the Queen’s private views during a conversation he did not know was being picked up by microphones. His public apology to the monarch is thought to be without precedent for a serving premier. He said he would be following it up with a personal phone call. Scroll down for video . David Cameron said he was ‘very embarrassed’ and ‘extremely sorry’ to have revealed the Queen’s views during a conversation with Michael Bloomberg, which he did not know was being picked up by microphones . In the extraordinary sequence, David Cameron could be heard talking to American billionaire Michael Bloomberg about the moment he rang the Queen at Balmoral to give her the news about the Scottish vote . Despite being just feet from the cameras, Mr Cameron revealed his private discussions with the head of state . In the most astonishing remark, Mr Cameron was heard to claim that the Queen 'purred down the line' The blunder was widely condemned by constitutional experts and one predicted his personal apology to the Queen ‘will be the most awkward call of his career’. He was caught on camera on Tuesday telling American billionaire Michael Bloomberg that the Queen had ‘purred down the line’ when he called her last week to say Scotland had voted by 55 per cent to 45 to remain part of the UK. In New York for a UN meeting last night, Mr Cameron said he was mortified to have breached the long-established protocol that content of conversations between the Queen and prime ministers is never discussed. He said Downing Street officials had already been in touch with Buckingham Palace to offer his apologies, and indicated that he would personally say sorry to Her Majesty when he next has his regular face-to-face audience with her. But the conversation may have to wait unless he makes it by telephone as they are not due to meet until she returns from Scotland in early October. Asked if he regretted discussing the Queen’s thoughts and whether he would apologise to her, he replied: ‘Yes and yes.’ During the walkabout, Mr Cameron also vowed to 'sue' polling companies who suggested the Yes campaign was ahead in the referendum campaign, claiming the stress and worry had given him 'stomach ulcers' Mr Cameron said he regretted discussing the Queen's personal views and said he would personally apologise . In the video recording, David Cameron can clearly be heard discussing his private conversations with the Queen. He said: 'The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying 'It's alright, it's okay'. That was something.... 'She purred down the line... 'But it should never have been that close. 'It wasn't in the end, but there was a time in the middle of the campaign when it felt… . 'I've said I want to find these polling companies and I want to sue them for my stomach ulcers because of what they put me through. 'It was very nervous moments.' He added: ‘Look, I’m very embarrassed by this. I’m extremely sorry about it. It was a private conversation, but clearly a private conversation that I shouldn’t have had and won’t have again. My office has already been in touch with the palace to make that clear and I will do so as well.’ A Buckingham Palace source said archly: ‘We are, of course, happy to facilitate any telephone call from the Prime Minister to Her Majesty.’ The apology came as Mr Cameron faced intense criticism over his gaffe. Dr Andrew Smith, teaching fellow of modern history at University College London said: ‘While it doesn’t seem unnatural for the Queen to have an opinion … it was a particularly sensitive phone call telling her that her kingdom was intact. ‘It does seem like Cameron has been terribly indiscreet, as if he was playing up [to] the bigger boys.’ He added: ‘It was very naive not to think there was a chance of the conversation being picked up … given his choice of language, the [description of her] purring and the fact that there is an important constitutional convention here, I have to say it will be the most awkward phone call of his political career.’ In his apology, Mr Cameron said: 'Look, I’m very embarrassed by this. I’m extremely sorry about it. It was a private conversation, but clearly a private conversation that I shouldn’t have had and won’t have again' The royal gaffe is not the first time that David Cameron has put his foot in it. He once let slip that the Queen had teased him about a play in which she is depicted falling asleep at one of their meetings. The Queen assured him it had never happened in real life before adding – after a pause for comic effect – ‘Yet!’. Mr Cameron revealed the joke when he met Andy Harries, one of the producers of The Audience, starring Helen Mirren. Mr Harries told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Mr Cameron told it in a most amusing way.’ In January 2011, the Prime Minister let slip that Prince William had been lobbying against defence cuts. The second-in-line to the throne was angry at plans to close four air-sea rescue bases in a move designed to save millions of pounds. Last December the judge overseeing the fraud trial of Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi’s former personal assistants was forced to tell the jury to ‘ignore’ Mr Cameron after the Prime Minister declared he was a secret fan of the chef. The Prime Minister admitted in an interview in The Spectator – published midway through the trial – that he was a member of #TeamNigella, used by those rooting for the Domestic Goddess in her very public battle with her former husband. And in June this year Mr Cameron was rebuked by the judge presiding over the hacking trial after his comments about Andy Coulson nearly led to the collapse of the remainder of the case against his former spin doctor. Footage emerged on Tuesday showing the Prime Minister laughing and joking with Mr Bloomberg. Although the pair knew they were being filmed, the fact their comments were picked up by microphones appears to have taken them by surprise. Mr Cameron can be heard to say: ‘The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying, “Your Majesty, it is all right, it’s OK.” That was something. That’s relief. She purred down the line.’ By longstanding convention, any discussion between the monarch and their prime minister should remain private, enabling the sovereign to ‘advise, encourage and warn’ with complete confidence. The fact the Prime Minister revealed details of such a sensitive conversation with the Queen simply to make idle chit chat will likely concern and anger her senior aides. Leading up to the referendum, Buckingham Palace stressed the Queen’s neutrality and firm belief that the vote was a matter for the people of Scotland. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Mr Cameron should ‘hang his head in shame’. The former SNP leader, who led the defeated nationalist campaign, gleefully told BBC Scotland: ‘David Cameron has been prime minister for four years and he hasn’t learned basic civility on not gossiping about what Her Majesty the Queen thinks … That’s absolutely pathetic and he should hang his head in shame.’ Labour MP Paul Flynn described Mr Cameron yesterday as a ‘gossiping motormouth’, adding: ‘I think it’s a major blunder … particularly embarrassing because he was speaking about a sensitive and divisive political issue.’ But Professor Robert Hazell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College London said: ‘[Mr Cameron] had not intended his private remark to Bloomberg to become public. He will be embarrassed … but no lasting damage has been done.’ Andy Zaltzman made the remark on Radio 5 Live . The BBC is under fire after a comedian suggested live on air that there should be a referendum on whether the Queen should be beheaded. The tasteless remark by comedian Andy Zaltzman, on Radio 5 Live, follows the beheadings of Western hostages by IS extremists. He was on The Christian O’Connell Manifesto, discussing the independence vote in Scotland, when the guests were asked what else could there be referendums on and Zaltzman suggested a vote on whether the Queen should be beheaded. Listener Becky Robbins said: ‘It was outrageous. It not only shows a complete lack of respect for the Queen but is also insensitive. The timing could not be worse.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘We have received four complaints.’","Prime Minister heard making indiscreet comments about the head of state .

Mr Hunt, who lives in the Scottish Highlands village of  Drumndrochit near Loch Ness, has now accused Police in Scotland of conducting a conspiracy against him. This week, during a civil case at Inverness Sheriff Court, Sheriff David Sutherland ruled Mr Hunt’s human . rights had been breached because the order had never been regularly . reviewed, nor had it been made permanent. He added Mr Hunt’s challenge against the order was 'well-founded'. After the hearing, Mr Hunt said there had been some 'pretty . dark moments' over the years and claimed he had never been involved with . the police before the order was imposed. He added: 'In some ways the last six or seven years have just been a complete blur. Having your name dragged through the mud for this length of time - it has been a nightmare. 'I have been in court on a regular basis and each time it is doing untold damage to my reputation. My wife Kathryn has suffered quite a bit from stress and anxiety. We both have. 'Imagine having the police up at your door every five minutes. It has been ruled as unlawful, unfair and a breach of my human rights and it is time the council removed it.' No laughing matter: The tourist village of Drumndrochit in the Scottish Highlands, where Stuart Hunt has been banned from slow clapping, laughing and staring . Mr Hunt is now hoping the order will be revoked once and for all. The ruling is the latest twist in a saga that began 10 years ago between Mr Hunt and the Lathams over shared access to their homes. Mr Hunt had built speed bumps on their shared driveway claiming the couple were driving too fast. The case went to a civil court and the Lathams, who argued their cars were being damaged, won. Mr Hunt was forced to remove the bumps. The . legal case cost him £200,000 and since then he claims to have spent about £50,000 fighting alleged breaches of his ASBO. Mr Hunt has lodged a fresh complaint with Police Scotland. The force has also been ordered by the Crown Office to investigate allegations made by him that police officers have been involved in a 'criminal conspiracy' by keeping the ASBO in place for so long and . attempting to secure breaches of it to justify its implementation. 'I have serious concerns about a number of police officers,' added Mr Hunt. A Crown Office spokesman confirmed it had received a complaint, but said it would be inappropriate to comment further. Police . Scotland declined to comment on the complaint but said any grievance . would be dealt with through its complaints procedure. Highland Council said it was now considering its position on the matter. The Lathams have remained silent on the order following their successful court case.

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke says Chelsea's criticism of the governing body's judgement in handing Nemanja Matic a two-match ban will not result in a change in the rules. Chelsea said they were 'appalled' by the FA's decision to ban Matic for pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes while taking no action against the Clarets player for his challenge on the Serbian midfielder. Referee Martin Atkinson said he saw Barnes' horror tackle - even though he did not give a foul - meaning the FA could not retrospectively act, drawing fierce criticism from the Barclays Premier League leaders and their manager Jose Mourinho. Greg Dyke has dismissed Jose Mourinho and Chelsea's criticisms of the FA over Nemanja Matic's ban . This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Matic and Mourinho has backed up his player . Blues boss Mourinho claimed the FA 'lose credibility' by making such decisions, but Dyke brushed off Mourinho's barb, saying: 'I don't get involved in the politics that goes on in the game. Managers say all sorts of things either through disappointment or to get tactical advantage. 'I don't take it too seriously. If you think you've got something wrong, you should do something about it, but I don't think you should get involved in the week-to-week politics of football. 'We have seen it before and I have no doubt we will see it again. They followed the rules. Did the referee see the incident? He says yes. He decided not to take action. That's his decision. Therefore we had no part under our existing rules of getting involved with that because the referee had seen it and decided not to take action. Dyke says the furore over the Matic-Barnes incident alone will not lead to the FA changing their rules . Mourinho appeared on Goals on Sunday to discuss what he has described as a 'campaign' against Chelsea . Matic's furious reaction earned him a three-match ban that was later reduced to two games by the FA . 'Are we going to re-look at the rules? Not on the basis of one. Over time? Maybe.' Mourinho, who has complained about a perceived 'campaign' against Chelsea this season, said on Friday ahead of the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham: 'Strong credibility - this is something English football cannot lose. You lose credibility when a player like Matic is suspended, and another player can play this weekend. 'I don't think you can have any doubt that all around the world people open their mouths with surprise at how this can be possible.' Mourinho spoke out again on Friday about how he felt the English game was losing credibility .","Greg Dyke says FA will not change their rules on retrospective action .

Laid by a hen, it is slightly larger than the average egg - and also has a small, twisted tail. But while its odd accessory might make it less appealing to eat, it also has one advantage - it makes the egg far easier to crack. The misshapen food was found by a villager known as Mr Lu at his home in Liyuan village in Shanxi province, which situated along the banks of the Fen River. Mr Lu, who keeps several hens at his house, said he had never seen such a strange egg before - but did not say whether he would be sampling the oddity.

While is not uncommon for birds to produce oddly-shaped eggs, experts cannot agree what causes other animals, such as hens, to lay eggs with tails.

"Astronomers have discovered that Polaris, the north star, is getting brighter. They say the star has suddenly reversed two decades of dimming. It is expanding at more than 100 times the rate they expected - and nobody is sure why. Is Polaris getting brighter? Stars appear to rotate around Polaris, the north star, in this long exposure picture taken near the 4-meter telescope dome at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. The image is composed of 114 30-second exposures of the night sky combined to make the equivalent of a nearly one hour exposure in which the earth's rotation causes the stars to appear to move across the night sky. Polaris, also known as the North Star, Northern Star or Pole Star, is the brightest star in the constellation Ursa Minor. Historically it has been used to guide travellers, and is very close to the north celestial pole, making it the current northern pole star. Recent papers calculate the distance to Polaris at about 434 light-years, although some suggest it may be 30% closer which. A team led by Scott Engle of Villanova University in Pennsylvania recalibrated historic measurements of Polaris by Ptolemy in 137 C.E., the Persian astronomer Al-Sufi in 964 C.E., and others. They investigated the fluctuations of the star over the course of . several years, combing through historical records and utilising the . Hubble Space Telescope. The team found that Polaris is 2.5 times brighter today than in Ptolemy's time, which they say is a remarkable rate of change. 'If they are real, these changes are 100 times larger than predicted by current theories of stellar evolution,' says Villanova astronomer Edward Guinan. The team's data also hint that the star's cyclic 4-day variation in brightness, although still weak, is once again growing more robust--but no one knows what's driving these flutterings or how long they will last. Engle and his team began to . research the star around the beginning of 2000, when they found that the . dropping brightness was on the rise again. Pinpointing Polaris: Researchers say it is getting brighter far more quickly than they expected after reversing its dimming . 'It was unexpected to find,' Engle  told SPACE.com.'It started increasing rather rapidly.' 'Polaris is arguably the best-known star in the Northern Hemisphere, since it lies within a degree of the North Celestial Pole,' the researchers wrote. 'For much of human history, Polaris was highly regarded for its unchanging nature. 'However, we now know that Polaris is a Cepheid variable, undergoing ultra-low-amplitude pulsations. 'Thirty years ago, a paper in the Astrophysical Journal by A. Arellano Ferro announced that the amplitude of these pulsations was diminishing. 'This behavior was confirmed, and it was believed that soon enough Polaris would no longer be a Cepheid variable. Star Trails above Beccles, with Polaris in the centre . 'We started photometrically monitoring Polaris in 1999 and discovered that the amplitude of pulsations had reached a minimum and was now, in fact, growing again. 'It was while gathering historic photometry for the amplitude study that we noticed the published magnitudes of Polaris were systematically fainter, the further back in time the data went. 'This is an entirely unexpected behavior for a Cepheid variable, and one that we wanted to investigate further.

"A bus driver has been named as British most prolific father - after it emerged he has 26 children with nine different women. Michael Redman first became a father aged 21 in 1976, when his first wife gave birth to a baby girl. Since then, his eight subsequent partners have given birth to another  25 children, with his most recent born just last year, it emerged today. Scroll down for video . Michael Redman, pictured with seven of his 26 children this year, is said to be Britain's most prolific father . Mr Redman's first child was born in 1976 and his most recent  was born last year and is now nine months old . He fathered three children in 1988 alone and had two children in 1991 and another pair of youngsters in 1998. The 58-year-old former solider now has 13 sons and 13 daughters, aged from nine months to 38 years old. Redman, who is based at the Guildford bus depot in Surrey, now lives with his current partner and their seven children in the nearby village of Ash. Neighbours  of one of Mr Redman's ex-wives today said he moved out of the former family home about a year ago after his wife discovered how many children he had with other women. The local resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'He was hardly ever home, and now we know why. 'I knew he moved out about a year ago but I didn't know he has since had another child. It is bizarre. It really is shocking. I can't really work out why he has got all these women.' It was reported today that Mr Redman uses his 'charm' to meet women while working as a bus driver . A former partner said she was kept in the dark over the size of his brood, but was shocked when she found out . The Sun reported today that Mr Redman, who has worked as a milkman and a builder, has met some of his lovers while working on the buses. One woman who has children with him told the paper: 'He is charismatic and charming. He tells you what you want to hear. It took me a long time to find out what was really going on.' The woman said she was unaware how many other children he had, but was astonished when she found out. Redman, who neighbours say drives a BMW, recently returned from holiday in Cornwall with his current partner and latest seven children. The family needed two cars to make the journey. 1976 - First daughter born . 1983 - Second daughter born . 1987 - Third daughter born . 1988 - Fourth daughter born . 1989 - Fifth daughter born . 1991 - Sixth daughter born . 1992 - Seventh daughter born . 1995 - Eighth daughter born . 1998 - Ninth daughter born . 1999 - Tenth daughter born . 2008 - Eleventh daughter born . 2009 - Twelfth daughter born . 2013 - Thirteenth and last daughter born . 1977 - First son born . 1986 - Second son born . 1988 - Third son born . 1988 - Fourth son born . 1990 - Fifth son born . 1991 - Sixth son born . 1994 - Seventh son born . 1996 - Eighth son born . 2008- Ninth son born . 2000- Tenth son born . 2001- Eleventh son born . 2002- Twelfth son born . 2004 - Thirteenth and last son born .

Neighbours at his former home said a previous he moved away from a previous wife after the number of children he had fathered emerged . Mr Redman's number of children put him on a par with 12th century monarch Henry I, who is believed to have had 26 children with his wife, Matilda, and various mistresses. Welsh painter Augustus John is often quoted as British most prolific father in history and is said to have had around 100 illegitimate children before his death in 1961. Ismail Ibn Sharif, a 17th and 18th century King of Morocco, is believed to have the most children in history, siring 525 sons and 342 sons, according to records. When approached before starting work this morning, Mr Redman declined to comment. After learning of his large brood, one of his regular passengers said: 'I can't believe it. You wouldn't think of it to look at him - he's not exactly George Clooney is he?' The bus driver has fathered the huge brood with nine women, including seven children with his current partner .

"It may be banned for ordinary people in Iran, but Facebook has at least one member in the country. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appears to have become one of the website's newest members. Despite banning it due to its use by activists to rally government opponents in 2009, a page purporting to be for Khamenei himself launched a few days ago with the name Khamenei.ir. Ayatollah Khamenei has joined Facebook despite banning the rest of Iran from the site due to government opposition in 2009 . The 73-year-old's page displays pictures of him alongside speeches and pronouncements he has made. While there are several other Facebook pages already devoted to Khamenei, the new one - whose number of 'likes' was today close to 10,000 - appeared to be officially authorised, rather than merely the work of admirers. The page has been publicised by a Twitter account of the same name that Iran experts believe is run by Khamenei's office. Both U.S-based social media sites are blocked in Iran by a wide-reaching government censor but they are still commonly used by millions of Iranians who use special software to get around the ban. In 2009, social media were a vital tool for those Iranians who believed the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was rigged. Facebook was used to help organise street protests of a scale not seen since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. The protests - which the government said were fuelled by Iran's foreign enemies - were eventually stamped out by the security forces and their political figureheads remain under house arrest. The cover photo for the supreme leader shows Khamenei being driven through the streets with hundreds of supporters surrounding his vehicle . Another picture shows Khamenei alongside Imam Kohmeini in the first days of Iran's Islamic Revolution movement . Khamenei's Facebook page has so far shared a picture of a young Khamenei alongside the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in the early 1960s. It shares a similar tone, style and content with accounts devoted to disseminating Khamenei's message on Twitter and Instagram and to the website www.khamenei.ir, a sophisticated official website published in 13 languages. Experts said the social media accounts showed that Iran, despite restricting access to such sites inside the country, was keen to use them to spread its world view to a global audience. 'Social media gives the regime leadership another medium of communication, one that can share their message with a younger and far more international demographic,' said Afshon Ostovar, a Middle East analyst at CNA, a U.S.-based research organisation. Iran has yet to comment on whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has joined Facebook or not . Iran is locked in a decade-long dispute with the West over its nuclear programme, which the U.S. and its allies suspect is aimed at developing a bomb, something Iran has repeatedly denied. Iran, the West and regional states are also often opposed on issues such as the violence raging in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Iranian authorities have said they are trying to build a national intranet, something sceptics say is a way to further control Iranians' access to the global web. Tehran tried to block Google Inc.'s email service this year but soon reopened access. Iranian authorities had no immediate comment on the site, which apparently went online last week but only recently gained prominence among social media watchers. Despite the possibility that it is a hoax, the page has generated at least 170 comments - laudatory and derogatory, and nearly all in Farsi - that highlight the deep political divisions in Iran and possibly opposition fervor from expatriate Iranians. One post compared Khamenei to a celebrated ruler of ancient Persia, Cyrus the Great, who significantly expanded the Persian empire 2,500 years ago. Another wrote: 'Mr. Khamenei, how are you visiting this page? With proxy?' It was a reference to Iran's blocking of Facebook and many other Western social media sites, and the efforts to bypass the restrictions using proxy server links from outside Iran. The U.S. State Department said Monday it will keep tabs on the page, but had no comment on whether it was genuine or not. Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland joked that Washington is curious how many 'likes' the Khamenei page receives. But much about the page - including an informal photo of Khamenei riding in a car - suggested it was not sanctioned by Iran's top leader. It is also highly unlikely that Khamenei would endorse a banned outlet such as Facebook. The Net is not unknown territory for Iranian leaders, however. Khamenei, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and others have official websites. Also, some senior Iranian clerics issue religious opinions by email.","facebook.com/Khamenei.ir launched a few days ago and has huge following .

"More than a million voters in swing states are being sent an anti-Obama documentary that claims the President's mother once posed for pornographic photos wearing bondage gear. The shocking - and totally unfounded - claims made in the DVD represent a new low in the election dirty tricks war today provoking fury among Democrats and likely to trigger outrage in the White House. 'Dreams From My Real Father', made by a right-wing film-maker who is a long-time critic of Obama,  includes images of a woman it claims is the President's mother Ann Dunham clad in leather gloves, boots and a corset posing seductively on a couch. The film also alleges that Mr Obama's . real father is left wing poet poet and Communist party activist Frank . Marshall Davis, and that Ms Dunham's marriage was a 'sham' to cover this . up. Scroll down for video . Accusations: An outrageous video is alleging that President Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, starred in pornographic photo shoots and that his real father is really Communist activist Frank Marshall Davis (right) Porn star: 'Dreams From My Real Father' the DVD includes images of a woman its maker says is Ann Dunham, clad in leather gloves, boots and a corset posing seductively on a couch . The extraordinary claims are the latest twist in the debunked 'birther' conspiracy which has raised questions over Mr Obama's past. But they could have serious . consequences as more than one million copies have been mailed to voters . in Ohio, a key swing state where Mitt Romney is lagging in the polls. Some . 100,000 copies have also been sent to voters in Nevada and the same . number to New Hampshire - with up to three million more still to come. It has even won the support of Alabama's . Republican Party chairman Bill Armistead who has said: 'That (the film) is absolutely frightening. I've seen it. I verified that it is factual, . all of it. People can determine.' Argument: Tea Party members are suspected to be behind the funding of the DVD made by Joel Gilbert and research that went into the website . But Democrat consultant Steve Murphy said today: 'It's about the lowest thing you can do to accuse, with no evidence, the opposition candidate's mother of being a porn star. 'There are two motives behind this - racism and money. It's a cynical attempt to make some coin and exploit the views of the fringes of mainstream views.' 'Dreams From My Real Father' claims that the President's family history is an elaborate lie. The . real story is that his mother's marriage to Barack Obama Sr was a sham . to cover up her affair with Mr Davis, who Mr Obama has referred to as . his 'mentor'. Mr Davis supposedly photographed Ms . Dunham whilst she was pregnant with Mr Obama and sold the photos to . 1950s magazines with titles like 'Bizarre Life',  'Exotique', and . 'Secret Pleasures'. Claims: A website for the DVD entitled, Dreams from My Real Father, compares photographs of a young Mr Davis with Barack Obama's high school photographs presenting them as similar . Like father like son? Mr Gilbert's DVD claims that Ann Dunham's marriage to Barack Obama Sr is a 'sham' to cover up her affair with Mr Davis (right) In one the woman - there is no proof . offered that she is Ms Dunham - is posing wearing the corset, gaudy . earrings and a large necklace with her hair cut short. In another photo she sits on a couch staring into the camera and in the other she is putting on an elbow length black leather glove. In a third she is reclining on the . couch with her buttocks clearly visible and in others she is naked apart . from a pair of high heels. In . the film, a narrator who is supposed to be Mr Obama says: 'These photos . were taken a few weeks before 1960, when mom was about five weeks . pregnant with me. 'Frank then sold the photos to men's mail-order catalogues.' Obama's real mother: 100,000 copies of the video directed by Joe Gilbert were mailed to voters in Ohio claiming that Ann Dunham (front, right)) is not the virtuous woman Mr Obama purports her to be . The film also claims that Mr Obama’s grandfather was not a furniture salesman but actually a CIA agent. The 'Barack Obama' narrator says: 'My election was not a sudden political phenomenon. 'It was the culmination of . an American socialist movement that my real father, Frank Marshall . Davis, nurtured in Chicago and Hawaii, and has been quietly infiltrating . the US economy, universities, and media for decades.' The case: Mr Gilbert has not revealed who funded the video Dreams from My Real Father . According . to the film Mr Obama made regular visits to Mr Davis from the age of 10 . where he was 'indoctrinated in Marxism during his formative years'. The movie's director Joel Gilbert said . the documentary was the result of two years of research but he is . already facing allegations it is a dirty tricks campaign. Speaking to MailOnline Mr Gilbert . claimed that he matched up Ms Dunham to the pornographic pictures by . comparing them to her high school photographs at the time. He and 'other researchers' made the connection but he did not employ a photography expert. Mr Gilbert said: 'Her teeth matched, her nose matched, everything matched. It's obvious. 'People don’t want to hear this because there is a mass hysteria around President Obama. 'Nobody wants to hear about the gap between what he says and what he wants to do.' Mr Gilbert also declined to discuss who had paid for the film and would only reveal it was 'privately funded'. There is already speculation that Tea . Party groups may have been behind it. Mr Gilbert has been unapologetic about his film and said that he investigated the President because he thought he had a 'passion for class struggle that did not fit with his background'. He has said that he turned up 'convincing evidence that Ann Dunham had an intimate relationship with Mr Davis' including '30 photos of her in various compromising states of nudity'. Mr Gilbert said: 'Right away I could see that Davis has a striking resemblance to Obama while the Kenyan Obama looked nothing like him. Target: Since he took office in 2008, Mr Obama has been at the centre of many right wing theories about his background and nationality including one that suggested he might be an alien . 'Davis was not only the biological father of Barack Obama but also the ideological father. 'I've . concluded that the people who were asking: ""Where's the birth . certificate?"" were asking the wrong question. The real question: ""Who's . the father?""' In his . memoirs Mr Obama has written how his mother, who was from Wichita, . Kansas, met his Kenyan-born father whilst they were both studying . Russian at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. They married in February 1961 but in August of that year she moved to Seattle to study at the University of Washington. Reputation: Joel Gilbert is a Los Angeles based filmmaker known for his rabble-rousing style with films like 'Atomic Jihad: Ahmadinejad's Coming War for Islamic Revival and Obama's Politics of Defeat' Mr Obama was born on August 4 in Honolulu before she left. His long form birth certificate lists a 25-year-old student called 'Barack Hussein Obama' as his dad, referring to his father. Mr Obama Sr is said to have finished . his economics degree in Hawaii then studied at Harvard before moving . back to Kenya in 1964, the year he and Ms Dunham divorced. In a separate development the . director of the anti-Obama film 2016, which has become a surprise box . office hit, has made lurid claims similar to Mr Gilbert's about Ms . Dunham in his book: 'Obama’s America'. In . the book, which reached no.1 on the New York Times bestseller list, . Dinesh D'Souza alleges that she sent her son to Hawaii just so she could . cheat on his father with Indonesian men. According . to extracts of the book on the Daily Beast: 'Ann's sexual adventuring . may seem a little surprising in view of the fact that she was a large . woman who kept getting larger. 'Learning about Ann's sexual adventures . in Indonesia, I realized how wrong I had been to consider Barack Obama . Sr. the playboy … Ann … was the real playgirl, and despite all her . reservations about power, she was using her American background and . economic and social power to purchase the romantic attention of . third-world men.' Since taking office Mr Obama has been the subject of a number of bizarre claims about his past. Right wing bloggers have claimed that the 'scar' on his head was evidence he had undergone some kind of secret surgery. They suggested it could be anything from a routine procedure to the work of extra-terrestrials. The birther movement, which was championed by real estate mogul Donald Trump, said that as the President was not from Hawaii it meant he was not eligible to be in the White House. When Mr Obama released the long form of his birth certificate the issue finally went away. The issue of Mr Obama’s religion is another point of attack and despite publicly proclaiming his Christian beliefs, some still believe he is a Muslim.

"Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois is expected to start for Belgium against Andorra – just five days after suffering a head injury against Arsenal. The 22-year-old stopper joined up with his international team-mates on Thursday – three days later than the rest of the squad – after he was substituted following a clash with Alexis Sanchez on Sunday. And after coming through a Thursday night training session unscathed he will start in Brussels, subject to further neurological tests on Friday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cech issues Chelsea threat . Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois arrives at the Belgium team hotel ahead of the game with Andorra . Courtois suffered a heavy blow when he came out to challenge Alexis Sanchez but played on for a while . Chelsea allowed their new No 1 to answer his country’s call after he was passed medically fit, but reports in Belgium suggest they would prefer for him to be rested with Courtois still suffering from a minor headache. The young keeper had already claimed to be feeling better and is now expected to start against Andorra, although Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet will deputise if there are problems with tests on Friday. Belgium manager Marc Wilmots told his Thursday press conference: ‘I do not understand the discussion on Courtois. ‘If he is fit and wants to play, he will. If not, then it will be Mignolet. I will decide after training.’ Courtois took part in some light exercises at Chelsea’s Cobham training base this week and is keen to add to his 22 international caps. Even if they do hold concerns over the young ‘keeper’s condition, Chelsea are unable to prevent Wilmots from selecting him for Friday’s Euro 2016 Group B qualifying clash – or Monday’s trip to face Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sanchez immediately shows concern for Courtois as the keeper appeared badly hurt on the pitch . The Belgian is escorted up the tunnel and was immediately treated by paramedics in the dressing room .

"An anonymous letter sent to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in which he is called a ‘filthy abnormal animal’ and urged to kill himself has been made public for the first time in its unredacted form . An anonymous letter sent to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in which he is called a ‘filthy abnormal animal’ and urged to kill himself has been made public for the first time in its unredacted form. The letter, written in 1964 by an FBI deputy posing as a disillusioned civil rights activist, was an attempt by J Edgar Hoover to unsettle the civil rights leader just days before he received the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. A heavily censored version of the ‘suicide letter’ has been published before, but a Yale University historian recently unearthed an unredacted copy. Beverly Gage was researching a book about Hoover in the National Archive when she accidentally came across the letter. ‘I was surprised to find a full, uncensored version of the letter tucked away in a reprocessed set of his official and confidential files at the National Archives,’ she told the New York Times. Former FBI director Hoover feared King so much that he had classified him as 'the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country'. With his agents desperately searching for something they could use to destroy King, the only thing they could find was about his extramarital affairs. When Hoover learned that King would be the recipient of the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, he stepped up his attack, instructing his agents to send King the anonymous note in which they threatened to divulge details about his affairs if he didn't take his own life. Scroll down to the letter in full . Former FBI director Hoover left, feared King so much that he had classified him as 'the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country', while the original letter was recently uncovered by Yale University historian Beverly Gage, right . The typewritten note, featuring misspellings and deliberately poor grammar, was written by an agent called William Sullivan. It was accompanied by a cassette recording containing evidence of King’s now well documented extramarital liaisons, which the FBI had obtained by wiretapping his homes and hotel rooms. 'King, look into your heart. You know you are a complete fraud and a great liability to all of us Negroes,' the nasty note reads. In a previously redacted part of the letter, Sullivan is especially vicious in his criticism of Dr. King. 'Lend your sexually psychotic ear to the enclosure. 'You will find yourself in all your dirt, filth, evil and moronic talk exposed on the record for all time … . Civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. receives the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo in December 1964 . 'You will find on the record for all time your filthy, dirty, evil companions, male and females giving expression with you to your hidious [sic] abnormalities. 'It is all there on the record, your sexual orgies. Listen to yourself you filthy, abnormal animal. 'You are on the record. You have been on the record – all your adulterous acts, your sexual orgies extending far into the past. This one is but a tiny sample. 'You will understand this. Yes, from your various evil playmates on the east coast to [name redacted] and others on the west coast and outside the country, you are on the record. King you are done.' It concludes by urging King to take his own life within 34 days – thought to be a reference to a date on which he was due to collect the Nobel Peace Prize in Sweden. King left for Norway before the letter arrived and it was left to his wife Coretta, center, to open it . 'There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy, abnormal fraudulent self is bared to the nation.' King left for Norway before the letter arrived and it was left to his wife Coretta to open it. When King showed the letter to his advisers, they agreed that it was clearly the work of the FBI and a blatant attempt to blackmail him into taking his own life. 'One oddity of Hoover’s campaign against King is that it mostly flopped, and the FBI never succeeded in seriously damaging King’s public image,' write Gage in the Times. 'Half a century later, we look upon King as a model of moral courage and human dignity. Hoover, by contrast, has become almost universally reviled. 'In this context, perhaps the most surprising aspect of their story is not what the FBI attempted, but what it failed to do.'

"Thousands of rabbits on a tiny Scottish island are to be culled to stop them destroying it with their furious burrowing. The final straw came after the rabbits' burrowing even caused a major landslide in Canna, closing a road for days, and needing specialist machinery and workmen to be sent from the mainland. They have also been digging up human remains in a graveyard, islanders' gardens, bringing down walls and damaging important archaeological sides. Canna's rabbit problem has boomed since rats were eradicated from the island . Now the isle's owners, the National Trust for Scotland, are going out to tender to 'drastically' reduce Canna's estimated 16,000 rabbits in what will be one of the biggest such culls. The way the animals are killed will be up to the contractor but must be humane. It is likely to include live trapping and gassing. The problem is so great on Canna that after a previous cull a couple of years ago the population was brought down to around 2,000. But without too many natural predators they have simply bred. There are now more than 1,000 rabbits for every person on the Inner Hebridean island which has a human population of just 12. While Canna, 23 miles out in the Atlantic, may have problems attracting people, it has no such difficulty with rabbits. The island is so plagued by the creatures that they recently caused a huge landslide which blocked the main track to Tarbert . The island is so plagued by the creatures that they recently caused a huge landslide which blocked the main track to Tarbert. A digger had to be hired over from the mainland to clear about 100 tonne of soil and stones off the road so it could be used again. 'The rabbits are the worst I've known them in my 51 years here,' said islander Winnie Mackinnon. 'They are digging up the graveyard and there dragging out the bones. It is sad to see. They are everywhere - causing stone walls to collapse by burrowing under the foundations as well as damaging our archaeological sites. 'Something has to be done - they are . basically eating away the island. A lot of rabbit pie is being eaten but . you cannot keep up with them. 'The . sea eagles feed on them but it does not stop the rabbits increasing. Something has to be done to control them and urgently.' Canna's rabbit problem has boomed since rats were eradicated from the island. The rabbit problem is so great on Canna that after a previous cull a couple of years ago the population was brought down to around 2,000 . After spending £600,000 and bringing specialist trappers from over 11,000 miles away, the last rat was seen on the tiny Hebridean island of Canna seven years ago. But now islanders are complaining that the rodent's disappearance has led to a new plague - rabbits. Residents say that thousands of rabbits have invaded the island because there are no rats to keep their numbers down. The low-lying, crescent-shaped island . lying just to the south of Skye had previously been famous for its more . welcome settlers: Iron Age farmers, early Christian monks and the . influential Gaelic folklorists John Lorne Campbell and Margaret Fay Shaw . - who lived in the island's main iconic building Canna House. Canna once supported a population of more than 400 people in 1821. Now it faces a fight for its survival. Over the last two years 20 residents - five sevenths of the population - have left. There are no children on the island now. The islands of Canna and Sanday were gifted to the NTS in 1981 by John Lorne Campbell. 'We recognise the rabbits are a major problem. Estimates suggest the rabbit population is now around the 16,000 mark,' admitted a spokeswoman for NTS. 'We recognise that the population has reached a particularly high level and are causing serious problems. That is why we have decided to act. 'We are about to go out to tender for a contractor to undertake control work on the island imminently, with the hope that much of this could be carried out before the end of the year. 'The overall plan is to get the population down to manageable and sustainable levels. The cull will reduce the population drastically. We cannot disclose the cost at this stage but it will amount to thousands of pounds.' Conservationists hope that important breeding bird species on the island, including puffins, razorbills, European shags, Manx shearwater and northern fulmars, will start recovering. Milder winters brought on by climate change are also thought to have led to perfect breeding conditions for rabbits - and especially with no rats predators around anymore. John Brady, chief executive of . Edinburgh-based charity One Kind said: 'We believe that culling wild . animals because their behaviour is inconvenient or causing a nuisance is . a vastly disproportionate response and we would urge the NTS to . consider non-lethal and humane management techniques as an alternative . to the proposed cull.'","Canna's estimated 16,000 rabbits will be 'drastically reduced'

"Chris Robshaw led his England team-mates through their final preparations for the top-of-the-table RBS 6 Nations clash with Ireland on the Aviva Stadium pitch on Saturday morning. The England skipper took charge of the captain's run as the unbeaten red rose side completed their last session before Sunday's 4pm showdown between the competition's two unbeaten sides. England surprised Wales at the Millennium Stadium with a 21-16 win in the first round of fixtures before seeing off Italy at Twickenham - and head coach Stuart Lancaster wants his side to draw inspiration from the win in Cardiff on what will be another atmospheric occasion in Dublin.

Robshaw took charge of the session and was out issuing instructions as part of the captain's run . The England team warm-up in the surroundings of the Aviva Stadium that will be packed come Sunday . Sunday's match is the biggest of the 2015 Championship but Robshaw and Lancaster both know that if England finish as victors they will have a clear sight of the title with home games against Scotland and France remaining, and a potential Grand Slam. Ireland start as marginal  favourites but England, who have recalled wing Jack Nowell and full-back Alex Goode, will draw on their victory at the Millennium Stadium for inspiration. 'Dublin is similar to Cardiff. History tells you it's a very difficult place to go and win,' Lancaster said.

There was plenty of catching practice at the Aviva for George Ford (left) and Alex Goode (right) Head coach Stuart Lancaster looks on from a distance, hoping that England can match their win over Wales . 'Sometimes when you're playing against Irish teams you feel like you're playing against 16 or 17 because of the energy that they bring. It will be as difficult a game as we've had in a long time.' England turned around a 16-8 half-time deficit at the Millennium in January and Lancaster hopes they can replicate the second-half showing on Sunday. 'It would be nice to repeat what we did in Cardiff, especially the second half,' he said. 'One of the keys to that night was that we had a strong sense of belief we could win there, but the players still needed to deliver and they did that.

'Belief has to be built on some sort of foundation and the foundations laid in the last two weeks with wins against Wales and Italy have been excellent. 'That's why it's such a fascinating game because Ireland have been in the same position. I'd be very surprised if either team weren't ready for this game.

"Meditation: Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams says he is inspired by Buddhism and spends 40 minutes a day meditating to clear his mind for prayer . The former Archbishop of Canterbury has admitted he is inspired by Buddhism and spends 40 minutes a day meditating. Lord Williams completes the intense early morning ritual to help him clear his mind for prayer. The former Archbishop disclosed in an interview with the New Statesman how he contemplated becoming a monk in his youth, as well as joining the Orthodox church. The article delves into the power of religious ritual and he explains he draws daily inspiration from meditation and reciting the ‘Jesus Prayer’. He repeatedly recites the words ‘Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me, a sinner’ whilst controlling his breathing. He said: ‘Over the years increasing exposure to and engagement with the Buddhist world in particular has made me aware of practices not unlike the ‘Jesus Prayer’ and introduced me to disciplines that further enforce the stillness and physical focus that the prayer entails. ‘Walking meditation, pacing very slowly and coordinating each step with an out-breath, is something I have found increasingly important as a preparation for a longer time of silence. ‘So: the regular ritual to begin the day when I’m in the house is a matter of an early rise and a brief walking meditation or sometimes a few slow prostrations, before squatting for 30 or 40 minutes (a low stool to support the thighs and reduce the weight on the lower legs) with the ‘Jesus Prayer’: repeating (usually silently) the words as I breathe out, leaving a moment between repetitions to notice the beating of the heart, which will slow down steadily over the period.’ Lord Williams explained that the routine helps him focus and detach himself from ‘distracted, wandering images and thoughts’ and he pictures the human body as a ‘cave’ through which breath passes. He added: ‘If you want to speak theologically about it, it’s a time when you are aware of your body as simply a place where life happens and where, therefore, God ‘happens’: a life lived in you.’ White robes: Lord Williams also donned white robes and became a druid in 2002 during a celebration of Welsh culture . Criticism: The Archbishop was criticised as the Gorsedd of Bards ceremony was seen by some as too close to paganism for comfort . He went on to explain that those who perform such meditation rituals regularly could reach ‘advanced states’ and become aware of an ‘unbroken inner light’. Lord Williams also donned white robes and became a druid in 2002 during a celebration of Welsh culture. The Gorsedd of Bards comprises Welsh-speaking poets, writers, musicians, artists and others who have made a distinguished contribution to Welsh language and culture. But the Archbishop was criticised as the ceremony was seen by some as too close to paganism for comfort.","Lord Williams says he is inspired by Buddhism and meditates every morning .

"A never-before-seen video shows the moment Barack Obama reunited with his half-brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo after two decades apart. Ndesandjo, who shares the same father as the president, decided to surprise his half-brother right before a debate with Hillary Clinton in the lead up to the 2008 elections. The half-brothers had met on only one prior occasion, when Obama visited his father's family in Kenya in 1988. The video obtained by Inside Edition shows candidate Obama entering the room, seeing his brother and looking extremely surprised. Scroll down for video . Shocked: President Obama saw his brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo for the first time in 20 years before a debate with Hillary Clinton in 2008 . Surprised: Ndesandjo showed up out of the blue, flying from his home in China to Texas for the debate . 'How are you? Good to see you,' Obama says as he goes up to hug his brother and slap him on the back. 'How you been man?' 'It was amazing,' Ndesandjo recalled of the reunion. 'We just laughed and we hugged each other and we were brothers.' President Obama is Ndesandjo's older half-brother. Their father, Barack Obama Sr, married Ndesanjo's mother Ruth Baker a few months after divorcing the president's mother, Ann Dunham. Closer now: Ndesandjo and his wife post with the president in this undated photo from 2013 . The home video was released as Ndesandjo works to publicize his new autobiography, Cultures: My Odyssey of Self-Discovery, which gives a shocking new perspective on the president's father. While the president didn't grow up with his father, Ndesandjo and his mother moved with Obama Sr back to Kenya where he spent his childhood. Different lives: While the president grew up without his father, Ndesandjo and his mother Ruth Baker moved to Kenya with Barack Obama Sr. On the left, a young Barack Obama with his father on his one visit to Hawaii in the 1970s. On the  right, Obama Sr and Ndesandjo's mother Ruth Baker . Lost touch: Before their reunion in 2008, President Obama and his half-brother had met only once before - on his 1988 trip to Kenya. Above, the future president poses with family members on that trip . In his book he remembers his father as abusive and a violent alcoholic. 'I remember seeing my mother on the floor on one occasion with a knife to her throat,' he said. He says he left his bedroom door open most night and would hear his father come home to beat up his mother and the scent of Johnny Walker Black Label on his breath. In 1973, Ruth Baker divorced Obama Sr and remarried another Kenyan man and Ndesandjo took his step-father's last name. Barack Obama Sr died in a car accident in Nairobi, Kenya in 1982 at the age of 46. Despite his troubled childhood, Ndesandjo went on to study at Brown, got his Masters from Stanford and an MBA from Emory. Big move: Ndesandjo moved to China in 2002 and is now married to a Chinese woman and speaks the language fluently . In 2002 he moved to Shenzen, China 'looking for a new life' and seems to have found it, marrying a Chinese woman and learning the language. While his new book may reveal some embarrassing details of the elder Obama's life, Ndesandjo doesn't believe it will spark any animosity from his powerful half-brother. 'He said to me before he became a politician, 'Mark, go live your life and don't worry about me,' and that's what I'm doing,' Ndesandjo said.","President Obama met his half-brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo for the first time in 1988 on a visit to Kenya .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin could be about to offer missile systems and a second nuclear reactor to Iran by renewing an old deal. The offer will reportedly be put to President Hassan Rowhani, the new Iranian premier, when the two meet for the first time on Friday. If it goes ahead Iran will be supplied with five advanced S-300 surface-to-air missiles, capable of taking down aircraft or guided missiles, valued at $800million (£500million). Five S-300 missile systems, capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles, could be supplied to Iran . A Kremlin source said that the offer could be made when Putin meets Iran's new President Hassan Rowhani for the first time on Friday . The deal, revealed by a Kremlin source to Russia's Kommersant newspaper, would include Russia building a second reactor at Iran's only nuclear plant in Bushehr. The source told Kommersant that Russia's offer would depend on Iran's withdrawing a $4billion lawsuit that it has lodged at an international court in Geneva against Russia's arms export agency. Also speaking in Kommersant, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Putin and Rowhani were expected to discuss 'working together in the nuclear energy sphere' and 'questions of military technical cooperation' at the summit in Bishkek. The renewed deal will anger both America and Israel who forced Russia to drop it in 2010 . The move will anger America and Israel who, in 2010, forced Russia's then-President Dimitry Medvedev to cancel the arms deal following heavy diplomatic pressure. Russia risks straining relations with the US having just assuaged America over the Syrian crisis following a tense meeting at the G20 summit in Moscow. Iran is a staunch ally of Syria and President Bashar Al Assad and has taken its diplomatic lead from Russia during the crisis in calling for a halt to talk of military action and insisting on a diplomatic solution. However, Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quods fighting unit, has said that Iran would support Syria 'until the end' in the face of military action. Russia will also expect international condemnation if it starts construction on a second nuclear reactor at Bushehr. A second nuclear reactor could be built in Iran if the deal goes ahead . Iran's only working nuclear facility was completed by Russia and began operating in 2011 after a series of setbacks and sabotages, most notably the American Stuxnet virus which was thought to have shut it down for several months. Despite repeated assurances from Tehran that the facility is only for peaceful power generation, Western countries remain deeply sceptical.","Renewed 2010 deal could see five missiles worth $800million sold to Iran .

Valcke described the decision to bring in video technology as the 'biggest ever' and it won't be rushed . Football Association chairman Greg Dyke had been keen to push forward live trials but other delegates were more cautious which means it will be at least another year before the go-ahead can be given.

While the reception was generally good, Welsh FA chief executive Jonathan Ford said: 'We shouldn’t as IFAB just allow experiments to be conducted willy-nilly.' However, a move to change the 'triple punishment' has been agreed in principle, so that a player who is sent off for a straight red card for denying a goal-scoring chance when conceding a penalty is no longer suspended for the following match.

"A growing digital lynch mob of Twitter users is calling for street justice against George Zimmerman and advocating he be murdered since his release from jail on $150,000 bail early this morning. Some have even threatened to kill the neighborhood watch volunteer themselves. The public menace against Zimmerman is not new. His family said he has received 'thousands' of death threats since he shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin February 26 in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. For this reason he was promptly whisked away to a secret location after he walked out of jail. He has been in hiding ever since the shooting, which erupted into a racially-charged national controversy. The threats come as his lawyer says he regrets letting Zimmerman take the stand Friday to apologize for Trayvon's death and said he wouldn't have done it, had he known the teen's parents wouldn't have taken it well. Scroll down for video . Threats: Dozens of profane Tweets threatened George Zimmerman flooded Twitter after the neighborhood watch volunteer was released from jail . Sprung: George Zimmerman is now in hiding after his release from jail in Seminole County, Florida, after he posted bail . The vitriol on Twitter became dozens . of violent threats ever since a judge agreed Friday to set Zimmerman's . bail at $150,000. Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in . the killing, but was not deemed a flight risk. Twitchy, . a right-leaning blog that tracks Twitter traffic, published several of . the threats. Many were since taken down, but more continue to pour in. A user named Jordan Irving wrote: 'They let this n**** Zimmerman out of jail?! Somebody kill this dude already!' Another, called Uncle Phil, said: 'I say kill Zimmerman b****.' Chatia said: 'someone pass me a gun, imma go follow zimmerman, shoot and kill him and say #imstandingmyground.' 'They done let Zimmerman free lets kill that MF,' Louis David Jr wrote. 'If I go kill zimmerman how much time will I get?or will they let me out on bond?' Kenish. According to Twitchy, a user called Taylor said: 'Ima kill zimmerman myself *loads semi* where he at.' Twitter's policy says such comments . are against its policy: 'Violence and Threats: You may not publish or . post direct, specific threats of violence against others.' This compilation of tweets, compiled by Mail Online, shows just a few of the vitriolic messages sent out after Zimmerman was let out of jail . Out: Zimmerman was wearing a brown jacket and . blue jeans and carrying a paper bag. It's not known where he will stay . until his trial in the murder of Trayvon Martin . Meanwhile, Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, told This Morning on CBS that he regrets letting his client apologize for killing Trayvon during his bond hearing. Trayvon's parents did not respond well to the apology. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump said: 'The apology was somewhat of a surprise because we had told them this was not the appropriate time, but they just disregarded that, and he went and pandered to the court and the media and gave a very insincere apology.' O'Mara said, in retrospect, the apology was a mistake. 'To be honest, had I known that... I'm not sure that we would have done it at the bond hearing, because the purpose of it truly was to get to the family and to respond directly to the family's request.,' he said. 'Had I known or been told that that wasn't the time, it wouldn't have happened. So, I apologize for that.' Ride: Zimmerman met a man in a white BMW and drove away from the jail to an unknown location . he extraordinary step to speak out at the court hearing Friday saying: 'I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son. I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit younger than I am, and I did not know if he was armed or not.' Zimmerman was led out of Seminole County Jail shortly after midnight Sunday and driven away to a secret location. Seminole . County Circuit Court Judge Kenneth Lester determined last week that . Zimmerman is not a risk to the community, despite being charged with . second-degree murder in the death of the unarmed teen in February. Zimmerman was granted bond of $150,000 on Thursday, much less than the $1 million asked for by the state of Florida. Shortly after midnight Sunday, he . was seen leaving the jail wearing a brown jacket and blue jeans and . carrying a paper bag. He met a man in a white BMW and drove away. His ultimate destination is being kept secret for his safety and it could be outside Florida. Judge . Lester said at a hearing Friday he cannot have any guns and must . observe a 7pm-to-6am curfew. Zimmerman also surrendered his passport. Zimmerman had to put up 10 per cent, or $15,000, to make bail. His father had indicated he might take out a second mortgage. Walking out: Zimmerman's ultimate destination is being kept secret for his safety and it is very likely outside of Florida . Zimmerman worked at a mortgage risk-management company at the time of the shooting and his wife is in nursing school. A website was set up to collect donations for Zimmerman's defense fund. It is unclear how much has been raised. Bail is not unheard of in second-degree murder cases, and legal experts had predicted it would be granted for Zimmerman because of his ties to the community, because he turned himself in after he was charged last week, and because he has never been convicted of a serious crime. Speaking at his bail hearing, Zimmerman, 28, apologised to Trayvon's parents, coming face-to-face . with the victim's family for the first time. He said: ‘I am sorry for . the loss of your son… I did not know if he was armed or not.’ Addressing Trayvon Martin's family directly Zimmerman said: 'I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit older than I was'. The 28-year-old is charged with second degree murder for the February 26 killing of the 17-year-old. Getting situated: George Zimmerman took to the witness stand for the first time on Friday . While on the stand, the prosecution . asked why Zimmerman waited so long to contact Martin’s parents. Zimmerman said he was told not to by his own lawyer. ‘I . was told not to communicate,’ he said. Zimmerman sat stiffly while . testifying, keeping his expression blank and blinking frequently. Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester set several conditions Friday for Zimmerman's release. He cannot have any firearms, drink alcohol or use drugs and must observe a curfew. He will also have a GPS monitoring device. He was questioned for about five minutes before the judge dismissed him from the stand. Zimmerman's case may have improved slightly with the release of a new photograph, showing the back of Zimmerman's bleeding head following the incident. The photo, obtained and released exclusively by ABC News, shows blood trickling from the crown of Zimmerman's head. ABC News notes that the blood is likely coming from two gashes. The police report from the night of February 26 also noted that Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose. However, Zimmerman was not sent to the hospital, nor did he receive stitches. Rather, he was treated by paramedics and brought in for questioning. Zimmerman, who has not spoken publicly since the shooting, told police that he spotted Martin as he was patrolling his neighbourhood and called 911 to report a suspicious person. 'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his sport utility vehicle. He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes.'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman said on a 911 call. Possible evidence? ABC News exclusively obtained this photo of George Zimmerman's bloodied head, three minutes after he killed Martin . But Trayvon was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother. A neighbour said there had been several break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in which burglars took a TV and laptops. A dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown reasons - got out. Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his sport utility vehicle when he was suddenly attacked. He claims he shot the teen in self-defence.

"A grandmother has finally reached her ideal weight at the age of 77 - after a diet lasting 50 years. Brenda Boxall started slimming in her late 20s after her weight ballooned to 20 stone. She vowed to shed the pounds after seeing a picture of herself in the early 1960s and thinking she looked like a 'big blob'.

Heartbroken, she says she turned to bread, pastries and cakes and consumed more than 7,000 calories a day. Mrs Boxall said: 'I would eat anything that would come my way - lots of carbohydrates including a lot of bread and crisps. 'When . I was at my biggest I wore clothes which were like tents.

"President Barack Obama is set to brief the media and make one final pre-vacation push for his signature health insurance overhaul, just hours after his Department of Health and Human Services took a giant step toward obliterating the 'individual mandate' that is holding Obamacare together. HHS said Thursday night that nearly 500,000 people who have lost their medical insurance under the Affordable Care Act would qualify for a 'hardship exemption' to the individual mandate, allowing them to buy the same low-cost, bare-bones 'catastrophic' coverage plans that were previously available only for Americans under 30 years of age. News reports have projected the number of canceled policies as closer to 15 million, but Obama administration officials insisted that number was greatly exaggerated. Insurers automatically renewed most of those plans or otherwise found them 'grandfathered,' they said, while not directly acknowledging that those renewals came at a much higher cost. The nearly half-million Americans with hardship exemptions, however, will now have an extra year to find traditional coverage – a status that other Americans will envy, Republicans will blast and insurers already dread. Undertow: Obama is set to leave for his Hawaiian vacation on Friday night -- seen here on last year's holiday -- and is trying to provide his health care law a needed pressure valve before the new year . 'This latest rule change could cause significant instability in the marketplace and lead to further confusion and disruption for consumers,' said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry's main trade association. Ignagni's members worry that allowing so many Americans to shift away from the gold, silver and bronze plans, and into cheaper catastrophic coverage, will upset a carefully balanced system that planned premiums in advance – possibly resulting in cost hikes for everyone else in the market. Republicans quickly complained that if the individual mandate has already failed hundreds of thousands of Americans, the Obamacare law in general is unsustainable. 'The administration is recognizing the grim reality that more Americans have lost health insurance than gained it under Obamacare,' Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio said Thursday night. 'Holding a fire sale of cheap insurance is not a responsible fix for a broken program. This is a slap in the face to the thousands of Americans who have already purchased expensive insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.' Tennessee Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn noted that in a recent hearing, 'we asked Secretary Sebelius point-blank what would be the next ""holiday surprise,"" and she was silent.' 'Yet, here we are with another major policy shift. The sad reality is that when the law takes effect come January 1, more Americans will be without coverage under Obamacare than one year ago.' A group of six left-leaning senators, however, are patting themselves on the back for a job well done in suggesting a politically feasible way out for the White House. Fire sale: Sen. Rubio lashed out at the administration for cheapening the 'universal' coverage aspect of the Affordable Care Act with a last-minute loophole . Democrats Mark Warner, Jeanne Shaheen, Mary Landrieu, Heidi Heitkamp and Tim Kaine, and the nominally independent Angus King wrote to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Thursday, specifically asking her to carve out the exemption. The six all face criticism in their home states, where their liberal politics put them at odds with more conservative red-state majorities. 'We are pleased that the administration appears to have responded to the concerns we’ve raised,' they said in a joint statement.  'As a result, this clarifies an option that will help those consumers who have had their plans canceled transition more smoothly into the marketplace.' Consumers who have received dreaded cancellation letters from their health insurers and can't afford higher-priced plans, Sebelius wrote to them, 'should qualify for this temporary hardship exemption and I can assure you that the exemption will be available to them.' 'In addition to their . existing options,' she explained, 'these individuals will also be able to buy a . catastrophic plan to smooth their transition to coverage through the . Marketplace.' Left holding the bag: HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will have to contend with a new and less-than-improved policy that covers a small number of Americans while possibly raising costs for the rest . Americans taking advantage of the new hardship exemption will have to prove their eligibility by showing that their plans were canceled in 2013. But the bigger picture will find the GOP, and even some liberal Obamacare defenders, arguing that offering exemption after exemption undermines the universal-coverage mandate that once upon a time made everyone subject to the same set of rules. Hardship exemptions were already available to Americans who satisfied any of a host of conditions, including homelessness, expenses caring for sick family members, a death in the family, eviction or foreclosure, or domestic violence. Americans claiming the domestic violence exemption are unique in that they are not expected to provide any documentation to support their claim. The new exemption criteria requires that 'you received a notice saying that your current health insurance plan is being cancelled,and you consider the other plans available unaffordable.'","New loophole will let Americans with cancelled policies apply for bare-bones coverage previously available only to under-30s .
White House says fewer than 500,000 people are left on the sidelines after their insurance was found to be insufficient to satisfy Obamacare .

"Lionel Messi wasn't at his best for Barcelona last season because he 'ate more pizza than he should have' according to sporting director Carles Rexach. The four-time Ballon d'Or winner did not enjoy his best season at Barcelona last year, ending the campaign trophyless and with a haul of 36 goals in 39 games for the Catalan club - his lowest since 2008-09. And now Barca's new sporting director Carles Rexach has hinted that the relative lack of form came from a poor diet, claiming that Messi was eating too much pizza to perform at his best. Lionel Messi's form dipped last season as he was eating too much pizza, says Barcelona's sporting director . Carles Rexach told Regio7 that Messi 'ate more pizza than he should have' during a trophyless campaign . Messi's goal output was the worst it had been since 2008-09 and he failed to win the Ballon d'Or again . 'Before, he ate at the club and rested after,' Rexach said. 'But I think last year Messi ate more pizza than he should have.' Earlier this season the post-match meal preferences of Messi and his team-mates was revealed by by Spanish newspaper Libertad Digital who leaked a copy of the club's menu sheet before their draw against Malaga in September. And the Argentine superstar opted for a Sprite to wash down his cheese pizza after struggling to inspire his side in the 0-0 draw on the Costa del Sol. Messi looks back to his best with Barca second in the league, and he was great against Manchester City . Messi was shown to have ordered a cheese pizza and a Sprite on this Barcelona menu from September . Rexach, who played for Barca between 1967-1981 and was later a coach before being appointed as sporting director this month, also spoke about manager Luis Enrique's early struggles after he reportedly fell out with Messi. 'Luis Enrique  started with too many rules, whoever doesn't train doesn't play,' Rexach told Catalan paper Regio7. said. 'Let's see what happens when Messi doesn't train and you need him.' Rexach's bizarre outburst also saw him reveal that Tito Vilanova and Pep Guardiola were both offered jobs by Manchester United and Manchester City, while he criticised some young players at the club. Speaking of Barcelona youngster Gerard Deulofeu, who spent last season on loan at Everton, Rexach said: 'Deulofeu is good, but maybe he believes it a little too much,' while on midfielder Sergi Roberto he said: 'He plays, but you don't notice him. It's like he doesn't want to get stuck in. And now the same has started to happen with (Ivan) Rakitic.' Luis Enrique started with too many rules which caused unrest at Barca, said to sporting director Rexach .","Lionel Messi endured a trophyless campaign with Barcelona last season .

"The best way to preserve broccoli's cancer-fighting properties is to steam it for up to five minutes . Most people would probably admit they eat broccoli more for its health-giving properties than for its flavour. But new research shows that people who don't cook it in the right way could be wasting their time. Scientists found broccoli loses its cancer-fighting properties when it is boiled or microwaved. The researchers, who presented their findings at the American Institute for Cancer Research Annual Research Conference, found the best way to cook the vegetable is to steam it for three to four minutes. They say steaming it until it turns a bright green colour can enhance its cancer-fighting compounds. Broccoli is an excellent source of sulforaphane, a naturally occurring plant compound that has been shown to be protective against cancer. The enzyme myrosinase in broccoli is needed for sulforaphane to form - so if the myrosinase is destroyed, sulforaphane cannot form. The researchers found boiling and microwaving broccoli, even for just one minute, destroys most of the myrosinase it contains. In contrast, they also discovered that steaming it for up to five minutes is the best way to retain the enzyme. ‘Past food processing has tended to focus on improving taste, visuals and microbiological safety,’ said Dr Elizabeth Jeffery, a researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ‘Now our task is to go further. Processing can ensure that the bioactives – the cancer protective compounds – arrive in your digestive system in a form the body can use.’ Dr Jeffery also discovered that boiled or microwaved broccoli can still produce sulforaphane if it is eaten with other raw foods that contain myrosinase. Dr Jeffery asked participants to eat a broccoli supplement with no active myrosinase. When some participants then ate another item of food which did contain myrosinase, their blood and urine levels of sulforaphane were significantly higher than those who did not eat the second food. ‘Mustard, radish, arugula, wasabi and other uncooked cruciferous vegetables, such as coleslaw, all contain myrosinase, and we’ve seen this can restore the formation of sulforaphane,’ Dr Jeffery said. Microwaving or boiling broccoli destroys the enzyme myrosinase which is vital for the production of the cancer-fighting compound sulforaphane . This is not the first study to show that the way in which food is prepared can impact how protective it is against cancer. Previous research has shown that crushing or chopping garlic and then waiting 10 to 15 minutes before exposing it to heat allows its inactive compounds to convert into the active, protective phytochemical allicin. It has also revealed that cooking tomatoes and other foods that contain lycopene allows the body to more easily absorb the phytochemical. ‘As we’re learning, food processing isn’t just what happens to food before it reach the grocery shelves,’ said American Institute of Cancer Research Associate Director of Nutrition Programmes Alice Bender. ‘This research highlights that what you do in your kitchen can make those fruits and vegetables on your plate even more cancer protective.’","Broccoli is a source of sulforaphane which is protective against cancer .

"Nasa has found a unique planet which wobbles on its axis - causing weather conditions to be even more erratic than those on Earth. Astronomers were stunned to find the planet, designated Kepler-413b wobbles wildly on its spin axis, much like a child's top. The tilt of the planet's spin axis can vary by as much as 30 degrees over 11 years, leading to rapid and erratic changes in seasons. Kepler-413b wobbles wildly on its spin axis, much like a child's top. The tilt of the planet's spin axis can vary by as much as 30 degrees over 11 years, leading to rapid and erratic changes in seasons. This illustration shows the unusual orbit of planet Kepler-413b around a close pair of orange and red dwarf stars. Kepler 413-b is located 2,300 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. It circles a close pair of orange and red dwarf stars every 66 days. The next transit visible from Earth's point of view is not predicted to occur until 2020, because the orbit moves up and down, a result of the wobbling, in such a great degree that it sometimes does not transit the stars as viewed from Earth. 'Imagine living on a planet with seasons so erratic you would hardly know whether to wear Bermuda shorts or a heavy overcoat,' Nasa said. In contrast, Earth's rotational precession is 23.5 degrees over 26,000 years. Researchers are amazed that this far-off planet is precessing on a human timescale. Kepler 413-b is located 2,300 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. It circles a close pair of orange and red dwarf stars every 66 days. The planet's orbit around the binary stars appears to wobble, too, because the plane of its orbit is tilted 2.5 degrees with respect to the plane of the star pair's orbit. As seen from Earth, the wobbling orbit moves up and down continuously. Kepler finds planets by noticing the dimming of a star or stars when a planet transits, or travels in front of them. This is the space telescope Kepler's field of view, superimposed on the night sky so that the main stars are visible. In its four-year history, Kepler has confirmed 132 planets, and found 2,700 new ones. Some of the discoveries may harbour life . Astronomers using Kepler discovered the wobbling when they found an unusual pattern of transiting for Kepler-413b. 'Looking at the Kepler data over the course of 1,500 days, we saw three transits in the first 180 days -- one transit every 66 days -- then we had 800 days with no transits at all. 'After that, we saw five more transits in a row,' said Veselin Kostov, the principal investigator on the observation. The next transit visible from Earth's point of view is not predicted to occur until 2020, because the orbit moves up and down, a result of the wobbling, in such a great degree that it sometimes does not transit the stars as viewed from Earth. Astronomers are still trying to explain why this planet is out of alignment with its stars. The Kepler space telescope orbits around the Sun, 40 million miles from Earth. It is named after 17th Century astronomer Johannes Kepler. It was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets. During that time it has confirmed 132 planets and spotted more than 2,700 potential ones. In December 2011, Kepler found a new Earth-sized planet orbiting a star just 352 light years away. It was found lurking in the Kepler star field and was named Kepler-21b. Its parent star, the HD 179070, is so close it can be viewed with a home telescope. Kepler is a space observatory launched by Nasa to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. Data from Kepler could help humans find alien life . However, Nasa scientists said there’s very little chance of it hosting life because the surface is a  1627C (2960F). Kepler's mission was supposed to be over by now, but last year NASA agreed to keep Kepler running through 2016 at a cost of about £13 million ($20 million) a year. According to Nasa scientists, there is, what's dubbed, a 'Goldilocks Zone' in space where the temperature is not too hot, or too cold, for water to exist in liquid form. Any planets found in this zone could have life on them. If Kepler is retired, Nasa scientists believe the search for other lives on planets could be severely hindered. There could be other planetary bodies in the system that tilted the orbit. Or, it could be that a third star nearby that is a visual companion may actually be gravitationally bound to the system and exerting an influence. 'Presumably there are planets out there like this one that we're not seeing because we're in the unfavorable period,' said Peter McCullough, a team member with the Space Telescope Science Institute and Johns Hopkins University. 'And that's one of the things that Veselin is researching: Is there a silent majority of things that we're not seeing?' Even with its changing seasons, Kepler-413b is too warm for life as we know it. Because it orbits so close to the stars, its temperatures are too high for liquid water to exist, making it inhabitable. It also is a super Neptune - a giant gas planet with a mass about 65 times that of Earth -- so there is no surface on which to stand.","Unique planet discovered by Nasa's Kepler telescope wobbles on its axis .

"Internet fame isn't all it's cracked up to be, as 16-year-old Alex Lee from small town Frisco, Texas learned in the past two weeks. The high-schooler known across social media as 'Alex from Target' went from just 144 Twitter followers to more than 730,000 after a picture of him working a shift at the store surfaced online. That photo generated a popular meme and now 'Alex from Target' is searched more on Google than pop sensation Justin Bieber. Like any teenager, Alex is enjoying the newfound attention but admits it also has its downfalls. He's bombarded like a celebrity anytime he goes out of his house, which has left his parents frightened for his safety at school and work. They say he's even received death threats. Scroll down for video . Insta-fame: Alex Lee of Frisco, Texas became an online sensation two weeks ago when a picture of him working at Target surfaced online and went viral. He is now known simple as 'Alex from Target' Alex was working a shift at his local SuperTarget on November when fame hit him out of nowhere. 'It was just a normal day,' Alex told the New York Times in his second interview, after appearing on the Ellen Show last week. Somehow a picture of him scanning and bagging items at his cash register surfaced online, and a teenage girl in Britain posted it on her Twitter account with the caption 'YOOOOOOOOOOO.' The picture quickly went viral, generating the hastag  #alexfromtarget, and suddenly his Sunday shift got a whole lot busier. That afternoon, his line started getting longer and longer and young girls were taking pictures of him while he was ringing up their purchases. Then his manager Molly  came up to show him his picture on Twitter. He was transferred to the stock room for the rest of the today because the attention got so out of hand. Alex's picture allegedly first surfaced on Tumblr, but went viral worldwide when a teen in Britain posted this pic to her Twitter. Alex says he first started noticing something was up during a shift at Target, when his line got unusually long and girls started approaching him to take pictures . By the time he clocked out that evening, Alex turned on his phone and was greeted with a slough of text messages from friends about his internet celebrity. At that point he had amassed a fandom of 100,000 followers on Twitter. Confused, he tweeted 'Am I famous now?' While Alex has adjusted to the internet fame well, and is more than happy to pose for selfies with locals in his town, the attention can be overwhelming sometimes. Like the night last week that he went to a burger joint with his father after school and had to run out of the restaurant, chased by a throng of female fans. 'I’ve been in the house the entire time,' he said. 'I’m kind of scared to go in public.' His newfound celebrity has also exposed him to unwarranted criticism. Alex says he's received negative comments on Twitter from users calling him 'damn ugly' or undeserving of his fame. He's also had his life threatened, and his girlfriend Lindsey has become the target of jealous comments. Alex's only TV appearance was on the Ellen Show last week. He says he has received death threats since the photo went viral . 'Alex from target, I'll find you and I will kill you,' one private message read. Alex says he was bullied in elementary school, so knows how to ignore 'the hate' but the comments have left his parents genuinely worried about his safety. Parents Eric and Marci Fooks also say that their personal information has been leaked online including Social Security numbers, bank accounts and phone records, leading them to contact the police. The family are now consulting with John Shahibi, the founder of Shots, a selfie-sharing app, to help Alex deal with his fame. Shahidi also works with Justin Bieber. 'The family is only concerned with doing something positive with this opportunity,' Mr Shahidi said.","Alex Lee, 16, from Texas became an online celebrity last week after a photo surfaced online of him bagging goods during a shift at Target ."
"In airline travel, less is apparently more, at least when it comes to cost and customer satisfaction. Low-fare and budget airlines like JetBlue and Southwest, which centre their advertising around affordability, ranked higher in customer satisfaction than their large-network competitors. Meanwhile, customer satisfaction for major airlines hit significant turbulence, with most major airlines falling several points from the year before. Diversion: A JetBlue flight from New York to San Diego had to be diverted after a woman took exception to another passenger's 'free' seat upgrade . Journey: The plane was able to continue its journey to San Diego after the woman was reportedly removed by the authorities . Unhappy fliers: The pollsters ranked U.S. Airways lowest, at 614 out of 1,000 possible points . The annual survey, conducted by J.D. Power and Associates, polled almost 14,000 passengers and asked them to rank their experiences on major North American carriers from May 2011 to April 2012. The poll ranks all airlines – discount and network – on a 1,000-point scale, based on satisfaction with categories such as cost and fees, boarding and deplaning, the politeness of the flight crew, check-in and reservation, and baggage. JetBlue, the top ranked of the low-fare airlines, rose three points from last year’s ranking to 754. JetBlue: 776 - up 3 points . Southwest: 770 - up 1 point . WestJet: 733 - up 4 points . AirTran: 698 - up 8 points . Frontier: 694 - up 6 points . Alaska: 680 - down 2 points . Delta: 650 - up 9 points . American: 647 - down 9 points . United: 625 - down 15 points . US Airways: 614 - down 11 points . 'We are honoured and humbled to be ranked highest among low cost carriers by the traveling public, and to receive this highly-respected and sought-after industry accolade for the eighth consecutive year,' Dave Barger, president and CEO of JetBlue Airways, said in a statement. Meanwhile, Alaska Airlines ranked the top for network carriers, at 680 points, down from two in 2011’s ratings. As the Wall Street Journal notes, all five budget carriers (JetBlue, Southwest, WestJet, AirTran, and Frontier) improved their standing from the past year, while all major network carriers save Delta fell by several points. Fasten seat belts: Airlines were ranked by ease of boarding, cost and fees, and customer service, among other things . Service with a smile: Many respondents said they preferred checking in with their cell phone; the least-preferred method was at the airline kiosk . J.D. Power’s vice president of global travel and hospitality Stuart Greif said around half of the point differences between budget airlines and network carriers came down to money – their price points and fees. ‘Part of the gap is due to cost and fees, whether it’s a matter of the base fares being a bit lower,’ he said, adding that airlines like JetBlue, Southwest, and WestJet do not charge for the first checked bag. In an era where many airlines are now charging for what was once industry standards – including free checked luggage and airplane snacks – customers showed a deep appreciation for these services. United Airlines just announced its plan to charge $100 for the second piece of luggage checked on some international flights. Notably, it dropped an alarming 15 points from last year to 625. Southern hospitality: Southwest Airlines ranked second overall in budget carriers with an 'outstanding' staff experience . Mr . Greif told msnbc.com: ‘On average, charging for the first checked bag . results in a satisfaction score that’s 85 points lower vs. not charging . for it.’ He called the decline in network carries somewhat ironic, in that it was a moderately good year for the airline industry. He . said that network airlines could take a leaf out of the budget . airline’s book on policies like hospitality and no fees for checked . bags.","J.D. Power and Associates polled 13,500 fliers on satisfaction with flying experience, using boarding, fees, and booking as qualifiers .
Out of budget carriers, JetBlue ranked highest with 754/1000 points .

"80% of Britons are too tired to kiss their partner goodnight at bedtime . 90% do not say 'I love you' before drifting to sleep . 46% turn their back on their partners as soon as they get in to bed . But it is sleeping positions that really reveal what is going on in relationships . What happens in your bedroom when the lights go out? If a new survey is to be believed, the answer is not much. As a nation we are becoming a loveless lot, turning our backs on our partners as soon as we settle down, not bothering to kiss each other good night or say I love you and in 25 per cent of cases hoping that our partners don't even touch us as we try and drift to sleep. But despite our efforts to ward off intimacy as we are trying to fall asleep, psychologists say it is the positions we take up when actually deep in sleep that reveal how we really feel about each other. The positions we sleep in can say a lot about our relationships: The Liberty - back to back but not touching - shows a couple feels connected whilst independent enough to sleep separately . During sleep, you cannot fake your body language, this is . the time when you are honest and vulnerable and your sleeping position . can therefore reveal a lot about your relationship. Relationship psychologist Corrine Sweet and the Travelodge hotel group have investigated what Britons’ sleeping positions say about their . relationship. Sweet said: 'Couples fall into habitual ways of . sleeping together that suits their personalities and personal . preferences. 'These are negotiated at the outset, so if something . changes in how they sleep together, this can reflect a change in their . relationship and cause concern for the other partner.' The Cherish - back to back but touching - means a couple are comfortable, intimate and relaxed with each other . Spoons - male with the female on the inside - this is a traditional position in which the male takes the lead and protects his lover . Pillow Talk - face to face - this position represents an intimate need for one-to-one contact and conversation in bed . Lovers Knot or Lovers - face to face with legs intertwined - if couples separate after 10 minutes it demonstrates a loving independence, if legs intertwined all night it means you cannot bear to be separated . She added: 'Individual . psychological states also affect how we sleep and the positions we . sleep in, so if we are stressed we may be irritable, and not want to . snuggle up with our partner. Arguments often lead to sleeping wide . apart, as people feel loathe to touch.' 'Inevitably, once the first flush of lust wears off, with couples naked . and entwined, it is more likely that the need for a good night's sleep . predominates, so sleeping back to back becomes a favourable position in . bed.' The research highlighted a new trend . for sleeping apart. Nowadays one in 10 couples admits to sleeping . separately from their partner in the quest for a good night’s sleep. Alarmingly a quarter of couples in their sexual prime age (35 and above) are considering sleeping in separate beds. Couples . not in favour of having their own bed are still vying for more space . between the sheets with more than half now opting for a King Size bed . and over a quarter considering an upgrade from their standard double. 1. LIBERTY: Back to back but not touching (28%)This couple feel . connected whilst independent enough to sleep separately. They are used . to each other and accept each other’s sleeping habits. 2. CHERISH: Back to back but touching (18%) This couple are comfortable, intimate and relaxed with each other. A popular position in a new relationship. 3. SPOONS (MALE):  Male spoons with the female on the inside (13%)This . is a traditional position, in which the male takes the lead and . protects his lover. Couples sleep side-by-side each curled up with each . other in the foetal position. Traditional spooning is the most common . position adopted by couples during the first few years of their . relationship or marriage. It shows both a strong sexuality and feeling . of security in the relationship . 4. PILLOW TALK: Face to face (7%) This position represents an intimate need for one-to-one contact and conversation in bed. 5. LOVERS KNOT: Face to face, legs intertwined for 10 minutes then couples separate to sleep (8%) This . position demonstrates a loving independence, it’s a sign of intimacy, . love and sexual activity - even though the couple separate and sleep . apart. 6. SPOONS (FEMALE): Spoons with the female on the outside (5%) In this position the female takes the lead and protects her man while he is sleeping. 7. THE LOVERS: Face to face with legs intertwined all night (4%) This . is love’s young dream position where you cannot bear to be separated as . each moment together counts. A position for the born romantics. 8. THE ROMANTIC: Woman lying with head and arm on man’s chest (1%)This . is the popular Hollywood movie bed scene position. An intimate pose . much favoured in a new relationship or after love making. It represents . new / rekindled love. 9. SUPERWOMAN: Woman lying in star fish position with man hanging off the bed (1%) The woman rules the bed in this position, she likes her space and the man takes a secondary role and lets her take it. 10. SUPERMAN: Man lying in star fish position with woman hanging off the bed (1%) In this position the male is king of the bed, he likes to have his way and the female is happy to oblige. The sleep behaviour report also found that one in four couples constantly argues in bed because they are kept awake by their partners sleeping habits. The survey also revealed that more than half of people questioned said they felt their sex life was better if they ‘cuddled-up’ more. More men at 67% responded that their sex life was better if they cuddled more during the night. 34% of men said that it annoyed them if their partner did not cuddle them in bed in comparison to 26% of women. Experts have stated longevity of a marriage is enhanced when couples fall asleep and wake up at the same time. Couples who go to sleep together and get up at the same time are content in their relationship. Over half of adults can tell if their partner is cheating on them by the way they sleep. Nearly two thirds of women are more vigilant under the duvet and can detect if their other half is playing away by his bedroom antics. Nearly one in 10 men have made the cardinal sin and called their wife or girlfriend the wrong name in bed. Spoons - with the female on the outside - in this position the female takes the lead and protects her man while he is sleeping . The Romantic - woman lying with head and arm on man's chest - this is the popular Hollywood movie bed scene position. An intimate pose much favoured in a new relationship or after love making . Superwoman - woman lying in star fish position with man hanging off the bed - the woman rules the bed in this position, she likes her space and the man takes a secondary role and lets her take it .

"Last week, Theresa May was pictured sporting sassy knee-high boots and a rather eye-catching coat that could hardly be described as conservative. The Home Secretary took further sartorial steps at her party's conference earlier this month where she turned heads in a £1,190 Vivienne Westwood tartan suit, leading to comparisons being drawn between her and Cara Delevingne, who wore the exact same look a few months earlier. But the 57-year-old MP has laughed off similarities between herself and the 21-year-old supermodel, who she describes as one of the most 'beautiful' women in the world.

"Boris Johnson yesterday called on George Osborne to ‘junk talk of austerity’ and pump more money into big spending projects amid fears the economy could be heading towards a triple dip recession. The plea from one of the Tory Party’s most prominent figures came after bleak figures from the Office for National Statistics showed output fell 0.3 per cent between October and December. This weaker than expected performance left City experts predicting an unprecedented triple dip recession, while others said the downturn is now worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s. Scroll down for video . Call: Boris Johnson, right,  yesterday called on George Osborne, left, to ‘junk talk of austerity’ and pump more money into big spending projects amid fears the economy could be heading towards a triple dip recession . In a very public challenge to . mainstream Conservative policy, London mayor Mr Johnson warned that the . ‘hair-shirt’ agenda set by the Chancellor and gloomy remarks from the . Bank of England threaten hopes of a recovery. And in a sign of coalition tensions . over the flatlining economy, Nick Clegg made clear the Liberal Democrats . will demand higher capital spending on infrastructure projects in the . next public spending review – a shot across Mr Osborne’s bows. The Office for National Statistics said the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last three months of 2012, which meant there was no growth overall last year . Construction grew by 0.3 per cent, but not enough to make up for sharp drops in the last year . IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said the Budget in March would be a good time to slow the pace of austerity . The slump rounded off the worst four-year period for the British economy, excluding the aftermath of war, since the 1830s. It is feared it could be followed by . another quarter of decline at the start of this year, which would mean . Britain was in recession again. The ONS report said that the British . economy did not grow at all in 2012 and has now shrunk for four of the . last five quarters, with the only growth coming between July and . September when output rose 0.9 per cent with the help of the Olympics. The economy is still 3.3 per cent . below its pre-crisis peak in 2008 and fears are mounting that Britain . will be stripped of its coveted AAA credit rating as tax receipts . dwindle and debts soar. Addressing British business leaders . at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Johnson called for a change of . tack from the Government. ‘We need to junk talk of austerity . and recognise that the single biggest inhibitor of demand is lack of . confidence, and that if only some of the people in this room would . invest some of the cash in their balance sheets we would see that . confidence rewarded in a virtuous circle,’ he said. He attacked the downbeat rhetoric . emerging from both the Treasury and the Bank of England and alluded to . the painful age of austerity overseen by post war Labour Chancellor Sir . Richard Stafford Cripps. The sharp drop in output was caused mostly by contraction in production, wiping out a small rise in construction . ‘I don’t think austerity is a . terribly useful concept in this sort of climate,’ he said. ‘The hair . shirt stuff, the Stafford Cripps agenda, that is not the way to get . Britain motoring again.’ Mr Johnson said he backed the . Chancellor’s plans to cut the deficit but said more cuts would need to . be found to invest in housing and infrastructure. Mr Clegg warned that ‘there is some . way to go before the recovery really takes root’ and conceded that it . would be ‘a long, painstaking job before the British economy fully . recovers’. A day earlier he admitted in an . interview that the Government should not have cut capital spending so . much when it first came to power. Aides said he is not challenging the . Chancellor’s overall levels of government spending. But they said he . will argue for even more capital expenditure on infrastructure projects . in the next spending round. ‘This is a priority for us,’ one said. But speaking in Davos yesterday, Mr . Osborne insisted he would not change course. ‘We have a reminder today . that Britain faces a very difficult economic situation,’ he said. ‘A reminder that last year was . particularly difficult, that we face problems at home because of the . debts built up over many years and problems abroad with the eurozone, . where we export most of our products, in recession.’","Office for National Statistics announces negative growth for final quarter of last year .

"World Cup fans heading to Rio de Janeiro might want to think twice about swimming in the sea - as these shocking photos reveal the true extent of its sewage problems. More than 400,000 tourists are expected to descend on Brazil's 'Marvellous City' next month, but they might want to avoid the ocean. Local photographer Eliseu Cavalcante snapped the destination's waterways - which are pumped with human excrement. Raw sewage: Eliseu Cavalcante's photos show the extent of the sanitation problem in Rio where human excrement is pumped into the sea. A mixture of cyanobacteria and sewage flow off the coast of Barra Beach . Warnings: Raw sewage flows onto Sao Conrado Beach - an upmarket area but where it's unsafe to swim due to the sanitation problems . Only 40 per cent of sewage is treated in Rio - and the rest ends up in its rivers, lagoons and bays. And as these images show, it also ends up floating around on and near the beaches where tourists will be flocking. Cavalcante told website Rio Gringa that she wanted to raise the issue of sanitation at a time when more foreigners are paying attention to Brazil. Health concerns: Biologist Mario Moscatelli has been doing flyovers of Rio¿s waterways since the late 1990s to document the city's environmental degradation . Health warning: Tires and sewage float in Guanabara Bay near Rio¿s international port . According to Global Post, the government plans to clean up the usually picturesque Guanabara Bay - where up to 100 tonnes of rubbish are dumped every day - ahead of the 2016 Summer Olympics - especially because of the water events involved. Mario Moscatelli, a biologist who's been monitoring Rio’s waterways for decades, said more than £595m had been spent trying to clean up the bay in the past 20 years, but the situation has worsened. 'Not in my worst nightmares would I have imagined that the Brazilian authorities would have done this with the environment,' he said. A contaminated lagoon in Rio's Barra has different colours due to sediment, sewage flows, and the resulting cyanobacteria - some of which are toxic . Unsafe for swimming: A sunbather sits on the beach near Rio's Niteroi as trash and sewage float by . Rio's famed 'City of God' slum shows raw sewage is part of life . According to the city government's environment agency, 12 locations along beaches in Zona Sul — the most popular area for tourists - are unsafe for swimming due to the poor water quality. Dr Daniel Becker, founder of the nonprofit Center for Health Promotion in Rio, said: 'In Rio, if you're going to the beach, you're going to sewage.' He said exposure to raw sewage can cause illnesses such as diarrhoea and microbial diseases. In April, the state government said it was cutting the Olympic clean-up budget from $1bn to £51m, according to Global Post.","Only 40% of sewage is treated in Rio - with rest pumped into waterways .

"Fearful: After the bombings, Tsarnaev's mom says he laughed off her concerns, but later called to say he and his brother were being chased by police . Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev took time during his final moments to phone his mother as he engaged in a furious gun battle with police early on Friday morning, it has emerged. 'The police, they have started shooting at us, they are chasing us,' Tsarnaev told his mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva. At the time he was hurling pressure cooker bombs at officers in the suburb of Watertown as he and his brothers fired more than 200 rounds. Then, finally, before hanging up Tsarnaev said: 'Mama, I love you.' When he ran out of bullets, police say he charged at police, before officers tackeld him and he was finally run over by his brother Dzhokar. Days earlier, reports The Wall Street Journal, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva had called her son after the bombings, concerned about his safety. Shockingly, he'd merely shrugged off her concern. 'Mama,' laughed Tsarnaeva, 'why are you worrying?' This was not, however, the first time the young man dealt in troubling telephone calls. Zubeidat . and her husband Anzor Tsarnaev have claimed that their oldest son . received a call from the FBI accusing him of the attack, to which he . responded: 'That's your problem.' Tamerlan Tsarnaeva, . who was killed following a shoot out with the police on April 19, . called his mother two or three days after the marathon bombings to tell . her about the call from the FBI, his father said. Scroll down for video . Family: Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev have also said their son claimed the FBI called him to accuse him of the bombings . The claims, reported by Channel 4 News, reveal how Tsarnaeva, . 26, believed that the FBI was watching him. His mother previously said . he had been followed by the FBI for five years. Channel 4 News suggested that, while it was unlikely the FBI had called the suspect to accuse him of the heinous crime, it was perhaps his way of preparing his parents for the news of his involvement. While it seems unlikely, if the claim is true, it raises questions over how the FBI handled the case. The agency has already come under fire for reportedly failing to stop the brothers before they planted two bombs at the finish line of the marathon. It has emerged that Russian authorities alerted the FBI about their concerns over Tsarnaeva's links after he was spotted speaking to an Islamic militant six times at a mosque in Dagestan last year. Hiding out: Anzor Tsarnaev, the father of the bombers, said his son claimed the FBI were on to him . Now his parents are planning to visit the U.S. to see their surviving son, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found hiding in a boat following his older brother's death. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told ABC World News in a tearful phone interview that she fears her son will receive the death penalty. ‘I lost two sons,’ she said through tears over the phone. ‘My family is in the dirt.’ The grieving mother did not say when she and her husband, Anzor Tsarnaev, plan to travel to the U.S. She . told an ABC reporter based in southern Russia that she fears she will . be unable to do so, despite her having an American passport, because she . is now the parent of a suspected terrorist. Home: The parents of the Tsarnaeva brothers live in Dagestan, pictured, and hope to travel to the U.S. The couple spent the day hiding from the crowd of journalist that flooded their neighborhood in the remote Russian region of Dagestan, according to ABC News. Neighbors who did speak to the press said the Tsarneav family had no noticeable ties to Islamic fundamentalism or terrorist factions. One neighbor said that there was no fanaticism among the family members living there and that the father was not too religious. In her phone call with ABC News reporter . Kirit Radia, Tsarnaeva reiterated the wild claims her husband has made . in previous interviews that their two sons were framed by the U.S. government. Grieving mother: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of the two Boston bombing suspects has said that she and her husband, Anzor Tsarnaev, plan to take a trip to the U.S. to visit their surviving son . 'No Islamic ties': Neighbors who spoke to the press said the Tsarneav family had no noticeable ties to Islamic fundamentalism or terrorist factions . She said her oldest son Tamerlan, 26, was investigated two years ago by the FBI only because ‘he loved Islam’ and that he ‘didn't do anything bad.’ The FBI said in a statement released Friday that it had investigated Tamerlan Tsarnaeva in 2011 at the request of a foreign government. The FBI did not reveal which country’s government that was. ‘The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups,’ the FBI statement said. The FBI said that in response to the request the bureau culled through its databases and interviewed both Tamerlan Tsarnaeva and members of his family, but were unable to find any evidence that he was connected to a terrorist organization. Caught: The parents hope to visit their youngest son in the U.S., who was wounded and arrested on Friday .

"Elliot Rodger was trying to act out . the role of a film star when he went on his killing spree – to make up . for the fact he felt like a failure in real life. Clearly he did not . feel he had the status he deserved. In his last YouTube video, which he explicitly filmed to leave a legacy, he casts himself as a movie star. In . another of his clips he appears to reference the film American Psycho, . and it might be that he has taken the main character, Patrick Bateman, . as a role model. American Psycho follows anti-hero Patrick Bateman, the son of a US banker, who mutilates and kills prostitutes after having sex with them . Bateman, played by Christian Bale, is a successful Wall Street banker who picks up women and then butchers them after sex. The irony is that Bale’s character is both sexually successful and a killer. 'If you feel as if the whole world is against you, it makes it easier to start attacking random individuals' But . for Rodger, his sexual frustration was the driving force behind the . anger. However, both share deep feelings of sexual desire for women and . aggression towards them. There . are parallels between Rodger and the Columbine High School killers Eric . Harris and Dylan Klebold, who fantasised about the idea that Steven . Spielberg would make a movie about their lives. Some . might think that because his father worked as an assistant director on . The Hunger Games, which involves teens killing teens, that could have . planted a seed in him to go on the rampage. But I think his father’s success in Hollywood is more relevant, as it may have heightened his own feelings of inadequacy. Rodger . is the classic rampage killer: young, male, isolated and sexually . frustrated. And he appeared to have a pronounced victim mentality. In his video he says things such as: ‘You forced me to suffer all my life and now I’ll make you all suffer.’ He blamed his suffering on others, and therefore felt his violence was righteous. It was a disturbed reality. 'The irony is that Bale's character is both sexually successful and a killer. But for Rodger, his sexual frustration was the driving force behind the anger' He felt he was a victim of all of humanity. I think he was suicidal, and intended to kill himself after the shooting. If . you feel as if the whole world is against you, it makes it easier to . start attacking random individuals – and then kill yourself.

"Iran has issued a stark warning to the West vowing that response to any hostile action will be 'regretful but destructive'. As tensions over its disputed nuclear programme continue to rise General Masoud Jazayeri, spokesman for Iran's Joint Armed Forces Staff, said: 'We will rigorously confront any . threat or hostile behaviour, and our response will be definitely . regretful and destructive. 'We hope this (kind of behaviour) would not . take place, but if it happens then the history will remember whether the . Americans or the Iranians were bluffing.' The General's words came as Iran claimed it had produced 'intelligent' laser-guided artillery shells which can spot and hit moving targets with very high degrees of precision. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Claims: Iran has produced 'intelligent' laser-guided artillery shells (pictured) which can spot and hit moving targets with very high degrees of precision . Defence Minister Ahmad Vahidi hailed . what he described as 'intelligent munitions' as a new chapter in the . country's weapons and military equipment. 'Besides America and Russia, there are only three other countries which have this technology,' he said. Tension between Iran and the West have been escalating over the past few weeks over whether Iran is harbouring nuclear weapons. The unveiling of the missiles came amid this stark warning from the Iranian military which vowed to 'rigorously confront any threat or hostile action' The missile, unveiled on Iranian television, have been described as a new chapter in the country's weapons and military equipment . Today, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi offered to extend the current visit of U.N. nuclear weapons inspectors and said he was optimistic their findings would help ease tensions. The three day visit by the Atomic Energy Agency team began on Sunday and followed reports in November that suggested some of the Islamic Republic's alleged experiments were focused on developing nuclear weapons. Salehi said he was 'optimistic about the results of . the visit' without offering more details and he also told Turkish state . television that the U.N. mission could be 'extended if necessary'. Suspicions: Technicians work at the reactor building at Bushehr nuclear power plant, 750 miles south of Tehran . The findings could . greatly influence Western efforts to expand economic pressures on Iran . over its uranium enrichment - which Washington and allies fear could . eventually produce weapons-grade material. Iran has declined to abandon . its enrichment labs, but claims it seeks to fuel reactors only for . energy and medical research. The inspectors are likely  to visit an underground enrichment site . near Qom, 80 miles south of Tehran, which is carved . into a mountain as protection from possible airstrikes. Security: A satellite image of Lavizan Shiyan - a restricted area in Tehran - which was completely dismantled after it was suspected of harbouring missile equipment . Earlier this . month, Iran said it had begun enrichment work at the site, which is far . smaller than the country's main uranium labs but is reported to have . more advanced equipment. The IAEA team also wants to talk to key . Iranian scientists suspected of working on a weapons program. The team . also plans to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure . commitments from Iranian authorities to allow future visits. Oil prices have been driven higher in . recent weeks by Iran's warnings that it could block the Strait of Hormuz . at the mouth of the Gulf, the route for about one-fifth of the world's . oil.

"Middle class families earning more than £50,000 a year will get up to £1,000 a year to pay for childcare – half what was originally planned. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has revealed the ‘squeezed middle’ will benefit from a coalition overhaul of childcare as well as parents lower down the income scale. But the Mail has learned the plans to give parents tax breaks will now be delayed for another two months because the £1.4billion costs will have to be paid for through measures in the Budget, due on March 20. Extra help with the huge cost of nurseries and childminders is to be extended to struggling middle class families . In another flip-flop from initial plans . to hand £2,000 to parents, the sum will be slashed in half because the . Treasury can’t find the money to pay for it. A row continues in Whitehall about how . far up the income scale the handouts should go. The childcare package . was supposed to be announced earlier this month as part of the . Government’s midterm relaunch. But officials across Whitehall say Mr Osborne wants to hold on to the tax announcement in order to make it near the Budget. Deputy PM Nick Clegg said he was determined to extend help with childcare bills to middle class families . Instead Education Minister Liz Truss . will next week only unveil plans to change the regulation of childcare. The number of children nursery staff can manage will be raised from four . to six but those in charge of children will have to be better . qualified. It had been claimed that the Lib Dems . were insisting only the poorest families will get the money. But Nick . Clegg said he was ‘unambiguously in favour’ of giving more support to . ‘the British middle classes’ who do not feel well off when they are . forced to spend up to 15 per cent of their income on childcare. Officials have told the Mail that . Tories are winning the argument that some taxpayers who pay the 40p rate . – which kicks in at £37,000 – will get the money. ‘That is a safe . assumption,’ said one source. The Tories want middle class families . to get help with childcare to offset some of the anger about the . decision to slash child benefit. That benefit is being reduced for . families where one earner is on £50,000 or more and withdrawn completely . for parents with salaries over £60,000. Parents spend a total of £63,738 on childcare and babysitters raising a child from birth to the age of 21 . Mr Clegg told the House magazine: . ‘It’s an absolute duty to try and help people, the squeezed middle if . you like, who aren’t at the bottom.’ New figures this week showed that the . crippling cost of bringing up a child from birth to the age of 21 has . ballooned to an all-time high of £222,500.","Nick Clegg promises Middle England will benefit from package of help .

"Two girls found murdered in Pennsylvania nearly five decades ago and buried in a potter's grave have finally been identified as two teenagers who vanished from their home in Philadelphia. Sandra Stiver, then 14, and her sister-in-law Martha, then 17, disappeared in early 1968 and relatives speculated that they had headed to Kansas City, where the family had previously lived. In August 1968, one body was found shot five times and dumped off Route 82 in Berks County, while the second was found about four miles away in French Creek State Park in April 1969. The second body was skeletal but authorities believed she had been murdered around the same time as the first. The girls, who authorities deduced were related because of their similar clothing, could not be identified and were buried in a potter's grave in Berks County. But their family never stopped looking. Found: The bodies of Sandy Stiver (left), who was just 14 when she vanished, and Martha Stiver (right), have been identified as two girls buried in a potter's grave in Pennsylvania. They vanished from their home in 1968 . They were finally identified after one of the Stivers' family members . read about the case on the National Missing and Unidentified Persons web database, and thought the timings matched up. They contacted authorities and offered DNA samples to be tested against the bodies, which were exhumed from Potter's Field. The DNA samples matched up. 'We've been praying and praying for this day for so many years,' Sandra's sister Hazel Stiver-DeMoss told the Philadelphia Daily News from her home in Richfield, Ohio. 'But we still don't know who did this, who killed them.' Authorities are now appealing for any information that can help identify their killer. Ahead of the girls' disappearance, the Stiver family had lived in Kansas City and there was speculation after they vanished that the girls may have headed back there. When they moved, Martha - who was married to one of the Stiver's sons - had left her one-year-old daughter behind with family members, and some guessed the girls had headed back to get her. Similarities: The girls' bodies were found eight months apart but both were wearing these identical sandals . 'My dad always . believed in his heart that she talked my sister into running away to get . that baby,' Hazel said. 'The last thing anyone remembered was that they . went to the corner store and didn't come back.' The Reading Eagle reported that it was . believed the girls traveled to Reading and possibly worked at the . Reading Fair in the summer of 1968. Hazel Stiver-DeMoss, victims' sister . Sandy Stiver's body was found on August 22 and had been shot five times in the abdomen and torso and once in the temple. She was wearing a medal reading: 'I am a Catholic. In case of emergency, call me a priest.' Eight months later, her sister-in-law's body was found on a flat rock in the state park, but authorities deduced that she had also been killed in August. She was naked and had three teeth . missing, and her sandal and panties were found nearby. Police believed . she was related to the first girl who had been found. 'They were believed to be related, or . knew each other, by the clothing that they had,' Berks County Coroner Dennis Hess told Philly.com. Killed: Sandy, whose body had been shot five times in the torso and abdomen and once in the temple, was wearing this bronze medal, which said: 'I am a Catholic.  In case of emergency, call me a priest' 'In particular, there were a pair of Italian-made sandals that . were identical. State police were able to determine that they were the . same shoes.' The girls could not be identified and their bodies were buried in a potter's grave - a grave used for the unidentified or people who cannot afford a proper burial. The following August, police thought . they had made a break in the case when they came across photographs in a . hanger that had been used by a biker gang. The images showed two girls . that police speculated could have been the Stivers - but this was never . confirmed. At the request of the family, the bodies were exhumed and samples were sent for DNA testing. Sandra's . father died of cancer in 1974, never finding out what happened to his . daughter or daughter-in-law. Her mother is in poor health in Ohio, the . Daily News reported. Who are they? Months after the bodies were found, . police found pictures of these girls in a hangar that was used by a . biker gang. Police thought they might be the girls who were killed - but . this was never confirmed . The Stiver family now plan to drive to . Pennsylvania and collect Sandy's remains, while Martha's daughter, . Samantha, will decide what to do with her mother's remains. Now authorities are searching for suspects in the case. Anyone with information about the deaths is  urged to contact the State Police in Reading at 610-378-4011. 'The University of North Texas tells us this is the oldest case that they have ever been able to match, from 1968 and 1969,' Hess added. 'They’ve never done one this old. That, in itself, is a feat.'","Sandra Stiver, then 14, and Martha Stiver, 17, vanished walking to a corner store in Philadelphia in 1968 and relatives thought they had run away .

"Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on Monday that there is 'absolutely no evidence' that the United States will lose jobs as a consequence of implementing the Affordable Care Act. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office declared on February 4 that the Obamacare law would suck the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs out of the U.S. economy by 2024. 'There is absolutely no evidence, and every economist will tell you this, that there is any job loss related to the Affordable Care Act,' Sebelius insisted Monday in Florida. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius continues to plug the Affordable Care act, claiming that it won't reduce employment . The HHS chief and former Kansas governor had at least 17 conversations with president and other White House bigwigs leading up to the Obamacare system's disastrous launch, it emerged last week . 'Part-time positions are actually down since 2010, not up,' she noted. 'The number of full-time workers continues to increase. I know that’s a popular myth that continues to be repeated but it just is not accurate.' But the CBO projected something dramatically different, concluding that so many Americans would stop working that the U.S. workforce would shrink by millions. On February 10 Vice President Biden seemed to agree with what Sebelius would say a week later, telling TIME that 'there is zero evidence that this is costing people jobs now.' The White House immediately spun the CBO report as good news, saying that those 'choices' reflected new flexibility for Americans who will soon be able to keep their health insurance without going to work every day. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi claimed that 'it's not going to cost jobs. It's going to shift how people make a living and reach their aspirations.' 'This was one of the goals' of the Affordable Care Act,' she added. Sebelius could have worded her statement differently, saying that Obamacare wouldn't drive employers to hire fewer people. But by choosing to say there would not be 'any job loss,' she has left herself open to attacks from Republican members of Congress who are growing impatient with the Obama administration's handling of the law's implementation. The president hasn't directly addressed the CBO report about Obamacare job losses, but his spokesmen have spun it as a positive when working Americans can make the 'choice' to leave their employment . The White House has already announced 29 unilateral changes, many of which contradict the plain text of the Affordable Care Act. 'This is going to drive Capitol Hill conservatives nuts,' a Republican campaign operative in Louisiana told MailOnline on Tuesday. 'This year's election is a referendum on Obamacare,' he said. 'It's bad enough that the White House is playing emperor in order to keep the law from a death spiral, but now the woman in charge doesn't seem to understand how bad it's going to be for the economy.' HHS did not respond to questions about how Sebelius' statement could be reconciled with the facts the CBO has put on the record. But some in Congress had already piled on the notion that Obamacare will cost jobs. 'Just like when the president promised, ‘""f you like your plan you can keep it,"" those in the Administration who promised that Obamacare wouldn't negatively impact the job market couldn't have been more wrong,' Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul wrote in an essay for the Breitbart.com blog. And Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that the White House seemed to believe 'that it’s a good thing to discourage people from working.'","HHS Secretary insists Obamacare will not cost the economy jobs .

"The last of a generation: Con Shiels, 96, died on Boxing Day and was one one of 200 men to take part in the Jarrow March to London . He was the last of the Jarrow Marchers - a famous band of jobless men who walked 300 miles to London to protest about unemployment and poverty during the Great Depression. Con Shiels was just 20 when he took part in the long journey from the north-east to the capital in 1936 but at the age of 96 he has died after a short illness this Christmas. The March saw unemployed men walk from Jarrow, on Tyne and Wear, in . protest at the town's spiral into deprivation following the . closure of its shipyard. Led by a mouth organ band, these 200 men became the symbol of hope for many in Britain when they were suffering great poverty. Carrying an 11,000-name petition, they did so to demand help from the government and then Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin. Inspired by the plight of his friends and family, Mr Shiels joined his father and the other . protesters for the marathon journey. For many years Con told local generations of schoolchildren about the March and the plight of those who took part. He joined the final leg of the walk into London because his father, Con senior, was an unemployed riveter who became cook for the men on the . route.

"Starbucks will move its tax base from the Netherlands to London in an attempt to banish its ‘immoral’ image. The coffee chain is changing controversial methods it uses to push money into overseas tax havens. The surprise announcement puts pressure on Google and Amazon, which have been criticised for similar tax avoidance. Starbucks faced a boycott in 2012 after it emerged the company had paid corporation tax only once since arriving in the UK in 1998. Starbucks has said it will pay more tax in the UK as it announced its European HQ will move to London. The coffee shop chain was hit by a customer boycott two years ago in protest over its tax payments .

But critics said the move was just a ploy to lower Starbucks’ total tax burden. Accountant . Richard Murphy said: ‘They are not paying any more tax, just paying . more tax here.

"A mother had to have a hysterectomy at 19 after doctors missed a minor infection which could have been treated with antibiotics. Hayley Sanders has now been awarded a five-figure settlement from her local NHS trust. Miss Sanders underwent the operation to remove her womb barely a fortnight after having her first child, Jayden, by Caesarean section on December 27, 2009. Hayley Sanders developed an infection after the birth of her son, Jayden, in December 2009. Despite having a high temperature, she was discharged from hospital . Four of the checks carried out immediately after the birth revealed high temperature readings – a warning sign of an infection. Despite that, Miss Sanders was discharged from Birmingham’s Heartlands Hospital three days later. But on New Year’s Day, Miss Sanders . was rushed back into hospital after developing severe abdominal pain and . spent several days in the high dependency unit. She fell into a coma as her body . fought the deadly infection. It is thought it was caused by one of the . internal examinations she was given during labour. It could have been treated with a . simple course of antibiotics. Instead, doctors were eventually left with . no choice but to perform a complete hysterectomy to save her life. Ms Sanders was rushed back to hospital two days after being discharged. As the infection took hold of her body, she fell into a coma and doctors were forced to perform a hysterectomy to save her life . If Ms Sanders had been given antibiotics as soon as she developed a high temperature, she would not have needed a hysterectomy and she would be able to have more children in future . The . 23-year-old was awarded a ‘five-figure’ pay-out from Heart of England . NHS Foundation Trust, shortly before the case was due to be heard in the . High Court. Miss Sanders says she is ‘disgusted’ by her treatment. She has been left with ongoing health problems as a . result of her hysterectomy, including Irritable Bowel Syndrome. She will also require specialist scar revision surgery to her stomach. Ms Sanders has now received a five-figure pay-out from Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust - it will cover her loss of earnings and pay for the counselling she has required as a result of the incident . Ms Sanders said: 'I couldn't believe that if staff had only given me antibiotics I would never have needed a hysterectomy' She said: ‘I just could not believe that at 19 years of age I wouldn’t be able to have children again. ‘I was devastated and determined to . get to the bottom of how it could have happened. When I heard the . evidence I was absolutely appalled. ‘I couldn’t believe that if staff had . only given me antibiotics I would never have needed a hysterectomy, I . would have been able to make the most of bonding with Jayden in the . first weeks of his life and I would have, one day, been able to give him . a little brother or sister. Ms Sanders now hopes that the hospital has learnt from its mistakes and that no other women will go through the same trauma she experienced . ‘Instead I was robbed of this and have . been left with a host of ongoing problems that are a constant reminder . of the failings in my care. ‘The whole situation has been made . worse by the fact the Trust has never taken responsibility for its . actions or even just said sorry. Nothing can make up for what happened . but it would at least give me some closure to allow me to begin . rebuilding my life.’ Emma Rush, of law firm Irwin Mitchell, . said: ‘Hospital staff missed multiple opportunities to recognise that . Hayley’s high temperature was the result of an infection that is not . uncommon in maternity patients and that simple antibiotics would have . treated [it]. ‘Instead she became critically ill as . the infection took over her body and the only option of saving her was . to perform a hysterectomy to remove the source of the infection.’ ‘This is obviously a horrendous ordeal . for any person to go through, but particularly difficult for a . 19-year-old who hoped to have more children.’ A spokesman for the Heart of England . NHS Trust said: ‘A detailed action plan is developed to improve and . learn from the findings of investigations and this is monitored and . inspected by senior teams of doctors nurses and midwives. Unfortunately, . Hayley Sanders suffered complications during the course of the delivery . of her son. ‘Whilst no admissions of liability . were made, a financial settlement was achieved and we wish Hayley and . her family all the best for the future.’ The body can be vulnerable to some infections after birth. The most common is endometritis - an infection of the lining of the womb. Some women also develop infections of the breast, C-section scar, or urinary tract. Women who have C-sections are at significantly higher risk of endometritis than those who have a natural delivery. Symptoms of an infection include fever, chills and malaise.

"A naked hairdresser stopped traffic on a residential street at the weekend by performing a sex act in front of a couple's car then climbing on top of it and throwing a tantrum when the police arrived.

"A former White House assistant press secretary has lashed out at the White House taking specific aim on the office of the First Lady. Reid Cherlin has written an article for The New Republic criticizing the overly structured way that Michelle Obama's team handles her schedule and even the way the First Lady herself deals with her staff. He said that in addition to the internal politics that comes with a group of eager staffers trying to curry favor with Mrs Obama, a good deal of the drama comes as a result of 'the exacting but often ambivalent leadership style of the first lady herself'. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: A former White House staffer has written an article slamming the inefficiencies in Michelle Obama's office, citing her need for plans for events months in advance which is described as an 'unheard of' rigidity . Staffers complained about mixed . signals, and how the lack of a clear chain of command leads to empty . voids resulting in a mess of too many people focusing on the minute . details of projects while other larger-picture goals get left by the . wayside. 'There’s no . barometer: The first lady having the wrong pencil skirt on Monday is . just as big of a f***-up as someone speaking on the record when they . didn’t mean to or a policy initiative that completely failed,' one . anonymous former aide said. Cherlin first started his career with the Obamas during the President's first campaign in 2008 and then once he was elected, Cherlin went on to work as an assistant press secretary. He came into the spotlight with the launch of the Affordable Care Act but told Politico that he felt 'pretty burnt out' and has now left to work as a reporter. In his latest piece for The New Republic, the 32-year-old zones in on the East Wing, where Michelle Obama's initiatives are so intricately planned and plotted- in his view, to their own detriment. 'Unlike her husband, who derives visible satisfaction from his ability to improvise, Mrs. Obama depends on structure to support her public warmth—the ease with which she’ll pick up a hula-hoop, say, or do the Dougie with school kids,' he writes. '(The) first lady’s office can be a confining, frustrating, even miserable place to work. Jealousy and discontentment have festered, as courtiers squabble over the allocation of responsibility and access to Mrs. Obama, both of which can be aggravatingly scarce.' As examples of the inefficiency, he cites . Let's Move launch campaigns that were met with less than overwhelming . receptions and successful initiatives like Mrs Obama's partnerships with . celebrities like Jimmy Fallon and NBA star LeBron James that were . almost waved off before they even started. Close: Reid Cherlin, seen here with the President and his former advisors Stephanie Cutter and another advisor, left the White House in 2011 and has launched a career in journalism . Former East Wing employees explained that the First Lady's nationwide popularity extends into the guarded compound at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as well. 'They don’t want to work for her; they want to be friends with her,' the unidentified individual said. Another explained how 'every meeting was like an identity crisis' as they stressed about whether they were being invited to the daily meetings in Mrs Obama's private office. Cherlin gives examples of how Mrs Obama is seemingly aware but unmotivated by the attention from underlings, opting to place most of her trust in just a few people who have been working with she and her husband for years. 'Chief among the decision-makers are (White House chef Sam) Kass and (advisor Valerie) Jarrett—old family friends who enjoy rare access to the president and first lady’s ultra-secluded living quarters, and to Mrs. Obama’s private thinking,' Cherlin writes. That dependence on longer-term staffers to stick around because of their connection with Mrs Obama has led to some territorial infighting issues as well. He cites the June departure of Kristina Schake, the First Lady's former communications director who thought up the celebrity partnerships that proved so successful. When the West Wing got word of the positive effect of Ms Schake's initiative, President Obama's staffers began to approach her about possibly transferring to their side of the building. Careful planning: Mrs Obama's team has had some less-than-stellar public launches for some of her Let's Move initiatives, and some criticize her for being overly cautious (seen on Tuesday during her trip to China) When rumors about her possible . 'promotion' hit the East Wing water coolers, people were reportedly not . supportive of the step up but immediately skeptical, questioning whether . or not Ms Schake had asked the First Lady's permission to be perusing . other options. In the end, she left politics altogether and now works as the head of communications at L'Oreal. The . article describes how parts of Mrs Obama's personality conflict with . the way that the office is run: while she is known to be very . detail-oriented and demanding when it comes to having every aspect of . her public appearances planned, the same level of scrutiny does not . extend to the way that the East Wing is run. One . former aide described the mentality in the office as being one of 'how . can we be the caliber that we’re expected to be with no attention and no . resources and being an afterthought?' For their part, the East Wing issued a statement saying that the First Lady has been pleased with her successes in the areas of military family support and improved nutrition, even though they used a now-discredited statistic about a drop in obesity rates to justify her work. 'The First Lady is laser-focused on moving the needle wherever and whenever possible,' the statement reads.","Former assistant press secretary Reid Cherlin has written an article about the inefficiencies and lack of leadership in Mrs Obama's office .

"Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle has doubled down on her claims that young women should not serve on a jury - and former White House press secretary Dana Perino has incredibly chimed in to support her. Guifoyle sparked outrage on Tuesday when she told The Five viewers that 'healthy and hot' young women should be excused from voting booths and juries 'so they can go back on Tinder and Match.com'. But in a shocking development tonight, her co-host Dana Perino agreed that prosecutors should not pick young women to sit on a jury - as the 45-year-old former Victoria Secret model refused to apologize for her words. Scroll down for videos . Defiant: Kimberly Guilfoyle appeared on The Five tonight to defend her claim that young women are 'spoon fed' information - and her colleague Dana Perino, former White House Press Secretary, backed up her beliefs . Not backing down: Former Victoria Secret model Guilfoyle and Bush's press secretary Perino were defiant . 'If you're a prosecutor, you typically would not pick the young woman because she is not the person you would want on the jury, and that's true across the board,' declared Perino, America's second ever female White House Press Secretary, who served under George W Bush between  2007 to 2009. Addressing the storm of backlash, Guilfoyle simply blamed the 'liberal media' for taking her words 'out of context' - repeating: 'if [young women] want to go back to social media or online dating, that's fine with me'. 'I take voting very seriously,' she said, defending her own words. 'Don't come out because you're uninformed or you're spoon-fed information - anybody out there.' The panel discussion then turned into an attack on Huffington Post for 'manipulating the truth'. 'Unfortunately they made that headline then liberal media ran with it when there was not one iota of fact in it,' she raged at her fellow panelists. Describing the site's news-gathering process as 'twisting a Rubiks cube' of 'manipulation', Greg Gutfeld said: 'It was specifically HuffPo who picked it ... and then liberal media said let's go spread this garbage as far as we can spread it.' Guilfoyle insisted that she said nothing about voting. 'I take the right to vote very seriously, I take the right to serve on a jury very seriously and I think you should be informed when you do both things.' 'My point is you’ve been given a powerful blessing in life in this country to be able to vote and to be able to sit on the jury so come equipped, come prepared because you don’t want to dilute the votes out there because you are uninformed and you’re spoon-fed something that’s inaccurate or you don’t even bother to equip yourself with the facts – anybody out there, this goes for everyone.' 'And that is that': While many expected an apology from the former model, she did not back down on her words . Sit this one out, ladies: Fox News co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle has said on The Five that young women should be excused from voting and siting on juries to pursue online dating on Tinder and Match.com . He said, she said: When co-host Bob Beckel (right) pointed out to Guilfoyle that young women have 'every right in the world' to serve as jurors, Guilfoyle responded by saying they should get a pass . Refusing to acknowledge the complaints of sexism and hypocrisy that have swarmed Twitter, Guilfoyle then wrapped up the discussion by smiling at the camera defiantly: 'And that is that'. Guilfoyle, the ex-wife of former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, appeared on The Five along with her four-co-hosts Tuesday to discuss the challenges the Republican Party has been facing in swaying young women to vote conservative. When Guilfoyle’s fellow panelist Greg Gutfield suggested that married, older women tend to vote Republican because 'with age comes wisdom,' the 45-year-old former California prosecutor launched into a tirade calling out younger women for their perceived ignorance. 'It’s the same reason why young women on juries are not a good idea. They don’t get it!' Guilfoyle fumed. She then added that her younger peers don't have the proper 'life experiences' such as raising children, paying bills, or dealing with real-world issues like mortgage, crime and health care, to perform their civic duties. 'They’re like healthy and hot and running around without a care in the world,' said Guilfoyle, a one-time Victoria’s Secret lingerie model. When The Five co-host Bob Beckel pointed out that young women have 'every right in the world' to sit on a jury, Guilfoyle clarified her point. In her own words: Ms Guilfoyle addressed the controversy on Twitter and teased an upcoming panel discussion on the subject on The Five . 'Condescending': Guilfoyle, pictured here in May at an art benefit, insisted that attractive young women do not have the proper life experiences to make informed decisions . Sizzling look: Guilfoyle, 45, seen here at an October 14 premiere of the film Fury, started out as a model for Victoria's Secret . Crime fighter: Before she became a TV host, Guilfoyle served as a prosecutor in California for a decade . 'I just think, excuse them so they can go back on Tinder and Match.com,' the twice-divorced single mother said with a smile. On Thursday afternoon, Ms Guilfoyle addressed the controversy on Twitter, writing: 'Should young women (or men for that matter) who haven’t studied the issues… cast their vote at the ballot box? That discussion on @TheFive.' A Fox News spokesperson told MailOnline Ms Guilfoyle will clarify her position on the matter during a panel discussion tonight on Fox News. This is not the first time that The Five have taken young Americans to task accusing them of being ill-informed citizens. Earlier this month, Harris Faulkner urged young voters to sit out the upcoming mid-term elections if they 'don't know the issues,' reported Huffington Post. Kimberly Guilfoyle graduated from University of California at Davis and obtained a law degree. While still attending the San Francisco School of Law, she modeled for retailers like Macy’s and appeared in a bridal magazine published by Victoria’s Secret.

After a decade-long career in law, first as a persecutor and later as a deputy district attorney and assistant district attorney, Guilfoyle changed gears emerging as a TV personality. Besides her role as a panelist on The Five, Mrs Guilfoyle also co-hosts Fox News’ Outnumbered and appears as a regular contributor on The O'Reilly Factor and Hannity. While still working as a prosecutor in San Francisco, Guilfoyle married then-city supervisor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, who would go on to become mayor and later lieutenant governor of California. Their marriage ended in 2006. Four months after her divorce was finalized, Guilfoyle tied the knot with a furniture heir with whom she has an 8-year-old son.

"Kazakhstan's President may drop the 'stan' from his country's name to distinguish his booming oil-rich nation from the rest of Central Asia, where the other so-called stans are mostly mired in poverty. The world's ninth largest nation by area with a population of just 17 million, Kazakhstan is the largest economy of the post-Soviet region, which also includes Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Foreign companies have invested billions of dollars in the nation's mineral wealth since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Eye-catching: Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev may take the 'stan' out of his country's name to distinguish it from other poorer nations in the region which have a similar ending . But Kazakh officials say the vast country of steppes and mountains is still little known in the world. Nursultan Nazarbayev, who visited the nation's oil capital Atyrau in western Kazakhstan on Thursday afternoon, said a new name like Kazakh Eli, which stands for 'The Land of Kazakhs', would be more eye-catching for a foreigner studying the region's map. 'In our country's name, there is this ""stan"" ending which other Central Asian nations have as well. 'But, for instance, foreigners show interest in Mongolia, whose population is just two million people, but whose name lacks the ""stan"" ending,' Nazarbayev's press service quoted him as saying. Distinguishing features: Nazarbayev said a new name would make it stand out from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on the region's map . Show of wealth: The elaborate Akordia presidential residence. Kazakhstan is the largest economy of the post-Soviet region thanks to huge investment by foreign companies in the nation's natural resources . The suffix -stan is Persian for 'place of', 'land' or country'. So in the case of these post-Soviet era countries, the individual prefixes give them differing meanings: . Kazakhstan - Kazakh is derived from an ancient Turkic word meaning 'independent and free', reflecting the natives' nomadic horseback culture. Kyrgyzstan - The Kyrgyz originated in Mongolia. In Turkish, Kyr means 'mountain range' so, when pluralised, the full name plausibly interprets as 'Land of Mountaineers'. Tajikistan - Taj means 'crown' and ik means 'head' so the prefix likely translates as 'a person wearing a crown on his head'. Uzbekistan - Uzbek is thought to come from two Turkish words which combine to mean 'genuine man'. Turkmenistan - The combination of Turk and Men means 'I am a Turk'. 'Probably, we ought to consider with time . the issue of adopting Kazakh Eli as the name of our country, but before . that we definitely need to discuss this with the people,' he said . without elaborating. Nazarbayev, a 73-year-old former steelworker, has been in power for more than two decades and enjoys sweeping powers. Titled 'Leader of the Nation' and widely nicknamed 'Papa', he has overseen market reforms and attracted foreign investors. But he has kept a tight lid on dissent in his nation which has never held an election recognised as free and fair by the West. Still vastly popular, he has said he will rule as long as his health allows him to stay in power and promised to groom a successor before stepping down. Few doubt that Kazakhstan will receive a new name, should the veteran leader decide so. In 1997, he moved the capital from the leafy city of Almaty in southeastern Kazakhstan to the windswept steppe town of Akmola in the north. A year later, he said the new capital should be called Astana - which literally means 'capital' in the local Turkic language - to end speculation about Akmola's name which stood for both 'white shrine' and 'white plenty' in Kazakh.","Nursultan Nazarbayev may use Kazakh Eli which means Land of Kazakhs .

"Twin schoolgirls who followed their jihadi brother to Syria were hard-working students who hoped to train as doctors. Sixteen-year-olds Salma and Zahra Halane, who last summer achieved 28 GCSEs between them, left their parents’ home in the middle of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border. Police said the pair are thought to have followed their elder brother, who ditched his own ‘excellent’ academic career to join the ISIS terror group around a year ago. Scroll down for video . Salma (left) and Zahra Halane (right), who last summer achieved 28 GCSEs between them, left their parents’ home in the middle of the night and caught a flight to Turkey, before crossing the border . Friends said the twins had appeared to be typical teenagers, pouting for selfies and shopping at Primark – but they are now feared to be training for battle. Last night a rebel fighter boasted that he was teaching girls as young as 16 how to fight. Yilmaz, a Dutch national who has been in Syria for two years, told Sky News: ‘It’s extremely easy to get here. People go on holiday ... they end up in Syria.’ The twins’ parents raised the alarm last month, after finding the girls’ beds empty and their passports and clothes missing. A former neighbour said the couple had been ‘quite strict’, and did not allow the girls to ‘mix with other children on the street’. Others recalled that the twins wore headscarves when they were as young as nine. But Rhea Headlam, who sat next to Zahra in primary school, said they were ‘just normal teenage girls’. ‘I’m really shocked – I used to bump into them at Primark,’ she added. ‘They were both really clever.’ Selfies: Zahra, left, and Salma, right, pose with friends in pictures taken not long before they fled the UK . Schoolgirl: Zahra Halane kneels in front of friends when she was in Year 6 at her primary school . Last summer Salma achieved 13 GCSEs – 11 of them at grades A* to C – while Zahra passed 15, of which 12 were A*-C. The results put them in the top 10 per cent of their year group at Whalley Range High School for Girls in Manchester. They went on to study at Connell Sixth Form College, where fellow students said they hoped to follow in the footsteps of their elder sister Hafsa, 25, who is at medical school in Denmark after graduating from Manchester University. ‘The twins both have aspirations to become doctors – that is their ambition,’ said one. Another claimed it was ‘typical’ of the girls to head to Syria ‘after they had finished term’, adding: ‘They wouldn’t want to mess up their education. ‘I’m shocked they have gone. They didn’t seem to be radical or extremist in their views.’ Support: Visitors arrive at the family home yesterday, but the girls' parents have not spoken publicly . It emerged yesterday that the girls’ devoutly Muslim Somali refugee parents and their 11 children had been moved from an estate made famous by the TV series Shameless to an upmarket suburb, after telling the council they needed more bedrooms. They were given a six-bedroom end-terrace despite the protests of the existing tenant. Yesterday the large back and front gardens were strewn with discarded household items and children’s plastic toys. The house's previous resident - a 40-year-old Army heroine who served in Bosnia - said last night she had been booted out of the house by Manchester City Council so the twins and their family could move in. Former lance corporal Dawn Benjamin told The Sun she had thought the house - her childhood home - would be 'going to a good family'. She added: 'I lost my life, memories, everything I'd grown up with, to house jihadi wannabes'. Ms Benjamin and her young son had to move out after they were served with a court order. The council confirmed the house had been needed for a larger family. Police probe: Officers were seen leaving the house. The large back and front gardens were strewn with discarded household items and children's plastic toys . Neighbours said the twins’ parents were keen to share elements of Somalian culture with them, taking round dishes of traditional delicacies for them to try. The twins’ father Ibrahim is understood to teach at a nearby mosque, where leaders this week issued a statement repudiating extremism and opposing violence of all kinds. Mohammed Shafiq, of the Ramadan Foundation, said the family were moderate Muslims who know all about the dangers of war-torn countries. ‘They were desperately unhappy to discover [their son] had gone to Syria, and they thought they were keeping a watchful eye on their other children. Then this happens,’ he said. Sources believe Salma and Zahra were inspired by their brother’s transformation into a jihadi fighter, and became radicalised themselves while viewing extremist Islamist material online. According to police sources, their brother also travelled to the family’s native Somalia, where he may have linked up with another Islamist terror group al-Shabab. A friend told The Sun the brother was known for his ability to recite long passages of the Koran. Officers are investigating how the girls funded their own trip, over fears they have been bankrolled by jihadi fighters who want them as their wives. As many as 1,500 Britons may have travelled to Syria to fight alongside rebels. Many of them have posted messages online promising to use their ‘terror skills’ if they return to Britain.","Twins Salma and Zahra Halane left their parents’ home in middle of night .

"Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho berated the Stamford Bridge crowd in the wake of his side's narrow 2-1 victory over QPR, describing the match as 'like playing in an empty stadium'. The Blues continued their unbeaten start to the Premier League season after a second-half penalty from Eden Hazard secured the win, but Mourinho was critical of the crowd in the aftermath of the game. 'Everyone knows how much I feel connected to this club and the fans,' he told talkSPORT.

"Passed over: Lady Sarah Carnegie, pictured, was unable to prevent her father's earldom passing on to a relative he never met . The daughters of one of Britain’s oldest aristocratic families missed out on their father’s title after it was claimed by a distant relative. The three children of David Carnegie, the 14th Earl of Northesk, tried to block attempts at inheritance by his eighth cousin once removed, Patrick Carnegy. The late earl, who sat as a Scottish Conservative peer in the House of Lords, died in 2010, but details of the struggle over his title had remained secret until now. Representatives of his daughters, Lady Sarah Carnegie, 30, Lady Fiona Carnegie, 26, and Lady Sophie Carnegie, 23, tried to persuade the Crown Office to pass the title on down the female line instead, according to The Sunday Times. The inheritance is one of the most extreme examples of the UK’s inheritance law for titles, which always favours male relatives over females. In this case, the present earl was able to inherit despite having to trace his inheritance back 349 years, eight years before the earldom was created. The laws have recently been changed for the Royal family, but no reforms have been made for other nobility, many of whom are pushing for change. The struggle over to whom the title should pass was based on the interpretation of a Latin document from 1666 which created the earldom. A possible meaning of the document was that the title could pass to whomever inherited the late earl’s property – in this case Lady Sarah. But the Crown Office was unable to resolve the dispute before the 15th earl had his application for a coat of arms approved by the Lord Lyon, who controls membership of the Scottish nobility. His title was confirmed on August 15 2010. The 15th earl, Patrick Carnegy, is a 72-year-old scholar who is an expert on the works of Wagner and Shakespeare. He never met the earl whose title he inherited. He was unmarried when he inherited, but now lives with his wife, opera singer Jill Gomez. Patrick Carnegie, pictured, is now the 15th Earl of Northesk, and was the eighth cousin, once removed, of the 14th Earl . The unusual path of inheritance is the latest twist in an often painful history for the family. David Carnegie’s eldest son, who would have inherited had he lived, killed himself in 2001. Alexander Carnegie, known as Lord Rosehill, shot himself with his father’s at his family home in Hampshire while on leave from a psychiatric hospital. The 14th earl died of cancer aged 55 in 2010, and did not live to see his daughter, a paramedic, marry Anthony Caporaso, an American. The couple had a son, Jamie, before divorcing. All three daughters now live in America. However, members of the family have said that the title is not a great loss because of  its association with family tragedies. Lady Fisher, the aunt of Lady Sarah and her sisters, said: ‘I think we took the collective view that there were so many sadnesses attached to it and it had no benefits. ‘There is no money or estate with the title — it is just an adornment. There isn't a stately home and there isn't much money.’ The 14th Earl, pictured speaking in the House of Lords, died in 2010 and never met the man who inherited his title . Ethie Castle in Scotland, pictured, was the family's ancestral seat until it was sold in the 1990s . However, the inheritance did bring with it something of value. The Balmerino pearls, a family heirloom, passed between the Countesses of Northesk, and, now that the current earl is married, will pass to his wife from the late earl’s widow. The present earl has admitted that the circumstances of his inheritance were ‘embarrassing’, but said the considered it ‘a matter of history and respect to the distinction of my ancestors.’","14th Earl of Northesk died from cancer in 2010 .

"More British citizens signed up to fight in Iraq and Syria than joined the Army Reserve last year, it can be revealed. Just 170 extra reservists enlisted over the past year - despite a Government target to boost the stand-by force by 11,000 by 2018. But at the same time the brutal al-Qaeda inspired ISIS forces tearing through Iraq have been boosted by 'several hundred' Brits, ministers told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . The terror organisation ISIS  has wreaked havoc in Iraq and Syria. Ministers are increasingly concerned British-born recruits could return to the UK intent on carrying out attacks in the UK . Terror experts believe there could be as many as 500 Brits fighting alongside the jihadists in the Middle East for ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria). A senior government minister said: ‘There is a real problem about people going in and being radicalised and then coming home. There are several hundred who have gone from Britain that we know of. It is a worry. 'To get to Iraq most of them will have to go through Syria, so the two are connected.’ Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday admitted Brit will 'inevitably' be fighting alongside ISIS which he called the 'most violent and brutal militant group in the Middle East'. He said the majority of Isis' members were Iraqi or Syrian but 'it also includes a significant number of foreign fighters among its ranks'. Mr Hague said: 'As I have previously told this House, we estimate the number of UK-linked individuals fighting in Syria to include approximately 400 British nationals and other UK-linked individuals who could present a particular risk should they return to the UK.' He said 'some of these, inevitably' are 'fighting with' Isis. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said he revelation was humiliating for the country and needed to be tackled. Mr Coaker said: 'The government's own figures show more UK citizens are joining ISIS than signing up for the Armed Forces Reserves. This is shameful, embarrassing and will cause deep concern. 'We need to see action to ensure recruitment to the Armed Forces meets the targets set. Otherwise, Britain will be left with a dangerous capability gap.' The Government has launched a campaign to recruit 11,000 new reservists to boost the size of the back-up force to 30,000 by 2018. But between April 2013 and April 2014 just 170 signed up . Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker (centre), with Labour leader Ed Miliband  on a surprise visit to Camp Bastion earlier this year, attacked the 'shameful' failure to recruit British forces for the Army Reserve . In the whole of 2013 the number of British Army reservists actually fell by 50 to just 19,150 at the start of the year. Over the 12 months to April this year – a period during in which the Government claimed recruitment had improved – the number of reservists in Britain increased by just 170. The Army's stalling recruitment drive comes despite a pledge to raise the numbers of reservists to 30,000 by 2018. The Ministry of Defence has insisted it was confident the target would be met - as part of plans to slash the size of the regular Army from 102,000 in 2010 to 82,000 in 2018. But this would require an extra 2,750 reservists a year to be recruited. The MoD said: 'Although there have been a number of technical challenges, the programme is on track and the Reserves are now growing in size for the first time in 18 years.' Foreign Affairs Select Committee member Mike Gapes said it was 'shocking and very worrying' that more British citizens were prepared to risk their lives fighting alongside terrorists in the Middle East than had signed up for the Army Reserve. Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking in the Commons yesterday, said it was 'inevitable' that Brits were fighting alongside ISIS forces in Iraq and suggested 400 had travelled to the Middle East to join the battle against President Assad in some capacity . He said: 'There are clearly a pool of people who are being recruited by these extremist groups through the internet. It is very serious and we have got to be very tough on it. 'These figures show there is a minority of people who are fanatical and prepared to join extremist groups, but also that the Government's recruitment to the Army Reserves is not going very well at all. 'There are large numbers living in this country going to fight for these vile terrorist organisations and that's very worrying, particularly if they are returning to Britain having seen what they have seen and looking to recruit terrorists back here.' The revelation comes after former Prime Minister Tony Blair said British fighters returning from Iraq and Syria were the Government's single, biggest security concern. Mr Blair said: 'If we don't deal with the Syria issue then the problems are not just going to be for Syria and for the region, the problems are actually going to come back and they are going to hit us very directly even in our own country.' He added: 'If you talk to security services in France and Germany and the UK, they will tell you their biggest single worry today returning jihadists fighters - our own citizens by the way - from Syria.' Charlie Cooper, an expert at the anti-extremist think tank, Quilliam Foundation, said the number of Brits signing up to fight in the Middle East would only grow. He said: 'People are going from Britain and the EU to fight for ISIS - the estimate is more than 500 and that number will probably rise. 'If you want to go and fight jihad, ISIS, which holds a particularly extreme view of Islam and wants to create an extreme Islamic utopia, is a very attractive group to fight for.' While the British Army Reserve has struggled to attract recruits, the brutal ISIS insurgency in Iraq has been bolstered by 'several hundred' British-born fighters. An image emerged over the weekend  allegedly showing ISIS militants executing dozens of captured Iraqi security forces members. British security services fear ISIS recruits will return to the UK scarred by their experience in Iraq . The al-Qaeda inspired ISIS terror group has carved out an area of control across the middle east, threatening to tear apart the current national borders. A senior government minister told MailOnline the route into Iraq for many Brits was through war-ravaged Syria, to the west . David Cameron's official spokesman has acknowledged fears British citizens could be among the ISIS fighters in Iraq, saying: 'Our security services and all the relevant agencies will be monitoring those types of risks very closely. 'Clearly there is a very porous border between parts of Syria and parts of Iraq. 'As the Prime Minister has said, the greatest extremist activity and jihadist threats to the international community are in Syria. We need to keep these things under very close watch.' Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire, meanwhile, has warned any Brits considering joining the battle abroad that they will face jail in Britain for any terror-related offences - even if they are carried out abroad. He said: 'The Serious Crime Bill would extend the reach of the Terrorism Act 2006 so that UK-linked individuals and those who seek to harm UK interests, who travel overseas to prepare or train more generally for terrorism, can be prosecuted as if their actions had taken place in the UK.' A Foreign Office spokesman has previously added: 'People who are thinking about travelling to Syria to engage in terrorist activity should be in no doubt that we will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security, including prosecuting those who break the law.' Mail Online approached the Ministry of Defence about the revelations, but has not received any response.","Several hundred Brits thought to be fighting in Middle East killing fields .

"A Jetstar plane has been forced to make an emergency landing after a seriously ill passenger was reportedly vomiting blood on board on Wednesday night. A man in his 50s was greeted by paramedics and quarantine officials, including a woman wearing a white hazmat suit, at Sydney airport after the Darwin-bound flight was forced to turn back. The hazardous materials suit,  that consists of an impermeable whole-body garment, is currently being worn by medical staff caring for Ebola patients. 'I can confirm the customer’s symptoms emerged during the aircraft’s ascent out of Sydney,' a Jetstar spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . A man in his 50s was greeted by paramedics and taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital after falling ill on a plane to Darwin . The flight was about an hour in when it had to return to Sydney airport. The sick man was greeted by medical staff in hazmat suites (right) Nine News reported the passenger was 'vomiting blood' but a Jetstar spokesman told AAP the man was not suffering from Ebola. '(He) was vomiting, and it was clear (he was) quite unwell,' he said. He added that the passenger had a pre-existing medical condition that concerned the medical advisory team. The spokesperson would not disclose the medical condition, but said it was not contagious and there is now no concern of Ebola. Around 140 people were on board the flight, which landed in Sydney at around 12am. It had been in the sky for around an hour when the decision was made to turn back. Quarantine officials examined the plane and the man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for treatment. Staff wore protective gloves as they carried the sick traveller across the tarmac on a stretcher and a bright yellow protective plastic bag was also placed on the stretcher. Extra precautions were taken until it was determined the man had a pre-existing medical condition . Around 140 passengers had to leave the plane and some stayed in a hotel overnight . The sick men was rushed to hospital in an ambulance . A spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'The captain made the decision to return to Sydney as the nearest diversion point after a medical situation had emerged on board. This is a standard procedure for all airlines. 'A passenger on the flight became very unwell shortly after take-off and we were quickly able to determine they had a pre-existing medical condition. 'We were advised to turn back to Sydney so the passenger could receive urgent medical treatment. Paramedics met the aircraft on arrival and the passenger was taken to hospital.' Jetstar confirmed the plane had been forced to return to Sydney via Twitter . More than one hundred people were on board the flight. Another flight to Darwin has been scheduled for Thursday . Jetstar also tweeted: 'Confirming JQ672 returned to Sydney last night. Decision made in line with medical advice for the safety & wellbeing of the unwell passenger.' The frightened passengers were offered hotel rooms after their flight was subsequently cancelled. An additional Jetstar flight will run to Darwin on Thursday night.

"South Koreans have more plastic surgery than any other nation, astonishing new figures reveal. Those in the Asian country have more treatments per members of the population, with . one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle. The figures, from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (ISAPS), show that in 2011, 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks. While the popularity of cosmetic surgery in South Korea may come as a surprise to many, the industry there is in fact booming. South Korea had the most cosmetic procedures when taking population into account in 2010, while the UK came 20th . Last year, 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of Seoul admitted to going under the knife. One of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper . eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more 'Western'. It is believed that the rise of the country's music industry is behind the boom, and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities, asking surgeons to emulate American noses or eyes. Miss South Korea Yu-Mi Kim admitted having cosmetic surgery saying: 'I never said I was born beautiful' Singer PSY, whose song 'Gangnam Style' became a global hit, said his record label had urged him to get plastic surgery. Even Miss Korea 2012, Kim Yu-Mi, admitted . she went under the knife to achieve her pageant-winning good looks. The . student revealed the secret after photos emerged of her looking very . different at school, but she said she hadn't misled anyone. 'I never said I was born beautiful,' she told Korean media. While South Korea topped the table in relative terms, when it came to total numbers of tucks, peels, fillers, jabs and lifts in their quest for the perfect body,  America cemented its place at the top of the table in the poll of 20,000 surgeons. There were also regional variations in the popularity of different procedures. Brazil, . known for its beach culture, performed the most male breast reductions, . bottom implants and 'vaginal rejuvenations' - where tissue in the area . is 'firmed up for a youthful appearance'. Meanwhile, nose jobs are popular in Asia, with China, Japan and South Korea among the top five nations for rhinoplasty. The country performing the highest number of breast implants is the U.S., followed by Brazil, Mexico, Italy and China. The U.S. and Brazil also come first and second for the highest number of eye lifts and tummy tucks. Meanwhile, as obesity rates rise a growing number of overweight adults are turning to surgery for a quick fix. Lipoplasty - a procedure that uses high-frequency sound waves to liquefy fat beneath the skin's surface before sucking it out  - was the leading invasive procedure worldwide. There were 1,268,287 procedures, which was just a fifth of the total. It was followed by breast enlargement . surgery, with 1,295,251 boob jobs. Third was blepharoplasty, otherwise . known as eyelid surgery, with 703,610 cases and fourth was . abdomnioplasty, otherwise known as tummy tucks, with 553,399 cases. Finishing the top five list was rhinoplasty, with 478,023 people having . nose jobs.More unusual procedures that made the . top 20 were buttock implants at number 13, with 75,591 pursuing a more . prominent derriere. Meanwhile just over 60,000 opted for chin implants . and a further 47,000 or so went for a thigh lift. Plastic surgery procedures that took place in the UK in 2011 according to ISAPS . The UK came 16th in the table, the same . position it held in 2010. There were 95,063 surgical procedures in 2011 . including 19,031 breast enlargements and 16,034 lipoplasty procedures (where fat fat is liquefied and sucked out). Botox was by far the most popular non . invasive treatment with 45,464 treatments making up more than a fifth of . the 211,406 procedures. This was up 26 per cent compared to 2010. In the U.S, licensed plastic surgeons . performed more than one million surgical procedures such as breast . enlargements and more than two million nonsurgical procedures including . Botox to smooth out wrinkles. Figures released earlier this week by the British Association  of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) show our lust for cosmetic surgery finally seems to be cooling. Demand for procedures plateaued last year – the first time there hasn’t been a large increase in more than a decade. Experts say the PIP breast-implant scandal and  Wild West approach of some High Street providers – the two-for-one offers, hard-selling and rock-bottom prices may be to blame. But the PIP scandal aside, the most popular cosmetic procedure was still traditional breast augmentation, with numbers dipping by just 1.6 per cent to 9,854. BAAPS president Rajiv Grover said: ‘The desire for larger breasts is centuries-old. Scandals come and go – in this case, the cause was an isolated case of criminal manufacturing practices. This has made women anxious but breast augmentation remains a very safe operation.'","Study polled 20,000 licensed plastic surgeons worldwide .

"Shoppers made their feelings clear about an EU ban on models of more than 1,600 watts by visiting stores or online sellers in their droves . The stampede to buy powerful vacuum cleaners intensified yesterday as retailers reported a fourfold surge in sales. Shoppers made their feelings clear about an EU ban on models of more than 1,600 watts by visiting stores or online sellers in their droves. Many have been stockpiling two or more high-power models to beat regulations that came into effect yesterday. The new EU directive is intended to reduce energy use, but it has infuriated the public, who say they’ll have to spend longer using the appliances. Online electrical retailer ao.com said weekly sales had soared 380 per cent compared with the first week of August. The most popular model was the 2,400-watt Bosch Pro Energy BSGL3126GB cylinder vacuum cleaner costing £99, which sold out yesterday. It currently has two models left in stock that are over 1,600 watts, but expects to have more this week. There was clear evidence of customers stockpiling vacuums, it added, particularly in the 2,000+ watt ranges, where 3 per cent of sales were generated by shoppers buying two or more. ‘We saw a huge surge in sales of corded vacuums over 1,600 watts over the weekend, with sales quadrupling,’ said head of small domestic appliances Leanne Beswick. ‘Having reviewed our stocking levels it looks like we still have a limited number of high wattage vacuum cleaners in our warehouse and we are expecting another two models to come back into stock this week.’ Sales at the Cooperative Electrical Shop over the past two weeks leapt by 129 per cent compared with the same period last year. Currys said sales were up 94 per cent compared with the same weekend 12 months ago. A spokesman added: ‘They have been flying off the shelves and that has been across the board – from uprights to cylinders.’ Scroll down for video . Under threat: Food blenders may also be targeted . Some 30 devices – mostly domestic electrical items – are facing overhauls to meet the EU guidelines, including: . Air conditioning in cars – blamed for increasing fuel consumption although critics point out the drag created by opening a window uses more energy. Window heaters and seat heating will also be looked at. Fitness equipment – many modern exercise bikes and rowing machines use electricity to generate resistance. Hairdryers – power savings of 30 per cent may be required, although salons argue they will spend longer drying hair. Blenders – smoothies and soups may take longer to prepare if new rules are introduced. Fax machines – under scrutiny despite all but dying out in homes as people switch to email. Photocopiers, printers and scanners are on the list too. Power tools – they could face changes despite the Commission’s report stating the potential improvements are ‘small’. Lawnmowers – all types, including electrical and petrol, could be affected. Patio heaters – a key target due to the amount of energy lost. Kettles – may have to be redesigned to switch off sooner or slash surface heat loss. Toasters – they waste power if one or more slots is empty. Tesco has previously reported sales rocketing by 44 per cent over the past fortnight with models selling out including the 2,300-watt Hoover Breeze BR2306. Argos said it had seen an increase in sales despite 97 per cent of its stock being compliant with the new legislation since July. Retailers can continue selling existing stock until it runs out but they cannot import more and manufacturers are no longer allowed to produce them. Vacuums will also have to carry ratings from A to G similar to those on fridges and washing machines, explaining energy use, cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors, and dust emissions. The crackdown affects five of the seven vacuums given ‘Best Buy’ status by Which?, and the consumer watchdog last week advised people to ‘act quickly’ before stocks of powerful models run out. A 2012 report by retail analyst Mintel found 76 per cent of consumers rated suction power the most important feature when buying a vacuum. Senior household care analyst Richard Caines said: ‘I’m not 100 per cent convinced it will save a lot of energy as if a vacuum is not providing as much suction it will have to be used for longer.’ The power of cleaners will be reduced further from 2017, when the maximum will be 900 watts.","Shoppers made feelings clear about ban on models of more than 1,600 watts .

"A devastated mother has spoken of her anguish at witnessing a teenager drown in a reservoir tragedy, not realising it was her own son. Melanie Goodship, 40, was walking her dogs when she saw a group of screaming teenagers struggling as the makeshift raft they were playing on began drifting out of control. The civil servant rushed to the group’s aid only to learn her son James, 17, had disappeared under the freezing water whilst attempting to get help. Mother: Melanie Goodship, 40, (right) witnessed a teenager drown in a reservoir tragedy, not realising it was her own son James, 17, (left) in the water . Help: James had tried to swim to get help when the raft he and his friends were playing on began to drift . 'When we were walking the dogs around the reservoir we saw all the commotion but not for one minute did we know it might be James until we saw a couple of his friends,' Ms Goodship said, speaking after an inquest into her son's death. 'I was trying to phone James but there was no answer but I was thinking it’s ringing so he can’t be in the water because it was ringing but what we didn’t know is his phones had been left on the side. 'My heart just sank but we couldn’t have done anything. We were too far away. By this time the air ambulance had landed. He must have been under for some time at that point.' James's body was found in the reservoir the following morning. Another teenager who tried to make the swim with him had to be treated for hypothermia. An inquest was told the accident occurred on June 22 this year, after James - who had just finished the first year of a plumbing apprenticeship - joined six friends for a summer’s walk around Lake Burwain in Colne, Lancashire. The group spotted the raft, made out of wood with plastic barrels underneath, by a jetty near a boathouse and decided to have a look. Scene: The accident occurred on June 22 this year, after James - who had just finished the first year of a plumbing apprenticeship - joined six friends for a summer’s walk around Lake Burwain in Colne, Lancashire . Desperation: Ms Goodship rushed to the group’s aid only to learn her son had disappeared under the freezing water whilst attempting to get help . One member of the group, Keaton Greaves, 16, told the hearing in Burnley in a statement that two girls, who were afraid of water, opted to sit on the grassy area and look after their friends' belongings including mobile phones. In a statement read to the hearing he added: 'We jumped down onto the wooden jetty onto the raft which was attached with a rope. But we drifted away from the shore towards the middle of the reservoir. 'Most of us tried to paddle with our hands but it didn’t work the current was quite strong forcing us the other way. I wasn’t scared or worried but I knew we had to get the raft back.' The inquest heard that after around an hour the group decided they needed to do something, and estimated the vessel was about 50 metres from the shore. Keaton said: 'I decided to try to swim to shore to get help. James said he was going to swim as well. I sat down on the edge of the raft and slipped into the water. I took a couple of strokes out into the water and James dived in after me.' He added that James, who was described as a good swimmer, had taken his T-shirt off but had kept his trainers on. Mission: A search and rescue operation was launched the day after James was last seen, and his body was recovered by underwater search units . Tributes: A floral tribute left at the reservoir, close to the spot where James drowned . Shock: Wellwishers arrive at the Burwain Sailing Club, close to where the teenager died . Mourning: Friends of the tragic teenager gather at the lake after his death in June . 'I started to feel exhausted, the weight of clothes weighing me down, pulling me down,' said Keaton. He added that the friends who were still aboard the raft started to call for him to come back and that James had been ahead of him. Keaton said that he began to make his way towards the raft swimming on his back whilst trying to keep his head up. 'I was so tired,' he said. 'I knew I wasn’t going to make it to the shore. I could hear James but I couldn’t see him. As I got near the raft I was really struggling. I have never felt anything like it, it just froze your body, I couldn’t move, it was horrible.' The inquest heard Keaton was pulled aboard and lay on the raft 'freezing cold' as his friends tried to cover him up. Family: Ms Goodship (in pink, centre), with her family (left to right), stepson Jack, husband Emlyn Parry, daughter Lauren, James's stepmother Joanne, and his father Pete . The statement added: 'I heard the others shouting ""go on you’re nearly there"" I couldn’t see where he was. I did hear him shout for help at one point. I knew when I heard him he was in trouble because I knew how he felt. The others on the boat saw him go under, when he didn’t come up everyone started crying.' Keaton was rescued by emergency services and was taken to Airedale Hospital. A search and rescue operation was launched the following day at 5.30am and James’ body was recovered by underwater search units. Eyewitness Paul Bleasdale said: 'I heard a splash in the water and I decided to call the local police because I knew the water was cold. I told the operator there were kids in the water and appeared to be having fun and they said they’d send someone when they could. Tragedy: Ms Goodship (left) said she hoped other teenagers would learn from her son's death, while teenager Keaton Greaves had tried to swim with James, but ended up having to be treated for hypothermia . 'Soon after the laughs changed to shouts and I saw two kids swimming, it looked as if one had gone in after the other.' He added that he heard a male voice say 'I can’t do it' as he swam towards the two girls sat on the side who became 'hysterical, crying and shouting'. Paying tribute to James, his uncle Paul Goodship told the inquest: 'James was a fun loving lad who loved life always had a smile on his face and managed to put a smile on most other people’s face too. 'He was always full of adventure and even though he was very brash and sometimes wanted to be Mr hardman he was a very caring lad. It’s probably been one of the hardest parts of his character and nature that we have missed. He brought people together he just had that sort of personality and character.' Support: Ms Goodship is supported by a friend as she leaves the inquest into James's death . East Lancashire Coroner Richard Taylor recorded a verdict of accidental death. 'This appears to me to be a very very cruel accident that has taken this young man away,' he said.

"She one of the world’s richest sportswoman worth £60million But that hasn’t stopped Serena Williams walking off with scores of the distinctive purple and green towels provided to players at Wimbledon. The five-times singles champion, who suffered a surprise defeat in this year’s quarter finals, takes up to eight towels with her after matches. She is said to stuff them into her kitbag after arriving on court and then ask for more from court attendants. Mementos: Serena Williams reportedly can't have too many Wimbledon towels . Her sister Venus, who has not played this year because of injury, is said to be similarly keen on picking up a towel in previous appearances at the All England Club. ‘The Williams sisters have been seen to put towels in their bags as soon as they get on the court,’ an observer said. Sister Venus, who is not competing at the championships this year, is also said to be fond of the towels . ‘There have been games where Serena has probably left with more than eight.’ Traditionally, players have two towels . laid neatly on their chairs at the side of the court at the start of a . match. Some will then ask for more. Another couple of towels are set down whenever a tie resumes following a rain delay. The benevolent All England Club has a policy of not demanding towels back from any players who want to keep them. However, some players - notably world number one Novak Djokovic - always hand back their towels at the end of every clash. For a visitor to the grounds, a large towel emblazoned with the Wimbledon logo, costs £28 at shops at the grounds. Rising British star Laura Robson, 19, she took a generous approach, leaving two children speechless with delight as she handed them her towel as she left court after her third round win. At the end of Andy Murray’s quarter final clash on Wednesday he threw his towel into the crowd, prompting a near scuffle between two fans who both grabbed an end of it. This year observers have noticed growing trend for players to ask for a towel to mop their brows between points In the ladies quarter-finals, the worst offender was Na Li, who stopped 16 times in one set, and 35 during the entire match, which she lost. One of Andy Murray’s former coaches suggested that ‘towel breaks’ are a ploy to buy time. Former British player Mark Petchey, who . coached Murray into the top 50 of the world rankings, said: ‘It is . certainly not that hot at a lot of these tournaments - it hasn’t been at . London or Paris for the last two Grand Slams. The benevolent All England Club has a policy of not demanding towels back from any players who want to keep them . ‘It’s part of players’ routine, like bouncing the ball three times. It’s all a bit of a nervous tic. All players look for their comfort zone. A lot of it is all about composing yourself.’ He suggested that former British number one Greg Rusedski had started the trend. A spokesman for Wimbledon said: ‘The players are requested to give the towels back but can keep them if they want to.’","The five-times champ is said to stuff them into her bag after arriving on court .

"Missile-carrying robot drones have been used for years by the U.S Army - but they’re deployed against large targets and need a runway to take off from. Now a new YouTube video shows that in the future, drones could also carry out the close-combat duties of foot soldiers. In the clip ‘FPSRussia’, whose Call of Duty videos and real-life weapon demonstrations have earned him a cult following, shows off a quadrotor – a mini helicopter with four rotors - outfitted with a machine gun. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Air we go: FPSRussia demonstrates a hover drone outfitted with a machine gun . The machine is controlled by a tablet computer and FPSRussia explains that a camera on front of the quadrotor gives him a ‘birds’ eye view’ of the target. It’s capable of flying at 30mph and at an altitude of a quarter of a mile, but for the demonstration, FPSRussia takes the drone a short distance away to a group of life-size dolls positioned on a slope. The machine gun is capable of firing 100 rounds a minute – and it’s not long before the figures are completely destroyed. Heat is on: The clip shows the gun's muzzle flash as we see the drone's point of view . Explosive: The drone hovers over the remains of the dummies . A huge muzzle flash leaps across the screen when we see the drones’ view. Next, FPSRussia shows off the machine’s ability to get into a tight spot and flies it through the window of a mocked-up room. There four dummies sitting around a tablet are destroyed while FPSRussia stands by at a safe distance. He explains that the 'prototype' he's apparently flying in the video could well be turning up in a future Call of Duty installment.",A similar drone 'may appear in the next Call of Duty game'
"When Hollywood creates villains, they are usually gangsters or psychopaths – or a combination of the two. The baddies in a new film starring Dame Judi Dench are nuns – and the real life order of sisters portrayed in the box office hit are furious. The critically-acclaimed release Philomena has been accused of distorting the truth in its depiction of an order of Irish sisters as ‘uncaring and heartless’. Search: Dame Judi and co-star Steve Coogan in the film in which she plays a mother searching for her son who was put up for adoption in America . They say they are made to look like ‘villains’ in the film, which tells the real life story of Philomena Lee and her attempts to find her adopted son. Nuns inform Philomena, played by Dame Judi, that she should be punished for becoming pregnant as a teenager – and then obstruct her attempts to find her son, burn records and are paid to put children up for adoption. The film is based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee by journalist and former New Labour spin doctor Martin Sixsmith, played on screen by Steve Coogan. In the story, the young woman is sent to a home for unmarried mothers run by Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in County Tipperary and her son is put up for adoption in America. But Sister Julie Rose, the order’s assistant congregational leader, said the film ‘does not tell the whole truth, and in many ways is very misleading’. The order were denied a copy of the script and failed in attempts to delay the film’s release so they could respond, she told The Tablet magazine. Bonding: Judi Dench with Philomena Lee who she plays in the film 'Philomena' who was sent to a home for unmarried mothers run by nuns . They were also informed that one scene – in which Sister Hildegarde McNulty accuses Philomena of giving in to her ‘carnal desires’ – was being added. Sister Julie said: ‘The film company confirmed to us in writing at an early stage of production that a second meeting with Sister Hildegarde would be incorporated into the film and dramatic licence was the reason given to us.’ She said Sister Hildegarde, who died in 1995, had in fact been instrumental in reuniting many mothers with their children. Sister Julie also denied the order destroyed any records and said they never received any payment in relation to adoption. The film, which was released last Friday, took £1.51 million at the UK box office in its opening weekend. A spokesman for film-maker Pathe said although some scenarios were changed for ‘dramatic purposes’, the story was ‘materially true’. He said the nuns were contacted twice over the screenplay last year but they failed to send a formal reply. ‘As the nuns have themselves acknowledged, the film is not a documentary,’ he said. ‘If the congregations have seen the film, they will know that it is not a diatribe against the Catholic Church but it does challenge the Church’s instinct to conceal the original wrong and to refuse to apologise.’","The Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary accuse it of distorting the truth in its depiction of the Irish sisters as ‘uncaring and heartless'

"Humans may have been a late arrival to a universe full of alien life, a new theory has claimed. Harvard astrophysicist Abraham Loeb believes that exoplanets warmed by radiation from the big bang may have been teeming with life just 15 million years after it occurred. The earliest evidence of life on Earth so far found dates from 3.8 billion years ago, around 700 million years after our planet formed. Microwave radiation from the whole sky, captured by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite revealing relic radiation, otherwise known as the Cosmic Microwave Background, created in the fireball of the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. Harvard astrophysicist Abraham Loeb believes that exoplanets warmed by radiation from the big bang may have been teeming with life just 15 million years after it occurred. Cosmic background radiation (CMB) fills the universe in every direction. It is the afterglow of the big bang streaming through space these last 14 billion years. It the oldest light we can see and the farthest back both in time and space that we can look. Changes in the light emitted when the Universe was just 400,000 years old could helped scientists understand the structure and evolution of the universe. U.S. researchers have conducted an extensive analysis of the thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang, also known as cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Their analysis supports the theory that the Big Bang occurred between 13.798 and  0.037 billion years ago, creating our subsequent Universe. 'When the universe was 15 million years old, the cosmic microwave background had a temperature of a warm summer day on Earth,' he told Space.com. 'If rocky planets existed at that epoch, then the CMB could have kept their surface warm even if they did not reside in the habitable zone around their parent star.' Cosmic background radiation (CMB) fills the universe in every direction. It is the afterglow of the big bang streaming through space these last 14 billion years. Experts have focussed their search for life in habitable zones around stars in areas known as the 'goldilocks zone'. These regions are considered to be just the right distance away from stars for liquid water, a pre-requisite for life as we know it, to exist. Signs of life? Kepler-62f, a super-Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun, located about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. Kepler-62f orbits its host star every 267 days and is roughly 40 percent larger than Earth. The first planets would have been bathed in the warm CMB radiation, Loeb argues it would have been possible for them to have liquid water on their surface for several million years. He says that one way to test his theory is by searching in our Milky Way galaxy for planets around stars with almost no heavy elements, which would mirror these early planets. 'The feasibility of life in the early universe can be tested by searching for planets with atmospheric bio-signatures around low-metallicity stars in the Milky Way galaxy or its dwarf galaxy satellites,' he wrote.

"Ray Wilkins, sacked as assistant manager by Fulham this week, has revealed he is suffering from the same debilitating illness as Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher. Former Manchester United and Chelsea star Wilkins, 57, has been fighting the chronic bowel disease ulcerative colitis since 1990 along with periodic bouts of depression. Wilkins has decided to reveal his medical condition in order to save his career in football management and rebut drinking allegations. Revealing all: Ray Wilkins revealed he is fighting the chronic bowel disease ulcerative colitis . Claims were made from inside Fulham . that Wilkins was the worse for wear in the dug-out for the 3-2 home . defeat by Liverpool last Wednesday — a result that led to manager Rene . Meulensteen and his  back-room staff’s dismissal. Wilkins explained that his medical condition can give him the ‘woozy’ appearance of being drunk. ‘I need to control the ulcerative colitis with strict medication, which  I had not done before  the Liverpool game,’ he said. ‘That is the reason I didn’t return to the dug-out after half-time as I needed to be close to a toilet. Keeping quiet: Wilkins said he did not tell Rene Meulensteen about his illness that make him appear 'woozy' ‘Unfortunately . I can look the worse for wear but it is nothing to do with drink. I did . have verbals with Brendan Rodgers, but it was nothing. ‘I . was face to face with (Fulham) chief executive Alistair Mackintosh and . the owner Mr Khan straight before the game. And if I had been unable to . carry out my duties, they had the right to sack me on the spot. I most . certainly hadn’t been drinking on the train before the match.’ A clearly agitated Wilkins was involved in a touchline row with Liverpool boss Rodgers at half-time. And . Fulham sources suggested that Wilkins had arrived at Craven Cottage not . in the best condition having earlier travelled to and from Birmingham . by train to watch Fulham Under 21s play Aston Villa. Watching on: Fulham owner and chairman Shahid Khan (centre) and chief executive Alistair Mackintosh made changes to the managerial team last week . Tough time: Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher also suffers from ulcerative colitis . Wilkins . was banned from driving for three years after a drink-driving . conviction when he was found to be three times over the legal limit. Fulham . insiders also said that Meulensteen had tolerated Wilkins not being in . the best shape for work on other occasions - seen as one of the reasons . for the Dutchman being sacked after just 13 Premier League games. The . club’s sensitivity about the conduct of their management that night was . due to American owner Shahid Khan being in attendance. And some of the . players had voiced concern about whether Wilkins was well enough to . carry on coaching. Wilkins . added: ‘I didn’t want to make a fuss about my illness, I didn’t tell . Rene. Darren Fletcher said how hard it was to tell his team-mates. But I . desperately want to carry on in football and there’s no chance of that . happening if everyone gets the wrong impression that I have a drink . problem. ‘I was very stupid . about the drink-driving and I have had trouble with depression on . occasions. But not since I was back in football. I was so excited about . the Fulham challenge, but it’s all about results.’ Also . leaving Fulham along with head coach Meulensteen, technical director Alan Curbishley and . Wilkins are first-team coaches Jonathan Hill and Mick Priest, who were . brought from Manchester United by Meulensteen. *************************************************** .

"The riddle surrounding the woman who was discovered in Mexico nine years after going missing took a bizarre twist today after police cast doubt on claims she'd ever been kidnapped. Family and friends of Connie McCallister – now 25 - have repeatedly told how their loved one was abducted by her abusive Mexican boyfriend, drugged and smuggled across the border, aged just 15. They say they have had absolutely no contact with her until she finally got in touch in mid-September, revealed she had split up with the older man she had gone to Mexico with and was now married with three children and was working on a farm in an undisclosed location. Riddle: Wausau police today said Connie McCallister never told them when she was found in September that she had been drugged and smuggled across the Mexican border by an abusive boyfriend . Contradiction: Karen Zubke of the Trinity Lutheran Church wipes a tear from her eye as she and Judy Weise talk about raising funds to bring Connie back. They are hurt by claims doubting Connie's story of her ordeal . Aided by the local church, her aunt Florence Volska has launched a $5,000 fundraising campaign to help bring Connie, her husband and the three young girls back to her home in Athens, Wisconsin. They hope to have her back in weeks after filling out all the necessary paperwork. She has been in regular Skype contact with Connie for the last seven weeks - when her long-lost niece first made contact. Yesterday she described the moment she saw her niece on a computer screen for the first time in nine years. She said: 'I cried for an hour. I literally cried. And it was her. I thank God everyday.' But Wausau police force seemed to contradict the family's version of events, saying Connie left with her older boyfriend Freddie Ruiz voluntarily - or at least that is what she told them at first. They added Connie had spoken to her mother Cindy days after she was 'kidnapped' and told her she was 'fine'. She also apparently told her mother she was not going to reveal where she was going. Cindy then apparently indicated to police the pair were probably going to 'flee to Mexico', according to the statement. Her mother is believed to now be living in Florida and has had no contact with her daughter since her re-emergence. Detective Captain Greg Hagenbucher said: 'For the past several years Wausau Police have heard rumors that Connie McCallister was in Mexico, was married and had three children with her husband, who was not the boyfriend she left with.' Hagenbucher added: 'This week the Waussau Police Department was made aware of a fundraiser that will take place at Trinity Church in Athens. 'We were told that the fliers being passed out articulated that Connie McCallister had been kidnapped, drugged and abused in Mexico with her first husband. 'This was not the information Connie related to law enforcement when we talked to her in September of this year. The statement went on to explain police also made contact with Connie on Skype yesterday to ask her about the allegations. Memories: Connie, center, with her brother Morris, left, sister Jeannie, and mother Cindy, back. Connie has yet to speak to her mother since being discovered by a missionary in September . Call for help: Police say they issued the statement questioning the version of events after they saw fliers for a soup drive spelling out Connie's shocking ordeal . It said: 'We asked her about the information being reported... that Connie told officers that in 2004 she left Wausau voluntarily with Freddie and ended up at a party somewhere in the Milwaukee / Chicago area. 'She said while at the party she thinks someone may have drugged her as the next day she woke up in Mexico. 'Connie offered no explanation why she did not tell us this several months ago when we Skyped with her. 'The Wausau Police Department will work with the FBI and family in an attempt to return Connie and her family safely to the U.S. Once she returns to the U.S. we will discuss with Connie the circumstances of her leaving Wausau with Freddie Ruiz.' Today's statement came just hours after the two McCallister family friends championing Connie's safe return told MailOnline how they believed Ruiz had spiked a bottle of Mountain Dew, drugged Connie and smuggled her across the border. The family say Connie texted her elder sister Jeannie on the night of the party, saying, 'He won't let me come home'. There is still a warrant out for Ruiz's arrest relating to an alleged sexual assault on a minor, which happened just weeks before the pair disappeared. The police and the family and their friends are at odds over another claim. Karen Zubke and Judy Weise, of the Lutheran church, also told how Connie had reached out to police in Wausau five years ago, but officers dismissed it as a hoax. Family: Connie, left, with her siblings Jeannie and Morris. They had recently moved to Wausau when she disappeared after their father's tragic death from cancer . Vanished: Connie and her family lived above this bakery in Athens when she struck up a relationship with Ruiz, described by her friends as a 'sexual predator', who claim he should have been arrested when social services became aware of the relationship in 2004 . Karen said: 'Freddie was a sexual predator and Connie was kidnapped. People ask why she didn't escape sooner considering she was in three different relationships and escaped Freddie, then another abusive man, but no one knows the real situation. 'She was only a child when she was kidnapped and after years of mental and physical abuse, maybe she didn't have the strength to try to get away. 'Also, she did contact the police five years ago, but they thought it was a hoax. I don't know what the circumstances were. Maybe the man she was with found out and pressured her into not going through with it. 'But the fact she tried to reach out and failed will have knocked her confidence as well. The family are obviously very frustrated that the police didn't believe Connie.' When asked about the people in the community who doubt Connie's story, both Karen and fellow fundraiser Judy are obviously extremely upset. Karen said: 'Connie's childhood wasn't perfect and Cindy didn't have all the assets that maybe she needed, but it is very frustrating that we have to deal with all these sharks who are trying to doubt what happened. 'All we want is to get Connie back where she belongs, back in Athens with her family. We appreciate anyone who wants to help, but we are not begging.' She added: 'We all warned her about Freddie, but he was older and was probably telling her everything a 15-year-old girl wanted to hear. But the authorities should have stopped it. When social services got involved they told the family to move half an hour away to Wausau. 'That does not seem like good advice to me. What they should have done is arrested Freddie. 'Connie was always a little girl, but she was a fighter and when she realized something was wrong that night in Milwaukee she would have put up a struggle, that is when we believe Freddie drugged her.' But it is not just the police who are skeptical about Connie's abduction story. Mary Marohl, who owns the bakery below the McCallister's family apartment in Athens said she knew the family very well. And she is in no doubt that Connie left of her own accord. She also said Cindy struggled to look after Connie, Jeannie and their younger brother Morris, after her husband died of cancer when Connie was five. Mary said: 'Her husband had died and Cindy wasn't really a great mother. The town pretty much took care of them. People in the town think she just took off with Freddie. 'Most people don't think she was kidnapped. I personally didn't think she had been. I talked to her all the time because she helped out here after school and she wasn't happy with the situation with her mother. Reunited: Connie, pictured with her siblings and uncle, has completed the paperwork and hopes to be back with her family in Wisconsin by Thanksgiving . 'Her mother had a boyfriend at the time, a younger guy who came to live with them. For a while he wasn't working at all and she didn't like that. Also, her mother didn't like Freddie. I thought he seemed nice and it seemed to me he gave her more stability than she got at home. She loved him.' Connie McCallister made contact with her family after a church missionary told the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children that she had been spotted. The honor-roll student at Athens High School weighed just 98lb at the time and had been working as a field laborer in Mexico under a new name, after escaping two abusive relationships. Miss McCallister apparently escaped from Freddie but ended up with another violent man who fathered her first child. At one point he beat her so badly that she was taken to hospital, where someone helped her get a new identity, Ms Weise, who works for Trinity Lutheran Church in Athens, said. Her aunt Florence said that with no proof of her identity, and unable to speak Spanish, Miss McCallister struggled to contact her family. She worked in fields and later married and had two more children. Since making contact with her family she has barely left her home in Mexico, because she is apparently scared of reprisals from Freddie. That is also the reason why her relatives will not reveal her exact location.","Connie McCallister was found by church missionary three months ago in Mexico with three children and a husband .

"On or off duty? Justice Sir Mark Hedley admitted to making a life-or-death decision over the phone while at the zoo . Judges are making life-or-death . decisions about vulnerable people based on casual phone consultations . with  council lawyers, it was revealed last night. The . secretive Court of Protection has an out-of-hours service which is . being routinely used by local authorities wishing to ‘rush through’ decisions. In many cases, . judgments are handed out over the phone with the family not being . consulted and proper evidence not being made available. One . judge – who was on a trip to a zoo – has even admitted to giving a . decision on his mobile phone about whether a Jehovah’s Witness with . learning difficulties should get life-saving treatment. In . another case, a judge allowed an Asian woman with learning difficulties . to be forcibly removed from her home on the grounds of ‘flimsy’ evidence that she was going to be forced into marriage. After . a few weeks in care, the woman was returned home but the family sued . and were paid thousands of pounds in compensation by the local council. Out-of-hours rulings, a system meant to be used only in urgent cases, . are being routinely abused, an investigation has revealed. Instead . of being subject to open court, judges on call between 4pm and 9am are . consulted over the phone by a single barrister often without the . involvement of families. Written evidence is rarely used out-of-hours and the proceedings are not always recorded. One legal expert told the Independent newspaper: ‘There is no real investigation out-of-hours over whether [an action] would be appropriate. It’s just the local authority ringing the judge up, the parents are not part of the proceedings, so it’s on full trust that the barrister gives their side. ‘We can see from the transcripts that judges don’t ask enough questions and the barristers don’t tell them the other side of the story.’ In the dark: Wanda Maddocks was  jailed 'in secret' for trying to remove their father John Maddocks from a care home . The Daily Mail has led calls for the reform of the Court of Protection which is shielded from the scrutiny of the public and the Press. John Hemming, chairman of the Parliamentary Group on Family Law and the Court of Protection, will today call for an inquiry into the out-of-hours service by the Justice Select Committee. He described the system as an ‘appalling’ one in which ‘the family are not told about it, but the judge is called to rubber-stamp a decision.’ He said: ‘I was shocked when I found out this was going on. ‘The court is there to protect people, . but it seems more concerned about protecting local authorities and . their incomes. I’ve been to see ministers several times and they’re just . not interested in looking at individual cases. ‘They turn a blind eye to the problem – it’s a disgrace.’ A . retired High Court judge has also attacked the system which does not . publish the results of its hearings, making appeals nearly impossible. Sir Mark Hedley said: ‘There are very few cases which can’t wait until Monday morning. For example, any cases involving turning off of machines can wait.’ In another case he said he was asked to make a decision while on a family outing to Chester Zoo. He said: ‘The transplant case was made in the back of a car outside Chester Zoo, my wife said it was the only time she’d heard me making judgments.’ Sir Mark claims the procedure causes a problem for transparency because rulings are often not recorded so transcripts are not available. He added: ‘There’s a duty to keep a note [of hearings] I’ve kept them but I’ve never been asked for them.’ Last month the Mail highlighted the case of Wanda Maddocks, 50,  who was secretly jailed for five months for attempting to move her 80-year-old father from a care home where she believed he was at risk. Secrecy rules forbade anyone to name Miss Maddocks , her father, the Stoke-on-Trent councillor who asked for her to be locked up or the social worker who gave evidence against her. She served six weeks before finally being released.","Judges make crucial decisions based on casual phone consultations .

"The extinction of large mammals including a five-tonne sloth, has caused the Amazon rainforest to grow more slowly than it did, according to scientists. Research into how soil nutrients are spread throughout the Amazon basin has shown there is a shortage of certain minerals, including phosphorus, because animals are now smaller and produce less waste to fertlise the earth. The rainforest used to benefit from copious amounts of waste produced by South America's 'mega fauna' - large animals that roamed the rainforest thousands of years ago. The rainforest used to benefit from copious amounts of waste produced by South America's 'mega fauna' like this ground sloth (illustrated) that roamed the rainforest thousands of years ago . Scientists from Oxford University believe the absence of large herbivores, such as ground sloths and glyptodonts, which were a little like supersized armadillos, has helped cause the imbalance of soil minerals. Christopher Doughty, who wrote the study published in Nature Geoscience, said the shortage of minerals created by a lack of mega fauna is having a big effect today. He told The Independent: 'The Eastern Amazon in particular is . phosphorus-limited which means that if you added phosphorus to the . region the trees there would grow faster.' 'When you had big animals roaming more . than 12,000 years ago, there would have been wider dispersal of minerals . such as phosphorus and the trees there would have been growing faster . than they are today.' Research into how soil nutrients are spread throughout the Amazon (pictured) has shown there is a shortage of certain minerals, including phosphorus, because animals are now smaller and produce less waste to fertlise the earth . Ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths, in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra . The term 'ground sloth' is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered, as opposed to the extant 'tree sloths' Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more . The study said that around 98 percent of nutrient-dispersal has disappeared since the mega fauna died out, which was roughly at the same time humans lived in South America. While minerals are carried to the rainforest floor from the Andes via the Amazon river and its many streams, they are not always widely distributed and tend to collect in muddy soil in the flood plains. However, this was not always a problem as the ground sloths and mega fauna fertilised the soil with their manure tens of thousands of years ago. They used to wander the rainforest, carrying minerals essential for plants to higher ground, while their dead bodies also provided food for the forest, according to Dr Doughty. Scientists from Oxford University believe the absence of large herbivores, such as ground sloths and glyptodonts,which are a little like super-sized armadillos, as illustrated, has helped cause the imbalance of soil minerals . He told The Independent the research proves the extinctions of these ancient animals affects the area today and that the larger the creature, the bigger its role in spreading nutrients, which helped the environment thrive. Dr Doughty said: 'Most of the planet’s large animals have . already gone extinct, thereby  severing the arteries that carried . nutrients far beyond the rivers into  infertile areas.' The scientists likened the wandering mega fauna in the rainforest to arteries in humans that carry essential nutrients to where they are needed. The Amazon has been under threat from deforestation for years and this man-made action is preventing the spread of nutrients even more. Fertilisers used on the land by farmers and the act of keeping livestock in pens also stops the dispersal of minerals in the region.

"Caterham  say they are going ahead with preparations to race in Japan this weekend despite bailiffs seizing items from their factory in  on Wednesday. The troubled team issued a statement ahead of the race at Suzuka that condemned 'unfounded and unsubstantiated rumours concerning actions against 1MRT, the entrant and owner of CaterhamF1'. 'An action was threatened yesterday against a supplier company to 1MRT. This company is not owned by 1MRT and it has no influence over the entry of CaterhamF1 or the entrant,' it added. Caterham will race at the Japanese GP this weekend despite having baliffs visit their factory on Wednesday . 'Contrary to uncontrolled rumours, all operations are currently in place at Leafield and the race team is doing its preparation in Japan.' A senior source close to the team confirmed that bailiffs had visited the Leafield factory but said it was not the first time and denied reports that the facility or computer servers had been closed down. 'All this nonsense is nothing to do with the Formula One team... it is 100 percent not related to the F1 team or any company or subsidiary of the F1 team,' added the source, who did not want to be identified. A list of seized items to be sold at a public auction, likely in mid-October, appeared later on the bailiffs' website www.thesheriffsoffice.com. They included a 2013 Caterham F1 'test car', steering wheels, drilling and machining equipment, wheels and assorted pit lane items such as jacks and starters. Car parts 'due for Japan 2014' were also listed, although the race cars and main items of freight would normally have arrived in Japan some time ago with teams already setting up their garages in the paddock on Wednesday. Caterham's decision to compete at Suzuka means home favourite Kamui Kobayashi will get to race . Caterham changed ownership in July when Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes sold the struggling team to an unidentified 'consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern investors'. Since then the new owners have been embroiled in legal action with some 40 former employees who accuse them of unfair dismissal. There have also been issues to resolve with suppliers. Caterham, who are last in the championship standings and have never scored a point, said in a statement in July that the staff in question were employed by a supplier rather than the Formula One team itself. The team's Leafield site was previously used by Super Aguri and Arrows, two now-defunct teams that collapsed due to financial problems. Caterham are bottom in the F1 constructors championship standings with zero points . Japan's Kamui Kobayashi and Sweden's Marcus Ericsson are Caterham's current drivers, with Spaniard Roberto Merhi due to take part in Friday first practice at Suzuka. Team principal Manfredi Ravetto had been quoted only this week as saying Caterham planned to take a new front wing to Suzuka that they hoped would make their cars far more competitive. He also told Autosport that work on the 2015 car was proceeding in the Toyota wind tunnel in Cologne, despite the team having to contend with 'surprises' inherited from the previous ownership. 'In this team, the surprises never end,' he said. 'If we keep having 10 surprises per day then we have to keep doing 10 miracles per day. So my concern is what happens when we run out of miracles.'","Caterham have confirmed they will race at the Japanese GP this weekend .

"Revelation: The permanent operation that will leave the man substituting food for liquid was sanctioned by health workers rather than a court of law . An autistic young man had all his healthy teeth removed on the orders of doctors, it was revealed yesterday. The permanent operation left the man facing the rest of his life subsisting on liquids or forced to use dentures to chew solid food. The decision to carry out the procedure and inflict a long-term disability was not tested in a court of law or approved by a judge, according to evidence provided by lawyers who work in the secretive and controversial Court of Protection. Instead it was taken in secret after it is believed the Court of Protection ruled that the man was mentally unfit to decide for himself. Health workers said the procedure was necessary to stop the man from harming himself. The harsh and radical dental operation was disclosed in files presented to a House of Lords committee investigating the Court and the law which gave birth to it, Labour’s 2005 Mental Capacity Act. It follows the scandal last month over the decision of a Court of Protection judge to order a forced caesarean operation on a pregnant Italian woman who had been detained under mental health laws after suffering a breakdown at Stansted airport. The treatment of Alexandra Pacchieri - whose baby was taken by Essex social workers for adoption in Britain - led to a renewed wave of calls for greater openness in the courts and from social and health workers who take life-changing decisions about families and patients behind closed doors. The removal of the autistic man’s teeth came in a submission to peers by a group of lawyers who work regularly in the Court of Protection, which was set up by Labour’s mental capacity law to take decisions on health care and finance for people too ill to decide for themselves. Led by barrister Victoria Butler-Cole, the lawyers said that among the defects of the law and the Court is ‘confusion about what counts as serious medical treatment and when health professionals need to go to court to obtain declarations.’ Investigation: The news emerged as the House of Lords investigates the Court of Protection made by Labour . They added: ‘One example is a case in which an autistic young adult had all his teeth permanently removed to stop him self-harming, without the Court’s involvement.’ In keeping with the secrecy surrounding such decisions in the NHS, children’s and adult social work departments, and often in the family courts and the Court of Protection, no further details of the incident were discussed in nearly 2,000 pages of evidence which has now been published by the Lords committee. The lawyers called for a string of reforms to the Mental Capacity Act and the Court of Protection, including changes to the ‘deprivation of liberty’ powers which allow judges to order someone to be detained in a care home. The Lords committee, which is expected to report this year, was also told about research into the workings of the Act commissioned by the Department of Health, but never publicised. Researchers from Bristol and Bradford Universities said aspects of the law were ‘worrying’ and criticised the way the Court of Protection decides when someone has no capacity to think for themselves. The case follows that of Alessandra Pacchieri who was forced to have her baby by caesarean section then removed from her by Essex social services and put up for adoption . They said there was confusion over ‘the distinction between unwise decisions and a lack of decision making capacity.’ The case of the young man whose teeth were taken out comes after months of growing disquiet at the high-handed and secretive behaviour of Court of Protection judges. Concerns were raised in April last year after the Daily Mail revealed that a judge had jailed a woman called Wanda Maddocks for contempt of court after she tried to take her father away from a care home where he had been ordered to stay. Miss Maddocks, who had no lawyer to represent her in court, was imprisoned secretly and no-one was allowed to know her name until the Mail investigated the case. The most senior family court judge, Sir James Munby, has since ordered that no-one should ever again be jailed in secret. He is also pressing judges to break the routine Court of Protection secrecy by publishing judgements. New rules are also expected this year to allow greater public access to Court of Protection hearings.","Permanent operation leaves man on liquidised food for life .

"With her drooping whiskers and doleful eyes, Pixie certainly looks like the cat that got the sour cream. Now the two-year-old pedigree Persian is being touted as Britain’s saddest-looking feline and a worthy challenger to US internet sensation Grumpy Cat. Grumpy, who was born with dwarfism and an underbite, giving her a disgruntled expression, has built a £60million empire thanks to her unfortunate looks. Scroll down for video . Two-year-old Pixie the pedigree Persian is touted as the next Grumpy Cat and Britain's saddest-looking feline . If Grumpy could smile, it would surely be wiped from her whiskers were she to learn of her rival in the miserable moggy stakes. And it seems Pixie could well surpass Grumpy’s success because of her bubbly personality – in contrast to her mournful looks. Owner Sophie Batt, 24, said: ‘People always say how sad Pixie looks, but she’s so cute and cuddly, and has a huge personality. ‘She does have her glum moments and goes off in lots of sulks, but she’s anything but sad.’ The hairdresser, who lives in Bristol with her boyfriend Jason Brown, 34, bought Pixie as a kitten for £350. ‘When we saw her miserable face we just fell in love immediately,’ said Miss Batt, who has previously only posted a handful of photographs of Pixie as a kitten on her Facebook page.

"Australia has prompted outrage by becoming the first Western country to ban visitors from Ebola-hit areas of Africa, amid warnings the restrictions could make it harder to fight the deadly disease. In a dramatic move announced today, the government said it would refuse entry to anyone travelling from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leona - the countries most severely hit by the epidemic - despite there being no known cases of the virus in Australia. But a Sierra Leone official condemned the ban, describing it as 'counter-productive' and 'too draconian'. Scroll down for video . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison (left) said Australia would ban travel from Ebola-hit parts of Africa - but UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon (right) has warned restrictions could hamper efforts to deal with the crisis . Liberia's president urged Australia to reconsider its decision, while UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned travel restrictions could seriously hamper efforts to beat Ebola. The unprecedented moves comes amid calls from Republicans for a travel ban to be imposed in the U.S - something which has so far been resisted by Barack Obama. Announcing the decision, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament the government's processes were 'working to protect Australians'. Under the strict regime, Australia will not issue new visas and will cancel temporary ones. Those with permanent Australian visas yet to arrive in the country will only be allowed to fly after a 21-day quarantine before their departure. Mr Morrison also announced the government would be suspending its humanitarian programme in the affected countries. Ebola has killed almost half of more than 10,000 people who have been diagnosed with the disease. The World Health Organisation has warned the actual death toll is a lot higher. But public health officials have urged against travel bans, warning it could leave the stricken countries further isolated from international aid. They also warn it would not entirely prevent people in Ebola-hit areas from entering other countries. Critics say the move will prevent the stricken countries from getting the international aid they need to recover from the epidemic. Pictured: Health workers in Liberia carry a woman suspected of contracting the virus . Ebola has killed almost half of more than 10,000 people diagnosed with the disease although the true toll is far higher, according to the World Health Organisation . Alpha Kanu, Sierra Leone's information minister, said today that Australia's move was 'too draconian'. He said that measures at Sierra Leone's Freetown airport had successfully prevented anyone flying out of the country with Ebola. He said: 'It is discriminatory in that...it is not (going) after Ebola but rather it is ... against the 24 million citizens of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Certainly, it is not the right way to go. 'This measure by the Australian government is absolutely counterproductive.' Anthony Banbury, head of the U.N. Ebola Emergency Response Mission (UNMEER), added: 'Anything that will dissuade foreign trained personnel from coming here to West Africa and joining us on the frontline to fight the fight would be very, very unfortunate.' Barack Obama has so far resisted calls for a similar ban to be implemented on U.S. borders . Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Brian Owler also told CNN: 'It's not necessarily a very well-focused decision. 'The bigger picture needs to be on our preparedness at home but more importantly our involvement in West Africa itself, putting doctors and nurses and other logistical elements in place and trying to combat the crisis there.' After the annoucement, Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf urged Australia to reconsider its travel ban. She said: 'Anytime there's stigmatisation, there's quarantine, there's exclusion of people, many of whom are just normal, then those of us who are fighting this epidemic, when we face that, we get very sad.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott has previously refused to send Australian medical teams to help battle the epidemic in West Africa, until it has guarantees that any Australian who becomes infected received adequate medical treatment. He said he was 'carefully considering' requests from the U.S and Britain to follow their lead and send workers. Airport checks have identified more than 800 people who entered Australia from West Africa and who could have been in Ebola-stricken areas. But none have required a hospital visit after arriving. Meanwhile, the growing paranoia in the U.S. has fuelled calls to impose a travel ban and has become a bone of political contention. Prominent Republicans have called for a ban, including John Boehner, the House speaker. But Mr Obama reiterated he would not impose a ban, unless advice from experts changed. There are no direct flights from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea to the U.S and only a handful of international flights to Europe. People flying out of these countries are screened before they board a plane. Earlier this week, North Korea announced it was closing its borders to international tourists because of concerns about Ebola. A travel ban was never adopted in the 2003 SARS outbreak,  although it affected about 8,000 people.","Government will refuse entry to those from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone .

Last night the actor's heartbroken daughter released a statement about the death of her father. She wrote: 'My family has always been private about our time spent together. It was our way of keeping one thing that was ours, with a man we shared with an entire world. But now that's gone, and I feel stripped bare. 'My last day with him was his birthday and I will be forever grateful that my brothers and I got to spend that time alone with him, sharing gifts and laughter.

Robin Williams with his oldest son Zak and second wife, Marsha Garces Williams pictured in 2002 . Robin Williams hanged himself on Sunday night while his wife slept in a nearby bedroom. He had several superficial cuts on the inside of his left wrist. A pocket knife with what appeared to be dried blood was discovered nearby. The Mrs Doubtfire and Good Will Hunting star's suicide comes after decades of battling depression and alcohol and drug addiction. He was also facing significant financial pressures and admitted he was selling a $35million estate in Napa because he could no longer afford it. Williams struggled with depression and an addiction to cocaine and alcohol for decades. Last month the married father of three was back in rehab 'fine-tuning' his sobriety in a year where he had been working on six movies and a TV series. Robin Williams was a secret online gamer who was such an avid player, he named his daughter Zelda in honour of his favourite game. Since his death on Monday, the online gaming community has been paying tribute to the Oscar winning actor who was said to be a huge fan of games such was World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. One of his favourite series of games is believed to be The Legend of Zelda, and he even named his daughter Zelda Rae, after the princess character in the game. Robin Williams with his daughter Zelda in 2011, when they appeared in a commercial for Nintendo together . In 2011, Mr Williams appeared in a commercial for the Nintendo game alongside his daughter. The advert shows Zelda trying to get her father's attention as he plays the game and ends saying that he had been a fan of Zelda since 1987. Mr Williams had spoken of his love of online gaming describing it as like 'cyber cocaine'. He told the Telegraph in 2011: 'Especially if you're online playing against other people, it's totally addictive, you get lost in the world.' Now plans are said to be place for World of Warcraft to memorialise the actor as a non-playing character in the game after 11,000 fans signed a petition to urging the game's makers to pay tribute to the 63-year-old. The petition was created on the website change.org and urged game makers Blizzard to create the character. It stated: 'It was reported that Robin used to play on the Mannoroth server, and was something of a troll in trade on good days or when anonymity allowed. 'Because of his presence within our community, we the players of ‘World of Warcraft’ are asking Blizzard to kindly create an NPC within the game that memorializes the actor/comedian.' It then urged Blizzard to 'Create an NPC within World of Warcraft to memorialize the late Robin Williams, an avid World of Warcraft player, and one of the funniest men alive.' After amassing 11,000 names, Twitter user Celestalon, who is said to be on the game's designers tweeted that they were 'taking care' of the fans' request. There have also been calls to dedicate the next Zelda game to him.","Zelda Williams, 25, made an appeal to 169,000 followers to report two users .

"Hundreds of paedophiles will escape justice because Britain’s crime agency failed to act on a cache of information. Senior investigators at the National Crime Agency (NCA) sat on the names of 2,345 suspects for at least 14 months, it emerged last night. By the time local police forces got involved, little action could be taken because of the time that had passed, and some of the suspects had even died. Senior investigators at the National Crime Agency, pictured, sat on the names of 2,345 suspects for at least 14 months, it has emerged . The list of names was provided by Canadian police in July 2012 after they smashed a notorious online store that specialised in indecent images of naked children. Officers in Toronto identified thousands of potential paedophiles and passed the names to forces worldwide via Interpol. But the NCA apparently left the file gathering dust until November 2013, when it passed it on to police forces. Even then some forces failed to act for months. Many cases have now had to be abandoned because the information was simply out of date. Bedfordshire Police said the ‘age of the intelligence and the timescale difference’ meant that in three cases magistrates refused to grant search warrants. Hertfordshire Police said no action was taken against five suspects due to the ‘age of the offence and lack of supporting evidence’. In West Yorkshire, 60 suspects were identified but none was arrested, even though further investigations were carried out. The force did not explain why. The failings were highlighted this week as it emerged paedophile Martin Goldberg, 46, a deputy headteacher at a boys’ school in Southend, was only visited by Essex Police last month, ten months after the NCA passed on his name from the list and more than two years after the Canadian inquiry, known as Project Spade. Teacher John Cowell, who was named on the list . Police and national crime investigators did nothing about a paedophile teacher for 18 months. John Cowell, 60, from Essex, who had worked at a £26,000-a-year boarding school and as a school bus driver, was on the list of around 2,500 British suspected paedophiles identified by a Canadian inquiry and handed over to the UK’s Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre in July 2012. The NCA only sent the names out to police forces in November last year – and Essex police then waited until January to visit Cowell at his home in Thaxted. Last week, a court finally barred him from working with children in classrooms or on school buses. Police found 228 indecent images and videos of young boys, aged 10 to 14, at the retired teacher’s home. But Cowell, who pleaded guilty, walked free from court with a three-year community order. He is the only one of 35 suspected Essex paedophiles identified by Canadian police to be convicted. Most remain under investigation. Cancer specialist Myles Bradbury, who was found guilty of child sex offences last month, was not arrested for 16 months after his name was given to the NCA. The revelations came as children’s charity the NSPCC said police are struggling to cope with the mountain of child abuse images they have to deal with. Experts said they are ‘gravely concerned’ that some police forces do not have enough resources to investigate online abuse. Doubts were also raised about the NCA. Critics said the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, the unit of the NCA that received the Canadian intelligence in 2012 and which was absorbed into the NCA when it took over in 2013, is also struggling to keep up with the flood of child abuse cases. The failings are a huge embarrassment for the fledgling NCA, created by the Government as Britain’s answer to the FBI. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it is now assessing whether to launch a full inquiry – which would be the first the NCA has faced. John Carr, a child safety expert and Home Office adviser, said police must act on sensitive intelligence when it is ‘fresh’. He said: ‘The whole reason for the existence of CEOP and the NCA is to handle and pass on information like this to local forces to act on. ‘I can only imagine it is the sheer volume of reports that is behind this, there cannot be any other reason as this is what they are there to do. ‘This information needs to be fresh and police need to take action as soon as they possibly can to catch offenders and safeguard children.’ A spokesman said one line of investigation is why the NCA did not refer the case to the watchdog in November 2013 when it first realised the CEOP unit had failed to pass on the list of names to police forces. The NCA declined to comment on the latest revelations and instead referred to a statement that it had posted on its website three weeks ago. Deputy Director Phil Gormley has ordered a review of how the material was handled by CEOP before the NCA took full control in October 2013.","Investigators at National Crime Agency sat on the names of 2,345 suspects .

"The iPhone 6 has so underwhelmed consumers that even smugglers who illegally shipped them to China are having to slash their prices. Criminal gangs who queued up for days in the US and Hong Kong to get the Apple devices have been forced to charge less than half because of falling demand. Users in China now see the iPhone as just another smartphone and not the special product that it once was. Scroll down for video . The iPhone 6 has so underwhelmed consumers that even smugglers who illegally shipped them to China are having to slash their prices. Pictured is a smuggled sets of Apple iPhone 6 are displayed after being found hidden in a tea leaf box at the customs in Shenzhen, near the Hong Kong border, Guangdong province . The New York Times reported that smugglers were shipping devices to China because they do not go on sale there for a few weeks and they are already out elsewhere. In the past that has meant they can sell them for far higher prices than normal because consumers wanted to be the first to get them. But at one electronics market in Beijing, one retailer was selling the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus for between the equivalent of $1,060 (£650) and $1,436 (£885). Just after the phones came out they were selling on the Chinese black market for $1,960 (£1,200) and $2,450 (£1,500) each, a decline of 54 per cent and 58 per cent respectively. Criminal gangs who queued up for days in the US and Hong Kong to get the Apple devices have been forced to charge less than half because of falling demand. One iPhone seller in Beijing’s northwestern tech hub Zhongguancun said: ‘Stocks of the iPhone 6 are way too high right now’ If the trend continues it could mean the end of smugglers queuing up at Apple stores at the launch of the newest iPhone, making unlikely companions to the tech-savvy 20-somethings who form the bulk of the line. Pictured are queues of people waiting to get their hands on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus earlier this month . Legitimate retailers are currently selling iPhone 6 at a starting price of $649 (£539) and 6 Plus for $499 (£619) One iPhone seller in Beijing’s northwestern tech hub Zhongguancun said: ‘Stocks of the iPhone 6 are way too high right now’. China isn't selling the latest iPhones, despite the country being Apple's biggest market. Soon after Apple’s announcement of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, China’s big three telecom providers removed their online pre-order forms for the new phones. The move followed an announcement by Apple that the phone's introduction China had to be delayed. Apple is yet to respond to a request by MailOnline about why the announcement was made. Some experts have speculated that Apple isn't selling in China due to iPhone 6 leaks, while others suggest it is due to supply chain issues. The 21st Century Business Herald, a Shanghai-based business publication, claims the problem is that Apple hasn’t yet received a 'network access' license from Chinese regulators. This wasn't an issue for Apple previously and why this is the case now has yet to be revealed. The main route to China for smuggled iPhones is from Hong Kong - gangs persuade consumers to buy them using their official ID cards, only one of their agents to collects the device from the Apple store. When prices were good smugglers could expect to make around $163 (£100) per device but now one iPhone seller said that his losses will be ‘big’. Another factor which has put of smugglers is a crackdown by police in China who have been raiding boats carrying iPhones before they land at ports. If the trend continues it could mean the end of smugglers queuing up at Apple stores at the launch of the newest iPhone, making unlikely companions to the tech-savvy 20-somethings who form the bulk of the line. The reports of declining demand in China contradicts with Apple’s own figures which said that it had 10 million pre-orders worldwide for the iPhone 6. In reviews it was dubbed the ‘most exquisite smartphone ever’ but since then consumers have reported a number of issues including how the phone bends easily and stays out of shape. There have also been problems with iOS 8, the latest operating system, with some users complaining that it stopped them being able to make calls. Apple has released a fix for their devices. The company declined to comment on the smuggling.

"Drivers face having their cars  fitted with devices that slam on the brakes if they go over the speed limit, under draconian new road safety measures being drawn up by  officials in Brussels. All new cars would have to include camera systems that ‘read’ the limits displayed on road signs and automatically apply the brakes. And vehicles already on the road could even be sent back to garages to be fitted with the ‘Big Brother’ technology, meaning that no car in the UK would be allowed to travel faster than 70mph – the speed limit on motorways. All new cars would have to include camera . systems that 'read' the  limits displayed on road signs and . automatically apply the brakes . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is said to have ‘erupted’ when the proposals landed on his desk and has told his officials to block the moves. He has been asked by the European Commission for his views ahead of the publication of formal proposals this autumn. The EC’s Mobility and Transport Department hopes to roll out the ‘Intelligent Speed Adaptation’ technology (ISA) as part of a new road safety programme, which aims to slash the death toll from traffic accidents by a third by 2020. Every year, more than 30,000  people die on the roads in EU countries and a shocking 1.5 million are injured, of whom 120,000 are left permanently disabled. Mr McLoughlin has stressed to officials that the UK already has one of the best road safety records in Europe . Experts estimate that 6,000 of those deaths could be prevented if drivers obeyed speed limits. But Mr McLoughlin has stressed to officials that the UK already has one of the best road safety records in Europe. The number of people killed on our roads fell last year from 1,901 to 1,754 – the lowest figure since records began in 1926. By comparison, 3,645 people died in France and 3,657 in Germany. The ISA technology works in one of two ways – either through satellites, which communicate limits automatically to cars from databases, or by using cameras to read road signs. It then deploys one of three controls to slow drivers: ‘advice’, in which the motorist is simply notified of the speed limit by an alarm, giving them the opportunity to slow down; ‘driver select’, which arrests the car’s speed but gives the driver the option of disabling the device; or ‘mandatory’, which would not let a driver breach the speed limit under any circumstances. Mr McLoughlin was told by his officials that new vehicles will soon be designed with camera and satellite technology automatically incorporated, making it ‘cheap and easy’ to add speed-control systems. Last night, a Government source said Mr McLouglin had instructed officials to block the moves because they were a ‘violation’ of British motorists’ freedom. The source said: ‘This has Big Brother written all over it and is exactly the sort of thing that gets people’s backs up about Brussels. We are about getting a better deal for Britain, not letting EU bureaucrats encroach further into people’s lives. ‘The Commission wanted his views ahead of plans to publish the proposals this autumn. He made it very clear what those views were.’ No car in the UK would be allowed to travel faster than 70mph - the speed limit on motorways . A spokesman for the AA said at lower speeds the new technology could actually create dangers. He said: ‘If you were overtaking a tractor and suddenly needed to accelerate to avoid a head-on collision, you would not be able to.’ But he said he would support a system of audible speed alerts. A spokesman for the EC said: ‘It is part of the Commission’s job – because it has been mandated to do so by member states, including the UK – to look at, promote research into and consult stakeholders about new road-safety technology which might ultimately save lives. This is done in close co-operation with member states and the UK has generally supported such efforts.’ The spokesman added: ‘There is a currently consultation focusing on speed-limiting technology already fitted to HGVs and buses. ‘Taking account of the results, the Commission will publish in the autumn a document by its technical experts which will no doubt refer to ISA among many other things.’","Cars would include cameras that ‘read’ the limits displayed on road signs .

The chart shows 380 of the top 1000 most commonly used words in profiles on OkCupid. 'Working with data crunchers at the dating sites, we analyzed the 1,000 most popular words on both men and women’s profiles, tabulated the most popular movies and TV shows, and crunched stats on what people consider their best feature vs. what features their potential dates are attracted to,' the team at Wired said. The team also analysed the 400 most popular profiles, and found there were keys to which profile pictures worked best. A previously study found an outdoorsy full-length shot is best for men, while indoor body pictures get women 60% more message. The new study added that gay men enjoyed particular success with an outdoor shot, and that selfies were only acceptable for women.

"A loving mother was spied on by teachers and accused of making up her child’s autism after she demanded more help in the classroom. Jenny Lockley was suspected of having Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP) – in which sufferers fabricate illness in a child to draw attention to themselves – because she insisted her son Sam had needed support. Nursery school teachers dismissed three diagnoses of autism, one by a world-renowned doctor, and put the 39-year-old through an  experience she described as a ‘witch hunt’. 'Witch hunt': Mother Jenny Lockley, who faced the accusations with her autistic son Sam and daughter Laura . Mrs Lockley is just one of dozens of parents of autistic children who have contacted The Mail on Sunday saying teachers or social workers have accused them of fabricating their offspring’s disorder. This is despite statistics showing there are only about 64 cases a year in Britain of MSBP, while one in 100 children are thought to be autistic. In some cases children have been put on the child protection register – meaning the authorities believe them to be at ‘serious risk of harm’. In a few, parents even claim their children have been taken away from them and wrongly put into care. Almost 800 people have signed an internet petition calling on the National Autistic Society to act against the accusations being used as a ‘bullying tactic’ by schools and local authorities. Mrs Lockley, a single mother-of-two from Solihull, West Midlands, said: ‘This scandal has to be exposed before more damage is done.’ She was never told she was being investigated as a ‘Münchausen’s mum’ – and only found out after she demanded council documents about herself using the Freedom of Information Act. Secret meetings: Staff at Lady Katherine Leveson School in Solihull, West Midlands, watched Mrs Lockley coming into school with her two children . Lucy and Chris Mallows say they were accused of fabricating their daughter Josie’s autism as a result  of school-gate gossip. They faced an ‘extremely stressful’ two-week investigation by social services into claims of Münchausen’s Syndrome by Proxy. When Josie started nursery at her Cheltenham school, the couple informed staff that she had been diagnosed with a form of autism. But after staff said Josie was fine in nursery, mothers started talking, according to the couple,  and rumours began to circulate that Lucy had invented Josie’s autism. Worried, the head outlined her concerns in a secret letter to the Mallows’ GP, who passed it on to social services. Lucy, 34, received a telephone call telling her that she and her husband, 35, were under investigation as the head believed Lucy was ‘seeking attention through the child’. The case was dropped after the social worker concluded the allegations were baseless. The Mallows are now moving  to a different area. Consultant paediatrician  Dr Jo Jones, who diagnosed Josie as autistic, said: ‘The Mallows’ story is appalling. The school’s concerns were based on a group of trouble-making mothers.’ The headteacher at the school declined to comment. ‘What I discovered horrified me,’ she said. She learned that staff at Lady Katherine Leveson Church of England Primary School in Solihull secretly watched her coming into school with Sam and older daughter Laura, now 18, in a bid to prove their case. They also held a secret meeting about her parenting skills during which ‘child protection issues’ were raised. Mrs Lockley said: ‘I was gutted to find out what they had engaged in, which was basically a witch hunt. My world fell apart.’ She said that problems started when she tried to get Sam, who is now 12, assessed for special needs, only to be told he was fine. During a six-year battle, she spent £10,000 on private medical reports proving that her son needed extra help, and £14,000 on lawyers to force Solihull Council to fund a place at a private school for autistic children. In 2010, she succeeded. Carol Povey from the National Autistic Society said: ‘Many families across the country struggle to get a diagnosis of autism for their child, and report that local authorities and professionals can lack the  necessary understanding of the lifelong developmental condition. In some cases, this can lead to allegations of poor parenting, inappropriate care or even fabrication. ‘It’s vital that assessments are carried out by professionals who have an in-depth understanding of autism.’ A spokesman for Solihull  Borough Council said: ‘We do not comment about the circumstances of individual cases. ‘Lady Katherine Leveson School has been contacted  but does not wish to comment either.’","Jenny Lockley was suspected of having Münchausen Syndrome by Proxy .

"Abuse: Police said Google had tipped them off about the internet use of 41-year-old John Skillern, pictured . A convicted child abuser has been charged with fresh offences after saying Google detected indecent images in his Gmail account. The internet giant used sophisticated scanning techology to catch John Henry Skillern, 41, as he allegedly tried to send three explicit photos of a young girl to a friend. Skillern has now been charged with the possession and promotion of child pornography in a victory for Google's sometimes controversial e-mail scanning policies. Police in the city of Webster near Houston, Texas, said they were tipped off by Google on July 11 and obtained a warrant to search Skillern's electronic devices. They searched his home in Houston on July 24 and found the offending images, according to a crime report released by Webster Police. Detective David Nettles, from the Houston Metro Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce, said Skillern used a Gmail account to e-mail a friend three explicit photos of a young girl. 'They got a tip from Google, basically Gmail,' he told KHOU 11 News. 'He was trying to get around getting caught with just keeping it inside of his e-mail. I would never be able to find that.' A police statement said Skillern was held in custody after being charged. It added: 'After forensics were completed on evidence collected at the residence, the Webster Criminal Investigation Division filed one count of possession of child pornography and one count of promotion of child pornography on Skillern through the Harris County District Attorney’s office. 'Each count had a bond of $100,000 for a total of $200,000.' Innovation: David Nettles of Webster Police told KHOU 11 News he would never have known about the images . Skillern is a convicted child abuser whose name already appears for the rest of his life on the Texas Sex Offenders' Register. He was jailed for 20 years in 1994 for an aggravated sexual assault on an eight-year-old boy, according to the online database. Although the crackdown on child abuse images has been welcomed, Google's wider e-mail scanning technology has proved controversial and sparked a number of lawsuits. In April it stopped scanning e-mails on Google Apps for Education, used by 30million people in the academic world, amid claims the information could be used for targeted advertising. Since 2008 Google has used technology known as 'hashing' to tag known child sexual abuse images. That allows copies of those images elsewhere to be detected by computer software without humans having to view them again. Each image is encrypted, catalogued and assigned a unique ID number which is then tested against images being sent from Gmail accounts to see if they match. More sophisticated ways of detecting abuse images are being detected all the time. Last summer Google revealed it was launching a Child Protection Technology Fund worth $2million to encourage the development of more precise software. Source: Google . And last year it was sued by a group of citizens who claimed scanning e-mails to produce advertising violated the Federal Wiretap Act. The lawsuit was led by Keith Dunbar of Bowie County, Texas, who claimed e-mails he sent to Gmail users from a non-Google account were scanned by the firm. His argument was that by not signing up to Gmail himself, he had never given permission for the scans to take place. Google's terms of service clearly state that e-mails are analysed, and that any lawbreakers will be reported to the authorities. 'Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection,' the terms say. Information the firm gathers can be passed on for a number of reasons, including to 'protect against harm to... our users or the public as required or permitted by law'. A blog by the firm last year added: 'The Internet has been a tremendous force for good - increasing access to information, improving people’s ability to communicate and driving economic growth. But like the physical world, there are dark corners on the web where criminal behavior exists. Tool: Google spends millions of dollars developing ever more sophisticated tools to detect child abuse photos . 'In 2011, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children’s (NCMEC’s) Cybertipline Child Victim Identification Program reviewed 17.3 million images and videos of suspected child sexual abuse. 'Behind these images are real, vulnerable kids who are sexually victimized and victimized further through the distribution of their images. It is critical that we take action as a community - as concerned parents, guardians, teachers and companies - to help combat this problem. 'We’re in the business of making information widely available, but there’s certain “information” that should never be created or found. 'We can do a lot to ensure it’s not available online - and that when people try to share this disgusting content they are caught and prosecuted.'","Police near Houston, Texas, said John Skillern tried to send three images .

"The area you live in can have a huge effect on your education and outlook. And now researchers believe people can be made less racist by simply moving to live in ethnically-mixed areas. An international study found that white people develop ‘passive tolerance’ of minorities in mixed areas, even if they have no direct contact with them. A recent international study found that white people develop 'passive tolerance' of minorities in mixed areas, such as central London (pictured) even if they have no direct contact with them . Professor Miles Hewstone, director of the Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict, said governments could create more ‘harmonious neighbourhoods’ by doing more to encourage different ethnic groups to mix. ‘If two white people with identical views went to live in different postcodes for a year, the person in the neighbourhood with more mixing between ethnic groups would likely leave more tolerant,’ he said. ‘We would see this effect even if they never personally spoke to people from other ethnicities. ‘The size of this “passive tolerance” effect on people's prejudice is of the same order as the effect of passive smoking on lung cancer risk.’ The Oxford University-led study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal, is based on seven studies carried out in England, mainland Europe, the United States and South Africa between 2002 and 2011. Professor Miles Hewstone, director of the Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict, said governments could create more 'harmonious neighbourhoods' by doing more to encourage different ethnic groups to mix . It found that even highly prejudiced people who did not mix with those of different ethnicities became more tolerant the longer they lived in mixed areas. The scientists suggest simply seeing white strangers ‘interacting positively’ with ethnic minorities is enough to reduce racial prejudice. Professor Hewstone, the report's senior author, said: ‘Astonishingly, we don't just see reduced prejudice among people who have direct contact with ethnic minorities. ‘It isn't even confined to those whose friends have contact with minorities. Simply living in a neighbourhood where other people are mixing with minorities is enough to reduce racial prejudice.’ He added: ‘Governments should do more to encourage different groups to mix with each other, as we now know that this reduces prejudice not just in individuals but throughout entire neighbourhoods. ‘Social interventions that aim to increase contact between groups will help to establish more tolerant social norms in society. In the long run, this should lead to more harmonious neighbourhoods.’ Brain scans could soon be used to detect whether or not people are racist, scientists say. Last year, researchers found that brain scans were able to pick up on differences in the way that people with implicit negative racial attitudes viewed black and white faces. Racial stereotypes have previously been shown to have subtle and unintended consequences on how we treat members of different race groups. But research shows race biases also increase differences in the brain's representations of faces. Psychologists Tobias Brosch of the University of Geneva in Switzerland and Eyal Bar-David and Elizabeth Phelps of New York University examined activity in the brain while participants looked at pictures of White and Black faces. By examining patterns of brain activity in the fusiform face area - a brain area involved in face perception - the researchers were able to predict the race of the person that the participant was viewing, but only for those participants with stronger, negative implicit race attitudes. This, the researchers said, implies that people with stronger, negative implicit race attitudes may actually perceive black and white faces to look more different than others who held no such prejudice.","A study found led by the University of Oxford found that white people develop ‘passive tolerance’ of minorities in mixed areas .

"Never before has our world been so connected or convenient. With the click of a button we can change the channel, drop the heat or book a trip to Barbados. Our food is grown, produced and plated-up to our exact liking. Drive-thrus, home deliveries, medical advances and the right to education. In a short space of time, life has transformed to one of convenience. So why are we so stressed, overweight and dreaming of being free? Have we forgotten something our ancestors knew? Africa's Hadza tribe is the closest we'll get to looking into that past. On the banks of Tanzania's Lake Eyasi, in the north of the country, lives the world's last hunter-gatherer tribe. They don't grow food, raise livestock or build permanent shelter. Instead they live a life unchanged for more than 10-thousand years. Their world is one of ultimate freedom - something modern society can barely imagine and is unlikely to ever experience. Let alone have the skills in which to stay alive. Text messages and phone calls don't exist. Nor cars and electricity. No jobs, bosses, timetables, social or religious structures. No laws, taxes and incredibly, no money - the closest thing to currency is the occasional trade for a pair of shorts or sandals with a neighbouring tribe. We spent our time with the Hadza hunting baboon, a daily activity for the men, in what is a hot, harsh climate. Their landscape is precariously packed with thorny bushes, poisonous snakes and man-eating lions. But a successful hunting expedition is the difference between eating or going hungry. Scroll down for video . A young Hadza boy (left), wearing feathers in his hair,  prepares for the day's hunt while an another holds a pigeon-like bird he killed with a homemade bow and arrow . All weapons used for hunting by the Hadza people are handmade with materials found around Tanzania's Lake Eyasi . About one-thousand Hadza still live in caves around Tanzania's Lake Eyasi in Africa's Great Rift Valley. Just south of here some of the oldest fossil evidence of early Hominids were discovered. By all modern standards, the Hadza shouldn't really exist. They remain an anomaly. A tribe time has forgotten. They do not engage in conflict, and have no memory of infectious outbreaks or starvation. Their population never exceeds numbers that cannot be sustained through hunting or gathering. The Hadza diet is simple. Meat - including birds, baboons, antelope and buffalo - killed by hand-made bows and arrows, crafted in-between hunting trips. Their language is believed to be the oldest still-spoken language known to man ... a rhythmic dialect punctuated by clicking sounds. A linguist's dream. Unlike the modern-day office dweller, the Hadza enjoys an extraordinary amount of leisure time. Their 'work' - hunting for food - take up around five hours of their day. And over all these thousands of years, they've left little more than a footprint on their land. The Hadza represents a part of the world's cultural make-up, which has all but gone. But the greatest tragedy is they may also represent what we've all lost. The Hadza show us how to track animals, from baboon to snakes to lions, but we have to run to keep up - they don't pander to westerners one bit . The Hadza are hugely skilled with their handmade bow and arrow - we have a go and barely get the arrow to go three feet in front of us . In the morning the boys and men gather in a circle to sharpen their homemade spears and smoke tobacco through a pipe - this is the most social part of their day . Hunters head out wearing baboon skin wraps - they must earn the right to wear these by proving themselves to be a capable hunter; and a baboon skull .

"It has been dubbed 'Tinder for planes' - and promises to let you meet fellow passengers on your flight while you're still in the air. Called Wingman, it was created by 24 old New York copywriter Gabe Whaley. The app will use in-flight wifi or bluetooth to connect people, and is about to begin testing. The Wingman app hopes to bring a Tinder-like dating experience to the skies . Wingman works in a similar way to Tinder. Users create a profile with their picture, first name, age, occupation, flight number and the airline they’re traveling with - and whether they’re traveling for business or pleasure. The app then displays a list of travelers on the same flight, and if you find one attractive, you can opt to start a conversation. 'The beta, much like the final version, will be extremely simple,' he told MailOnline. 'To create your profile, you simply provide a photo, your first name, age, and occupation. 'All the info you provide at your discretion. 'Once you board a flight, you will input your flight number, airline, and whether you are traveling for business, pleasure or both.

"A talented 18-year-old Maine student who died in February after a routine dental procedure was killed by a rare flesh-eating bacteria, a medical examiner has ruled. The death of Benjamin LaMontagne was a result of complications of necrotizing fasciitis after having surgery to remove two impacted wisdom teeth, Mark Belserene of the medical examiner’s office concluded. The Long Island teen died at home in his mother's arms on February 22. His obituary listed the cause of death as complications from oral surgery, according to The Bangor Daily News. Tragic: Talented high school musician Benjamin Edward LaMontagne died in his mother's arms in the early hours of February 22 after contracting a rare bacterial infection following a routine dental procedure . Commonly known as 'flesh-eating bacteria', necrotizing fasciitis ravages muscles, fat and skin tissue. It typically enters the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut or scrape. Necrotizing . fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but . extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to . something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy . skin, muscles and fat. The . disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a . minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that . kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so . virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms . include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading . bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock . are also common complications. Sufferers . must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given . powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can . become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. But about . a quarter of victims will lose their lives to the disease. The disease can be caused by several types of bacteria, most commonly group A Streptococcus. Infections from group A strep are usually easily treated, but in some cases produce toxins that can destroy the tissue they infect. Dr. John Molinari, infection control expert for the American Dental Association, said they are extremely rare. 'I have not heard of anything like that, with necrotizing fasciitis as a result of routine oral surgery extractions,' he said. Dentists and oral surgeons follow well-established protocols to limit infection, including sterilizing instruments with heat and wearing gloves, masks and eyewear, which takes care of the 'overwhelming majority of what could happen', Molinari said. Benjamin's mother Lynn first called for assistance around 1am on Saturday February 22 when Benjamin had stopped breathing. The teen had reportedly suffered some typical swelling and pain following the procedure and by Friday it had intensified. But by the early morning hours, he was dead. Dr . Thomas Dodson said that in 20 years of surveys at the Massachusetts . hospital he used to work at, not a single death was recorded in patients . who had wisdom teeth extracted. The dentist, who is chair of the Department of Oral . and Maxillofacial Surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle, . had not reviewed Benjamin's case but has decades of experience. 'I’m . trained as an epidemiologist, and I can’t say I’ve even ever read . [about a death] anywhere,' he told the Portland Press Herald. 'The best part about him was that he did his own thing, he went his own way,' said LaMontagne's closest friend Christian Cilley (left). 'You could either jump on the train or watch it fly by' The . Long Island community where Benjamin's family live were left . reeling by the unexpected death of the honors student who had been . accepted at Pennsylvania's Sunderman . Conservatory of Music. The teenager, who played bass clarinet and enjoyed jazz, was a dedicated student who also enjoyed sailing and lobster fishing. 'If anybody could say they had a . complete life after 18 short years, it was Benjamin, which makes it all . the more painful to have him taken from us so soon,' Benjamin's father Peter LaMontagne told the Portland Press Herald. His school friend Christian Cilley, who would often busk with Benjamin in town, said: 'The best part about him was that he did his own thing, he went his own way.' The . 18-year-old fished for lobsters from his skiff and over the summer had . worked on a lobster boat. But music was his main passion, and he was one . of only two students to have received the merit scholarship for Sunderman Conservatory. Music teacher Julia . Frothingham, who taught Benjamin bass clarinet for six years at Cheverus . High School, said: 'I know he’s not my son, but I feel like I watched . him grow up. I’ll miss not being able to see where he goes from here.' Loss: Benjamin LaMontagne was an honors student at Cheverus High School .","Benjamin LaMontagne, 18, of Long Island, died on February 22 .

"A former medical researcher's conviction for poisoning his neurologist wife with cyanide should be thrown out because he was convicted solely on circumstantial evidence, his attorney has said. Robert Ferrante, 66, was this month sentenced to life in prison after  jurors in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, convicted him last autumn. Prosecutors said he laced Dr Autumn Klein's energy drink with cyanide in April 2013. Locked away: Dr Robert Ferrante, 66, pictured at court earlier this month where he was sentenced to life in prison after Allegheny County jurors found him guilty of poisoning his wife to death with cyanide . Appeal: An attorney for Ferrante, left, says prosecutors failed to show that Klein, right, had lethal amounts of cyanide in her blood, saying some experts concluded a sudden heart dysrhythmia could have killed her . Defense attorney Chris Eyster wrote in an appeal filed yesterday that prosecutors presented 'not one shred of evidence' that Ferrante administered poison to his wife. 'A conviction based on conjecture cannot stand,' he said. Mr Eyster also argued that prosecutors failed to show that Klein, 41, had lethal amounts of cyanide in her blood, citing disagreement among expert witnesses as to whether she died of the poison or a sudden heart dysrhythmia. As Ferrante was sent to prison for the rest of his life earlier this month, his mother-in-law said in a statement read in court that the murder had robbed her and her husband of their only child. 'The light of our lives has now been extinguished,' Lois Klein said. The statement went on to say: 'I certainly don't want to give him any credit but he has certainly ruined our lives. 'All she ever wanted to do was to be able to help people. People all over the world are now losers.' 'The light of our lives has now been extinguished': Dr Klein's mother, Lois (pictured in court February 4) said in a statement read during sentencing the murder had robbed her and her husband of their only child . Lois Klein and her husband, William, are now caring for their 8-year-old granddaughter, Cianna, in Maryland, according to the station WPXI. On November 7 last year it took jurors 15 hours of deliberations spread over the course of two days to find the medical researcher guilty of first-degree murder. Klein and Ferrante's 8-year-old daughter is now being raised by her maternal grandparents . Allegheny County prosecutors argued during Ferrante's high-profile trial that he deliberately laced his wife's creatine energy drink with cyanide. He had bought the poison through his lab using a university-issued charge card two days before she suddenly fell ill in late April 2013. Dr Klein died three days later at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, despite doctors' efforts to save her. His lawyers made the case that she might not have been poisoned at all, citing three defense experts who said that couldn't be conclusively proved. Ferrante said the cyanide he bought was for stem cell experiments he was conducting on Lou Gehrig's disease, because the toxin can be used to kill of neurological cells and thus simulate the disease in the lab. But prosecutors said Ferrante was a 'master manipulator' who concocted the plan to kill his wife after she pressured him to have a second child and because he may have feared she was having an affair or planned to divorce him. Ferrante did online searches on cyanide poisoning and how it might be removed by the medical treatments Klein received or detected by a coroner after her death. A spokesman for District Attorney Stephen Zappala Jr. said the argument for a new trial 'is based on issues that have already been litigated.'","Robert Ferrante was sentenced earlier this month to life behind bars .

"With Jose Mourinho’s talk of a campaign against Chelsea highlighted after Anthony Taylor’s refusal to award them a penalty in their last game and my Sportsmail colleague Martin Keown questioning Phil Dowd’s big-match temperament, the official went in to this match under a lot of pressure. His performance and that of his assistants was very good. Phil Dowd steps in as tempers flare following Paulinho's foul on Nemanja Matic . In the right position . Often criticised for a lack of mobility, Dowd used all of his experience to ensure he was in the right place to judge key decisions. He’ll never be the quickest around the pitch but knows the game and that came to his aid when caught well behind play when Eden Hazard broke away but was dispossessed by Federico Fazio. Keeping discipline . Getting through until the 65th minute before issuing a first yellow card always helps. The only player to escape when he should have been disciplined was Gary Cahill when he kicked out at Harry Kane. The FA could well act retrospectively to further frustrate Mourinho. Gary Cahill kicks Harry Kane while he is on the floor - something he could face retrospective action for . Dowd is on hand again as Jan Vertonghen (left) and Cesc Fabregas square up . Getting the big decisions spot on . Referees are judged on the big decisions and here Dowd did very well. Chelsea wanted a penalty when the ball hit Jan Vertonghen’s hand in the first half. But Vertonghen had his arm in a natural position and with his body weight holding him down he could not avoid contact with the ball. Spurs’ penalty cannot be disputed as Cahill missed the ball and brought Kane down inside the area. In the second half, Hazard appeared to be tripped by Fazio when clean through. Replays showed the Spurs man got the ball first and there had been no infringement. Overall assessment . An excellent performance in which the officials got every big decision right and did nothing to adversely affect the outcome of the game. Mourinho might do better to work with his defenders rather than focus on officials after this display, and perhaps his ‘campaign’ theory is merely an attempt to protect his stuttering team.

"Oliver Dowden, the Prime Minister's deputy chief of staff, said he spent most of his day on 'crisis management' One of David Cameron’s top aides has admitted spending most of his time on 'crisis management' after finding out what is happening in politics by listening to the radio. Oliver Dowden, nicknamed 'Olive' by colleagues in Downing Street, revealed he was 'surprised' on a daily basis by the behaviour of people in government. He used an interview in America to reveal he listens to Radio 4 each morning to 'hear what’s going on' before deciding what soundbites to feed to Britain’s ‘aggressive' media. The candid remarks will fuel the impression that Mr Cameron's young team in Number 10 struggles to get a grip on the news agenda. Party grandee Lord Tebbit said at the weekend: ‘The abiding sin of the . government is not that some ministers are rich, but that it seems unable . to manage its affairs competently.’ Mr Dowden, who studied law at Cambridge, said: 'I’m surprised on a day-to-day basis. There is no accounting for the conduct of individuals. ‘Most of my time is spent on day-to-day crisis management, ’ he Dowden told an American public broadcaster last month. ‘We’re not permanently in crisis, but dealing with the issues that arise on a day-to-day basis.’ Last week positive headlines for the government on falling unemployment, crime, inflation and NHS waiting times were overshadowed by a string of self-inflicted PR wounds. Mr Cameron’s pledge to force energy companies to put customers on the cheapest tariff unravelled, MPs’ expenses re-emerged in a fresh scandal on renting out homes and Defence Minister Andrew Robathan tried to get veterans from the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers thrown out of Parliament for clapping during a debate. On Friday night Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell finally resigned, more than four weeks after swearing at Downing Street police who told him to get off his bike. Hours earlier Chancellor George Osborne faced claims he was travelling in a First Class train carriage with a standard ticket and had to pay £189.50 for an upgrade. Both Old Etonians, Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have repeatedly face accusations of being out-of-touch. Mr Mitchell was replaced as Chief Whip by Sir George Young, who also went to Eton. On the run: Chancellor George Osborne, who was out jogging this morning, is the PM's political strategist but has been accused of being out-of-touch . Mr Dowden, who studied law at Cambridge University, was deputy campaigns director of the Conservative Party before joining lobbying firm Hill and Knowlton in 2007. A year later he returned to work as deputy director, political operations, reporting Andy Coulson. Number . 10 has repeatedly been criticised for apparently failing to predict the . direction of major news stories and appearing slow to react. Mr Cameron today revealed his exasperation at positive news stories being over-shadowed by government crises. The . PM said: 'We need to focus on the big picture. What actually happened . last week is that unemployment fell, inflation fell, waiting lists in . our hospitals fell, crime fell, the right decision was made about Gary . McKinnon. 'Those are the . important things that are happening in an economy where we've created a . million private sector jobs in the last two years. 'There . will always be people that will go on endlessly about process and . processology and Kremlinology and all the rest of it, what actually . matters is what is happening out there.' Andrew Mitchell resigned as Chief Whip on Friday, a month after a foul-mouthed rant at Downing Street police . Asked why it took a month for Mr . Mitchell to quit after his notorious confrontation with police in . Downing Street, Mr Cameron replied: 'It's the easiest thing in the world . as Prime Minister to just sack someone at the drop of a hat when . something goes wrong. 'I thought the right thing to do was to make sure there was a proper apology.' David Cameron has faced heavy criticism for a lack of direction in Downing Street . Mr Dowden is the Prime Minister's . deputy chief of staff, working under Chief of Staff Ed Llewellyn. Mr Dowden revealed he finds out what is . happening by listening to Radio 4. He said: ‘Of course, the first thing I . do in the morning, if I’m not woken up by my very young children, I . turn on the Today programme and hear what’s going on. ‘Hopefully we will have some sense of what’s coming up anyway, but often you’ll get surprised by what’s going on and working out with our media team about how we respond to that.’ Today the Prime Minister's official spokesman joked that he had 'offered to send him the grid' from Downing Street of the announcements and main news events happening each day. Asked if Mr Cameron is constantly surprised by the headlines, the spokesman added: 'All of us are surprised on occasion by what is happening in the news.' Mr Dowden works on ‘lines to take’ – soundbites handed to minsters and senior MPs on what Conservative party’s position is on the big issues of the day. In opposition he was part of the team which looked at all the expense claims of Tory MPs, which lead to several being demoted or forced to stand down. He said there was a ‘difficult balance to strike’ between press regulation and press freedom. ‘Much as we suffer at the hands of our aggressive press, that is a vital part of our democratic process,’ he added. He also admitted to being surprised at the ‘scale and speed’ of the London riots and said youth unemployment has been a problem ‘for a very long time’.","Oliver Dowden - nicknamed 'Olive' - spends most of his time on 'crisis management'

Now her sons have spoken out about their mother's charitable legacy, wishing the Diana Award a Happy 15th Birthday and praising its 'energy and passion'. Scroll down for video . Proud: The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry said their mother would have been 'proud' of the Diana Award . Writing in a joint foreword for a book celebrating the organisation's decade and a half, the two continued: . 'We believe, when encouraged and supported, that young people have the ability to change society for the better. 'We know that our mother - in whose memory this award was established - felt the same and would be proud of its achievements to date.' Along with working to tackle problems such as bullying and social exclusion, the Diana Award also runs training, mentoring and anti-bullying ambassador programmes. Its awards are presented to young people, including volunteers, carers and fund-raisers, who have a monumental impact on the lives of others. Much loved: William and Harry with their mother Diana, Princess of Wales on the Buckingham Palace balcony in 1986 . Close:  Diana, seen here with an infant William in 1983, dedicated much of her time to children's charities . 'Having met young people working with the charity in Newcastle and in London, we were struck in both cases by their deep and lasting sense of social responsibility,' added the princes. 'These young people were working hard to tackle the social issues that affected them - such as bullying or social exclusion - and the Diana Award empowered them to do more.' Among those being handed Diana Awards  at a reception at 11 Downing Street today were Ellie Louise Harris-Beard, 13, and Kyle Lewis, 18. Miss Harris-Beard, from Kidderminster, was handed the Diana Champion Fundraiser Award for helping to set up the charity Cords4Life to encourage umbilical cord donation. Her brother Charlie was treated using stem cells from an umbilical cord in 2011, although he tragically lost his fight against leukaemia last year. 'I was quite shocked,' said the schoolgirl of the moment she heard that she was to be given the award. 'I didn’t know what to say. It’s exciting.' Miss Harris-Beard, who has raised £25,000 for charity so far and was handed her award by JLS star, Oritse Williams, said she now plans to organise a fundraising ball. Close: The two princes remain close to each other and their father and support each other's work . All together: Most recently, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Charles turned out for Harry's Invictus Games . Encouraging others to take up fundraising, she advised people to 'just go and do it and do the best you can.' Her mother Fiona Harris-Beard said: 'Considering what we’ve been through, losing Charlie, I’m so proud of her. She’s so determined.' Fellow award winner, Kyle Phillips, 18, from Cardiff, got his Diana Champion Volunteer Award for his tireless volunteering. Along with a part time role at a greengrocer, Mr Phillips volunteers for more than 500 hours a year at school and leads a group to improve the literacy and numeracy of young boys - many of whom have behavioural or learning difficulties. 'It’s a great honour,' he said after receiving his award. 'It’s a real privilege to be recognised. I’m really just trying to help the youth in my community. Inspiring: William and Harry say they have been inspired by the Diana Awards volunteers they have met . 'Where I’m from, people think that it’s very stereotypical being a teenager - gangs and smoking - but I want to show them it’s not like that. 'I get up at six o’clock every morning and go to work and finish at 8.30 and make my way over to the school. My mum’s really proud of me. She loves what I do and how I help out others.' His mother Jane Phillips added: 'It’s not every day you get the opportunity to go to Downing Street. I’m extremely proud.' Prime Minister David Cameron, who is patron of the Diana Award, added his voice to the chorus of royal praise for the charity. 'I am honoured to be a Patron of this wonderful living legacy to the late princess which recognises young people for their contributions to society,' he said in a statement. 'I want to congratulate everyone involved on this special 15th anniversary and I look forward to seeing thousands more young people recognised and inspired in the years and decades ahead.'","William and Harry have paid tribute to the charity set up in Diana's name .

"NASA approved a $100,000 investment that pushes the envelope- not to mention sound barriers- when it comes to plane design. The space organization approved the hefty fund to allow for further development of a new type of aircraft called the supersonic plane concept. The plane is created in a way that will allow it to take off from the ground, and then turn on its side once it reaches supersonic atmospheric levels so that it can continue its flight into the uppermost parts of space. Scroll down for video . Phase one: When the plane takes off from the ground and is traveling in the subsonic atmosphere closest to the Earth, it needs to use the longer wingspan to get itself off the ground . Phase two: Once the plane reaches supersonic levels of the atmosphere, the long wingspan creates too much drag so it turns itself sideways and has a much thinner silhouette . The plane, which looks something like a four-cornered ninja throwing star with two sides that are extended out while the other two sides are far shorter. Engadget reports that when the plane . takes off from the ground, it has to have the longer wings on either . side, making the plane appear shorter in length and longer in width. Researcher: Dr. Gecheng Zha, a professor at The University of Miami, is behind the project and will continue to run tests . It is for this reason that normal commercial airplanes have such significant wings, because they need to use that wingspan to gain enough momentum to get off of the ground. By contrast, while the large wingspan is needed to take off, it creates too much drag for the plan when it reaches supersonic speeds. As a result, once it reaches the supersonic atmosphere, the plane will then rotate 90 degrees so that it is longer and thinner than when it took off. The technology has been pioneered by Dr. Gecheng Zha who is a teacher at the University of Miami. The school has an animated video of the plane in flight- equipped with the University's logo on the wings- to give a fuller idea of the shift and at what point that would happen during the flight. Engadget reports that the recently-approved award from NASA will allow the Professor and his aides to continue their research and refine it using simulations and wind tunnel testing. While the funding will give the research an obvious boost, it is still expected to take decades before any form of said plane becomes a reality.","Plane can fly on two of its sides and travel to supersonic levels .

"Canyons, lakes and mountains have been revealed in the most detailed maps ever made of the hidden world beneath the polar regions. Surveys of the Antarctic and Arctic have revealed features buried under the ice including a ‘mega canyon’ in Greenland - bigger even than the Grand Canyon in the US. And data from surveys of the regions has revealed the extent to which Arctic sea ice is gradually decreasing and how long it might take to disappear. The most detailed maps ever made of the land beneath the polar ice caps in the Arctic and Antarctic have been revealed. Using various techniques researchers were able to show the elevation of bedrock beneath the ice, highlighting amazing land features (shown) The unseen land under the ice was detailed in the new edition of the Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World. While previous maps of the polar regions showed them as mostly near-blank whiteness, the latest data has allowed the appearance of the land under the ice to be revealed. And the maps show the dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice in recent decades as the region is affected by rising global temperatures . Global warming could be triggering increasingly cold winters in some parts of the world, scientists have claimed. They discovered a link between rising ocean temperatures, and a large pocket of cold air known as the polar vortex. Researchers led by Baek-Min Kim from Korea Polar Research Institute found that as oceans heat up and melt the Arctic ice, warm air is released that destabilises polar air and sends cold blasts into the atmosphere. The polar vortex was responsible for the extreme and freezing temperatures experienced in the US last winter, they say. Dr Peter Fretwell of the British Antarctic Survey, the joint lead author on compiling the Antarctic dataset, told MailOnline that if there was no ice at the poles the land would look almost normal. ‘If the ice was taken away we would have continental features like mountains and canyons, which we don’t expect from regions like Antarctica,' he says. The data for the maps was mainly collected using a technique known as radio-echo sounding. This involved flying a plane over areas of interest, firing radio waves at the ground below and measuring how much they were reflected. And the researchers also used seismic and gravity-wave data to compile the maps. The sub-ice maps use bedrock data to show physical features such as the Antarctic’s Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains, which are as large as the Alps but completely covered in ice. In the Antarctic, the map also shows huge trenches buried under glaciers, including the Bentley Subglacial Trench, which reaches a depth of 8,188ft (2,496 metres), and the location of Lake Vostok, lying close to 2.5 miles (4km) under the ice sheet. The Astrolabe Trench, which contains the thickest ice in the world, is also featured on the map. At the other end of the world, the map shows Greenland’s 'mega canyon', which is more than 470 miles (750km) long and 2,600ft (800 metres) deep, running north to south under the ice sheet. By comparison the Grand Canyon in Arizona is 277 miles (446km) long and 6,000ft (1,800 metres) deep. Greenland's canyon - which was discovered in 2013 and is thought to be older than the ice sheet that covers it - is unnamed, although 'Greenland’s Grand Canyon' or 'Grand Canyon of Greenland' have been proposed. The incredible features appear in the new edition of the Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World. Included on the maps is a mega canyon under Greenland. It is almost twice as long and more than twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in the US . Greenland’s 'mega canyon', which is more than 470 miles (750km) long and 2,600ft (800 metres) deep, running north to south under the ice sheet, is shown here in an illustration from previous data. By comparison the Grand Canyon in Arizona is 277 miles (446km) long and 6,000ft (1,800 metres) deep . The data for the maps was mainly collected using a technique known as radio-echo sounding. This involved flying a specialised plane (shown) over areas of interests, firing radio waves at the ground below and measuring how much they were reflected to reveal the land hidden under the ice . 'It’s very important to know how much ice there is and what the topography of the bed looks like, as this is one of the main controls on how quickly ice sheets melt with climate change,' said Dr Fretwell. He said the data in the survey of the Antarctic bedrock was a key component in scientific models that tried to predict future sea level rises. 'As the world warms with increasing greenhouse gas emissions Antarctic ice will start to melt and cause global sea levels to rise, but the speed and amount of sea level rise is very dependent upon the bed-topography under the ice sheet,' he continued. The new edition of the Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World also has a map which includes long-term trends in Arctic sea ice cover, showing the average summer sea ice extent from 1981 to 2010, as well as the record low minimum cover in 2012. It also shows the minimum extent of the ice last year, 18 per cent lower than the 30-year average, using data sourced from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in the US which tracks polar ice cover. The sub-ice maps used bedrock data to show physical features such as the Antarctic’s Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (middle of image), which are as large as the Alps but completely covered in ice . In addition to radio-echo sounding (shown) the researchers also measured seismic and gravity-wave data to compile the detailed maps. Dr Fretwell told MailOnline there were still one or two holes in the data with regards to Antarctica, and there may be even more features hidden underground . Arctic sea ice melts each summer, reaching its lowest extent in September, and the changes to the sea ice cover are seen by scientists as a sensitive indicator of the warming climate. Dr Walt Meier, research scientist at the Cryosphere Science Branch, Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre in the US, said: 'End of summer sea ice extent averages 40 per cent less than it used to be in the early 1980s. 'The ice is also substantially thinner, about half the thickness on average than during the 1980s. 'The loss of sea ice results in more energy being absorbed in the Arctic, contributing to amplified warming compared to the rest of the globe.' The previous edition of the Times Atlas, published in 2011, was hit by controversy amid claims by the publishers that 15 per cent of Greenland’s ice had melted in little over a decade, an assertion they were forced to admit was 'incorrect'. A reworked map of Greenland also had to be produced after scientists said numerous glaciers could be found where the atlas showed ice-free conditions and the emergence of new land. The maps also show the extend to which sea ice is retreating. Arctic sea ice melts each summer, reaching its lowest extent in September, and the changes to the sea ice cover are seen by scientists as a sensitive indicator of the warming climate .

"Audi has revealed a car lighting technology that can make the back of its cars show bright patterns to other drivers. This 'swarm' is made up of thousands of small red lights that cover the width of the boot and react to movements of the car. The screens are designed to show other drivers what the driver it doing - but motoring organisations told MailOnline the technology should stay a concept. Scroll down for video . Audi's swarm tail light technology is made up of organic light-emitting diodes that respond to movements of the car . When the wheel is turned left or right, the lights flow in the same direction. When the driver presses the accelerator the lights move faster, and when the car brakes the lights flow forward . When the driver turns the wheel, the red dots flow in the direction it has been turned. When the car speeds up the number of dots, or 'fish', increase and they flow faster around the surface. Swarm technology is made up of thousands of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). These small points of red light flicker and move like a swarm of fish. The movements of the red dots follow . the movements of the vehicle. When a right turn is made, they flow to . the right. When the driver brakes, the dots flow  forward. The . faster the car goes, the faster the dots move. When the driver brakes, the dots slow down and flow forward onto the top of the boot. Audi’s swarm lights are made up of thousands of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). These diodes can be added to any surface. When an electrical charge is put through this organic material, the diodes light up. Audi claims these lights mean drivers in cars behind can . always see what the driver of the car in front is doing. However, a spokesman from the AA had a different view, 'The Swarm is a delightful concept design but under current lighting regulations it is probably best saved for aquariums or art galleries.' If they pass safety tests, the swarm lighting could replace the traditional braking lights on future Audi cars. Audi unveiled its swarm lighting technology at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas last week. The German car maker also announced a laser tail light. OLEDs are made up of thin films of organic particles. In the Audi example, these particles are spread thinly onto a flat, polished glass surface. It can also be spread onto flexible plastic surfaces, and will work as the surface bends and moves. The covering only needs be a few thousandths of a millimetre thick. When an electric charge is sent . through the covering, the particles emit photons and any surface covered . by the material lights up. The light and colours produced by OLEDs are brighter than LEDs because they are multi-layered. OLEDs are more energy-efficient because they use less electricity to produce a brighter light. In good visibility, the laser tail light shines a fan-shaped red line from the back of the car. It is used to prompt the driver behind to keep a safe distance, similar to a stop line. In fog or spray, the laser beam bounces off the water in the air and turns the line into a triangle, similar to the warning triangle used on breakdowns.","Lights designed to look like moving swarms of animals .

"A newlywed died of cervical cancer after being refused a smear test because she was deemed too young. Becky Ryder was 24 when she visited her doctor with worrying symptoms – but was denied the simple procedure because she was under the minimum age of 25. It took months of repeated visits to her GP before she eventually saw another doctor, who diagnosed her with cancer. Sad loss: Paul Ryder and his late wife Becky were due to celebrate their third wedding anniversary this year . Mrs Ryder began a gruelling course of . radiotherapy and chemotherapy and at one stage was even told she had . beaten the disease. But the cancer spread and she died at the age of 26. Yesterday her widower Paul paid tribute to his wife and described her attitude to the disease as ‘amazing’. Mrs Ryder, from Bristol, first went to her doctor in September 2010, complaining of unexplained bleeding. A change to legislation means that in . England regular smear tests are given only to women of 25 and over . instead of the previous minimum age of 20, which still applies in Wales. ‘Amazing attitude’: A beaming Becky Ryder on her wedding day (left), just months before she became ill. (Right), she is pictured with her husband Paul . Mr Ryder, 35, said: ‘Becky wanted a . smear test done and requested it but because she was under 25 at the . time they said it would just get returned and they would not do it. About 2,900 cases of . cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. The symptoms of aren't always obvious and it may not cause any symptoms until it has reached an advanced stage. In most cases, abnormal bleeding is the first sign. Its usually occurs after sex although any usually bleeding should be investigated. Other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex, an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine. If the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, bone pain and swelling in the legs and kidneys. If you are concerned about symptoms but are under 25 you have the right to an internal examination. Maddy Durrant, of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, says: 'There is a pathway in place that means a patient should be checked or referred if they are exhibiting symptoms. 'We advise women to challenge their doctor if they say they do not need a test.' She adds that it can help if you print out a list of symptoms, such as from the charity's website, to make your point understood. 'Cervical cancer is rare in women under 25, but it's not impossible.' ‘She was treated for cervical erosion . and then it was  just left. The bleeding did stop, but it came back . again. She saw a different doctor then and they raised a few more . concerns.’ Mrs Ryder, a chartered accountant, was finally diagnosed with cervical cancer  following a biopsy in February 2011. She immediately began radiotherapy and . chemotherapy as well as undergoing fertility treatment to freeze her . eggs in the hope she could later have a family. In September 2011, she was given the all-clear after scans showed no sign of the cancer. ‘It was quite a shock, but a good . shock,’ said Mr Ryder, a golf professional and teacher. ‘Becky didn’t . seem to believe it. She had a feeling something more was going on.’ A few months later her legs started to swell and, after returning to the doctors, scans showed the cancer was back. Mr Ryder said: ‘That’s when they said . “Sorry, it’s terminal”. We still thought she could fight but even more . chemotherapy couldn’t get rid of it.’ The couple, who would have celebrated . their third wedding anniversary this year, tried  to remain positive, . but Mrs Ryder was admitted to St Peter’s Hospice, in Bristol, just . before Christmas and died on February 14 this year. Mr Ryder said he later met a woman who . also knew a  victim of cervical cancer whose condition was not . identified in time and had set up a charity. The Mercedes Curnow Foundation For The . Early Detection Of Cervical Cancer now campaigns for a reduction in the . screening age to 20. It also funds private smear tests. But the Department of Health said . routine screening of under-25s did ‘more harm than good’, giving too . many false positive results that lead to needless treatment. Public health minister Anna Soubry . added: ‘We now vaccinate girls with the HPV vaccine which protects . against 70 per cent of cervical cancers.’ Mr Ryder (left) is tirelessly campaigning to raise awareness of cervical cancer, something former Big Brother contestant Jade Goody (right ) did before she succumbed to the disease in 2009 . Mr Ryder (front, kneeling) is working with friends, family and a local charity to increase knowledge about cervical cancer in young women under 25. A cervical smear test detects abnormal (pre-cancerous) cells in the cervix in order to prevent cervical cancer developing. Cervical screening is not a test for cancer; it is a test to check the health of the cells of the cervix. Most test results will come back normal, but for one in 20 women the test will show some abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix. Most of these changes will not lead to cervical cancer and the cells may go back to normal on their own. However, in some cases, the abnormal cells need to be treated to prevent them becoming cancerous. About 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. This amounts to 2 per cent of all cancer cases diagnosed in women. The highest incidence of cervical cancer occurs in women aged between 30 and 39, with the under-35s most likely to be affected. Until 2003 all women were offered smear tests from the age of 20 upwards. This is still the case in Wales. Since 2003 government legislation has meant that only women aged 25 and over are offered the test.","Becky Ryder visited her GP in 2010 aged 24 after bleeding abnormally .

"A beach hut is on sale for £225,000 despite not having mains electricity, running water, or - and some would say this one's pretty crucial - a sea view. The 13ft by 13ft timber shack on Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, Dorset, is divided into a living area, bedroom and mezzanine and is one of the most expensive beach huts ever to go on sale. But although glimpses of the sea can be seen from side windows, its front porch looks out on little more than sand dunes and grass - and there's a public toilet round the back. Room with a loo: A beach hut on Dorset's Mudeford Spit is on sale for £225,000 despite not having mains electricity, running water or a sea view - and it's next to a toilet . The sea? Oh, it's just over there: The hut's furnishings are slightly dated compared to others, and it faces sand dunes, but it's one of the largest on the peninsula . It also requires a half-hour walk or a ride on a novelty tourist 'land train' from the nearest parking space. At the same price as a detached house in Hull - which costs on average £218,000 - it outstrips the highest previous selling price for a hut on the spit by £55,000. Sold in 2012, the 18ft by 10ft timber retreat which held the previous record was shifted just two days after it went on sale amid bidding frenzy. For less than the hut now on sale, buyers could snap up a five-bedroom detached house in the south Wales village of Aberfan, near Merthyr Tydfil, which is on sale for £199,950. Or for £180,000 they could buy an entire church 'with conversion potential' in almost an acre of land in the village of Farr, near Inverness. But the estate agents selling this chalet insisted it was worth the price because it is one of the largest on the peninsula - which, like nearby Sandbanks, has become a premium spot for buying seaside homes. Upstairs, downstairs: Estate agent Andy Denison said the hut's value was increased by having a mezzanine level. It is one of the most expensive ever to go on the market . Kitchen: The hut has no mains electricity, but it does feature this charming gas hob, and there's even a fridge. It's claimed the chalet sleeps 10, at a push . Both areas have a 'perfect storm' of factors which push up prices, including that they are situated between harbours and the sea, have been largely owned within families and there is no room left for any new buyers to expand onto the narrow strips of land. The public toilet could also, in fact, come in useful - as the hut and others like it don't have one of their own. At a stretch: The sea is visible by standing on the steps and craning one's neck . Andy Denison, of Denisons Estate . Agents, said: 'The hut has been in the same family for donkey’s years and it . has got potential for people to put their own style on it. 'It has a living space, an integral bedroom and a mezzanine level and can sleep up to 10 people. It . features 12 volt solar electricity through solar panels on the roof and . has lighting, a fridge and a cooker which is run by gas. 'Bigger hits at Mudeford tend to have a mezzanine floor and the value seems to increase because of it. This . is a good size hut and I think that’s where the value is, it’s suitable . for a larger family or for friends which much be sharing it.' He added: 'The . hut has sea glimpses as it is set back about 30 yards from the . beach. There is nothing in front of it but grass, sand, and a path.' As well as the hefty price tag, the . new owners will have to pay a £15,000 transfer fee and more than . £2,600 a year in ground rent to Christchurch Borough Council. In order to see the sea, the new . owners of the beach hut will need to stand on the top step leading up to . the decking and then look towards the left. If it sells for the asking price, the cabin will just fall short of becoming the most expensive beach hut ever sold in Britain. Another on the Strand in Shaldon, south Devon, sold for £245,000 in 2012 despite being just 6ft wide. But unlike the Mudeford Spit huts, it was a new build with under-floor heating, a marble wet room, wireless internet, and electric windows which automatically close when it rains. Measuring 23ft long, it also boasted a fitted kitchen, a rear patio, TV, DVD and one mezzanine bedroom. Steve Barratt, chairman of the . Mudeford Sandbank Beach Hut Association, said: 'Back in the 1980s, the . beach huts would have sold for around £6,000 or £7,000. 'Now, . people are paying around £150,000 for one. Compared to how house . prices have changed, there’s a significant difference. 'Beach huts have outstripped property prices over the years by several times.' Picturesque: The quiet village of huts is on a peninsula with Christchurch harbour on one side and the English Channel on the other, and cannot be reached by cars . Spending a lot more than a penny: The hut, pictured in green, is right next to a public toilet block - useful if nature calls while the 10 people squeezed in are sleeping . Idyll: Thanks to its secluded sense of calm and good sizes by beach huts standards, Mudeford Spit has become one of Britain's priciest areas by cost per square foot . Many luxury beach huts on the market cost more than a brand new, fully-functioning home. In the last few months some beach huts across Britain have been marketed for vast amounts. They included a hut on Chesil beach near Weymouth, which featured in the title of a novel by Ian McEwan, which went on the market for £300,000. In Christchurch, Dorset, there are beach huts up for sale for £225,000, with some estate agents marketing them as 'one-bedroom terraced properties'. But there are bargains to be had. In Felixstowe, Suffolk, the cheapest beach huts are on the market for £7,000 while in Hove, East Sussex, one hut was recently on sale for £14,000. Another, in a prime position on the seafront at Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, was on the market two weeks ago for £18,000, decorated in pastel colours with a 1950s floral interior.","13ft square timber shack is on desirable Mudeford Spit near Christchurch, with living area, bedroom and mezzanine .

"Surely we’d welcome Arjen Robben back to England with open arms? In full-flight, there’s no more awesome sight in European football than the Dutchman. Until, that is, he falls flat on his face under little or no contact with an opposing defender. VIDEO Scroll down to watch say it was a clear penalty against Mexico . To dive or not to dive: Robben has been criticised for his tendency to throw himself theatrically to the floor . How can something so beautiful and graceful be so repugnant and distasteful all at once. Well, that’s Robben. A quite brilliant football player one moment, and a shame to the game the next. Rightly, or wrongly, diving is now part of football. And while Robben is one of the world’s best players, he’s also one of the planet’s expert divers. The way he flails his arms about with a face that suggests he’s just been hit by a bus is not befitting of a man so highly talented with a ball at his feet. Penalty: Referee Pedro Proenca awarded Holland a spot-kick after Marquez appeared to catch Robben . Full flight: Robben falls to the deck inside the Mexico box to win his side a late penalty in their last-16 clash . His latest Tom Daley impression came in yesterday’s thrilling 2-1 World Cup second round win over Mexico. Robben insists Mexico skipper Rafa Marquez’s did make contact with him in the split seconds leading up to his theatrical fall in the box to earn Holland’s decisive injury time penalty. But Mexico boss Miguel Herrera wasn’t having any of it. ‘Today it was not a wonderful goal that put us out, it was bad decision by the referee, an invented penalty,’ said the manager. ‘It seems to me that the reason we were eliminated was the man with the whistle. If the referee invents a penalty of that size, you leave the World Cup after circumstances not created by you. ‘And Robben dived three times for penalties that didn’t exist. He should have been cautioned. If you do that to the guy who tries to cheat, then he can’t cheat again.’ Daley-esque: The Dutchmen screams as he throws himself into the air as Michel Bastos dives in to a tackle . Dramatic: Robben begins falling to the floor inside the penalty area while playing for Bayern Munich . And while Robben is keen to stress that Pedro Proneca was correct in pointing to the spot, the Dutchman himself admitted that he tried to con the referee against Mexico. ‘That one was a penalty, but the other in the first half was a dive. I must apologise.’ He confession at trying to deceive into officials into awarding his side a free-kick just outside the Mexican penalty area leaves bitter taste. For all intents and purposes, it’s cheating. Do we want cheaters in the Barclays Premier League? Most certainly not. For every elegant fake or drop of the shoulder, there would be a theatrical fall in the box to earn his side an unfair advantage. Outrage: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger labelled Robben 'a very good diver' in March . We already have a big enough problem in combating diving in our game without Europe’s premier diver adding to the problem. And it’s not like yesterday’s dive wasn’t an isolated incident. He was accused of diving against Arsenal in the Champions League last summer; Arsene Wenger calling him a ‘very good diver’ in March. There other such instances to throw at him. For that reason - and that reason alone - Robben is not welcome back on these shores. His skill with the ball at this feet would light up the Premier League, his diving would plunge it into darkness.","The Holland speed merchant has been linked with Manchester United .

"Flies avoid being swatted in the same way that Keanu Reeves dodges bullets in the film The Matrix – by watching time pass slowly. To the insect, that rolled-up newspaper moving at lightning speed might as well be inching through thick treacle. Like Reeves side-stepping slow motion bullets, the fly has enough time to escape. A separate study last year found that flies avoid being swatted in the same way that Keanu Reeves dodges bullets in the film The Matrix ¿ by watching time pass slowly. This graphic how time perception is related to a creature's size . Of course, time is really passing at the same speed. But the fly’s eyes send updates to its brain far more frequently than a human’s eyes, and its mental processes are similarly much more rapid than ours. The result is that a fly sees objects moving slowly in comparison to its own rapid reactions. It makes a decision and buzzes away from danger far more quickly than a human can follow it with a newspaper. But flies are not the only species to perceive time differently. Many animals smaller than us see the world in slow motion. For instance, flies can perceive light flickering up to four times faster than we can . A dog's visual system has a refresh rate higher than that of the TV screen so all they see is a flicker of lights . Housefly- 6.8 times slower . Rhesus macaque-  2.4 times slower . Dog-  2 times slower . Cat- 1.4 times slower . Tiger salamander- 1.3 times faster . Blacknose shark- 2.2 times faster . Leatherback turtle- 2.7 times faster . European eel- 2.8 times faster . Research led by Trinity College Dublin, in collaboration with the University of Edinburgh and the University of St Andrews, suggests that time perception is related to a creature's size. For instance, dogs process information at twice the rate of humans, which is why they usually aren't interested in television. Television screens flicker to provide the illusion of constant images to humans, . But a dog's . visual system has a refresh rate higher than that of the TV screen meaning that all they see is a flicker of lights. Smaller, . more agile creatures had the most refined ability to perceive . information in a unit of time, said the researchers writing in the . journal Animal Behaviour. In other words, they were able to see more . flickers of light per second. In a similar way, time seems to speed up for larger creatures. An example is the leatherback sea turtle which perceives time 2.5 times faster than a human. However, the researchers highlight the tiger beetle as one animal who doesn't fit this rule. The leatherback sea turtle is thought to perceive time at a rate that is around 2.5 times faster than a human . 'The tiger beetle is an unusual one,' Dr Luke McNally told MailOnline. 'They take in very little information with their eyes, and run faster than their eyes can keep up. 'They essentially blind themselves, and take a stop-start approach to finding prey, hurtling towards them in the hope they'll hit something.' 'Another strange one is the swordfish. When they are hunting their time perception is almost the same as humans, as they deliberately heat up their eyes. 'The rest of the time, time goes around five times faster for them. This is because they perceive one fifth of the information we do per second,' added Dr McNally. Time perception is just another aspect of evolution and survival, the scientists believe. Scientists worked this out by flashing a light in rapid flickers in front of animals. If the flashes are close enough together, an observer sees them as a continuous blur. But researchers found that the flicker speed at which flashes seemed to merge together was different for different species. ‘A lot of researchers have looked at this in different animals,’ said Dr Andrew Jackson of Trinity College Dublin. Swatting flies: To the insect, that rolled-up newspaper moving at lightning speed might as well be inching through thick treacle . ‘Interestingly, there’s a large difference between big and small species. ‘If you look at flies, they can perceive light flickering up to four times faster than we can. You can imagine a fly literally seeing everything in slow motion.’ The animals studied as part of the research covered more than 30 . species, including rodents, eels, lizards, chickens, pigeons, dogs, cats . and leatherback turtles. 'Having eyes that send updates to the brain at much . higher frequencies than our eyes do is of no value if the brain cannot . process that information equally quickly,' added Professor Graeme Ruxton, from the . University of St Andrews. 'This work highlights . the impressive capabilities of even the smallest animal brains. 'Flies might not be deep thinkers, but they can make good decisions very quickly.' Some . animals may exploit differences in time perception to their advantage, . according to Dr McNally. 'For example, many species use flashing . lights as signals, such as fireflies and many deep-sea animals,' he . said. 'Larger and slower predator species may not be able to decode . these signals if their visual system isn’t fast enough, giving the . signallers a secret channel of communication.' Dr Jackson added that this could also explain why time seems to speed up as we get older but move slower for children.","Time is passing at the same speed, but the fly’s eyes send updates to its brain far more frequently than a human’s eyes .
Like Reeves side-stepping slow motion bullets, fly has ample time to escape .
The smaller an animal is, the faster its brain works and the quicker time flies .
This is why dogs tend not to watch TV as to them it is just a flicker of lights ."
"A banker and his wife waged a ‘sinister and devious’ campaign of harassment against a vulnerable neighbour to try to increase the sale value of their home, a court heard yesterday. Church warden Sandra Saxton, 69, was attacked and injured by retired City financier Peter Bayliss, who falsely told police and social services she had gone mad to try to get her put in a mental hospital. Bayliss, 62, and his artist wife Kim, 53, wanted the deaf pensioner out of the way after they clashed over a 12-inch strip of land at the back of their gardens, which gave Mrs Saxton right of way behind their property. Retired City banker Peter Bayliss and his wife Kim made a 'troubling and sinister' bid to have a deaf pensioner sectioned under the Mental Health Act so they could boost their property's value, a court heard . The dispute was over a tiny strip of land behind a cottage belonging to Mr Bayliss' mother in Westerham, Kent . The couple were angry at losing a court battle with her over the right of way in Westerham, Kent, in 2009, and began spreading lies about her. Yesterday Judge Nigel Gerald made a stinging attack on the couple, saying they had destroyed what was once a ‘happy little community’. They will have to pay damages and costs of £338,000 – more than the value of the home they were trying to sell. He condemned the ‘sheer awfulness’ of their attempts to have Mrs Saxton sectioned under the Mental Health Act, saying: ‘She suffered and suffers from no mental health ailments. ‘The purpose of the letters [to social services] were to get Mrs Saxton sectioned, to get her removed from her home so she could no longer exercise her right of way and maintain her boundary fence, leaving the way open for the Baylisses to sell, free of any adverse rights.’ Central London County Court heard that in 2008 Mr Bayliss’s mother moved into a care home, leaving her son in charge as the sole heir to her £315,000 home. Victim: The court heard that Mrs Saxton had never had any mental problems at all and had used the right of way for more than 20 years when the older Mrs Bayliss lived next door without any trouble . Mrs Saxton had used the right of way for 20 years, but it soon became an issue with Mr and Mrs Bayliss, described as ‘dishonest, devious and manipulative’ by the judge. They wanted to stop access along the strip of land and absorb it into their garden, making it bigger, thinking they would get a better price and an easier sale, it was alleged. The court heard Mrs Saxton, a carer for the disabled, suffered whiplash when she was violently grabbed and shaken by Mr Bayliss as she tried to use the right of way in July 2009. He also wrote letters to Sevenoaks Council, falsely claiming Mrs Saxton had attacked him and ‘could not be safely let out on her own, due to her rapidly deteriorating mental health condition’. One letter said: ‘We consider that we are at risk of further physical assault by her ... we request you formally to arrange her removal from her property to a home.’ The judge said that what had been a 'happy little community where neighbours helped each other' changed . On another occasion the couple reported Mrs Saxton to police and falsely accused her of assault after an altercation when the couple glued shut the access gate. The judge said: ‘The campaign combined physical obstruction and assault with direct and indirect mental manipulation and abuse designed to destabilize Mrs Saxton and turn her neighbours against her.’ He ordered the couple to pay Mrs Saxton £25,000 damages for harassment, £1,750 for nuisance, plus £10,000 exemplary damages. Mr Bayliss alone was ordered to pay £2,000 for assault. He also told them to pay costs, estimated to be in the region of £300,000.","Peter and Kim Bayliss wanted to increase the size of their garden in Kent and to put a stop to a neighbour using a right of way over it .

"He’s used to being the center of attention, but on Wednesday night Boris Johnson was left playing second fiddle to Hollywood starlet Jennifer Lawrence when the pair appeared as guests on the David Letterman Show on U.S. television. The last time the Mayor of London appeared with Letterman he was the star attraction and enjoyed a healthy rapport with his host, but things were much more brisk and business-like this time around. When Lawrence overran her slot while promoting the latest Hunger Games movie, Boris' interview got squeezed to under five minutes - less than half of what he had when he appeared in 2012.

Boris Johnson's interview got squeezed to under five minutes - less than half of what he had when he appeared previously in 2012 . Star: Jennifer Lawrence overran she stole the show plugging the new Hunger Games movie . Looking as crumpled as ever in a black suit and blue tie, bumbling Boris got off to a bad start when he almost walked into the set when it finally became his turn to take center stage. Things didn't improve when the interview finally started and Letterman congratulated him on his re-election - something which had actually happened before Johnson’s previous appearance almost two and a half years ago. As well as promoting his new book, American-born Boris used his shortened slot to boast about how well London is doing under his leadership. ‘Things are going gangbusters,’ said Johnson – no doubt perplexing the audience at home – as he claimed responsibly for reductions in the crime and murder rates and even people living longer. Exiting together: Jennifer Lawrence urged Letterman not to retire and said he should work until he dies . Lawrence appeared confused when discussing the latest Hunger Games movie and she admitted that having completed two films at the same she really doesn't know which one she's talking about at any given time . Quoting Balzac left many in the audience perplexed, but Boris at least managed to win a round of applause when he said that the recent success of the NFL games in London was testimony to Brits love for all things American. But even then Johnson admitted he found American Football to be ‘too theoretical’ and instead professed his love for rugby. ‘Some of my happiest hours were spent being ground into the mud,’ he recalled. Letterman then brought the conversation round to ISIS and the search for Jihadi John, the British-accented executioner. 'If the chap wants to see 72 virgins, I think he should be able to meet them as soon as possible,' said Johnson with his best quip of the night. London Mayor Johnson admitted he found American Football to be ‘too theoretical’ and instead professed his love for rugby. 'Some of my happiest hours were spent being ground into the mud,' he recalled . With his time quickly running out, Johnson finally got to talk about his book, The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History, which he had flown over from the UK especially to promote. However Johnson's reasons no doubt left many viewers perplexed as he said he wanted to teach children in the UK that Churchill was more than just a toy dog in an insurance commercial. Earlier Jennifer Lawrence had laughed and joked with Letterman about her health issues and she urged him not to retire and carry on working until he dies. She also appeared confused when discussing the latest Hunger Games movie, Mockingjay Part 1, and admitted that having completed both it and Part 2 at the same time she gets the two movies confused.

"The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of same sex marriage by striking down the Defense of Marriage Act in a landmark 5-4 decision this morning. It followed that decision with a ruling against California's controversial Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in the state, meaning that gay marriage will inevitably be deemed legal in California. By striking down DOMA, the Supreme Court ruled that it was not legal to prevent same-sex spouses from receiving the same benefits that heterosexual couples receive. Scroll down for video . Victory: Crowds celebrate in June after The Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriages should be legally recognized as valid across the U.S., but now the Texas National Guard has refused to process requests from same-sex couples for benefits . Working for the wedding: Plaintiffs Paul Katami, Jeffrey Zarrillo, Sandy Stier, and Kristen Perry were the people fighting for marriage equality in California . Just minutes after their ruling against the Defense of Marriage Act was announced, the Supreme Court declared California's Proposition 8 unconstitutional. The legal drama in California came when the state approved same-sex marriage, and that was followed months later with a Prop 8, which was put in place by the 9th Circuit Court. Prop 8 banned same-sex marriage across the state, and today, the Supreme Court ruled that the 9th Circuit Court was overstepping their bounds by putting the ban in place in the first place. Though the legal wrangling will undoubtedly continue in the coming months, the ruling suggests that California will go back to allowing same-sex marriage. If that is the case, it will be the 13th state to legally allow same-sex marriage. The plaintiffs in the Prop 8 case were two same-sex couples from California. During their celebratory interviews on the steps of the Supreme Court, one of the women received a phone call from President Obama  personally congratulating them on their victory. While it does not theoretically change the fact that only 12 states and the District of Columbia are the only areas in the U.S. where same-sex marriages are granted, today's ruling means that any couples who are married in those states have to be treated the same as any heterosexual married couples under the law across the country. The broadly-written decision says among other privileges, same-sex couples can now file joint tax returns, are entitled to social security survivor benefits, have the right to make medical decisions for incapacitated partners, and will receive notification when a spouse is killed in action. Justice Anthony . Kennedy wrote the majority decision, saying that it was not legal to . consider same-sex marriages anything lesser than full legal . partnerships. 'Under DOMA, . same-sex married couples have their lives burdened, by reason of . government decree, in visible and public ways,' Justice Kennedy wrote in . the majority decision. 'DOMA's principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal.' He . wrote that the previous law caused 'a stigma upon all who enter into . same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the . states.' As was . expected, the court's four more conservative justices- Samuel Alito, . Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and chief justice John Roberts- voted . against the issue. President Obama is currently in . Africa on a state visit to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, but he . tweeted shortly after the decision was reached. Big day: The ruling over the Defense of Marriage Act was one of the most hotly-anticipated verdicts . Celebrating: Glennda Testone of The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center jumps for joy after the Defense of Marriage Act was struck down, meaning that same-sex partners will receive equal benefits . 'Today's DOMA ruling is a historic step forward for #MarriageEquality #LoveIsLove,' his official Twitter account released. He was expected to make a statement about the two rulings, and his words . will have an added twist as he will give them in Senegal, where . homosexuality is illegal. The second ruling of the day came on . the issue of Proposition 8. In that case, California had passed same-sex . marriage but then Prop 8 was put in place banning gay marriage in the . state. Today's Supreme Court decision said that Prop 8 was not legal, . and they were not legally able to put that ban into place. By removing the ban, California is now the 13th state that allows same-sex marriage. The . landmark decision comes on a busy week for the highest court in the . land, as they already handed down verdicts on similarly controversial . decisions on affirmative action, the voting rights act, and a custody . battle between a girl's Native American biological father and her . adoptive family. Crowds gathered outside of the court on Wednesday morning ahead of their 10am announcement. On the call: The White House released this picture of President Obama calling Edie Windsor from Air Force One . Waiting to hear: The court was ruling on two different cases that would decide whether gay couples are legally allowed to marry across the country . Right now, 12 states and the District of Columbia recognize same-sex marriages as legal, and it is likely that the issue will still continue to be determined on a state-by-state basis. The case itself was based around the constitutionality of denying spousal benefits to same sex partners.They are also considering the validity of the California ban on same-sex marriage. Named the United States v. Windsor, the case was filed by an elderly lesbian named Edith Windsor. She was married to her female spouse Thea Spyer but was denied estate tax when Ms Spyer died. Their 40-year love story has been a well-publicized one and a movie was made to nationalize. In light of today's landmark ruling, Windsor no longer has to pay the IRS hundreds of dollars that she was told to pay because the federal government did not recognize her same-sex marriage as valid. Edie Windsor thanked her friends and attorneys at a press conference after the ruling . Edie Windsor challenged the federal Defense of Marriage Act after she was made to pay $363,000 in inheritance taxes, after her partner of 44 years Thea Spyer died. A heterosexual would not have faced the punitive bill. She seemed hopeful after she testified in front of the court in March, and today she is undoubtedly celebrating. 'They were direct, they asked all the right questions,' she said after exiting the hearing in late March. 'I didn't feel any hostility or any sense of inferiority...I felt we were very respected and I think it's gonna be good,' she added with a smile. Two years after they were married, Spyer, a long-suffering multiple sclerosis patient, passed away. Windsor explained how weeks later she suffered a real life 'broken heart,' when she was struck down with a heart-attack. She was then hit with the massive tax bill. 'In the midst of my grief, I realized the federal government was treating us as strangers,' she said. As such, the widow challenged the DOMA and when lower courts agreed that the Act discriminatory and unconstitutional, the case was handed to the Supreme Court to make a final determination. The 1996 U.S. law denies married same-sex couples access to federal benefits by defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Kennedy referred to DOMA as ""inconsistent"" because it purports to give authority to the states to define marriage while limiting recognition of those determinations.                                                                                                   -Daily Mail Reporter .","Defense of Marriage Act was struck down meaning that married same-sex couples have to receive the same benefits as heterosexual married couples .

"It's news that might spark a little celebration – if you own a home in London. The average cost of a house in the capital has now topped £400,000 for the first time following a record 25.8 per cent price increase. But while for Londoners it could mean cashing in on a nice little investment as prices boom, the rest of the country can only expect a more modest dividend. There is now a gap of more than £200,000 between a property in the UK’s largest city and elsewhere – where the average price of a home is just £185,478. The average cost of a home in London has now topped £400,000 following a record increase . The gulf in Britain’s two-speed housing market was laid bare yesterday in a report by Nationwide, which said the gap is ‘the widest that it has ever been’. In 12 months, prices in London have jumped by nearly £100,000 to £400,404. For house-hunters the sum may only buy a tiny studio flat or a garage in many areas, but for homeowners their properties will have ‘earned’ four times the annual salary of a typical full-time worker. Overall, house prices in the UK including London are rising by 11.8 per cent, the fastest rate of annual growth for nearly a decade following 14 consecutive monthly rises, raising the average cost  to £188,903. But this increase is overshadowed by rocketing prices in the capital only, which is seeing the fastest rate of growth since 1987. In 1975 – the year that Nationwide started to keep figures – prices in the metropolis were 30 per cent higher than the rest of the UK. Today they are a record-breaking 116 per cent higher, a boon for any Londoner who wants to sell and buy elsewhere in Britain. Alex Hilton, of tenants’ campaign group Generation Rent, said it might lead to an exodus of ‘talented people’ who need to work in the capital but cannot afford to live nearby. For the Treasury, however, the boom in London house prices means a welcome boost in stamp duty receipts. Homebuyers in the capital paid £2billion in 2012/13, the largest amount in a year in any part of the UK, according to HM Revenue and Customs. The Nationwide report comes just days after the Bank of England tried to cool the housing market with new lending rules. Robert Gardner, chief economist at the building society, said it does not resolve the biggest problem – the lack of supply of new homes. Matthew Pointon, of the consultancy Capital Economics, said London was in ‘distinctly bubble-like territory’. But Paul Smith, of estate agents Haart, said: ‘Bubbles burst and London house prices – while completely unaffordable to many – are not about to collapse.’ While the cost of homes has rocketed in London, in many areas they are still far below pre-financial crisis levels, the Office for National Statistics said in a separate report yesterday. Prices are lower than they were at their peak in areas including the North of England, the Midlands, the South West, Scotland and Wales, it said. The cost of a mortgage is also beginning to climb ahead of an expected Bank of England interest rate rise. Rates for the best two-year fixed-rate deal for a home buyer with a 20 per cent deposit have risen from 1.99 per cent to 2.19 per cent in a month, research by analysts Moneyfacts found.","The average cost of a house in the capital has now topped £400,000 .

"Emergency services have been left red faced after being led on a wild goose chase following two hoax distress calls, about a plane that had crashed because of faulty landing gear. It's believed a man, called up the Brisbane air traffic control centre just before noon on Monday and pretended he was a pilot before proceeding to tell operators there were problems with his equipment on board. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the man's voice was slow and slurred in the recording of communication obtained by Fairfax Media. The controller was heard trying to keep the unknown man calm, before advising him to try to land at the Sunshine coast where emergency personnel would be waiting. A man called the Brisbane air traffic control centre (pictured) pretending to be a pilot claimed he was about to crash because of faulty landing gear. After hours of searching for the plane emergency services discovered the call was a hoax . The distressing call caused a frantic rush from police and emergency services, to locate the supposed plane or wreckage, including a rescue helicopter and even commercial airlines, including a Singapore airlines plane (pictured) to look out for any sign of the aircraft . But the recording suddenly got heated with the man claiming he had a warning in his engine. 'Not good. I've got a fire warning, it's getting difficult to fly,' said the man. 'We're gone, tell them I love them, we're gone.' The distressing call caused a frantic rush from police and emergency services, to locate the supposed plane or wreckage, including a rescue helicopter and even commercial airlines to look out for any sign of the aircraft. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority have said they passed the information onto the Queensland police to investigate . After hours of searching for the apparent plane and wreckage, nothing was found. But controllers did however get another strange call, this time from a pilot flying another plane named 'Wedgetail' according to the Sydney Morning Herald. It's believed the man, who tried to change his identity, was in fact the same man who made the first call and proceeded to tell operators that he was searching for the wreckage of the plane. 'We have got contact of interest, a boat, and are watching it very closely,' he said. But by this time authorities were ignoring the call, aware that it was in fact another hoax call. It's believed the Australian Maritime Safety Authority have passed information onto the Queensland police to investigate. Last month Queensland police issued a media release saying that the Queensland emergency services often receive hoax calls or prank calls. They said the valuable time spent attending the calls places a huge drain on resources. The release also said 'while Emergency Services are attending your prank call, somewhere someone else could be losing the valuable time they need to get assistance.' It reminds people that hoax calls to emergency services is an offence.","Emergency services search for wreckage after a hoax distress call was made about a plane that was about to crash .

"Alex Salmond sparked outrage yesterday by comparing the Scottish referendum to South Africa’s post-apartheid election. The first minister said the sight of his countrymen waiting in line to register to vote was similar to that of black South Africans forming long queues outside polling stations in 1994. But while Scots have long enjoyed the full trappings of democracy – and elect both Scottish and UK MPs – black South Africans were having their first sight of the ballot box after centuries of cruel exclusion. Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond said the sight of his countrymen waiting in line to register to vote was similar to that of black South Africans  in the first post-apartheid election . Peter Hain, a Labour ex-minister and anti-apartheid campaigner, said Mr Salmond’s South Africa comparison was ‘preposterous’. ‘It was the first free, democratic election in South Africa’s history, when people who had never been allowed to vote in their lives did so,’ he added. ‘Comparing that with the Scottish referendum just underlines how the Yes campaign is resorting to desperation and irrationality. ‘South Africa was a brutal police state, with state terror, state-sponsored assassinations, torture, absolute denial of human dignity if you had the wrong colour skin. ‘To compare it to Scots seeking independence is just insulting to the freedom struggle that Nelson Mandela led.’ Labour peer Lord Foulkes said: ‘It is an outrageous comparison. Black people were oppressed and unable to vote, which has never been the case in Scotland. ‘It is insulting to anyone involved in democratic elections here over the century and belittles what people went through in South Africa. 'This is typical of Salmond’s hyperbole. Scots have always been a key part of running the UK, including with Scottish prime ministers. ‘He accuses the No campaign of panicking, but making this comparison is just desperation.’ And BBC broadcaster Sue MacGregor, who was raised in South Africa by Scottish parents, said: ‘Voting was not possible for many in South Africa until that election, that is why they queued for one or two days to vote. It is not comparable.’ Describing what he saw in Dundee, Mr Salmond had said: ‘[It was] almost reminiscent of the scenes in South Africa that some of us of a certain age remember from 20 years ago or so when people queued up to vote in the first free elections.’ 'Preposterous comparison': Voters pictured queuing in South Africa's first free election in April 1994 . Mr Salmond yesterday also dismissed reports that the Queen is concerned about the prospect of Scottish independence. He said: ‘I want the Queen as head of state, as Queen of Scots of an independent Scotland as her ancestors were. 'Her Majesty the Queen, who has seen so many events in the course of her long reign, will be proud to be Queen of Scots, and indeed we would be proud to have her as monarch of this land. ‘I had an audience at Balmoral some two weeks ago, but the proper position is you don’t discuss these matters in public. 'The statement from the palace about the Queen’s neutrality in this matter is a perfectly satisfactory and perfectly sensible one.’ The first democratic elections took place in South Africa over three days from 27 to 29 April, 1994. Despite threats of violence, the voting was largely peaceful. Mr Mandela, who had been imprisoned by the apartheid regime for 27 years, became the country’s first black president after his ANC party won 62.5 per cent of the votes. The parliament in Holyrood was formed in 1999 following the referendum campaigned for by Donald Dewar two years previously. Its powers including running the health service and education north of the border. Since 1707 there have been 12 prime ministers who were either Scots-born or of Scottish extraction. Jim Murphy, Labour MP for East Renfrewshire, who lived in South Africa for several years as a child before returning to Scotland, said: ‘To compare any vote in Scotland, no matter how important, with South Africa’s first ever democratic election is crass. ‘Scotland is not Soweto and a decision on whether or not we stay British has no parallels at all with the beauty of the liberation of South Africa from the evil type of racism that was apartheid.’ He added: ‘Scotland’s first minister seems to be getting carried away with himself the nearer we get to referendum day.’","He said long queue of voters was similar to that of post-apartheid election .

"Clever and high-achieving people are more jealous than their under-achieving peers, according to new research, and this is especially the case with women. A study from Roanoke College in Virginia found that the higher a student's grades, the more prone they were to feelings of romantic 'Facebook jealousy' - jealous feelings caused by Facebook posts made by, or sent to, their sexual partner. The researchers concluded that this was because high-achievers are perfectionists and when they think their partner is cheating on them, this desire for perfection is disrupted. U.S. researchers have discovered that intelligent people are more likely to suffer from 'Facebook jealousy' - jealous feelings caused by Facebook messages sent to their sexual partner. This is because high-achievers are perfectionists and any perceived infidelity makes them feel out of control . Facebook has begun rolling out its Graph Search to English-speaking users. Graph Search lets users find specific information about their friends. For example, users can search for friends in London who are vegetarians, friends of friends who like yoga or photos of friends or boyfriends from a certain month or year. The tool was launched in January to a select number of users and engineers. It is now being launched to everyone whose language is set to U.S. English. Participants in the study were asked to imagine different hypothetical Facebook scenarios. These included seeing ambiguous messages on their partner's Facebook from a person of the opposite sex, such as 'What are you up to later?' They were then asked how seeing those messages would make them feel. The researchers additionally tested whether jealousy levels increased when emoticons were used after the messages. These included smiley and winking faces. According to the results, women suffered from much higher levels of 'Facebook jealousy' than men. Adding a winking emoticon was found to have no effect on women's jealousy levels, while men became more jealous when an emoticon was used, compared to when no emoticon was present. The researchers then compared the results to each participants individual grade point average (GPA) score. According to the results, women suffered from much higher levels of 'Facebook jealousy' than men. But men became more jealous when messages were following by emoticons, such as winking faces . Those who showed higher levels of jealousy were also found to have higher GPAs. Study researcher Denise Friedman, an associate professor of psychology at Roanoke College in Salem, told Live Science: 'Students with higher GPAs are often more conscientious, show greater self-control and tend to be perfectionistic.' 'Perceived infidelity likely upsets their attempts at perfection across the board.' 'Evolutionary work suggests men are more jealous of sexual infidelity, while women are more jealous of emotional infidelity,' continued Friedman . 'The winking emoticon was most likely perceived as flirtatious, perhaps even sexually suggestive, which may explain why men were more jealous in this condition.' The full findings will be published this summer.","The more intelligent someone is, the more prone they were to Facebook jealousy' - feelings caused by Facebook messages sent to their partner .

The spinning top was photographed in Kibo, the Japanese Science Module of the Space Station (pictured) In microgravity, the centre of gravity of the top continuously moves while it is spinning, creating the incredible light patterns (pictured) ‘Spirals are deeply connected to life and his experiment attempted to paint spirals with floating light. ‘When a figure with many LEDs attached is spun like a spinning top, the axis becomes inverted and a beautiful phenomenon unique to space is revealed. He added: ‘During this experiment Kibo became a beautiful canvas with an image of bright lights.’ The intriguing movement of the spinning top (pictured) was captured using a camera with a slow shutter speed. Here, it floats around inside the ISS . Astronaut Koichi Wakata (pictured) created the artwork in his spare time on the ISS . The ISS was launched in 1998 and is in low Earth orbit. Since the arrival of Expedition 1 November 2000, the ISS has been . continuously occupied for 13 years and 93 days, the longest continuous . human presence in space. The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which crew members conduct experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and other fields. Microgravity is the condition in which people or objects appear to be weightless. The effects of microgravity can be seen when astronauts and objects, such as the spinning top, float in space. Microgravity refers to the condition where gravity seems to be very small. In microgravity, astronauts can float in their spacecraft - or outside, on a spacewalk. Heavy objects move around easily, so astronauts can move equipment weighing hundreds of pounds with their fingertips.","Koichi Wakata used a slow shutter speed on his camera to capture the spinning top’s spiralling movement as it change colour .

"Brian Taylor, pictured, has been forced to quit his high-profile role after admitting downloading more than 120,000 child porn images . A director of British Naturism has been forced to quit his high-profile role after admitting downloading more than 120,000 child porn images. Brian Taylor, 59, was head of public relations for the group and was chairman of the Spectrum Swimming Club for naturists in Northfield, Birmingham. But he has now been forced to quit both roles after being convicted of child porn offences and placed on the Sex Offenders Register. It has since been revealed that Taylor had previously written about naked images of children, claiming in one his blogs: 'Remember nudity does not equal pornography... it is possible for a naked image to not be pornographic.' Taylor, of Tamworth, pleaded guilty to six counts of making indecent images of children during a hearing at Stafford Crown Court earlier this summer. They included 95 category A images, 431 category B, and more than 128,000 category C. He was sentenced to a three year community order consisting of a 'supervision-intensive sex offender treatment course' at the same court on August 26. Taylor, who is understood to be separated from his wife, was also ordered to pay £400 costs and placed on the Sex Offenders Register for five years. He resigned from his unpaid director role at British Naturism and as chairman of Spectrum Club on September 2 after both learned of the conviction. British Naturism is the UK's officially recognised naturist organisation which has a membership of around 10,500 people. Taylor had been a naturist for more than 30 years and previously stated: 'Naturism is about body acceptance and countering the body shame born of being constantly told to cover our bodies and then presented with air-brushed models in the media.' But it has been revealed that he also made comments on his blogs on British Naturism websites about naked children. He said: 'Remember nudity does not equal pornography, it is perfectly possible for a non-naked image of a child to be pornographic, just as it is possible for a naked image to not be pornographic - take for instance the pictures that many parents take of their children having fun in the bath....' Taylor, from Wiggington Road, Tamworth, pleaded guilty to six counts of making indecent images of children during a hearing at Stafford Crown Court (pictured) earlier this summer . In another post, he said: 'Young children love to be naked themselves and seldom even notice the nakedness of others. 'It is only after prudish adults have brainwashed children that they grow into prudish adults themselves.' A British Naturism spokesman said last night: 'It's difficult for us, we knew him well and had known him for many years. 'We are very surprised and stunned by the news. As with all members, when news of this nature reaches us, membership is terminated.' The Spectrum Club confirmed Taylor had resigned on September 2 after the club learned of his conviction. He had not informed them. He had been a member since 2006 and chairman since 2013.","Brian Taylor quits British Naturism after admitting downloading child abuse pictures .

"A Cambridge academic is seriously ill in hospital after a giant stag charged out of the darkness and gored her through the neck. Kate Stone was on holiday in the Scottish Highlands when the beast charged into her in a ‘one-in-a-million’ accident. Friends watched in horror as the spooked red deer lowered its head and impaled her on its antlers before shaking itself free. Scroll down for video . 'Serious but stable': Dr Kate Stone was gored in the neck by a stag in the early hours of Monday . Dangerous: The animal's antlers pierced Dr Stone's throat, leaving her in critical condition (file picture) The antlers pierced Dr Stone’s throat and she had to be airlifted to a Glasgow hospital for emergency treatment for neck and spinal injuries. Last night doctors said the scientist was in a ‘serious but stable’ condition. Dr Stone, 44, and a group of friends were on a three-day festive break and had been at a ceilidh on Sunday evening before being invited back to local musician Jim Hunter’s home at Lochailort, near Fort William. The 44-year-old is a keen hiker and outdoor enthusiast . The group were laughing and chatting, said Mr Hunter. ‘We had been to the pub up the road and were coming back to my house through the gate. 'It was pitch black and we were using torches to navigate our way back and the big stag must have got trapped in the garden as we have deer fences around it. 'It must have panicked when it saw us and the only way out was through the gate that we were standing at. It just ran at us and went straight through us. ‘Kate was at the back of the group and its antlers must have caught her in the neck. The stag then made for the hills. It was a completely freakish accident, I’ve never seen the like of it before. ‘I think I know the one it is, it’s been hanging around. It’s a three-year-old stag, around 150kg. These are big fellas, you don’t mess with them, they’ll take your car out.’ The group initially thought Dr Stone had simply been knocked over but quickly realised that it was more serious. She was rushed to hospital in Fort William but then flown by air ambulance for specialist treatment at Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital, where she is understood to be in intensive care. Dr Stone, who has two children, is a research engineer in the Institute of Manufacturing at Cambridge and has set up her own technology company, Novalia. She was part of a group of three men and four women visiting the area – hill walking and enjoying the scenery – and staying at the Mo-Dhachaidh Guest House. The group was approaching this gate when the stag seemingly panicked and charged Dr Stone who was the tallest in the group . A young stag pictured crossing the road in Fort William where Dr Stone was staying with friends before the attack . Owner Gary Burton, 51, said: ‘No one here has heard of anything like this in their lifetime, it has shocked the community. ‘It’s a cornered stag with no alternative exit route, it would have just been in a panic. It had nowhere else to go but through the group and unfortunately it seems Kate was in the way. ‘The force of the attack and impact must have been ferocious. I went to the scene later and found Kate’s mobile phone smashed into tiny bits. ‘I understand the type of injury Kate has suffered can cause quadriplegia or paraplegia. The group had been at a ceilidh at the Lochailort Inn (pictured) before being invited to Mr Hunter's home where the attack occurred . She was telling me she enjoyed the . outdoors in the hills and camping on her own in remote places, so any . form of paralysis to such an active person will be a disaster.’ One local gamekeeper with more than 40 years of experience with Highland stags said he had never heard of such an incident. He added: ‘For a stag to come out of the darkness like this and go for someone is highly unusual – a chance in a million.’ In November, a deer farmer died after being attacked by a stag. Kenneth Price, 75, was gored in Llandysul, Wales.","Dr Kate Stone is seriously ill in hospital and may never walk again .

"An aspiring model who was turned down for a smear test because doctors said she was too young to get cervical cancer has died from the disease. Sophie Jones, 19, from Eastham, near Liverpool, was initially told she had Crohn's Disease when she went to the doctor complaining of stomach pains last February. But she was diagnosed with cervical cancer last November after being admitted to hospital when her condition worsened, and died early on Saturday morning. Now her family and friends have launched an online petition calling for smear tests to be offered to women from the age of 16, rather than 25.  Entitled 'Sophie's Choice', the petition has been signed by more than 45,000 people since its publication on Saturday,and 10,000 of them in a three-hour period this morning. 'The life and soul of everything': Sophie Jones, 19, has died of cervical cancer after being refused a smear test . Last Facebook picture: Miss Jones, who posted this photo two weeks ago, died early on Saturday morning . Miss Jones was described by her sister, Stephanie, as 'a very calming influence on everyone around her' While the disease is the most common cancer in women under 35, it is so rare in those under 25 that screening for it is not offered to women until they are 25. Today Miss Jones' mother, Peri Jones, 47, said it was 'just ridiculous' that smear tests were only offered routinely to those over 25. She said: 'At the very least people should be given a choice.  The cost of what Sophie has been through on the NHS is far more than a smear test - however many months ago would have been. 'Sophie knew something was wrong, she knew her body was telling her something but because of her age it wasn't even considered.' She added: 'She was the person that kept us all together as a family, stopped us falling out and was there for everyone.' She said her daughter, who did PR for nightclubs, had been trying to launch her modelling career when she was finally diagnosed with cancer, by which time it was too late. Mrs Jones said: 'Sophie was amazing - she was more concerned about all of us than she was about herself.  Her positive attitude was incredible.' Sophie' sister, Stephanie Jones, said she had vowed to fight the disease 'to the end'. She . said: 'She was still in high spirits even on the morning she died; she . was the life and soul of everything, and just lit the place up. Killer disease: Miss Jones, from Eastham, was admitted to hospital in November after her condition worsened . Model: The teenager had suffered from stomach pains and was initially told she probably had Crohn's Disease . Miss Jones, pictured with her boyfriend Jake Molyneux, was 'in high spirits' the day she died, her sister said . 'She was always a very calming influence on everyone around her, and she loved being with her friends.' She added: 'This should never, ever have happened to her.  Sophie said she would fight it all the way to the end. 'It’s . totally wrong that people are getting refused even when they know . something isn’t right. Everybody knows their own body, and Sophie knew . she wasn’t well.' The family had been fundraising to take Miss Jones on a final holiday, but she died before she had the chance to go. Should routine cervical smear testing start younger than 25? Should routine cervical smear testing start younger than 25? Now share your opinion . Now her family and friends have launched an online petition demanding that the . minimum age for having a smear test be lowered . to 16. The lower age limit for routine testing in England is 25 because the condition is so rare. No girls under the age of 20 died from the disease between 2009 and 2011, according to Cancer Research UK’s most recent statistics. Dr Claire Knight, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, told MailOnline young women should be reassured that cervical cancer is so rare in women under 25. She said:  'It is very rare for women who are still in their teens to be diagnosed with cervical cancer; there have been around 25 in the last decade. 'But it’s important to go to your GP if you notice anything unusual, like pain or discomfort during sex, bleeding in between periods, after sex or after the menopause, or unpleasant vaginal discharge. 'It may well be caused by something much less serious than cancer, but it’s a good idea to get it checked.' The Sophie’s Choice online petition has already collected more than 39,000 signatures since it was started on Saturday. Miss Jones' family say her death should never have happened and want younger girls to have cervical screening . Miss Jones' family and friends are now calling for younger women to be offered cervical cancer screening . Family friend Pamela Keelan, who set up the petition on the day Sophie died, said she hoped to prevent other girls suffering the same fate. The petition reads: 'A friend and amazing young girl, our Sophie has had her life cut short after experiencing symptoms for over a year and being in horrendous pain and even asking for a smear. 'But because of her age - 19 -  she was refused time and time again and now she has terminal cervical cancer. 'Out of loads of doctors, it took that one to say ""We will check you properly"", but then it was too late. 'Our Sophie has been failed in the worst way, and I need 500,000 signatures to be heard, one million to get this changed hopefully.' To view the petition and add your support for the campaign, go to: submissions.epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/62385 . Screening: The test is currently offered to women aged 25 or over . The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis.  Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young.  According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011. The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good. The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety. Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland.  In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year.  In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active. Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later.  Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.","Sophie Jones, 19, from Eastham, near Liverpool, first fell ill last February .

"Mick Schumacher, son of seven-times Formula One World Champion Michael, looks set to carry on his father's legacy after he secured a podium finish in this season's German junior kart championships. The 15-year-old, who finished runner-up at the world championships in France last month, lost his lead in Sunday's final round of races in Genk, Belgium to come in second place - finishing behind main rival David Beckmann. The teenager, who has promised this is 'only the beginning' of his career in the sport, has also one the European title this season.

Shared passion: Michael Schumacher and son attending the Monaco Formula One Grand Prix in Monte-Carlo, with Mick in 2010 . Having raced under the surname of Betsch, his mother Corinna's maiden name, Mick Schumacher adopted the name Mick Jnr this season. Last month he spoke of his intention to pursue a career in the sport, saying that it was 'only the beginning'. Speaking after he was crowned World Karting Vice Champion, Mick said: 'Of course I am proud of such an important result. But it is also clear that it is my goal to be world champion. This is only the beginning of my career.' The 15-year-old continues to race karts, which offer little protection to the driver, as his father receives treatment for his skiing injury at his Switzerland home. Michael Schumacher had a similar start to his legendary racing career - starting to race at a young age after his father built him his first kart when he was just four years old. In 1983, at the age of 14, Michael Schumacher became eligible to hold a German karting licence. And the following year - at the age of 15 - the racing legend won the title of German Kart Champion. His father went on to break numerous records on his way to claiming seven world titles and staking his claim among the sport's most successful drivers.

"A second friend of Officer Darren Wilson has come forward to defend the cop, describing him as a 'really quiet, well-mannered, respectful guy', who never showed any signs of violence. The male friend of the Michael Brown shooter spoke to GMA on Tuesday but asked that his identity be concealed for his own safety. The friend has been exchanging text messages with the 28-year-old Ferguson officer and said: 'I can tell that this is really hard on him.' Scroll down for video . A woman called Josie called a St Louis radio station this weekend in defense of Michael Brown shoot Darren Wilson (pictured). She said that Brown had rushed at the officer after trying to grab his gun and punching him . A male friend of Michael Brown shooter, Officer Darren Wilson, spoke out to defend his friend on Tuesday but asked that his identity be concealed for his own safety . The friend also said that he had played hockey with Wilson for years and had never seen him get into a fight. The show of support for Officer Wilson came after a female friend told a radio station this weekend that the cop shot and killed Michael Brown, 18, because the teen tried to grab his gun, punched him in the face and then charged at him on August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri. A woman calling herself 'Josie' called The Dana Show last Friday to say Wilson had told her Brown had 'bum-rushed' him prior to the shooting. 'Josie', who would only give her first name but said she was friends with the cop's girlfriend, had her account corroborated by a source who said it matched what Wilson told investigators,CNN reported on Monday. The woman said most friends and family were too afraid to speak out but she wanted the public to know Wilson's side of the story. Josie said that on August 9, Wilson came across Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson walking down the middle of a street in the St Louis suburb and pulled up to tell them to get on to the sidewalk. 'He pulled up ahead of them. And then he got a call-in that there was a strong-arm robbery. And, they gave a description,' she told KFTK. 'And, he’s looking at them and they got something in their hands and it looks like it could be what, you know those cigars or whatever. So he goes in reverse back to them. Michael Brown was shot dead on August 9 by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri . 'Tries to get out of his car. They slam his door shut violently. I think he said Michael did. And, then he opened the car again. He tried to get out. He stands up. 'And then Michael just bum-rushes him and shoves him back into his car. Punches him in the face and them Darren grabs for his gun. Michael grabbed for the gun. At one point he got the gun entirely turned against his hip. 'And he shoves it away. And the gun goes off. 'Well, then Michael takes off and gets to be about 35 feet away. And, Darren’s first protocol is to pursue. 'So, he stands up and yells, ''Freeze!'' Michael and his friend turn around. 'And Michael taunts him… And then all the sudden he just started bum-rushing him. He just started coming at him full speed. So [Wilson] really thinks [Brown] was on something, because he just kept coming. It was unbelievable. 'And so he finally ended up, the final shot was in the forehead, and then he fell about two to three feet in front of the officer.' The friend's report, which has not been verified, added to the growing number of different versions of events from the day of the fatal shooting. According to St Louis Post-Dispatch crime reporter Christine Byers on Monday, more than a dozen witnesses had backed up Officer Wilson's report of what happened on August 9. The reporter later admitted she was on maternity leave and her post was 'personal'. Gilbert Bailon, editor for the St Louis Post-Dispatch, issued a statement which read: 'Christine Byers is a police reporter for the St Louis Post-Dispatch who has been on FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) since March. She is not involved in the Ferguson coverage while she is on leave. Her tweets are personal. 'She has tweeted today in regards to her tweet Monday: ""On FMLA from papaer. Earlier tweets did not meet standards for publication.""' Wilson is on paid administrative leave following the shooting and pending the outcome of the investigation. The 28-year-old officer won a commendation for 'extraordinary effort in the line of duty' in February  this year. 'He never intended for any of this to happen,' Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson said. 'It’s devastating, absolutely devastating.' Assistant pathologist Shawn Parcells told CNN on Monday afternoon that it cannot be proved from the initial autopsy whether Brown was rushing the officer or simply standing at a distance. Earlier on Monday, an eye-witness to the shooting released a video of Brown in the street with Wilson pacing back and forth beside his lifeless body in the street. Piaget Crenshaw lives in an apartment with a balcony overlooking the street where the 18-year-old was killed.  She said today that she waited until now to release the video as she feared for her safety and the officer's name had not been released. She told CNN today that she had recorded the incident because she believed that something was wrong. Officer Darren Wilson looks at the body of teenager Michael Brown lying dead in a Missouri street last Saturday after he fired multiple shots . 'From it all initially happening, I knew this was not right,' Miss Crenshaw said. 'I knew the police shouldn't have been chasing this boy and firing at the same time. 'And the fact he got shot in his face, something clicked in me and I thought someone else should see this so I recorded.' The radio caller's version of events also contradicted the statement of Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson who said at press conference on Friday that Officer Wilson was unaware of the store robbery when he stopped Brown. Chief Jackson released the name of Officer Wilson last Friday after mounting public pressure. He had waited after saying that the officer received death threats on social media. The Brown family's lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said on Monday that the teenager had been 'executed in broad daylight' as the results of their independent autopsy were revealed. Professor Shawn Parcells points on Monday to one of the shots that hit teen Michael Brown during a preliminary autopsy report conducted on behalf of the family . Michael Brown died from a 'kill shot' to the top of the head, medical examiner Dr Michael Baden revealed today - but could have survived his five other bullet wounds. Dr Baden told a press conference in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday that he had reassured the teen's mother, Lesley McSpadden, that her son did not suffer. The family's autopsy, which was released on Sunday, revealed the unarmed 18-year-old had been shot at least six times by Wilson. Eye-witnesses have also claimed that Brown had his hands up to signal that he was surrendering. The shooting of the unarmed black teenager has sparked eight days of protests in the once quiet Missouri suburb. Protests over the teen's shooting on August 9 had seen looting and violence in the area. Following a brief calm, trouble returned at the end of last week, prompting Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to put a curfew in place from midnight to 5am. Nixon lifted the curfew on Monday while ordering the National Guard to help restore order. He deployed the Guard Monday following an overnight clash between armored police and what he called ‘a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community'. Nixon said the Guard will be under the direction of the state Highway Patrol.","A male friend of Ferguson cop Darren Wilson said on Tuesday that he played hockey with him for years and had never once seen him get into a fight .

"Seven men have been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after firearms and other weapons were found 'hidden' in a car. One man from West Yorkshire and six from the West Midlands are being questioned on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism following a series of arrests this week, police said today. News of the arrests comes a day after six people, including a white Muslim convert, were detained over an alleged plan to carry out a major terrorist attack, possibly during the Olympics. Police insist the 13 arrests in the last two days do not involve threats to the Games, set to begin in three weeks, and that there is nothing to suggest that two sets of arrests are linked to each other. But the counter-terror sweeps - and a false alarm yesterday that involved a bus filled with passengers - have raised anxiety in the run-up to the games. Arrested: British Muslim convert Richard Dart spent two years working for the Met Police. He was one of six people detained by police across London yesterday . Held: Three men have been charged with terrorism offences after a police operation in which firearms were found in a car stopped by police on the M1 . A West Midlands police spokesman said that officers found material including firearms following a routine stop on the M1 in South Yorkshire last weekend. He said: 'The arrests followed a routine stop of a vehicle by police between J33 and 34 on the southbound side of the M1 motorway in South Yorkshire on Saturday. The car was impounded on suspicion of having no insurance. 'Firearms, offensive weapons and other material were later found hidden inside, prompting police to take action to trace and arrest the driver, passenger and others suspected of being involved. There were two firearms recovered. They are not automatic. They were not loaded and there was also a small amount of ammunition.' Police said three men aged 23, 26 and 27 from Sparkhill, Birmingham, were arrested on Tuesday morning. Three more suspects, a 22-year-old from Alum Rock, Birmingham, a 24-year-old from the Moseley area of the city, and a 22-year-old from Smethwick, West Midlands, were arrested on Wednesday evening. A 43-year old man from Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was detained yesterday in Ravensthorpe, Dewsbury. Detective Chief Superintendent Kenny Bell, head of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said: 'As soon as the items were discovered in the impounded vehicle, our priority was to protect the public by pursuing and arresting those we believed to be involved.' Police said the contents of the car were undergoing forensic analysis and the suspects' homes had been searched. Detectives have been given extra time to question the three men arrested on Tuesday, after the initial 48-hour detention period ran out. They now have until next Tuesday morning to charge or release the men, or apply for a further warrant. All seven men are being held in the West Midlands. Terror raid: A home raided by Metropolitan Police officers in Stratford, east London, one mile from the Olympic Park just three weeks before the Games . Search: A police forensics officer works inside the premises looking for clues . The arrests come a day after a white Muslim convert who once worked as a BBC security guard was among six people arrested over an alleged plan to cause an atrocity in the UK. Also . among those detained was a former police community support officer, who . was arrested at a home just half a mile from the Olympic Stadium. In April last year Richard Dart, using the . name Salahuddin Al Britani, appeared in an internet video uploaded by a . Muslim group vowing to disrupt the wedding of Prince William and . Kate Middleton. Elswhere, Jahangir Alom, 26, who spent two years working for the Metropolitan Police, was also detained. The former police . community support officer, dubbed 'Blunkett Bobbies' because they were . introduced when David Blunkett was Home Secretary, and his two younger . brothers were arrested at 4am at their family . home half a mile from the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. The remaining two were a woman aged 30 and man of 21, who were . arrested at separate homes in West London yesterday, on suspicion of . being part of the terrorist plot. Last night, the suspects' alleged . targets were unclear, as was how it is alleged they planned to strike. But security sources described the arrests 'as very significant' and . counter-terrorism chiefs are convinced they have thwarted a major . attack. A policeman searches the garden of the East Stratford house while others stand guard at the front of the property . A neighbour caught the moment anti-terror police raided the house near the Olympic park . Officers can be seen in SAS-style outfits during the raid which happened at 4am . Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman Steve Field today insisted there was no sense of alarm at the spate of arrests so close to the start of the Summer Games. He said: 'We have been looking at the issue of security at the Olympics for some time and we have robust plans in place.' Yesterday's developments followed . months of surveillance and a recent, worrying increase in intelligence . 'chatter', prompting fears of an attack to coincide with the Olympics . and Paralympics. It is not thought that the suspects . were intending to target Games' venues or spectators. But detectives . fear Islamic radicals will try to maximise publicity with an attack – . anywhere in Britain – during the next two months. Jahangir Alom and his brothers Moybur . Alom, 18, and Alomgir Alom, 24, were arrested at the semi-detached . council home they share with their mother in Abbey Road, Stratford, East . London. One of the men was Tasered as dozens . of armed officers threw 'flash bang' grenades and stormed into their . family home. Neighbours screamed as police dressed in black . paramilitary-style clothing smashed down doors and smoke poured from the . windows. One said: 'I asked one police officer what was going on and he said it was an Olympic exercise.' All three brothers are British nationals from a large Bangladeshi family and attended the local Rokerby High School. Their father, Sheikh Alkas Ali, a chef, is understood to have returned to Bangladesh, where he and his wife were both born. The arrested men's brother-in-law . Salim Ahmed said they had once been acquaintances of radical preacher . Anjem Choudary. Jahangir also appeared in a Channel 4 documentary, My . Brother The Islamist, in which he drove several men to a meeting at a . mosque in Leeds. Jahangir spent two years working as a .

Smashed: A broken door which is thought to have been battered down by police as they arrested three people in Stratford . The scene in Abbey Road, Stratford, East London, just half a mile from the Olympic site . In a nine-minute interview posted on . YouTube, Jahangir – using the name Abu Khalid – said he once harboured . ambitions to become a chief inspector but later quit the police. His arrest was part of a London-wide . terrorist operation that saw Dart detained in the street and a man and . woman held at their home in Ealing, West London. Dart is a Muslim convert who . criticised Britain on TV while claiming benefits to live rent-free. He . also appeared in the documentary My Brother The Islamist, alongside . Jahangir Alom. A total of eight homes across London were being searched last night as officers looked for evidence of a plot.

"High-powered Maserati sports car was also seized in the raid on Szymon Lam's luxury Leeds apartment . Court hears that the proceeds of Lam's fraud were siphoned off to buy property in Germany . Fraudster told police he was now worth £250,000 after arriving from Poland eight years ago with just £500 in his pocket . Credit card fraudster Szymon Lam was jailed after police raided his house and find £90,000 of gold and silver . Police discovered a 'glittering Aladdin’s cave' of gold and silver bullion worth £90,000 when they searched the penthouse flat of a credit card fraudster, a court has heard. A high-powered Maserati sports car was also seized in the raid on Polish national Szymon Lam’s swish riverside apartment in Leeds. West Yorkshire Police officers searched Lam’s home at the Santorini flats beside the river Aire in September 2010 after receiving a tip-off from officers in London. Ian Brook, prosecuting at Leeds Crown Court, said: 'When they got there the police found a glittering Aladdin’s cave.' Mr Brook said photographs of the huge haul of bullion made for 'impressive viewing'. Officers in Leeds were asked to go to the flat after Lam’s wife had been detained at the exclusive Chelsea Bridge Hotel after a form was completed with a false address, the court heard. Police went to her room and found a laptop containing high volumes of credit card numbers. Another laptop containing credit card details was also found in Leeds. The court heard Lam and his wife were highly intelligent, financially astute and had 21 bank accounts between them. Police discovered £90,000 worth of gold and silver bullion when they raided Lam's address . A high-powered Maserati sports car was also seized in the raid on Lam's luxury riverside apartment in Leeds . Lam had profited to the tune of £128,000 through his fraudulent activities, around £90,000 of which he had invested in gold and silver bullion (pictured) After his arrest, Lam told police he had come to the UK eight years previously with just £500 in his pocket and was now worth £250,000. Lam was jailed for three years on Thursday after pleading guilty to money laundering offences. The court heard Lam siphoned off the proceeds of his £128,000 deception into off-shore bank accounts and used it to buy property in Germany. Lam's lawyer said he was solely responsible for the offending. The huge bullion haul was uncovered at Lam's luxury apartment in the Santorini flats in Leeds, pictured . Officers were alerted to the fraud after Lam's wife was held at the Chelsea Bridge Hotel, pictured . His barrister said Lam turned to fraud after being made redundant from a job in IT and running up gambling debts without his wife knowing. She said he was introduced to people at a casino who gave him the idea of committing fraud on-line. Detective Sergeant Tom Walsh, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'It is obviously very unusual for officers to come across such a large amount of gold and silver bullion while searching a flat in Leeds city centre. 'Our investigation uncovered evidence which showed that Szymon Lam was living a lifestyle way beyond his legitimate means and one which therefore could only have been funded by crime.'","High-powered Maserati sports car was also seized in the raid on Szymon Lam's luxury Leeds apartment .

"These remarkable photographs show a testosterone-fuelled battle between two stags in Richmond Park. Photographer Mark Bridger, 45, took the autumnal images over the last two weeks at the famous park in south west London. The area, often called the Old Deer Park, is 147 hectares in size and is home to around 650 animals - 300 of which are red deer and 350 are of the fallow species. October and early November are traditionally the months when stags lock antlers to compete for mating rights with the females - an act that has been captured in these stunning photographs, taken at the largest of London's Royal Parks. Arriving at dawn, Mr Bridger caught some of the action on camera - watching a pair of fallow deer fight for over an hour. In the background a herd of females can be seen watching the fight like a ringside boxing crowd to see which male will come out on top.

"Hundreds of thousands of genetically modified mosquitoes are awaiting federal approval for release into the Florida Keys as part of an experiment aimed at reducing the risk of dengue fever. Mosquito control officials have requested the Food and Drug Administration's sign off on the experiment that would be the first of its kind in the U.S. Some residents of the tourist town of Key West worry though on how much research has been done to determine the risks of releasing genetically modified mosquitoes on the Keys' fragile ecosystem. Let us go! An entomological technician with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, sorts and counts dead mosquitoes in Key West, where officials are hoping to release genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild . Officials are targeting the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes because they can spread dengue fever, a disease health officials thought had been eradicated in the U.S. until 93 cases originated in the Keys in 2009 and 2010. The trial planned by mosquito control officials and the British company Oxitec would release non-biting male mosquitoes that have been genetically modified to pass along a birth defect that kill their progeny before reaching maturity. The idea is that they will mate with wild females and their children will die before reproducing. After a few generations, Key West's Aedes aegypti population would die off, reducing the dengue fever risk without using pesticides and at relatively a low cost, the proponents say. There is no vaccine for dengue fever. 'The science of it, I think, looks fine. It's straight from setting up experiments and collecting data,' said Michael Doyle, pointing to research Oxitec has had published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. He inherited the project when he took the lead at the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District in mid-2011. Genetic adaptions: An Aedes aegypti mosquito is seen feeding on a woman's arm while the ones genetically modified would be non-biting males that pass along a birth defect killing their progeny before reaching maturity . The district's website says the modified genes will disappear from the environment after the mosquitoes carrying it die, resulting in no permanent change to the wild mosquito population. The district also says that the mosquito species isn't native to the Keys, nor is it an integral food source for other animals. Dengue fever is a viral disease that inflicts severe flu-like symptoms — the joint pain is so severe its nickname is 'breakbone fever.' It isn't fatal but victims are then susceptible at subsequent exposures to dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can be. 'It's very uncomfortable. You ache all over, you have a terrible fever,' said Joel Biddle, a Key West resident whose dengue fever symptoms lasted more than a week in 2009. Biddle is among those concerned about the Key West trial. He worries the modified genetic material will somehow be passed to humans or the ecosystem, and he wants more research done. He and other Key West residents also chafe at the fact that the project was in the works long before it was made public late last year. No vaccine: Influenza vaccines are seen before a worker while there is no vaccine for dengue fever which causes similar non-fatal symptoms but also makes victims susceptible to dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is . Only female mosquitoes bite, so the modified genetic material wouldn't be passed on to humans, Mosquito control and Oxitec officials said. They also say they're being transparent about their data and the trial. Real estate agent Mila de Mier has collected more than 117,700 signatures on a petition she posted on Change.org against the trial. Most come from outside the Keys, which de Mier says shows that tourists don't support the mosquito control district. 'We are dependent here on our tourists, and people from all over the country have been sending the message,' de Mier said. A University of Florida professor who studies mosquito control said Oxitec's technology works and evidence from the company's experiments elsewhere show it can control mosquito populations, but it's not clear whether its methods are as effective at controlling the risk of disease transmission. Phil Lounibos of the Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory also said it would take repeated releases of modified mosquitoes for the program to work, and the public outcry against genetically modified organisms, even when it's irrational, may be insurmountable. Growing problem: A field inspector with the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District tests a sprayer used to spray pesticides which have unfortunately become less effective on mosquitoes today . 'The public resistance and the need to reach some agreement between mosquito control and the public, I see that as a very significant issue, outside of the (operating) costs, since this is not just a one-time thing,' Lounibos said. The Aedes aegypti has shown resistance to pesticides used to control other species, and is the most difficult for the district to manage. Common in the Southeast and the Caribbean, it lurks in standing water around homes and businesses and can breed in containers as small as bottle caps. District inspectors go door-to-door to remove the standing water where they breed, a time-consuming task. The district spends roughly $1 million a year to suppress Aedes aegypti, 10 to 15 percent of the agency's budget, Doyle said. 'Unfortunately, control of Aedes aegypti is a never-ending job,' said Larry Hriber, the mosquito control district's research director. In the trial, thousands of male mosquitoes bred by Oxitec would be released in a handful of Key West blocks where the Aedes aegypti is known to breed; the number of mosquitoes in those neighborhoods would be measured against the numbers from similar blocks where no modified mosquitoes were released. Exhausting count: Key West's district spends roughly $1 million a year to suppress Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, what they say is 10 to 15 percent of the agency's budget . The state's agriculture department oversees the mosquito control district, and Doyle said he would not expect any challenge from the state if the FDA signed off on the trial. The mosquito control district wouldn't need any local permit for the trial, either, but officials held a public meeting earlier this year and have posted information on the agency's website. Still, it could take years for the FDA to approve the trial. There hasn't been a case of dengue fever in Key West since November 2010, but two other cases were reported elsewhere in South Florida this fall. The mosquito trial proposed for Key West wouldn't be the first release of genetically modified insects in the U.S. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service concluded that integrating genetically modified pink bollworms, bred by Oxitec to be sterile but more competitive in mating than regular bollworms, into the agency's plant pest control program was 'the environmentally preferable alternative' to combat the cotton pest. The program was discontinued, however, after officials found that the genetically modified insects were not as hardy as pink bollworms sterilized through irradiation, and that their use would cause farmers to lose their organic certification. Oxitec said the USDA's environmental assessment is one of several examples of proof that the trial's risks and methods are being independently evaluated. The company has trials in Brazil, the Cayman Islands and Malaysia, and it says it's gotten positive reviews from the latter two governments. It also cites its published research in peer-reviewed journals. But Biddle, the onetime dengue patient, wants Oxitec to continue testing the modified mosquitoes outside the U.S. 'Why the rush here?' the Key West man said. 'We already have test cases in the world where we can watch what is happening and make the best studies, because wouldn't it be wonderful if we could find out how it can be fail-safe — which it is not right now. It's an open Pandora's box.'","The non-biting male mosquitoes genetically modified would pass along a birth defect killing their .

"These spectacular images document the final red deer stag season of professional stalker Peter Fraser, who has employed traditional methods of deer stalking for 45 years. He has served as head stalker for 43 years on the Invercauld Estate in Braemar, Scotland. The stalking season runs from July until October and he is set to retire in November. His day-to-day work revolves around hunting and shooting wild red deer, an iconic Scottish species. He controls the numbers of deer for the health of the herd and the benefit of their habitat. Quarry: Head stalker Peter Fraser prepares to load a freshly shot stag onto a pony at Milstone Cairn in Glen Callater on the Invercauld Estate. Dram: Peter Fraser enjoys a break at Auchallater farm on the Invercauld Estate. Guide: Mr Fraser leads a shooting party up to Milstone Cairn in Glen Callater. Clean shot: Mr Fraser and his party after a successful shoot at Milstone Cairn in Glen Callater. The cull is necessary for the greater good of the herd. Deer stalking involves the stealthy pursuit of deer, typically with a high powered rifle fitted with a telescopic sight. It is necessary because carnivorous predators of adult deer have long been hunted to extinction . in Britain. The objective is to maintain a stable and . healthy population of deer and involves careful planning. Injured or sick animals are targeted first, then barren or very old animals. If the population needs to be reduced, more females will be . culled. If a population increase is required, only injured or sick . animals will be culled. Stalking is a hard life, involving going out in all weathers and stalkers are used by guests hunting the stags. As well as his work as a stalker, Mr Fraser is dedicated to all the wildlife on the estate and traps stoats, weasels and crows, as well as keeping fox numbers in check, to stop the land becoming overrun by vermin. According to the Invercauld Estate website, the land has been owned by the Farquharson family for centuries and incorporates approximately 200 square miles of spectacular scenery. Mr Fraser prepares to load a freshly shot stag onto a pony (left) and surveys the terrain for deer through binoculars, with his rifle slung across his back (right). Hunter Dave Stewart holds up his rifle after shooting a stag. Hunters frequently use suppressors as stealth is of the utmost importance when stalking. Trophy: Mr Fraser holds a Stag's antlers near the larder on Auchallater farm. Headless: Mr Fraser has been stalking for 45 years and will retire in November. Culled: A successful hunter hauls his trophy on horseback. If left unchecked, deer populations could soar and impact the food supply and habitat. Heave: The hunting party loads a stag onto a pony at Milstone Cairn. Ponies are perfect for the job thanks to their strength and ability to handle the difficult terrain. Aftermath: Mr Fraser drags a stag after it has been shot. Hunter Stephen Henry carries his rifle on his back as he follows Mr Fraser. Jubilant: Mr Fraser, Dave Stewart (R) and Stephen Henry (L) share a joke after a successful shoot. Culling is the only viable form of population control. Stalking: Using binoculars Mr Fraser and Mr Henry view stags from the Land Rover in Corrie Kander. The hunt requires meticulous planning and study of the herd. Gutted: The carcasses have their internal organs removed and are hung up for inspection post-hunt. Mr Fraser has spent more than four decades perfecting his skills. Surgical precision: The stalker uses a knife to cut open a recently shot stag (left), while hunters enjoy bacon butties and a hot drink at the start of a gruelling day (right). Stunning: The hunts take place against the backdrop of the Scottish Highlands, featuring some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. Man's best friend: Dogs are used to flush out the deer to the waiting rifles of the hunters. Blood stains the white hair of a pony as it hauls a successful kill across the breathtaking landscape. Reconnaissance: The party pause to scan the grounds for their prey. Hunters flock to the Highlands to enjoy stalking the red deer.","Peter Fraser has stalked deer for 45 years on  the Invercauld Estate in Braemar, Scotland .

"Defense attorneys for convicted murderer Jodi Arias on Wednesday sought to portray the victim as a man torn between his devout Mormon faith and his secret sexual urges as they worked to convince a jury to spare her life. Arias was found guilty of murder last year in the 2008 killing of ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander at his suburban Phoenix home, but jurors deadlocked on whether she should be sentenced to death or life in prison. Prosecutors have one more shot with a new jury to secure a death sentence. Otherwise, the 24-year-old faces life in prison. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Arias was found guilty of murder last year in the 2008 killing of ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander at his suburban Phoenix home . Life: Prosecutors have one more shot with a new jury to secure a death sentence. Otherwise, Arias faces life in prison . The retrial was a mini-trial of sorts to get the fresh jury - of 12 women and six men, including six alternates - up to speed on the case. Testimony on Wednesday mirrored the previous trial during which Arias' attorneys portrayed her as a naive woman in love with a man who only used her for sex, while Alexander maintained to friends and family that he was a virgin and devout Mormon saving himself for marriage. 'There's a mastery here of deception,' said defense witness L.C. Miccio-Fonseca, a psychologist who described Alexander as a man who led two separate lives — one of sexual deviancy with Arias and another of religious conviction around his friends and family. 'He was a committed Mormon,' Miccio-Fonseca said. 'He was a spiritual man. I think he really genuinely struggled with this.' Testimony: Testimony on Wednesday mirrored the previous trial during which Arias' attorneys portrayed her as a naive woman in love with a man who only used her for sex, while Alexander maintained to friends and family that he was a virgin and devout Mormon saving himself for marriage . Prosecutors argue that Arias killed Alexander in a jealous rage after he wanted to end their affair. He suffered nearly 30 knife wounds, was shot in the head, and had his throat slit. Arias acknowledged killing him, but claims it was self-defense after he attacked her in his home. Miccio-Fonseca said that despite being snubbed in public by Alexander and kept hidden from his friends and family, Arias continued to seek his affection and sex because she was in love with him. 'Love is pretty powerful and so it makes us do crazy things,' she said. 'Because her love for him was powerful, wasn't it?' asked defense attorney Kirk Nurmi. 'Oh yes,' Miccio-Fonseca said. The retrial resumed Wednesday with arguments by defense attorneys accusing authorities of destroying evidence on Alexander's computer that may have benefited Arias' case. They say files were deleted by police that showed he had visited numerous pornographic websites, something her attorneys claim would have helped bolster Arias' contention that the victim was a sexual deviant. Self-defense: Alexander suffered nearly 30 knife wounds, was shot in the head, and had his throat slit. Arias acknowledged killing him, but claims it was self-defense after he attacked her in his home. Accusations: The retrial resumed Wednesday with arguments by defense attorneys accusing authorities of destroying evidence on Alexander's computer that may have benefited Arias' case . They are seeking a dismissal of all charges or at least to have the death penalty removed as a sentencing option. The judge denied a request by the defense to delay the trial based on the allegations, explaining she would take up the matter at a later date. Prosecutor Juan Martinez said his office had the computer reanalyzed just this week, and it showed the defense claims are false. He also noted that if anything was deleted from the computer, it was done by Arias' previous defense attorneys, not authorities. 'It confirmed that he had not accessed any of the (pornographic) sites that they're claiming he accessed,' Martinez said. But Nurmi told the judge a 'plethora of evidence' is being uncovered by computer experts 'as we speak.' The retrial is expected to continue into December.","Defense attorneys for convicted murderer Jodi Arias on Wednesday sought to portray the victim as a man torn between his devout Mormon faith and his secret sexual urges as they worked to convince a jury to spare her life .

"Family members of slain Hofstra coed gave their final goodbyes at an . emotional funeral service Wednesday, including the victim’s distraught twin . sister who is unable to eat and keeps keeps asking how she could have prevented . the tragedy. Andrea Rebello, 21, died after a cop accidentally shot her in her home after a man broke in and took her hostage. Twin sister Jessica was at the house at the time of the shooting. Family members and college classmates were packed into Sleepy Hollow, New York's St. Teresa of Avila Church church May 22 to bid Rebello a final farewell and try to make sense of the tragedy. Mourning: Andrea Rebello's father Fernando, left, twin sister Jessica, second from left and mother Nella, third from left tearfully follow her casket after her funeral service at St. Teresa . Heartbreak: Jessica Rebello, right, is asking what she could have done to prevent the killing of her twin Andrea . 'During this . tragedy a question comes to mind - why?' Reverand Osvaldo Franklin said. 'Why Andrea, in the flower of her youth, she left us?' As the crowd sobbed, lohud.com reports, Franklin tried to offer comfort, if not an answer. 'She has left us to join our father in heaven,' Franklin said. 'We are here to pray for the family that she left behind.' Perhaps the most besieged among the crowd of 500 was th emotionally stricken Jessica Rebello. The grandfather of Andrea Rebello, . who died after Dalton Smith, 30, forced his way into the house near . Hofstra University early on Friday morning, said her twin now sleeps . much of the time. 'When she wakes up, she says ""Oh my God, what did I do wrong?""' Henrique Santos told Newsday. Devastated: Andrea's sister Jessica and father Fernando arrive at the church in Sleepy Hollow, New York . Disbelief: Mourners embrace outside the church, five days after Andrea was accidentally shot dead . He said Jessica does not blame herself but constantly asks . how she could have prevented it. The service was held after friends gathered at a wake for Rebello in Tarrytown, New York on . Tuesday night. She was killed when officer Nikolas . Budimlic responded to the break in and entered the home, where he found . Dalton Smith holding Andrea in a headlock. He fired eight shots, fatally hitting Andrea in the head and killing Smith. Torn apart: The girls lived in the house with other sorority sisters just a block from Hofstra University . The New York police union has defended Budimlic by  saying the only person responsible for the woman's death was the gunman who held her hostage. 'There . is some second guessing by people who think we should have stayed . outside the house, but our job is to get inside and make sure we can . protect as many people as we can,' said James Carver. Budimlic is on sick leave while authorities investigate. 'The . officer sends his thoughts and prayers to the victim,' Carver said. 'He . is a religious man and has a strong family background, and he has a lot . of support from his family and friends.' Nassau police sources said that the police officer had followed the rules, calling it a 'tragic accident'. 'There's . no playbook. You arrive at a home, and the guy has a gun to the . victim’s head - what do you do?' the source said. 'You rely on your . training and your instincts and hope for the best outcome.' But Andrea's grandfather questioned the protocol the officer was following. 'I think the police is not very professional,' Santos said. 'If he's professional, he should have tried negotiation.' Tragic: Andrea Rebello, left, was shot dead by a police officer as Dalton Smith, right, used her as a shield . Response: Two police officers responded to the scene (pictured on Friday) and found Smith holding a gun to Rebello's head. One of the officers shot eight times, hitting Rebello once in the head . Others echoed this sentiment, asking whether officers should have waited for help from a hostage negotiating team. A high school friend of Andrea Rebello said he believed her death could have been prevented. 'It's . a tragedy,' Anthony Martinato of Tarrytown said outside Coffey Funeral . Home. 'The only time I see her is in an open coffin.' But Patty . Neuwirth of Briarcliff Manor, who knows Rebello's father, said she . sympathized with everyone involved, including the police officer. 'None of us can put ourselves in the position of any of them,' Neuwirth said. Another family friend, Maria Sousa of Millbrook, described the family as 'beyond devastated.' Twins: The Rebello girls came as a unit, university staff said, and Jessica (right) is now unable to eat . 'I think this was unnecessary,' Sousa said, adding that the officer should have waited for backup. A key question is whether the officers responding to the house near the Hofstra campus early Friday were aware the intruder was holding hostages. Police officials described the initial report as simply a robbery in progress. After Smith forced his way into the home, he demanded money for the sisters and two other people in the home. He allowed one of the students to leave to get money from an ATM but she called police. '[The officer] went into the house, he deemed it was not appropriate to wait at that time,' Carver said. 'If he would have waited, we don't know what could have happened.' Smith had a warrant out for his arrest for violating his parole. School-wide: Hofstra University observed a moment of silence for Rebello during their graduation May 19 . Respect: Mourners arrive at Andrea Rebello's wake Tuesday ahead of her funeral on Wednesday . Memorial: Most of the crowd at the Tarrytown wake wore black to remember the Hofstra student . The state Department of Corrections and . Community Supervision said he served nine years of a 10-year sentence . for attempted robbery and criminal possession of a weapon and was . released in May 2012. He was arrested for a parole violation in July and was told he wouldn't have to go back to prison if he successfully completed a 90-day drug treatment program. He finished the program in February. A warrant was issued in April after he didn't make contact with his parole officer and left his approved residence.","Andrea Rebello, 21, was killed by a police officer as a masked intruder held her in a headlock at her home near Hofstra University on Friday .

"The woman at the center of the David Petraeus cheating scandal warned another woman to 'back off' and 'stay away' from the retired general in threatening emails uncovered by the FBI. Petraeus quit his post as director of the CIA on Friday while offering an apology over the affair, allegedly with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. His apology came as reports show . that the affair blew up in Petraeus' face after Broadwell allegedly sent the e-mails to another woman whom she accused of getting too close to him. The woman was later identified as a State Department military liaison. Scroll down for video . A Woman Scorned? It is being claimed that the affair between David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell emerged after she sent threatening emails to Ms Kelley . The recipient of those emails, fearing for her safety, contacted the FBI - which found that Broadwell had sent them. A government official told the New York Post that the emails contained such language as: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy.' The official added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and thought she was in a 'lovers triangle.' Little is known about the recipient of those emails, including her identity, but the paper reported that she was not Petraeus' wife. Broadwell, who is married with two young sons, has not responded to multiple emails and phone messages. She had planned to celebrate her 40th birthday in Washington this weekend, with many reporters invited. Her husband Scott emailed guests to cancel the party. It is also claimed that Broadwell used Petraeus' own Gmail account to send the emails, and when the . FBI began to investigate an obvious national security issue instead . uncovered explicit messages between the two sent from the decorated war . hero's own account - indicating an affair. Three senior law enforcement officials with knowledge of the case told the Washington Post that when Petraeus' name was raised in connection with the threatening emails, the FBI thought that security had been breached. 'Affair': Paula Broadwell (right) allegedly sent threatening emails to scare off a woman she suspected of being too close to the retired general - a State Department military liaison . CIA officers long had expressed concern about Broadwell's unprecedented access to the director. She frequently visited the spy agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to meet Petraeus in his office, accompanied him on morning runs around the CIA grounds and often attended public functions as his guest, according to two ex-intelligence officials. Investigating the threatening messages, FBI . agents uncovered evidence that he and 40-year-old Broadwell were . involved in an extramarital affair. FBI . investigators first interviewed Petraeus about what they had found two . weeks ago and informed him that no criminal charges would be brought and . no-one is thought to have discussed the possibility of his resignation. But, according to the Washington Post, . after an investigation Justice Department officials were unclear what . to do next, because no crime had occurred nor breach of security. They contacted James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence and told him they had compromising material about Petraeus. Clapper in turn spoke to Petraeus and advised him to resign. 'Other woman': Paula Broadwell, left, is married . and has two children. Petraeus has been married to his wife Holly, . pictured right, for 37 years, and they also have two children . 'Director Clapper learned of the situation from the FBI on Tuesday evening around 5pm,' the intelligence official said to the Washington Post. 'In subsequent conversations with Director Petraeus, Director Clapper advised Director Petraeus to resign.' Director . Clapper also added that he did not see the need for an internal . investigation by the CIA, citing it as 'a very personal matter, not a . matter of intelligence.' On Wednesday evening, Clapper went to the White House and on Thursday morning President Obama was informed. Later on Thursday, Petraeus arrived to see the President and offered his resignation, which was accepted on Friday. The Washington Post also reported that in an email message to a friend, Petraeus apologized for his actions. Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student . 'He was deeply sorry for the pain he has caused his family,' the friend said. 'He also noted how much he loved his job at the agency. He said he really relished the intellectual challenge there.' Broadwell did not respond to voice mail or email messages seeking comment. Broadwell's biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,' was written with Vernon Loeb, a Washington Post editor, and published in January. Lawmakers from both parties joined Obama in praising Petraeus. Obama said in a statement that Petraeus had provided 'extraordinary service to the United States for decades' and had given a lifetime of service that 'made our country safer and stronger.' CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell will serve as acting director, Obama said. Morell was the key CIA aide in the White House to President George W. Bush during the 9/11 attacks. 'I am completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission,' Obama said. West Point Graduate: Broadwell, pictured here in Afghanistan, has more than a decade of U.S. military service . Broadwell, pictured with Lt Col. Steve Grenier in Gizab, writes opinion pieces on leadership . The resignation comes at a sensitive time. The administration and the CIA have struggled to defend security and intelligence lapses before the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three others. It was an issue during the presidential campaign that ended with Obama's re-election Tuesday. The CIA has come under intense scrutiny for providing the White House and other administration officials with talking points that led them to say the Benghazi attack was a result of a film protest, not a militant terror attack. It has become clear that the CIA was aware the attack was distinct from the film protests roiling across other parts of the Muslim world. Morell rather than Petraeus now is expected to testify at closed congressional briefings next week on the assault on the consulate in Benghazi, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Petraeus, who turned 60 on Wednesday, has been married for 38 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was a cadet at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. She was the daughter of the academy superintendent. They have two children, and their son led an infantry platoon in Afghanistan. Awkward: Holly Petraeus (left in white) and Paula Broadwell sit in the front row during the CIA confirmation . hearing of US Army General David Petraeus . Oath of office: Petraeus was sworn in last September by Joe Biden with his wife Holly at his side . The retired general told his staffers in a statement that he was guilty of 'extremely poor judgment' in engaging in the affair. 'Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours.' At FBI headquarters, spokesman Paul Bresson declined to comment on the information that the affair had been discovered in the course of an investigation by the bureau. Petraeus, who became CIA director in September 2011, was known as a shrewd thinker and hard-charging competitor. His management style was recently lauded in a Newsweek article by Broadwell. The article listed Petraeus' 'rules for living.' No. 5 was: 'We all make mistakes. The key is to recognize them, to learn from them, and to take off the rear view mirrors - drive on and avoid making them again.' Petraeus, in his email, told his CIA employees that he treasured his work with them 'and I will always regret the circumstances that brought that work with you to an end.' Family Man: In a photograph from 2004 David .

Glory Days: David Petraeus is America's . best-known general and arguably the most consequential Army leader of . his generation. Here he salutes troops in Afghanistan in 2011 . The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said Petraeus' departure represented 'the loss of one of our nation's most respected public servants. From his long, illustrious Army career to his leadership at the helm of CIA, Dave has redefined what it means to serve and sacrifice for one's country.' Other CIA directors have resigned under unflattering circumstances. CIA Director Jim Woolsey left over the discovery of a KGB mole, and director John Deutch left after the revelation that he had kept classified information on his home computer. Before Obama brought Petraeus to the CIA, he was credited with salvaging the U.S. war in Iraq. 'His inspirational leadership and his genius were directly responsible - after years of failure - for the success of the surge in Iraq,' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Friday. President George W. Bush sent Petraeus to Iraq in February 2007, at the peak of sectarian violence, to turn things around as head of U.S. forces. He oversaw an influx of 30,000 U.S. troops and moved troops out of big bases so they could work more closely with Iraqi forces scattered throughout Baghdad. Petraeus' success was credited with paving the way for the eventual U.S. withdrawal.","Details of Petraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell emerged when she allegedly sent threatening messages to another woman, later revealed to be a State Department military liaison .

"The address of a property belonging to Cherie and Tony Blair was found on a terror suspect, the Old Bailey heard . A terror suspect was caught carrying bombmaking instructions and Tony Blair’s address, a court was told yesterday. Erol Incedal, 26, was arrested at gunpoint after a bug that police planted in his car recorded his rants against the West. Officers allegedly then found a micro memory card hidden in his iPhone case with a step-by-step guide on making an improvised explosive device. The mobile, which had the black flag of jihadist group Islamic State as its home screen, had been used to visit extremist sites and monitor the war in Syria. An Old Bailey jury was told the handwritten address of Mr Blair and his wife Cherie was found in Incedal’s Versace glasses case. Opening the prosecution’s case yesterday, Richard Whittam said the law student was plotting a terrorist outrage. He said the target was unknown and may have been ‘against a limited number of individuals, an individual of significance or a more wide ranging and indiscriminate attack’. The QC suggested the plan might have been to copy the carnage in 2008 in Mumbai when more than 150 people were killed by marauding gunmen. The Old Bailey trial is being held in conditions of extreme secrecy with the vast majority of the evidence to be heard behind closed doors. The case would not have been reported at all had the media not persuaded a High Court judge that complete secrecy was an affront to centuries of open justice. Incedal and Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, 26, were arrested in a dramatic police swoop as they travelled through east London in a black 2010-plate Mercedes last October 13. The court heard that counter terrorist police discovered identical memory cards wrapped in masking tape and concealed in the cases of their iPhones. Forensic experts discovered they were loaded with three files with innocent titles but which allegedly contained detailed bombmaking instructions. The material included a ‘car bomb recognition guide’, details of a ‘gas bomb’, information to help make detonators and a photograph of an exploding jet. One of the documents began with the advice: ‘The first rule of bomb-making is your first mistake will be your last.’ The court heard that almost a fortnight earlier police had covertly photographed the contents of the Mercedes and installed a bug after stopping Incedal for a traffic offence. Mr Whittam said the device recorded him referring to a ‘plan B’ because he feared the authorities were on to him. Londoner Erol Incedal, 26, centre, who is of Turkish origin, is accused of terror charges but denies them . Watched: Incedal on a quad bike (left) and Mounir Rarmoul-Bouhadjar, 26 (right) who pleaded guilty last week . The court was told he said: ‘We might have to destroy everything and do something else, plan B.’ Speaking to his wife, with whom he has three young children, he added: ‘These pigs, I just feel like running them over.’ When she asked why he was calling the police ‘pigs’, he replied: ‘They are pigs, they are known as pigs. Everyone, even the kuffar [non-Muslims] call them pigs.’ In another conversation, he said: ‘They made a big mistake there. There was some very important stuff in the car … if they found it … effed.’ Police discovered Incedal had access to a property other than his family home and found a laptop there, the court heard. It contained evidence of email and Skype conversations with an unknown figure overseas who used a woman’s username. Incedal was handcuffed and did not reply when told he was a suspected terrorist, the prosecutor said . Mr Whittam said some of the ‘cautious’ deleted exchanges were recovered and contained coded references to a terrorist attack. In one, Incedal referred to ‘straps’, which the court was told is slang for guns. The other man replied: ‘These straps are not the little ones. They are like the ones we have here.’ He then used a code word which police believe meant ‘Kalashnikov’. In a further exchange a code word for ‘Mumbai-style’ was also used, the jury was told. On his laptop, counter terrorism police found a prayer to mujahedeen fighters and those who create improvised explosive devices. Incedal, formerly known as AB and a British citizen of Turkish origin, is accused of preparing acts of terrorism and possessing bombmaking instructions. He denies all the charges. Rarmoul-Bouhadjar pleaded guilty to possessing bombmaking instructions last week and is not on trial. The trial is expected to last up to six weeks. Incedal, pictured in court, had the black ISIS flag as his iPhone's wallpaper, jurors at the Old Bailey heard . Dozens of terror trials have been staged at the Old Bailey but few have involved the level of secrecy seen yesterday. The opening remarks by the prosecution were heard in public but the vast majority of the trial until the jury returns its verdict will be held behind closed doors. The evidence will be heard in three ways, in public; with a small group of journalists who cannot report what they hear; and entirely in secret. The unusual arrangements are the result of a compromise struck after a successful High Court challenge by the media. Several organisations, including this newspaper, objected to plans by the trial judge to hold the trial entirely in secret for reasons of national security. A panel of senior judges ruled that total secrecy would go against the principle of openness at the heart of the British criminal justice system. As a result, ten accredited journalists are allowed to witness some of the closed proceedings – but will not be able to report what they heard. They must also hand over their phones before every session, leave their notes in a locked safe and not discuss the case with outsiders. The journalists have been warned that breaching the order could lead to prosecution for contempt of court.

"Payout: Foreign Secretary William Hague announced details of the compensation in the Commons . The UK government is to pay £14million in compensation to  elderly Kenyans tortured by British colonial forces, but Foreign Secretary William Hague today stopped short of issuing an apology. With legal fees, the total bill for the brutal treatment of  thousands of prisoners tortured and raped under colonial rule will reach almost £20million. Mr Hague told MPS the the British Government continued to . deny liability for what happened during the uprising as he only conceded 'we understand the pain and grievance felt by those who were involved'. Negotiations began after a London court ruled in October that three elderly Kenyans, who suffered castration, rape and beatings . while in detention during a crackdown by British forces and their Kenyan . allies in the 1950s, could sue Britain. The torture took place during the . so-called Kenyan 'Emergency' of 1952-60, when fighters from the Mau Mau . movement attacked British targets, causing panic among white settlers . and alarming the government in London. In a Commons statement, Mr Hague He said the Government had reached a . full and final settlement with the solicitors representing the 5,228 . claimants totalling £19.9 million. The UK Government would also support . the construction of a memorial in Kenya's capital Nairobi to the victims . of torture and ill-treatment during the colonial era. The Foreign . Secretary said: 'We recognise that British personnel were called upon to . serve in difficult and dangerous circumstances.

'Torture and ill-treatment are abhorrent violations of human dignity which we unreservedly condemn.'

It came after ministers’ dramatic confession last year that officials and Kenyan allies did commit atrocities. 'We have agreed on an out-of-court settlement,' Kenyan lawyer Paul Muite, an advisor to the Mau Mau veterans seeking compensation, said. '(The negotiations) have included everybody with sufficient evidence of torture. And that number is about 5,200,' he said, declining to comment on the size of the payout.

This payments work out at about £2,600 - . or 339,560 Kenyan shillings - per claimant in a country where average . national income per capita is around 70,000 shillings. The . Mau Mau nationalist movement originated in the 1950s among the Kikuyu . people of Kenya. Its loyalists advocated violent resistance to British . domination of the country. The Kenya Human Rights Commission has estimated 90,000 Kenyans were killed or maimed and 160,000 detained during the uprising. London tried for three years to block the Mau Mau veterans' legal action in the courts, drawing condemnation from the elderly torture victims who accused Kenya's former colonial master of using legal technicalities to fight the case. Caroline Elkins, a Harvard history professor who acted as an expert witness in the case launched in 2009, said the settlement would be the first of its kind for the former British Empire. '(It) should be seen as a triumph,' Elkins said during a visit to Nairobi for the British announcement. Elkins wrote the book 'Imperial Reckoning: The Untold Story of Britain's Gulag in Kenya' which served as the basis for the Mau Mau case. Britain had first said that responsibility for events during the Mau Mau uprising passed to Kenya upon its independence in 1963, an argument which London courts rejected. The government then said the claim was brought long after the legal time limit. But a judge in October's ruling said there was ample documentary evidence to make a fair trial possible.","Foreign Secretary William Hague says government 'understands' pain .

"Whoopi Goldberg reportedly has Rosie O'Donnell to thank for spoiling her plans to star in a new sitcom. According to multiple reports, Goldberg was expected to exit The View after being cast in comedian Jermaine Fowler's new ABC prime-time series, Delores and Jermaine. But when Rosie O'Donnell departed from the talk show last week, ABC network executives allegedly withdrew their offer to Goldberg in order to keep her on as the moderator of The View. Scroll down for video . Backstage drama: Whoopi Goldberg, pictured left in New York Tuesday, reportedly had to pass up on a starring role in a new sitcom so she could stay on as the moderator of The View after Rosie O'Donnell (right) exited the show . Farewell: O'Donnell, pictured holding her daughter, Dakota, ended her second stint on The View February 12 . Linked: Goldberg, 59, has been the moderator on the show since 2007, when she replaced O'Donnell after her first eight-month stint on The View . Page Six reported Wednesday that the decision was made before President's Day weekend. Delores and Jermaine is based on the life of Jermaine Fowler. The sitcom stars the comedian as an ambitious but unmotivated millennial who moves in with his grandmother, a tough-talking, football-obsessed retired Washington DC police officer. Entertainment Weekly reported that Danny Chun, of The Simpsons and The Office, will write and executive produce the show alongside Fowler, Avi Gilbert and Michael Rotenberg. If the sitcom were picked up by the network for a full season, it would have been Goldberg's first series since her show, Whoopi, ended in 2004 after only one season. Goldberg has been the moderator on The View since 2007, when she replaced O'Donnell after her first turbulent eight-month stint on the program. On Tuesday, Goldberg addressed the remours swirling around her career plans, telling the paper that ABC has always been willing to accommodate her side projects, and that her contract with the network allows her to take on movie and TV roles. Speaking at a fashion show in New York, the veteran talk show host revealed that she has been trying to join the cast of the new drama Empire on Fox, but ABC wants her to do another show. She did not specify whether the project in question was Delores and Jermaine. 'But it’s a lot of work to go and do two or three jobs at the same time,’ Goldberg told the paper. ‘I’m getting older, and I don’t want to work that hard. So we’ll see how it all works out.’ An anonymous source within ABC has denied that Goldberg has been pulled from the new sitcom, calling the claims' hilarious,' reported the New York Daily News. The View moderator also said that she was ‘very happy’ with her current arrangement. Goldberg was slated to play Jermaine Fowler's (pictured) grandmother on his new sitcom, Delores and Jermaine . ‘I never put down the fact that I have a really good job, but I also have bosses. They make decisions,’ she added. Rosie O'Donnell made her exit from The View last Thursday in a segment that lasted barely 40 seconds. She thanked the show's creator, Barbara Walters, for having her on twice. She announced last weekend she was leaving. O'Donnell, who is going through a divorce and has had a heart attack, said she needed to reduce the stress in her life. Her outsized personality brought the usual tabloid rumors of backstage strife at the daytime talk show. O'Donnell had returned to The View in September, part of a revamp aimed at stopping a ratings slide, joining Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace on the panel.","Goldberg was reportedly expected to exit The View after being cast in ABC's new prime-time series Delores and Jermaine .

"Home Secretary Theresa May has persuaded the countries to campaign with Britain for tighter restrictions on migrants' access to handouts and other services . Migrants from other EU member states are putting ‘considerable strain’ on schools, healthcare and the welfare state, Britain and Germany have warned in an unprecedented joint statement. They joined Austria and the Netherlands in demanding an end to rampant abuse by benefit tourists of the EU’s free movement directive. The call comes before citizens of Romania and Bulgaria are granted free access to the EU jobs market and benefit system on January 1 next year. Home Secretary Theresa May has persuaded the countries to campaign with Britain for tighter restrictions on migrants’ access to handouts and other services. Last night, the countries sent a joint letter to the Council of the European Union, arguing that the free movement directive – a founding principle of the EU – must not be ‘unconditional’. The letter, which calls for action at a meeting of the EU’s justice and home affairs council in June, warns that some towns and cities ‘are under a considerable strain by certain immigrants from other member states’. It adds: ‘These immigrants avail themselves of the opportunities that freedom of movement provides, without, however, fulfilling the requirements for exercising this right. 'This type of immigration burdens the host societies with considerable additional costs, in particular caused by the provision of schooling, health care and adequate accommodation.’ The four countries also want to make it harder for citizens of other member states to gain access to benefits within days or weeks of arriving in a member state. Britain has long sought changes to the rules on entitlement to welfare but its chances of success were limited while it remained a lone voice in Brussels. That Germany, in particular, has joined the campaign will place huge pressure on other member states to come to an agreement on tightening the rules. The letter was sent to Alan Shatter, president of the justice and home affairs council, and was signed by Mrs May, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, Austria’s federal minister of the interior; Dr Hans Peter Friedrich, Germany’s federal minister of the interior, and Fred Teeven, minister for immigration in The Netherlands. The free movement directive says that all 500million citizens of the EU should be free to enter any member state, with only the most minor of border controls. Last night, the countries sent a joint letter to the Council of the European Union, arguing that the free movement directive must not be 'unconditional'. It was sent to Alan Shatter, president of the justice and home affairs council . But the letter says that abuse of the directive is having a negative effect on some states with its burden on benefits, schools and healthcare. It continues: ‘On top of this strain on vital local services, a significant number of new immigrants draw social assistance in the host countries, frequently without a genuine entitlement, burdening the host countries’ social welfare systems.’ The letter added that the signatories wanted to stop migrants ‘who have only recently arrived in a member state and have never been employed or paid taxes there to claim the same social security benefits as that of member state’s own citizens’. They also want a crackdown on migrants from outside the EU who marry an EU citizen in order to gain access to state handouts. The letter states: ‘All necessary measures need to be taken to deal with the consequences of this type of immigration and to fight its causes. This includes legal as well as financial measures.’Last month, David Cameron said he was determined to end Britain’s ‘soft touch’ reputation on immigration and welfare. From next year, arrivals from the EU will be stripped of jobseekers’ benefits after six months unless they can prove they have been actively looking for a job and stand a ‘genuine chance’ of finding one. A Labour frontbencher was accused of being ‘xenophobic’ after saying ‘it would be nice to see a British hotel receptionist’. While discussing immigration, Chris Bryant said many employers ‘do not bother’ hiring Britons, leaving locals in his Rhondda constituency feeling ‘undercut’. Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi said: ‘Labour have gone from an ‘open-door’ policy to cynically peddling xenophobic rhetoric.’ Last night Mr Bryant said: ‘I made no anti-immigrant comments... the [hospitality] industry has failed to train and upskill local workforce.’","Join Austria and the Netherlands to demand end to abuse by benefit tourists .

"A terror attack could be launched in the UK by Britons radicalised while fighting with rebels in Syria, William Hague warned today. The Foreign Secretary said a 'substantial number' of British fighters had joined the battle to defeat president Bashar Assad, posing 'current and future risks to UK national security'. It comes after the EU's counter terror chief  warned radicalised Europeans pose 'a serious threat when they get back' from Syria. Foreign Secretary William Hague said 'substantial numbers' of British nationals had been attracted to  violent Islamist groups . Britain has promised to step up its support for the rebels, hinting that it could be ready to send arms. But . intelligence agencies have stepped up operations after a rise in the . number of Europeans, notably from Britain, France and Ireland, joining . fighters. Security . bodies are tracking Brits and Belgians while the Netherlands has raised . its terror threat to ‘substantial’ in part because of fears about . citizens being radicalised in Syria. Mr Hague said: 'The conflict is precipitating a growth of extremism in Syria which poses current and future risks to UK national security. 'As the conflict has progressed, violent Islamist groups have been gaining ground in Syria and have attracted a large number of foreign fighters of all nationalities, including a substantial number of UK citizens. 'The overall number of foreign fighters travelling to Syria is greater than for all other areas of jihad combined. There is enough uncontested space in Syria for some violent Islamist groups to provide extensive training. 'This is particularly concerning as we assess some of the individuals being trained will seek to carry out attacks against Western interests in the region or in Western states now or in the future,"" he said in a letter to the foreign affairs committee. He had challenged by MPs on the committee to justify a decision to push for the further easing or lifting of an EU arms embargo. Britain and France are spearheading the move - which would allow the arming of rebel groups - but face opposition from partners concerned weapons could fall into the hands of jihadists. Richard Ottaway, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, told Mr Hague in a letter last month that it was concerned the UK was 'out of step' with almost all European partners on the issue. Europeans fighting with Syrian rebels are being radicalised by groups with links al-Qaeda, security chiefs have warned . European Union’s . security chief Gilles de Kerchove also warned the fighters . to bring down President Assad, including many Britons, will be . ‘radicalised’ before returning home where they will pose a ‘serious . threat’ to national security. It is feared some will become members of groups with links to al-Qaeda before launching terror attacks at home. Mr de Kerchove, the EU’s counter-terrorism coordinator, said: ‘We are concerned, of course.’ He said most of the Europeans agreeing to fight with the rebels were being converted by radicals in Syria. ‘Not . all of them are radical one day when they leave but most likely many of . them will be radicalised there, they will be trained,’ he told the BBC. ‘And as we have seen in previous situations this might create a serious threat when they get back.’ Brits, French and Irish fighters are said to be among hundreds of Europeans in Syria. Rebels are pictured attending a training session in Maaret Ikhwan, near Idlib, Syria . Syrian President Bashar Assad has waged a bloody war against rebels seeking to depose him . The UK has already sent non-lethal equipment to rebels in Syria, including body armour and four-by-four vehicles, and there has been pressure from both the British and the French to lift an EU arms embargo against the country. Foreign Secretary William Hague believes the few weeks are a crucial period in deciding what further action the international community can take. Any shipment of weapons would have to be . ‘very carefully controlled’, Mr Hague said amid fears that arms could . fall in to the hands of jihadists operating in the country. EU Counter terrorism coordinator Gilles de Kerchove issued his warning as Foreign Secretary William Hague said the next few weeks would be crucial in the EU's plans to step up support for rebels . The Foreign Secretary told MPs: ‘The next few weeks are a very crucial period in this matter because we need to decide with our European Union partners, and indeed the United States, what are the next steps we can realistically take and should take in order to... strengthen the opposition on the ground and increase the incentives for a political settlement in Syria. ‘We have taken no decision about that but if we do so, I will come to the House of Commons and describe that decision.’ His comments followed a question in the Commons from Liberal Democrat former Leader Sir Menzies Campbell, who said ministers needed to state their position on Syria more clearly. The language being used by ministers was ‘equivocal and delphic’, he said, adding the Government should seek the ‘express endorsement’ of MPs if there was ‘any material change in policy’.","Foreign Secretary says violent Islamist groups are attracting fighters .

"Cllr. Danny Healy-Rae proposed that rural drinkers should be allowed to drive after 'two or three drinks' A motion to allow rural drink-driving has been approved by an Irish council after a pub-owning politician said it would help prevent depression and suicide. Councillors in County Kerry backed the creation of a permit that will allow drinkers in rural areas to drive after having 'two or three drinks'. Pub owner and Independent councillor Danny Healy-Rae, who put forward the motion, claimed people in rural areas were 'travelling very minor roads … with very little traffic' and 'have never killed anyone.' The motion was passed by Kerry county council, in south-west Ireland, on Monday by five votes to three, with the remainder of the councillors either absent or abstaining. Three of those who voted in favour of Mr Healy-Rae's proposal are also believed to be publicans. The approved motion will now be considered by Minister for Justice Alan Shatter who will then decide whether or not to take the issue up with government. Mr Healy-Rae claimed his proposal would bring back a social outlet for lonely people in rural areas that has been lost after more strict drink-drive laws were introduced. In his proposal outline he wrote: 'To ask the Minister for Justice to introduce legislation to allow Gardaí to issue permits to people living in rural isolated areas to allow them to drive home from their nearest pub after having two or three drinks on little used roads driving at very low speeds - to be issued at the discretion of the local Garda. 'This would greatly benefit people living alone looking at four walls and restore some bit of social activity in local pubs and may also help prevent depression and suicide.' Ireland has a chronic drink driving problem. 18,851 drivers were arrested on suspicion of drink driving in 2007. A total of 18,053 drivers were arrested on suspicion of drink driving in 2008. That’s an average of around 347 drivers arrested each week for drink driving in the Republic of Ireland. Ireland is ranked among the highest alcohol consuming countries in the EU (Health Research Board, 2007) He told the Irish Independent: 'They're travelling in very minor roads, often on tractors, with very little traffic and it's not right they're being treated the same as the rest of the travelling public and they have never killed anyone. 'The only outlet they have then is to take home a bottle of whiskey and they're falling into depression and suicide for some of them is the sad way out,' he added. Road safety chiefs attacked the 'off-the-wall' motion that would serve only to drag the country back to 'a much darker day.' The head of Ireland's Road Safety Authority, Noel Brett, expressed disbelief at the proposal. He said most of the country's deaths and injuries from road accidents were in fact in rural areas. 'There is very strong evidence which makes an irrefutable link between the consumption of alcohol and impairment,' Mr Brett said. 'On that basis it is unthinkable that we would go back to a system that sought to increase our drink-drive limit,' he said. 'We have made substantial progress in Ireland in reducing deaths and injuries on our roads, particularly in rural areas which are hardest hit by road fatalities and injuries. For those that live in County Kerry (pictured), Mr Healy-Rae . said: 'They're travelling on very minor roads, often on tractors, with . very little traffic and it's not right they're being treated the same as rest of the public' 'I think we need to proceed with that and continue with the life-saving policies that we have in place.' Describing the motion as 'off-the-wall', Mr Brett paid tribute to Irish motorists for a sea change in attitudes and behaviour towards drink-driving that had made a significant dent in road deaths over recent years. 'That is what is saving lives and proposals such as this bring us back to a much darker day,' he said. Labour councillor Gillian Wharton-Slattery said she did not want to be associated with the motion. 'Depression causes suicide. It’s not caused by not being able to go to the pub. There’s more things in Kilgarvan than go into your pub,' she told Mr Healy-Rae. Figures show 161 people lost their lives on Irish roads last year, a record low . Independent councillor, Cllr Brendan Cronin (Ind) said Mr Healy-Rae was representing the interests of publicans on the council. Conor Cullen, spokesman for Alcohol Action Ireland, said: 'Those in rural areas who may be suffering from isolation will not benefit from putting their lives and the lives of the other members of their community at risk by drinking and driving. 'We need constructive solutions to help those people, such as greater investment in community resources, and socialising is an important part of this, but alcohol does not have to be.' Mr Cullen added that alcohol will exacerbate, not alleviate, mental health difficulties such as depression or anxiety. The drink drive limit in Ireland was tightened in 2011 and is now in line with European levels. Latest figures show 161 people lost their lives on Irish roads last year, a record low at 25 fewer than 2011 and 51 less than 2010. The new Irish Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) limit is 50 milligrams (mg) for all drivers, and 20mg for specified drivers, defined as learner or newly qualified drivers (for a period of two years after passing their driving test) or professional drivers (of buses, goods vehicles and public service vehicles).","Danny Healy-Rae's motion passed by Kerry County Council by 5 votes to 3 .

"We're all either guilty of it or have a friend who does it: oversharing on social networking sites. And it could be ruining your relationships offline. But while oversharing comes in many guises (the loved-up status updates, the endless baby/cat/food photos, the relentless check-ins), there's one method of keeping ePals abreast of your life that is driving us to all tears quicker than any other: the selfie. It's a method of communication on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter beloved of celebrities including Rihanna, Harry Styles, Cara Delevingne and Peaches Geldof. But sharing too many photographs of your own face or body on Mark Zuckerberg's media channel could be detrimental to your relationships with friends, colleagues and even your family, according to a British study. Bajan singer Rihanna can't get enough of the selfie, but has found herself in hot water after posting self-portraits in risque situations, such as half-naked in bed with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, or smoking suspicious-looking cigarettes . Young English model Cara Delevingne is famous for her selfies, most of which involve her dressing up in wacky fancy dress outfits, pulling silly faces and raising one of her legendarily bushy eyebrows . How the quantity and subject matter of the pictures you upload onto Facebook impacts upon your real-world relationships was researched at the University of Birmingham, the University of the West of England, the University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University, in a project appropriately titled Tagger's Delight. The researchers found that an increased level of sharing photos of the self prompted a decreased level of support - in terms of 'likes' garnered - from friends and colleagues. Peaches Geldof uses Instagram mainly to post photographs of her two babies, Astala and Phaedra, but occasionally she steps in for a slice of the action . One Direction star Harry Styles is always updating his Instagram feed with snaps of himself with bandmates, famous friends and adoring fans . Commenting on the findings that . excessive selfie-sharing may damage relationships, lead author of the . report Dr David Houghton, a lecturer in marketing at Birmingham Business . School, said: 'Our research found that those who frequently post . photographs on Facebook risk damaging real-life relationships. 'This is because people, other than . very close friends and relatives, don't seem to relate well to those who . constantly share photos of themselves. 'It's . worth remembering that the information we post to our 'friends' on . Facebook, actually gets viewed by lots of different categories of . people: partners; friends; family; colleagues and acquaintances; and . each group seems to take a different view of the information shared.' The study, fully entitled Tagger's . Delight? Disclosure And Liking In Facebook, also found that young women . were the most likely to find support in the form of 'likes' on Facebook. Older users and men received less support when they shared online. Young American singer Justin Bieber is the ultimate selfie-taker, and rarely a minute goes by in which we aren't informed what this chap is wearing, eating or doing . Mrs Orlando Bloom, model Miranda Kerr, has the sort of face most of us would probably be selfie-ing all the live-long day, were it ours instead... Supermodel Heidi Klum, pictured right with comedian Amy Poehler, is an ardent selfie-poster, probably because she enjoys having control over the camera and the editing room for a change . We've seen enough celebrity selfies on Instagram to last us well into the next millennium.... and it seems even they are tiring of their grinning mugs. So famous fans of the self-portrait snap have swapped faces for posteriors, and are currently enjoying a bit of a renaissance... in the form of the bottom-selfie. The belfie.

"A Department of Justice official told MailOnline on Thursday that looming protests by state lawmakers and a need to protect Attorney General Eric Holder's image among law enforcement officers caused him to pull out of a planned speech in Oklahoma City. Holder's public schedule shows that he was to 'deliver remarks at the Oklahoma City Police Department’s 130th police academy graduation ceremony.' That address didn't occur, however. Seven Oklahoma legislators were preparing to lead a crowd of hundreds in protests across the street, most calling for Holder's impeachment. 'Look, the attorney general isn't afraid of a few protesters,' the DOJ source said. 'But you have to understand that it's legacy building time around here, and no one wants him to get a reputation as the guy who brought chaos to a police ceremony.' 'He's the nation's top law enforcement officer. What kind of message would that send? And it could have been a PR disaster for the president.' Just couldn't make it: Possible PR disaster: Eric Holder, the US attorney general, canceled a speaking engagement at a police academy graduation ceremony, reportedly over concerns about protesters and his post-career legacy . Location: The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was destroyed by a truck bomb blast in April 1995; Holder's speech -- and the impeachment protests -- were to have taken place across the street . The Justice Department ignored a request for comment through official channels, but the official spoke on condition of anonymity. The Washington Times was first to report on the cancellation, attributing it to a protest planned by state Rep. Paul Wesselhoft, a Republican who believes Holder should be impeached following a 2012 finding of criminal contempt by the U.S. House of Representatives. The House's action, a precedent-setting step against a presidential cabinet member, came after Holder's long-held refusal to comply with a House subpoena for documents related to the Operation Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal. Wesselhoft told MailOnline that Holder 'was definitely avoiding a national embarrassment' by canceling. 'It would have been in all the papers, photos of people holding signs saying ""Impeach Holder,"" can you imagine?"" 'Hundreds' of people would have turned out, Wesselhoft said, but most decided not to come once Holder sent his regrets. 'We had a little over 100 come, and that was after he canceled,' he boasted. 'We had seven lawmakers lined up to speak, all of them calling for his impeachment.' 'Holder has been held in contempt of Congress,' Wesselhoft said in defense of his impeachment demand. Awkward: Holder often speaks in controlled settings, like this Justice Department Diversity and Inclusion speaker series on Wednesday, but seldom presses the flesh in public . 'Congress could do this today. There are a number of articles they could bring for impeachment. Operation Fast and Furious is at the top of the list because there's blood on his hands.' That failed operation put more than 2,000 firearms in the hands of Mexican drug cartel members, in the hope that their movements could be traced. More than 300 Mexican nationals, and at . least one U.S. Border Patrol agent, lost their lives when those firearms . ended up where they were intended to go. Paul Wesselhoft, a GOP state legislator in Oklahoma, had planned protests against Holder for his apparent work to stymie a congressional inquiry into the botched Operation Fast and Furious -- a pattern that has brought cries for impeachment . 'It is true that Mr. Holder will not be in attendance,' Oklahoma City Police Department spokesman Capt. D. Nelson told the Times. 'We are told that it is not due to the planned protests, but no reason was stated.' The attorney general is expected to step down after this year's congressional midterm election, and reportedly plans a flurry of lasting policy changes before his departure. One, announced just days ago in conjunction with the White House, is a change in the criteria used when evaluating clemency applications from nonviolent drug offenders in federal prisons. Wesselhoft also cited that decision, along with a 'porous' U.S. border and 'voter intimidation,' as reasons Holder should be removed from office. Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican who chairs the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is poised to become the latest burr under the AG's saddle as he skips Oklahoma. Issa and 16 other House members, all Republicans, wrote to Holder Thursday to demand cooperation as they probe who the DOJ considered prosecuting conservative tax-exempt groups that were also targeted by the Internal Revenue Service in what has erupted into a major scandal. Last week the center-right group Judicial Watch released documents from inside the IRS indicating that former IRS official Lois Lerner had back-and-forth communications with the Justice Department about the potential for criminal charges to be brought. Tea party groups were the most widely and intensely targeted in that scheme. They rose in prominence during the 2010 congressional midterm election season. Republicans believe Lerner, who headed the IRS office tasked with vetting and monitoring nonprofit groups, conspired to hobble them because of their political beliefs.","US attorney general was to address police academy graduates in Oklahoma City on Thursday .

"North Korea has dismissed South Korea's first female president Park Geun-hye with a sexist remark, attacking the 'venomous swish' of her skirt . North Korea has dismissed South Korea's first female president with a sartorial jibe, attacking the 'venomous swish' of her skirt. President Park Geun-hye, the daughter of late South Korean dictator President Park Chung-hee, took office on February 25. Until now there has been no high-level mention of her from the North since the day before she was elected on December 19. It comes as North Korea's army this week officially cancelled an armistice it signed with the South at the end of Korean War and as tensions look set to bubble over into all out warfare between the two countries. 'This frenzy kicked up by the South Korean warmongers is in no way irrelevant with the venomous swish of skirt made by the one who again occupies' the presidential Blue House, the North said in its statement. But despite that swipe, and a continuing torrent of rhetoric from Pyongyang threatening nuclear war,  President Park Geun-hye has continued to vow to reach out to North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong Un, and to send the country much-needed humanitarian aid. The new South Korean leader is trying to build trust with Pyongyang, after five years of North-South tension, which has seen North Korean nuclear tests, long-range rocket launches and attacks that left dozens of South Koreans dead. Park's predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, infuriated North Korea by linking aid and concessions to what transpired to be nonexistent progress on North Korea's past commitments to abandon its atomic weapons ambitions. In doing so, he reversed past liberal governments' policy of providing huge aid shipments with few strings attached. Like Lee, Park is a member of South Korea's main conservative party, but she has promised to find a middle ground by re-engaging Pyongyang through aid shipments, reconciliation talks and the resumption of some large-scale economic initiatives as progress occurs on the nuclear issue. Park has also talked about the possibility of a summit with Kim Jong Un. Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae, said this week that regardless of the political situation, South Korea intends to eventually send humanitarian aid shipments for infants and other vulnerable people in North Korea.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, second left, watches sturgeons in a pond at the Ryongjong Fish Farm in South Hwanghae, southwestern North Korea. The leader has been seen looking increasingly warlike in recent pictures posing next to tanks and guns . Ryoo said South Korea won't accept North Korea's nuclear development or any provocations and called for a dialogue between the countries to improve strained ties. The Unification Ministry said today that South Korea has not started discussing when to start making shipments, what aid items might be sent and how much it will send. Park's North Korea policy is of keen interest not only on the Korean Peninsula but also among officials in Washington, Beijing and Tokyo. Analysts believe her course will set the initial tone for new North Korea policy in those capitals. It comes after North Korea issued yet another set of apocalyptic threats yesterday. An official newspaper quoted a war veteran vowing to 'rain bullets on the enemy' while leader Kim Jong Un urged his troops to 'cut their windpipes'. The 20-something leader has been seen looking increasingly warlike in recent pictures posing next to tanks and guns, prompting speculation he is trying to project a 'hard man' image to shore up his authority ahead of a possible new offensive. Speech: The dictatorial leader told troops to 'cut the windpipes' of their enemies . War? North Korean officials have cancelled a ceasefire agreement made with the South decades ago . Threat: North Korea's Kim Jong Un, pictured here with his troops, has pledged to attack his rivals . Hard man: Over the past couple of days Kim appears to have projected a tougher image . North Korea's army this week officially cancelled an armistice it signed with the South at the end of Korean War. The move makes it more likely that recent tensions, prompted by new UN sanctions as well as the joint military exercises which started yesterday, could bubble over into all-out warfare. Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of Kim's Workers' Party, quoted an 80-year-old veteran of the Korean War supposedly expressed the national mood. 'I am still keeping a bullet that I failed to fire at a trench in the 1950s because the U.S. imperialists and their stooges signed an armistice agreement,' he apparently said. 'Send me to the trench. Give me a rifle. I want to rain bullets on the enemy to my heart's content.' Firepower: Official media have published a series of threats towards South Korea and the West . Looking at a tank: Kim has made a series of visits to elite military installations in recent days . Crowd: Kim receives a rapturous response from an audience of soldiers at a military base . Kim himself issued a direct threat to the U.S. and South Korea over their long-scheduled drills on the Korean Peninsula. 'As . the saying goes, a guy who is fond of playing with fire is bound to . perish in flames,' he told troops. 'All the enemies quite often playing . with fire in the sensitive hotspot should be thrown into a cauldron once . I issue an order. 'Once . an order is issued you should break the waists of the crazy enemies, . totally cut their windpipes and thus clearly show them what a real war . is like.' The leader's . martial attitude in recent photographs is in stark contrast to the . laid-back image he attempted to project during the recent visit of . former basketball star Dennis Rodman to the pariah nation. Pictures from that visit showed him laughing along with his guest at a sports match and hosting the star at a lavish banquet. Inspection: Kim holds up a guitar at the base on an island near the border with South Korea . After the start of the military . drills yesterday, South Korean officials said their northern . counterparts did not answer two calls on a hotline between the sides, . apparently following through on an earlier vow to cut the communication . channel because of the drills. Pyongyang . has launched a bombast-filled propaganda campaign against the drills, . which involve 10,000 South Korean and about 3,000 American troops, and . last week's UN vote to impose new sanctions over the North's February 12 . nuclear test. Pyongyang . isn't believed to be able to build a warhead small enough to mount on a . long-range missile, and the North's military has repeatedly vowed in . the past to scrap the 1953 armistice. North . Korea wants a formal peace treaty, security guarantees and other . concessions, as well as the removal of 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in . South Korea. South Korean and U.S. officials have been closely monitoring Pyongyang's actions and parsing the torrent of recent rhetoric from the North, which has been more warlike than usual. Change of tune: Just two weeks ago Kim was pictured enjoying himself with ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman . North Korea regularly claims South . Korea-U.S. drills are a preparation for invasion, but Pyongyang has . signaled more worry about the drills that began Monday. The drills follow UN sanctions that the North says are the result of U.S. hostility aimed at toppling its political system. North . Korea has also warned South Korea of a nuclear war on the divided . peninsula and said it was cancelling nonaggression pacts. Under . newly inaugurated President Park Geun-hye, South Korea's defence . ministry, which often brushes off North Korean threats, has looked to . send a message of strength in response to the latest threats. The . ministry warned on Friday that the North's government would 'evaporate . from the face of the Earth' if it ever used a nuclear weapon. The White House also said the U.S. is fully capable of defending itself against a North Korean ballistic attack. North Korea has said the U.S. mainland is within the range of its long-range missiles, and an army general told a Pyongyang rally last week that the military is ready to fire a long-range nuclear-armed missile to turn Washington into a 'sea of fire.' Best of friends: Kim at dinner in Pyongyang with Rodman and his wife Ri Sol Ju, left . While outside scientists are still trying to determine specifics, the North's rocket test in December and third atomic bomb test last month may have pushed the country a step closer to acquiring the ability to hit the U.S. with weapons of mass destruction. Analysts, however, say Pyongyang is still years away from acquiring the smaller, lighter nuclear warheads needed for a credible nuclear missile program. But there are still worries about a smaller conflict. North Korea has a variety of missiles and other weapons capable of striking South Korea. In 2010, North Korea shelled a South Korean island and allegedly torpedoed a South Korean warship, killing a total of 50 South Koreans. Both incidents occurred near the disputed western sea boundary, a recurring flashpoint between the Koreas that has seen three other bloody naval skirmishes since 1999. Kim Jong Un visited two islands just north of the sea boundary last week and ordered troops there to open fire immediately if a single enemy shell is fired on North Korean waters. Kim was also quoted as saying his military is fully ready to fight an 'all-out war' and that he will order a 'just, great advance for national unification' if the enemy makes even a slight provocation, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency.","Jibe is first high level mention of President Park Geun-hye, by North Korea .

"A prominent Japanese politician has raised hackles as Barack Obama visits Tokyo by claiming it's an 'open secret' that he and the first lady are headed for divorce, and that the president has been using Secret Service agents to cover for him as he pursues extramarital affairs. Kazuyuki Hamada, who sits in the upper house of Japan's parliament, earned his PhD a half-mile from the White House at George Washington University, and emerged as a shrill commentator on America's economy and foreign policy. In 2009 he also joined the ranks of the so-called 'birthers,' arguing in a book titled 'Who is Obama?' that the president likely wasn't born in the United States. Scroll down for video . Boys' night out: President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shared expensive sushi on Wednesday in Tokyo, with their wives nowhere to be seen. Mrs. Obama stayed home, angering some outspoken Japanese politicians who saw her China visit in March as a slap . Kazuyuki Hamada (L) is a member of the upper house of Japan's parliament, called the National Diet. He claims the Obamas are headed for divorce over the president's cheating and the first lady's wild travel spending – especially her recent trip to China (R), which some in Japan saw as a slight . Uh-O: President Obama greeted U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy with extra warmth upon his arrival in Tokyo. His four-nation trip comes at a time of rising tensions and mounting distrust . But it's his more recent writing that's capturing the attention of the international press this week. Hamada complained April 5 on his official blog about Obama's decision to visit Tokyo without first lady Michelle Obama in tow. 'His approval numbers are dragging down . near 30 per cent,' Hamada wrote, according to an English translation. BIRTHER: Kazayuki Hamada's 2009 book 'Who is Obama?' sided with so-called 'birthers,' arguing that it was likely the President of the United States was born abroad and was ineligible to hold the White House . 'The . president has been criticized for having no visions or leadership to . solve domestic and diplomatic problems, some even ridiculing him as the . worst president of the postwar era.' 'The biggest reason – of many – for the collapse of his reputation is his failed relationship with his wife,' Hamada claimed . 'It is an open secret that the pair are already negotiating their divorce, and that they are waiting for his term in office to be over, and then they'll separate.' He had stiff words for the impact of the first lady's multimillion-dollar 'goodwill' trips to far-flung places on the taxpayers' dime. The Japanese pol claimed that 'if you ask the president, he will tell you, ""I can't show my face to the voters after how she's spent so much money"".' 'On the other hand,' Hamada added, 'if you get his wife to talk, she'll tell you: ""The president is a pathological philanderer. He uses the Secret Service for this, and has used them to hide evidence that he's a cheater"".' Some of Hamada's claims appear to closely mirror a January report from the National Enquirer. The tabloid reported in January that the Obamas are sleeping in separate bedrooms and have determined that the president will return to Hawaii in January 2017, while Mrs. Obama and their daughters will remain in Washington, D.C. Hamada's official parliamentary biography notes that after earning his Ph.D, he worked for the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, and then for the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. CRS briefs, prepared for members of Congress, often sort out technical details or split economic hairs on issues vital to American national security, defense and economic survival. MailOnline was unable to identify any briefs that bear his name. It's difficult to look at the nearly 50 books Hamada has published, though, without sensing an anti-American streak. Trouble in paradise? The National Enquirer first claimed that the first couple's marriage was on the rocks, a report that Kazuyuki Hamada seems to have absorbed and taken seriously . What trouble? The Obamas seemed to put any public relationship fears to rest with a smooch during Monday's White House Easter Egg Roll -- a photo that may not have made it to Japan . No men allowed: Mrs. Obama took her mother and daughters on a multimillion-dollar China trip last month, turning her absence this month in Japan into an insult in some corners . The 2009 'Who is Obama?' includes the claim that the president 'has . done nothing for the American People,' according to a partial translation of the book's introduction obtained by MailOnline. 'This . is the man who, during the [2008] campaign, took massive amounts of . money from Wall Street,' he wrote, 'and has now proceeded to throw around the . American people's tax dollars – a man with nothing more than a promise . on his lips.' Hamada's . other works include a 2002 volume titled 'The Dark Corridor: An . American underground conspiracy of the military-industrial complex.' In 2006 he wrote 'The Next World Order: The Rise and Development of America.' The low-budget paperback's cover, . reminiscent of campaign literature from the anti-Federal Reserve former . GOP congressman Ron Paul, featured a smirking Obama and a gold coin. Howard LaFranchi, a staff writer with the Christian Science Monitor, first hinted at Hamada's anti-Obama rant on Wednesday. In most corners, he wrote, Mrs. Obama’s absence from Tokyo 'is a woeful sign of Japan’s retreat from the top tier of America’s allies.' One Obama, no waiting: The U.S. first lady didn't make the trip to Tokyo, leaving an adoring throng with only her husband to gawk at . Many, LaFranchi noted, are speculating 'that Obama is suggesting his lack of connection with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by coming stag, or that Michelle is hinting at her disapproval of this or that Japanese policy or reality (perhaps whaling? or maybe the relative subjugation of Japanese women?) by staying home.' But if the first lady tags along when President Obama visits China next year, Hamada and other prominent Japanese national figures will likely crank up the anti-Obama press mill again. Keith Koffler, a veteran White House correspondent, noted on his White House Dossier blog that the first lady has the perfect political excuse for avoiding the long trip to Japan: a Democratic National Committee fundraiser on Thursday. The last American first lady to stay home while her husband made a state visit to Japan was Betty Ford in November 1974. That trip, just months after President Richard Nixon's resignation, marked the first time a sitting U.S. president traveled there. The White House did not respond to a request for comment, despite MailOnline calling it a 'softball' question.","Kazuyuki Hamada, a member of the upper house of Japan's parliament, is miffed that Michelle Obama is staying home as her husband tours Japan .

"Amazon has launched its own currency called Amazon Coins. It's currently only available in the . States for Kindle Fire owners, but the Coins can be used to pay for . games, apps and in-app purchases from the Amazon Appstore. One Amazon Coin is worth one US penny, and Kindle Fire owners are getting 500 Coins ($5) for free as part of the launch. Amazon has launched its own virtual currency called Coins in the US. It is  only available for Kindle Fire users, for the time being, but can be used to buy games, apps and in-app purchases from the Kindle Appstore, as well as buy items from Amazon's retail store . Microsoft Points are the currency of the Xbox Live Marketplace, Games for Windows Marketplace, Windows Live Gallery, Xbox Music and Video online stores. Points can be used to buy content from the respective stores. They can be bought using a credit card and the credit card can then be removed. This means parents can buy their children Points to spend on games and upgrades, and control how much they spend without adding a credit card to the account. However, in October 2012, Windows 8 began support local currency in the Xbox Video Store instead of relying on Microsoft Points. This suggests that Microsoft may move away from its virtual currency, in the same way Facebook did with its Credits scheme last year. The Coins will also be able to be used on the company's retail site when they become more widely available. Amazon has not yet confirmed when the scheme will be launched outside of the US, or if it will be available to non-Kindle users. Amazon Coins can be bought in batches of 1000, 2500, 5000 and 10,000. The more you buy, the bigger the discount and 10,000 Coins costs $90, for example. Customers will also get a 10% discount on items bought using Amazon Coins. Amazon isn't the first company to introduce it's own currency; Microsoft Xbox and Windows Live customers can use Microsoft Points to pay for games, upgrades, bonus levels and so on. Amazon Coins are only currently available in the US. The company has not yet confirmed when the scheme will come to the UK. All Kindle Fire users in America have been given 500 Coins worth $5 for free, to spend in the Kindle Appstore . Nintendo similarly has Nintendo Points that can be used in the Wii Shop Channel. Facebook . launched Facebook Credits in 2009, which could be used for apps and . games on the social network site, but scrapped the scheme last year in favour of local currency. Amazon . has said it has launched its Coins program as a way for developers to . make more money by making it easier for shoppers to buy apps and games. It hopes Coins will make it easier for customers to pay for items because they can buy and store Coins in their Amazon Appstore accounts to use as and when. It can also be a way for parents to control how much children spend, negating the need to have a credit card attached to the account. Amazon already accepts card payments and gift cards for Kindle purchases and has said that these payment options will remain. Amazon developers had until April 25 to submit their app if they wanted it to run on the new Coins currency. Developers will continue to get 70% revenue share for any apps or in-app purchases bought using Coins.","One Amazon Coin is worth one US penny .

"Two teenage asylum seekers from Guatemala have escaped a detention center in Illinois and carjacked a 91-year-old Navy veteran. The incident has prompted the federal government to order a security review at all 139 shelters across the country that house illegal immigrant minors, MailOnline can exclusively reveal. The boys, age 16 and 17, were able to walk away unchallenged from Heartland Alliance in Des Plaines, Illinois, outside Chicago, on Wednesday morning and carjack two victims before they were arrested more than 225 miles away outside Iowa City, Iowa, according to authorities. Police say they targeted an elderly man in Moline, Illinois, who was picking up his prescription at Walmart. They threatened him with violence, forced him out of his car and then sped off with his Buick LeSabre. A 225-mile escape plan: Police say the escaped teens, age 16 and 17, were headed for California, where one of them has family . Police tell MaiIOnline they were headed for California, where one of the teens has family. The teens had been transferred to the Illinois facility after crossing the US-Mexico border as unaccompanied minors and requesting asylum in the United States. More than 60,000 unaccompanied minors from Central America have poured across the US-Mexico border in recent months and claimed asylum, saying they were fleeing the drug cartel violence in their impoverished home countries. At least 60,000 unaccompanied minors flooded across the border this summer and claimed asylum status. More than 2,400 are still housed in federal facilities across the country (stock photo) The federal government is spending $868million this year to house and resettle them. Currently, there are more than 2,400 children being held at 139 facilities across the country while they await placement with family or sponsors in the US, according to Kenneth J. Wolfe, a spokesman for the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the programs. When federal officials began looking for places to house the tens of thousands of minors, governors and local politicians around the country said no, fearing an uptick in crime over rumors that some of the refugees has ties to Central American gangs. Illinois welcomed the minors with open arms, with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel saying he wanted 1,000 more kids brought to his city. Federal law says minors cannot be deported without a refugee hearing, but the backlog in immigration courts can be months. Nearly all of the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors have been released to family members or sponsors in the US. Those who couldn't be placed with families remain in facilities contracted by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. Mr Wolfe, the HHS spokesman, told MailOnline that the escape has prompted the Office of Refugee Resettlement to take 'immediate steps to ensure that all (refugee resettlement) programs continue to provide a safe and secure environment.' The minors who claim asylum in the US are mostly from poor Central American nations that are rife with gang violence . Huge increase: The federal government's Unaccompanied Minors program has handled more than twice as many cases as last year and ten times as many as 2003 to 2011 . The government program has also ordered all shelters to conduct a 'a security assessment to ensure that they have appropriate physical requirements to meet the behavioral and therapeutic requirements for children placed in their locations, reporting findings to ORR and taking any necessary steps to ensure all policies and requirements are followed.' The Heartland Alliance , a shelter for mentally-ill and at-risk youth, received unaccompanied minors who have mental health issues or are a security risk, Mr Wolfe said. Police say the teens escaped about 6am and committed a carjacking of a victim nearby about 40 minutes later. During the carjacking, the teen threatened the victim with violence, Des Plaines police Commander Randy Akin told MailOnline. They drove 165 miles southwest to Moline, Illinois, where they targeted the 91-year-old man at a Walmart about noon. 'They obviously chose him to take his vehicle. He walked with a cane. They watched him go in and get his medication from the VA,' Moline police Detective Scott Williams said. The teens threatened the man and made him give them his keys. 'He was pretty rattled. He’s 91. But they didn't psychically assault him,' Det Williams said. The teens then sped off and hit a parked car on their way out of the parking lot. They headed west on Interstate 80 into Iowa. They made it 80 miles, past Iowa City, when they were finally caught. Iowa State Patrol Lieutenant Randy Jones told MailOnline he had received reports of both carjackings and figured the teens were likely to head straight west on I-80, so he waited and watched passing cars. When he spotted the teens in the LeSabre, he called for a roadblock to be set up ahead of them. Troopers used spike strips to shred the teens' tires and then pulled over - they surrendered without incident. The teens did not speak, and only indicated that they spoke little English, Lt Jones said. They are currently in a jail in Iowa City awaiting extradition back to Illinois to face criminal charges.","Two Guatemalan asylum seekers, age 16 and 17, escaped a detention facility in Des Plaines, Illinois, and committed a carjacking .

"Deep in the flat and featureless landscape of eastern Ukraine, it is all too ­possible that the outline of World War III is taking shape. Whipped up by the Kremlin ­propaganda machine and led by Russian ­military intelligence, armed men are erecting road blocks, storming police stations and ripping down the country’s flag. They are demolishing not just their own country — bankrupt, ill-run and beleaguered — but also the post-war order that has kept most of Europe and us, here in Britain, safe and free for decades.Vladimir Putin is striking at the heart of the West. Scroll down for video . A Ukrainian military convoy traveling towards the eastern Ukrainian town of Slovyansk where Russian nationalists have seized the regional administration building . His target is our inability to work with allies in defence against common threats. The profoundly depressing fact is that the events of the past few months, as Russia has annexed the Crimea and ­suppressed opposition in Ukraine, have shown the West to be divided, humiliated and powerless in the face of these land grabs. We are soon to face a bleak choice. We can chose to surrender any responsibility we have to protect Ukraine and the Baltic states — almost certainly Putin’s next target — from further Russian incursion. Or we can mount a last-ditch attempt to deter Russia from furthering its imperial ambitions. If we do choose to resist Putin, we will risk a terrifying military escalation, which I do not think it an exaggeration to say could bring us to the brink of nuclear war. Putin knows that. And he believes we will choose surrender. For the real story of recent events in Ukraine is not about whether that country has a free-trade deal with Brussels or gets its gas from Moscow. It is about brute power. It is about whether Putin’s Russia — a rogue state on Europe’s doorstep — can hold its neighbours to ­ransom, and whether we have the will to resist him. So far the answer to the first question is yes. And to the second a bleak no. The Russian leader believes the collapse of the Soviet Union was a ‘geopolitical catastrophe’. He believes Russia was stripped of its empire by the West’s chicanery. And quite simply, he wants it back. When the Soviet Union was ­dissolved in 1991, the former captive nations of Eastern Europe scrambled into Nato and the protection it offered as fast as they could. As the tension escalates a Ukranian air force Su-27 fighter patrols an area 100 miles from the Russian border in estern Urkraine . But the bitter truth is that Russia did not reform its ambitions in 1991. The Kremlin has always retained its imperialist outlook. While modern Germany has ­forsworn militarism and empire, and is liked and admired even by countries such as Poland, which suffered horribly at Hitler’s hands, Russia has not.Putin believes its historic destiny gives Russia the right to seize land, intimidate and blockade its neighbours. The Russian leader sees Ukraine not as a real country, just a territory, and one he is determined to dominate. First he took ­Crimea. Now he has launched an operation in the east and south of Ukraine.Russian troops are prowling the border as the Ukrainian authorities launch a desperate attempt to regain control of government buildings and police stations in key ­cities that have been seized and occupied in recent days. As the situation continues to deteriorate, Ukranian soldiers stand guard beside a military helicopter to prevent pro-Russian activists from seizing the aircraft . Only yesterday it was reported that between four and 11 people had been killed as Ukrainian troops re-took Kramatorsk ­airfield from pro-Russian forces. Putin has presented the Ukrainian leaders with an impossible choice. Either they consent to the dismemberment of their country. Or they fight a war they cannot win. Ukraine’s ill-trained, ill-equipped and ill-led soldiers are quite unsuited to deal with the fraught challenge facing them. Any bloodshed against a single Russian soldier will give Putin a pretext to use his military might.For her part, Russia has played a brutally clever game. She has ­deliberately sought to humiliate and destabilise Ukraine. Now Putin can claim his soldiers must be allowed to intervene because the very social disorder his  outriders have engineered demonstrates that the authorities cannot maintain order. A Ukrainian soldier aims his machine gun at pro-Russian protesters outside a Ukrainian airbase in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine . The hypocrisy is breath-taking. But the Ukraine adventure is ­stoking a patriotic frenzy at home which ­distracts the public from his regime’s incompetence and thievery. But the biggest benefit to the ­Russian president lies abroad. He makes no secret of his hatred for the West. He is contemptuous of, yet fears, our soft power. He resents the laws, liberty and prosperity that our citizens enjoy. They throw into bleak contrast the dismal life that his own ­corrupt and incompetent rule offers Russians. He also despises our weakness. He sees a Europe and America that talk tough but have failed to ­provide a united response to the growing catastrophe. Yes, we talk a good game — Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for ‘a clear and united international response’ — but our deeds do not match our words, and Putin knows it. In his bleak world view, only force and money count. He believes we in the West are too weak to defend ourselves when threatened. So far, his assessment looks right. Even Nato — the bulwark of our security since 1949 — is creaking under the strain of the Ukraine crisis. Nato’s gutsy commander, General Philip Breedlove, wants to share international intelligence with Ukraine and boost Nato’s forces in its most vulnerable member countries: Poland and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But the White House has blocked the first recommendation. And European countries such as ­Germany are blocking the second. Meanwhile, pro-Russian protesters attempt to barricade the same airbase in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine . Vainly, our leaders hope diplomacy will make Putin back down. Surely he can be made to understand that confrontation is not in Russia’s interests? The markets are already punishing the rouble and big ­Russian companies. But that approach fundamentally misunderstands a man like Putin. He is prepared to make his people suffer economic pain and risk war for what be believes is their national interest. We in the West are not. Having taken Ukraine, he will turn his attention to the Baltic states. Members of the EU and Nato, their lawful societies, elections and ­thriving economies are an implicit rebuke to those who preside over sleaze and brutality in Russia. Now Putin sees a chance to humiliate them — and the West. He does not need to invade, just to provoke. Using social division and agitation he will raise the pressure — whether economic or political — on one or more of the Baltic states until it becomes unbearable. Nato and the EU — on current form — will merely appeal for ­dialogue and threaten sanctions. ­But nothing will happen. Which means the Baltics will buckle, and Putin will take back lands which he believes are rightly Russia’s. That will be the end of Nato — and the dawn of a terrifying new world in which international rules count for nothing and the strong dominate the weak. Russia — ruthless and greedy — can play divide and rule for decades to come. Suppose we do try to resist, with our shrunken armed forces and craven allies? With the latest round of cuts, the British Army is about to become the smallest it’s been since the Napoleonic wars. A Ukrainian army MI-24 helicopter gunship patrols an area around Slaviansk while Ukrainian authorities plan a clampdown on pro-Moscow activists . Meanwhile, our once ‘special ­relationship’ with America was tested by our ­failure to support Obama over intervention in Syria. What’s worse, the West’s ­intelligence operations have been severely ­compromised by the exploits of Edward Snowden, the former U.S. intelligence contractor who has taken refuge in Moscow, having stolen tens of  thousands of secret state documents. Deplorably, the complacent and self-indulgent journalists who so damagingly published the West’s intelligence secrets and effectively blinded our spies have been awarded America’s greatest journalistic honour, the Pulitzer Prize. If the West does stand up to ­Russia, Putin will put its nuclear forces on alert, all the while decrying our ‘aggressive behaviour’. As the centenary of the Great War in July approaches, historians are vying to pinpoint the chain of events which started that conflict. I may be wrong, but in 100 years time, will their successors look back at the events in Ukraine to make sense of the beginnings of the next world conflagration?

"One advantage of the Paris Motor Show clashing with the city's fashion week is that you just can't move for supermodels — both on and off the automotive catwalk. Claudia Schiffer over here one minute, Britain's Rosie Huntington-Whiteley over there the next. And then there are the cars. Although Paris chic was all across the metropolis, the Brits did their best to upstage their Gallic hosts by sticking the British boot in — Wellingtons of course. Scroll down for video . Give it welly: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley with the new Discovery and giant Union Jack footwear . Jaguar Land Rover strove to upstage Schiffer, who was on an adjacent stage as it struck up the band — a military band including soldiers in red tunics and bearskins — to unveil its new XE sports saloon and Land Rover Discovery Sport, for which it has received 1,200 orders in just three weeks. Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Dr Ralf Speth said: 'These two cars are at the very heart of Britain's manufacturing renaissance.' Huntington-Whiteley led the charge by swapping the catwalk for the new Discovery Sport's launch on the Seine. The 27-year-old actress and former Victoria's Secret lingerie model boarded a giant 250ft barge, transformed into floating off-road assault course adorned with seven pairs of oversized Wellington boots — one of them a 15ft-high pair decorated in the red white and blue Union Flag. Two of the new vehicles then drove around the course as the barge sailed up and down past many of the capital's most famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame cathedral — under the very put-out noses of haughty Parisians. A spokesman said: 'The boots, a reference to both the Discovery's versatile seating layout and Land Rover's unique take on outdoor life, brought a sense of quintessential British heritage and humour to the Rive Gauche.' Claudia Schiffer scored highly in the fashion stakes when she unveiled the new Vauxhall Corsa. 'It's chic, just like Paris,' she said of the hot hatchback . The seven pairs of giant wellies, made by British firm Barbour and becoming something of a fashion statement in Paris, were designed to highlight the Disco's seating versatility — two people at the front, three in the middle and two more in the optional folddown seats at the back. Costing from £32,395 to £42,995, the new car replaces the Freelander and means an investment, production and jobs boost for the firm's Halewood factory on Merseyside. It goes on UK sale on January 22 alongside the existing the larger seven-seater, full-size Discovery. The launch model will deploy an efficient, yet powerful, SD4 fourcylinder diesel engine, four-wheel drive, with either advanced ninespeed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. An eD4 turbodiesel version is to be introduced later in 2015 from under £30,000 and with frugal CO2 estimated at around 119g/km. Bentley launched its new £252,200 Mulsanne Speed with a top speed of 190mph and acceleration from rest to 60mph of 4.8 seconds. The Land Rover Discovery Sport has also received 1,200 orders in three weeks . The Crewe-based luxury car maker, owned by Germany's giant Volkswagen group, has recorded its best-ever half-year sales of 5,252, a rise of 23 per cent. It is to launch a new SUV in 2016, creating 400 new jobs. Brace yourself for bargains. European makers are slashing prices and offering great deals to UK consumers because Britain is the only country showing good sales growth. 'It's all about growth. Everyone wants a piece of the action. The last quarter has been particularly competitive,' said one executive. Claudia Schiffer scored highly in the fashion stakes when she unveiled the new Vauxhall Corsa. 'It's chic, just like Paris,' she said of the hot hatchback in what, quite frankly, a rather cheesy and stilted bit of Eurovision-style scripting. But the Corsa is a significant car for Britain. It was the second biggest-selling car after the Fiesta at 83,000 last year — it's actually the biggest seller in Scotland. But Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Jaguar Land Rover led the British charge of luxury cars at the prestigious motor show as booming export sales propelled them towards new record highs. Luxury car brand Infiniti produced a bit of a head-turner. Its eye-catching Q80 Inspiration prototype is a four-door 'fastback' with four individual leather seats, while a plunging panoramic glass roof creates a light, airy environment inside. Rolls-Royce is on a roll,' said the firm's chief executive Torsten Mueller-Otvos, as he revealed that the luxury firm, based at Goodwood in Sussex, is on target to break through 4,000 annual sales for the first time. No doubt it'll be helped by a raunchy black-andwhite, art-house style video involving a suspenderclad Kylie getting changed in the back of a Roller which was shown at a private view at the show, after appearing at some of her concerts. Apparently it's called 'Skirt', though I struggled to see much evidence of one.","Land Rover Discovery Sport has also received 1,200 orders in three weeks .

"Grim toll: Thousands will die because of the cold this winter - while millions say they fret over heating bills . More than three million older people are worried about staying warm indoors this winter – with six million anxious about rising fuel bills, says Age UK. The charity said its research shows many are unaware of the potentially fatal consequences of living in poorly heated housing. Cold temperatures endanger the elderly by increasing the risk of flu, chest infections and other respiratory problems, and their severity. Being cold also pushes up blood pressure which may trigger heart attacks and strokes. Almost one in four people (22 per cent) taking part in the research did not know that a number of serious health problems are made worse or brought on by the cold. This rose to 29 per cent amongst people aged 80 and over. Fewer than one in 10 Britons aged 65 and over are aware that strokes can be brought on by the cold in winter, with only 14 per cent recognising that the cold can impact on heart attacks. The survey marks the launch of Age UK’s Spread The Warmth winter campaign, which is aimed at cutting the 24,000 excess winter deaths that occur nationally each winter. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director of Age UK, said ‘It’s vital for older people to keep warm, both inside and outside their homes in the winter months. ‘Being cold, even for just a short amount of time can be very dangerous as it increases the risk of associated health problems and preventable deaths during the winter.’ ‘Through our Spread the Warmth campaign, we are calling on everyone to recognise the importance of staying warm and well this winter and to think about older friends, neighbours and relatives as the temperature drops.’ Living room temperatures should ideally be kept at 70F (21C) and above whereas bedroom temperatures should be kept at a minimum of 64F (18C), according to international guidelines (from WHO). Dot Gibson, NPC general secretary, described price rises from energy companies as 'eye-watering' But the survey of 1,100 Britons aged 65 and over found four out of five did not know the ideal living room and bedroom temperatures. Among their major concerns this winter were staying warm at home cited by 28 per cent of respondents  – equivalent to three million older people nationwide – and the soaring cost of energy bills, selected by 55 per cent. Official advice issued last week told elderly people unable to afford fuel bills to heat only their living rooms during daytime this winter. Cold temperatures endanger the elderly by increasing the risk of flu, chest infections and other respiratory problems . Public Health England also suggests they keep the heating in their bedroom off until just before going to bed. Britain’s biggest pensioners’ organisation, the National Pensioners Convention (NPC) has launched an online poster campaign urging its 1.5m members to email energy secretary Ed Davey over the number of older people that die every year of cold-related illnesses. Dot Gibson, NPC general secretary said ‘Every year over 25,000 older people die in this country from cold-related illnesses and the best the government can do is to tell people to put a jumper on. ‘Most of the big six energy companies have now announced eye-watering increases in their charges and rather than tackle the scandal of fuel poverty, the government has instead redefined what it is, so as to cut down on the official number of those who cannot afford to keep warm. ‘Ministers have got to get a grip on the problem and start addressing the need for higher winter fuel payments, widespread insulation programmes and the introduction of a block on the right of energy companies to simply put up bills without any regard to the economic climate in which they operate. ‘It is a national scandal that ever year thousands of older people die from the cold. This has got to stop.’ Luciana Berger MP, Shadow Minister for Public Health, said ‘Many older and vulnerable people all across the UK face a choice between heating and eating this winter, and it shows how out of touch David Cameron is that the only solution he offers is advice on what room to heat. ‘That’s why we desperately need a Labour government which will freeze energy bills to save money for 27 million households and 2.4 million businesses and reset the market to deliver fairer prices in the future.’","Charity warns of death toll as heating bills soar .

"It is the 'holy grail' of Chinese porcelain, a 500-year-old antiquity owned by emperors - and now the world's most expensive cup of tea. An eccentric Chinese art collector has been photographed enjoying a cup of tea from a rare 15th-century antique he purchased at auction for £21million. The 'chicken cup', named after its hen and cockerel decorations, was created during the Ming Dynasty reign of Emperor Qianlong and was bought by billionaire Liu Yiqian in April. Tea for me! This extremely rare 500-year-old cup Liu Yiqian is pictured drinking from is one of only 17 left in the world. He paid a staggering £21m for the cup which has chickens and cockerels on it . While most would expect an antique of such prominence to go directly into storage or on display, Mr Liu decided he would put his chicken cup to a more immediate, and practical, use. He told the Wall Street Journal: 'A Sotheby's staffer poured me some tea. I saw the [chicken cup] and excitedly poured some of that tea into the cup and drank a little. 'Emperor Qianlong has used it, now I've used it. I just wanted to see how it felt.' The prized object measures just 3.1 . inches in diameter and is widely considered the 'holy grail' of Chinese . porcelain with only 17 remaining in the world - four of which are in . private hands. The cup was made during the reign of the Chenghua Emperor, who ruled from 1464 to 1487. 'There's no more legendary object in the history of Chinese porcelain. This is really the holy grail when it comes to Chinese art,' said Nicholas Chow, Sotheby's deputy chairman for Asia. The 500-year-old cup was sold at Sotheby's Hong Kong auction in April to Mr Liu for about £21million . Wealthy: He is called 'the eccentric Mr Liu' by his employees for his habit of wearing T-shirts in the office . Attention: Nicholas Chow, Sotheby's deputy chairman for Asia, said: 'There's no more legendary object in the history of Chinese porcelain... This is really the holy grail when it comes to Chinese art' Mr Liu made his fortune on the stock market during communist China's increasing shift towards capitalism in the 1980s and 90s, investing much of that money in art. He's one of China's 152 billionaires and is dubbed 'the eccentric Mr Liu' by his employees for his habit of wearing T-shirts in the office, he is thought to be China's 200th richest person. However, Mr Liu's stunt has angered some, who claim he is not treating the antique with the proper respect and simply using it as a rich vanity project. His employees have dubbed him 'the eccentric Mr Liu' and he is known for wearing t-shirts to work and growing beards. Liu Yiqian is not only one of the richest people in China, but he is part of a golden generation who made their fortune during China's gradual shift towards capitalism in the 1980s and 90s. Born into a working class family in Shanghai, the 51-year-old's break came in his 20s when he first invested in the stock market - a shrewd move which grew into a two million yuan windfall that catapulted him into the billionaire he is today. As an older man he and his wife Wang Wei have poured their wealth into rare and expensive Chinese artwork. They now own two exhibition spaces in Shanghai, known as The Long Museum, which house their collections alongside other exhibitions and researchers. Their collection is vast and expensive. While Mr Liu's new £21m 'chicken' cup made headlines, it is just the latest acquisition in a long history of expensive purchases. For example, in October 2010, Mr Liu paid £6.4m for a Qing Dynasty imperial throne with carved dragons at Sotheby's Hong Kong. Later that year 60 of the couple's Chinese paintings and art works - which dated back to the Song Dynasty 1,000 years ago - were shown at a Chinese Museum. They were reportedly insured for ten billion yuan - nearly £1bn.","Liu Yiqian bought antique porcelain drinking cup at auction for £21million .

"Critical: President Jose Mujica has said the former prisoners appeared 'middle class' and different from the hardworking peasants who helped build Uruguay after he visited them at home . Uruguay's president has accused six former Guantanamo Bay inmates of lacking a work ethic and being 'middle class' for refusing to get jobs since arriving in the South American country three months ago. President Jose Mujica has appeared to criticise the men, who were locked up for more than 12 years in the American detainment camp in Cuba, saying they lacked a work ethic. But the men  are equally disappointed with their new lives - with one telling the press they had simply swapped one prison for another. The men arrived in Montevideo in December, after Mujica said his country would take them in and help them get resettled. The six, who were detained as suspected militants with ties to al-Qaeda in 2002 but were never charged, were cleared for release in 2009. But they were stuck in Guantanamo for the next five years because they could not be sent home - and no one wanted them, until Uruguay stepped into the breach. It offered them a residential facility to study Spanish, learn about Uruguayan culture and integrate to their new home - which has about 300 Muslim residents out of a total population of 3.3million. A labour union was drafted in to help find the men work, but it has since said the men have turned down jobs they have been offered. Local newspapers reported they were supposed to start work this month in the construction industry. Refused: The six men have so far turned down the jobs which have been offered to them. Pictured: Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi from Tunisia, Syrians Ali Husain Shaaban, Abedlhadi Omar Faraj and Ahmed Adnan, and Palestinian Mohammed Abdullah Taha Mattan at their home in Montevideo . Mujica has since taken matters into his own hands, visiting the home of five of the six men to encourage them to take work. But he returned from his visit despondent. On his radio programme he said the former detainees are far from the ancestors of Uruguayans, who he described as gritty, hard-working immigrants. 'If these people were humble people of the desert, poor people, they'd surely be stronger and more primitive, but they're not,' Mujica said of the former prisoners. 'Through their hands, features and family histories, it seems to me that they're middle class.' His comments have not been universally welcomed. Senator Ope Pasquet, of the Colorado Party, defended the men Wednesday, tweeting: 'The Guantanamo six were jailed for more than 10 years in dreadful conditions. 'The psychological damage must be terrible. Making them work now? Premature.' His comments about their state of health appear to be backed up by lawyers working for the six men. Cori Crider, of Reprieve UK, told the Buenos Aires Herald last month: 'My client [Abu Wa'el Dhiab] has lost ability to walk after 13 years in Guantánamo. But he is now not just in wheelchair, he is able to walk with crutches.' Unable: Cori Crider, of Reprieve UK, told the Buenos Aires Herald last month her client Abu Wa'el Dhiab lost the ability to walk during his incarceration - but had managed to start using crutches . Cleared: The men were detained in Guantanamo from 2002, but charges were dropped in 2009 . Trapped: But one former inmate has said his new life in Uruguay is simply swapping one prison for another . However, Dhiab - a Syrian who cannot return to his country because of the ongoing violence - has also complained about his new home. He recently said the men have 'walked out of a prison to enter another one'. In a TV interview, Dhiab expressed thanks to Uruguay, but said it needs a plan for helping the ex-detainees, who need 'their families, a home, a job and some sort of income that allows them to build a future'. While at Guantanamo, Dhiab was at the center of a legal battle in U.S. courts over the military's use of force-feeding. When he arrived in Uruguay, he was reportedly weak as a result of repeated hunger strikes. In recent videos, Dhiab appears thin but not overly so. Since January 2002, when the Guantanamo detention center opened, about 620 prisoners have been released or transferred, with the vast majority making no public statements or appearances.","The six men arrived to start new lives in Montevideo last December .

"Once HIV conquers a human cell, it will stay there forever. It inserts its deadly genome permanently into its victims' DNA, forcing them to require medical treatment for the rest of their life. But now, for the first time, researchers in Philadelphia have found a way to completely delete HIV from human cells by ‘snipping’ them out. Scroll down for video . For the first time, researchers in Philadelphia have found a way to completely delete the HIV virus (pictured) from human cells by ‘snipping’ them out. The process could also provide a cure for other latent infections . The team of Temple University School of Medicine said the breakthrough marks the first successful attempt to eliminate latent HIV-1 virus from human cells – and could be a cure for other latent infections. ‘This is one important step on the path toward a permanent cure for AIDS,' said Kamel Khalili, PhD, Professor and Chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Temple. 'It's an exciting discovery, but it's not yet ready to go into the clinic. It's a proof of concept that we're moving in the right direction,' he added, . In a study published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr Khalili and colleagues detail how they created molecular tools to delete the HIV-1 proviral DNA. Researchers based the two-part HIV-1 editor on a system that evolved as a bacterial defence mechanism to protect against infection. When deployed, a combination of a DNA-snipping enzyme called a nuclease and a targeting strand of RNA called a guide RNA (gRNA) hunt down the viral genome and remove the HIV-1 DNA. Dr Khalili's lab engineered a 20-nucleotide strand of gRNA to target the HIV-1 DNA and paired it with a DNA-sniping enzyme called Cas9 and used to edit the human genome. From there, the cell's gene repair machinery takes over, soldering the loose ends of the genome back together – resulting in virus-free cells. When deployed, a combination of a DNA-snipping enzyme called a nuclease and a targeting strand of RNA called a guide RNA (gRNA) hunt down the viral genome and remove the HIV-1 DNA. From there, the cell's gene repair machinery takes over, soldering the loose ends of the genome back together – resulting in virus-free cells. 'Since HIV-1 is never cleared by the immune system, removal of the virus is required in order to cure the disease,' explained Dr Khalili. These molecular tools also hold promise as a therapeutic vaccine; cells armed with the nuclease-RNA combination proved impervious to HIV infection. Worldwide, more than 33 million people have HIV, including more than 1 million in the United States. Every year, another 50,000 Americans contract the virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the UK, around 100,000 people were living with HIV in the UK in 2013. That’s around one person in 665. Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (Haart) has controlled HIV-1 for infected people in the developed world over the last 15 years, the virus can rage again with any interruption in treatment. Worldwide, more than 33 million people have HIV, including more than 1 million in the United States. ‘This is one important step on the path toward a permanent cure for AIDS,' said Kamel Khalili, PhD, Professor and Chair of the Department of Neuroscience at Temple . 'The low level replication of HIV-1 makes patients more likely to suffer from diseases usually associated with ageing,' Dr Khalili said. These include cardiomyopathy – a weakening of the heart muscle – bone disease, kidney disease, and neurocognitive disorders. 'These problems are often exacerbated by the toxic drugs that must be taken to control the virus,' Dr Khalili added. Researchers based the two-part HIV-1 editor on a system that evolved as a bacterial defence mechanism to protect against infection. Dr Khalili's lab engineered a 20-nucleotide strand of gRNA to target the HIV-1 DNA and paired it with a DNA-sniping enzyme called Cas9 and used to edit the human genome. 'We are working on a number of strategies so we can take the construct into preclinical studies,' Dr Khalili said. 'We want to eradicate every single copy of HIV-1 from the patient. That will cure AIDS. I think this technology is the way we can do it.'","Scientists used a DNA-snipping enzyme called Cas9 to cut out the virus .

Process could also be a cure for other latent infections, researchers say .
'It's an exciting discovery, but not ready to go into the clinic,' said Dr Khalili ."
