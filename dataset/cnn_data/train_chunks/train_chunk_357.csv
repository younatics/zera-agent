"(CNN) -- A Marine lost at sea after bailing out of a MV-22 Osprey when it appeared it might crash in the Persian Gulf is believed to be the first American military casualty in support of U.S. operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Cpl. Jordan L. Spears, 21, was declared dead after search and rescue efforts to locate him were unsuccessful, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement released Saturday. Asked how Spears death will be classified, Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters the question was still being decided. ""Clearly, that squadron and that ship were in the Gulf, supporting Central Command operations. Some of those operations included operations in Iraq and Syria, at least tangentially, through at least some tangential way, support to those missions,"" Kirby said, according to a transcript. ""So there's no question that -- that this Marine's death is related to the operations that are going on, in some form or fashion."" Even so, he said he did not know whether the Marine's death would be formally classified as such. The branch of service typically determines how a service member's death is classified. The military has not detailed the Osprey's mission at the time of the incident, which remains under investigation. The Osprey, a tilt-rotor aircraft, was deployed as part of the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group ""supporting operations in Iraq and Syria and throughout the region,"" the statement said. Spears, a crew chief, went missing Wednesday when the Osprey lost power shortly after takeoff from the USS Makin Island and dropped toward the water, according to the Navy. Spears and another crew member went into the water when it appeared the Osprey was about to crash, the Navy said. The pilots managed to get control of the Osprey and land it safely, according to the statement. Search and rescue crews found one crew member in the water, but were unable to locate Spears of Memphis, Indiana, it said. ""U.S. forces in the North Persian Gulf suspended a search and rescue operation for Spears Oct. 2, after efforts to locate him were unsuccessful,"" according to the statement. Spears was assigned to Marine Tiltrotor Squadron 163, Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Aircraft Wing with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California.","Marine Cpl.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal won his first European clay title of the season and 27th Masters tournament victory of his career at the Madrid Open after his opponent Kei Nishikori was forced to retire through injury. Nadal had won seven straight games to lead 3-0 in the third set when the match was halted having lost the first set 6-2 and come from a break down to win the second 6-4. Nishikori had struggled with a back spasm in Saturday's dramatic semifinal victory over Nadal's fellow Spaniard, David Ferrer, and the injury returned to haunt him on Sunday. Although disappointed to lose his first Masters final in in such an unfortunate manner, the Japanese can take comfort from his performances this week which will see him break into the world top 10 for the first time when the latest rankings are released Monday. Nishikori out-played Nadal for a set and a half with some aggressive shot making and big winners. After the trainer was called seven games into the second set, however, it was clear that Nishikori's movement was inhibited. Nadal capitalized to break twice and level the match at a set apiece. The third set was an anti-climax by comparison with Nadal easing ahead of his injured opponent before Nishikori decided he couldn't continue. ""I am very disappointed about what happened today in this final,"" said Nishikori after the match. ""Unfortunately, I was hurting already and I tried to fight but Rafa was too good today, so congratulations to him."" As ever, Nadal was gracious in victory. ""I'm very sorry for Nishikori. He's an unbelievable player that will fight to be in London (at the ATP World Tour Finals),"" he said. ""Winning at home is always more special than winning anywhere. Having the chance to play in front of your home crowd... is unforgettable for me,"" he added. Sharapova bounces back . Earlier, Maria Sharapova recovered from a horrendous start to defeat Romania's Simona Halep 1-6, 6-2, 6-3 to claim the women's title. The Russian lost the first four games of the match to the World No. 5 and conceded the first set in less than half-an-hour. Sharapova turned things around as the game progressed and has now won seven of her last nine titles on a clay, a surface once far from her favorite. Speaking on court after the match, the 27-year-old said: ""Last year I lost in the finals and I really wanted to go one extra step this year, and it's just been such a fantastic week. ""Simona and I had played a couple of times before, but she's really on a different level now (having risen from 64th position in the world rankings this time last year). I don't know how I pulled it off.""","Rafael Nadal wins Madrid Open after Kei Nishikori retires in third set .

"(CNN) -- A Swedish man is being investigated by police after apparently trying to put together a nuclear reactor in his apartment, Sweden's nuclear watchdog said Thursday. The man, named in local media reports as 31-year-old Richard Handl, contacted the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority in July to ask whether he was allowed to build a nuclear reactor, the organization's research director Leif Moberj told CNN. That contact led the authorities to swoop down on his home in Angelholm, a coastal town of about 40,000 people known for its long sandy beaches. ""We realized he probably had radioactive material at his home which you are not allowed to have without a permit, which was why the authorities decided to inspect his home,"" Moberj said. Radioactive material was found during an ""extensive"" inspection last month, although testing suggested radiation levels were too low for his neighbors to be worried, Moberj said. The material included ""small amounts"" of Americium-241, a component of smoke detectors which cannot legally be removed from the detector casing, he said. The agency has not yet confirmed what other radioactive materials were found at the property. Handl was quoted by the Helsingborgs Dagblad newspaper as saying he had his own Geiger counter and had not noticed any problems with radiation. He never got the reactor going as he had just bought what was needed, Handl was quoted as saying, and now all his equipment has been taken away. Handl told the newspaper he intended to keep to the ""theoretical level"" in future. Moberj said the situation was ""extremely unusual"" in Sweden. ""I haven't heard of any similar things ever,"" he said. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the man-made radioactive metal americium ""poses a significant risk"" to health if ingested or inhaled. It recommends never dismantling or burning a smoke detector at home.","The man had Americium-241 at his home, the Swedish radiation watchdog says .

"(CNN) -- In March, 9 million viewers tuned in to AMC to watch a farm -- which served as a safe haven to survivors of a zombie apocalypse -- burn to the ground on ""The Walking Dead."" This Sunday, TNT (a Time Warner network, like CNN) commences its second season of ""Falling Skies,"" which sees a group of survivors fight back against alien invaders while their home state of Massachusetts lies in ruins. Switch over to NBC, and you're likely to see promos for ""Revolution,"" a series about what happens 15 years after the loss of all advanced technology and electronics. Post-apocalyptic scenarios are cropping up all over the small screen -- oddly enough, in the year 2012. But is the runaway success of ""The Walking Dead"" the main reason for it, or is there something else going on here? ""There's always a copycat trend in the industry,"" TV critic Ryan McGee said, pointing to last year's ""Pan Am"" and ""Playboy Club,"" both of which drew comparisons to ""Mad Men."" ""There's no way executives aren't looking at the ratings for 'The Walking Dead' and aren't salivating."" At the same time, he says, ""Revolution"" has to forge its own creative path to survive. ""Everyone imitates everything that's successful,"" said fellow critic Alan Sepinwall, who doesn't see it so much as a trend but as a coincidence. ""Or simply that ideas go in cycles."" Indeed, TV has been down this road before, with the short-lived cult favorite ""Jericho"" exploring a scenario of society rebuilding after a nuclear attack. Jamais Cascio, an ethical futurist with a background in television, noted that various aspects of ""The Walking Dead"" are being replicated now: ""The rule of TV production is to figure out what aspect of a surprisingly success show made it a winner. We're seeing other comic book-based stories in development, other supernatural stories and other post-apocalypse stories."" Actress Jessy Schram, whose character, Karen, was last seen having been ""harnessed"" by the aliens on ""Falling Skies,"" actually took a look at ""The Walking Dead"" as a sort of homework assignment. ""It was interesting to watch and take notes, and compare the similarities and differences,"" she said, ""to compare it to 'Falling Skies' to see what a world taken over by another species would be like."" Schram, also known for her recurring role as Cinderella on ""Once Upon a Time,"" has another upcoming series, ABC's ""Last Resort,"" with something of a twist on the same themes: The crew of a submarine disobeys orders to avoid nuclear war and ends up retreating to an island. ""They're having to start over and form their own living and way of protecting themselves,"" she explained. ""Even though it's very different (from 'Falling Skies'), it has that same theme of 'who do I trust?' "" She said she and other actors on ""Falling Skies"" asked themselves what they would do in a post-apocalyptic scenario like this. ""What tools would I have to work with? If I don't have transportation or a gun or a knife or even a steak dinner, what am I actually feeling? There's a lot of desperation in that situation, but there can also be a lot of joy as well."" 'Falling Skies' cast and crew interviews . ""Revolution's"" creator, Eric Kripke (""Supernatural""), hopes to explore that joy or at least have more fun with it. ""The apocalypse kind of bums me out,"" he admitted in a meeting with J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions when the series was being developed. Kripke wanted to do a show based around the elements of Joseph Campbell's ""hero's journey,"" which were perhaps best exemplified in ""Star Wars."" The Abrams team was looking at a series that began with the cataclysmic scenario of that loss of electricity and technology. Instead of dealing with the immediate consequences of that event, ""Revolution"" flashes forward 15 years later. ""That is an interesting world,"" Kripke said. ""It transforms into a kingdom with good warriors and bad warriors. That's a world that's gone back to swords. It's about people living in a world that nature has reclaimed."" Kripke can see the current mood being reflected in series in a post-apocalyptic vein. ""There's something in the collective zeitgeist that people feel we're headed towards a cliff,"" he said. ""The population is massive, we're separated from our food supply, we're eventually going to run out of oil, and there's international tensions. People feel like we're really out of balance and due to be knocked down a peg by war or disease or something."" Kripke wanted to explore the story on the ""other end"" of that. ""We're not interested in nihilism or hopelessness. We'll all survive and be OK if we remember the things that bring us together: family, brotherhood and mercy."" Ultimately, though, as McGee points out, ""What 'Revolution' needs is what every show needs: five characters people care about. Why the lights went out turns into a bit of boring trivia without that emotional investment."" The rules of great TV are the same, even when the world seems to be coming to an end.","Life after apocalypse portrayed on multiple current television series .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Swooping in at 4 o'clock in the morning, Spanish police arrested six Spanish men on suspicion of recruiting and sending 26 radical Islamic fighters for terrorist groups in Syria, Mali and Libya, the Interior Ministry said Friday. The arrests came in the Spanish enclave of Melilla, on Morocco's north coast, where a Spaniard and two Frenchmen were arrested just last March on similar charges. The suspected leader in the cell disrupted on Friday had returned to Spain after fighting in Syria and training in a terrorist camp in northern Mali, the Interior Ministry said. The movement of Islamic militants from Europe and North Africa to conflict zones such as Syria, Mali or Libya -- and their eventual return to Spain to potentially carry out terrorist attacks -- has been a prime concern for authorities battling terrorism. The cell disrupted on Friday had recruited and sent at least 24 Moroccans and two Spaniards to conflict zones, according to authorities. But it was planning to expand its activities, to acquire weapons and manuals for preparing explosives, the Interior Ministry said, ""which would have increased their level of danger, turning them into a serious threat to national security."" The latest arrests coincide with the final day of an Interpol conference, held in Granada, Spain, this week, on the problem of terrorist fighters who cross international borders. More than 130 security experts from 33 nations are attending, a separate Interior Ministry statement said. The suspected leader of the cell disrupted on Friday is Benaissa Laghmouchi Baghdadi, 42, who spent about eight months in Syria and recently returned to Spain, via Mali, said an Interior Ministry spokesman, who by custom is not identified. He was among the first Spaniards to be detected as working with terrorist groups in the broad Sahel region in northern Africa. The other five suspects arrested were identified as Mustafa Al Lal Mohamed, 42; Kamal Mohamed Dris, 32; Rachid Abdel Nahet Hamed, 37; Mohamed Mohamed Benali, 26; and Mustafa Zizaoui Mohand, 26. All of the suspects were being flown to Madrid, to be taken to National Police headquarters. Arraignments are expected on Monday. Last January, a suspected Islamist militant returning to Europe from the war in Syria was arrested at the Malaga airport in southern Spain as a potential ""threat to national security,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement at the time. March 11 marked the 10th anniversary of the Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800. The Spanish courts convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the bombings on morning commuter trains, along with four Spaniards who trafficked in explosives used in the attacks. A further seven key Islamist suspects blew themselves up three weeks after the train attacks as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb. Spain has arrested more than 472 suspected Islamic militants since the train bombings. There are now more than 1,800 police and security officials dedicated to fighting terrorism, far more than at the time of the attacks, Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said last March. On Thursday, Spain's National Court sentenced Mudhar Hussein Almalki, 53, a Saudi national, to eight years in prison for of membership in a terrorist organization, according to a copy of the sentence viewed by CNN. He was convicted of using the Internet, from his home in Valencia, Spain, to spread terrorist ideology with the aim of training militants, for at least six years until his arrest in 2012, the sentence said. He was legally residing in Spain at the time and had no prior criminal record, the sentence said. Spain is on a Level 2 anti-terrorist alert, unchanged since 2009, on a scale of four terrorist prevention levels. Level 2 signifies a ""probable risk"" of another attack, the Interior Ministry said. Melilla is a Spanish city with about 85,000 residents. It was in the news earlier this week when about 1,000 sub-Saharan migrants rushed the fence from the Moroccan side, and some 500 made it over and into Spain, with the aim of finding work in Spain or in the European Union, authorities said. As police escorted the suspects from the homes where they were detained, crowds formed and some people heckled the police for making the arrests, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.","Arrests came in Spanish enclave of Melilla, on Morocco's north coast .

"(CNN) -- Adrian Lamo, the former computer hacker who tipped off federal authorities to WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning, says two men in the Boston area have told Lamo in phone conversations that they assisted Manning. Lamo said both men attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but he refused to identify them because, he said, at least one of them has threatened him. One of these men allegedly told Lamo they gave encryption software to Manning and taught the Army private how to use it, Lamo said. Manning, an Army intelligence analyst, is being held in solitary confinement at a Virginia detention facility. He is charged with leaking an airstrike video that the whistleblower website WikiLeaks published in April, and Pentagon officials say he is the prime suspect in last week's disclosure of thousands of field reports from the war in Afghanistan to the site. Lamo claimed both men are working for WikiLeaks. Also, both men are Facebook friends with Lamo and Manning, and at least one continues to post Facebook messages on Lamo's wall, the former hacker said. Asked for comment about Lamo's allegation that men working for WikiLeaks assisted Manning, WikiLeaks responded in an e-mail: ""As a matter of policy, we do not discuss any matters to do with allegations relating to the identity of sources."" The New York Times reported Saturday that Army investigators looking into the document leak have expanded their inquiry to include friends and associates who may have helped Manning. Specifically, the Times spoke to two civilians interviewed in recent weeks by the Army's criminal division, who said that investigators apparently believed that the friends, who include students from MIT and Boston University, might have connections to WikiLeaks. The civilians, who the Times did not name, told the newspaper they had no connection to WikiLeaks. The Boston Globe interviewed a recent MIT graduate who it said acknowledged Saturday that he met Manning in January and exchanged as many as 10 e-mails with him about security issues. But the individual ""adamantly"" denied any role in the document leak, the Globe reported. The Globe also reported that this MIT graduate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he was interviewed several months ago by Army investigators to find out whether he or ""others in the local computer hacker community"" helped Manning. A spokeswoman for MIT, Patti Richards, told CNN: ""We are monitoring the situation closely, but are not commenting at this time."" CNN has previously reported that the FBI is assisting the Defense Department in the WikiLeaks investigation of Manning. One FBI official told CNN the bureau is involved in the investigation of potential civilian co-conspirators who may have played a role in the leaking of the classified material. Attempts to reach an attorney for Manning have so far been unsuccessful. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Ashley Vaughan and Shirley Hung contributed to this report.","Hacker says he's talked to two men who say they helped WikiLeaks suspect Manning .

"London (CNN) -- British lawmakers meeting in emergency session approved a motion Friday to participate in airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq. The 524-43 vote came after Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament that the country had a ""duty to take part"" in international efforts to combat the extremist group. The terror group is an organization of ""staggering"" brutality, he said, which has already killed one British hostage and threatens the lives of two more. ""This is not a threat on the far side of the world,"" he said, but one which menaces European nations directly. In addition to an ISIS-inspired attack on a Jewish museum in Brussels earlier in the year, Europe's security agencies have disrupted six other ISIS-linked plots, he said. Parliament was recalled by Cameron for the vote on military action in Iraq, which was approved after lengthy debate in the House of Commons and House of Lords. Any proposal to expand the strikes to Syria would require additional action by Parliament, according to the motion. Cameron said Britain should join international allies in combating ISIS, a campaign that he warned would take years, not months. ""The hallmarks will be patience and persistence, not shock and awe,"" he said. The government insists such action is legal because Iraq's government has requested international help to tackle the Sunni extremist group, which has overrun vast swathes of Iraq and Syria and massacred religious minorities and Shia Muslims. Cameron made that point again Friday, saying there was ""no question"" of the legality of action given the request by Iraq's leaders and the broad international backing for the campaign against ISIS. Some MPs may be reluctant to back a bombing campaign in Iraq because of doubts over its effectiveness or unhappiness over past UK military intervention in Iraq. But action has been backed by the governing coalition of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, as well as the opposition Labour Party. Labour leader Ed Miliband told lawmakers the United Kingdom ""cannot simply stand by"" against the threat of ISIS. Now that it's been approved, military action could start within hours. UK forces have already been taking part in surveillance missions over Iraq, as well as aiding Kurdish forces with equipment. 'Past mistakes' Cameron acknowledged that the memory of going to war in Iraq in 2003, when Labour's Tony Blair was Prime Minister, ""hangs heavy"" over the House of Commons. ""This is not 2003, but we must not use past mistakes as an excuse for inaction,"" he said. There is ""no realistic prospect"" of defeating ISIS without military action, he said, and Britain has unique assets that no other coalition partner can offer, including precision missiles and surveillance capabilities. ""It is also our duty to take part,"" he said. ""Protecting the streets of Britain is not a task that we are prepared to entirely subcontract to other air forces of other countries."" Last year, Cameron suffered a painful defeat in the Commons when MPs voted against action in Syria in response to claims the Syrian government had used chemical weapons against its own people. The motion approved by Parliament on Friday specifically rules out action in Syria unless a separate vote is held. It also rules out the use of UK troops in any possible ground combat operations in Iraq. Cameron: 'Strong case' for Syria action . Asked about the possibility of a change of approach to Syria, Cameron said the situation there was ""more complicated"" than in Iraq and that he was not going to change strategy right now. ""ISIS needs to be destroyed in Syria as well as Iraq and we support the action the U.S. and five Arab states have taken in Syria and I do believe there is a strong case for us to do more in Syria,"" he said. ""But I did not want to bring a motion to the house today which there wasn't consensus for."" British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told CNN before the vote he was confident the MPs would approve Britain's participation in the Iraq air campaign against ISIS, but ""there will be assurances that they want to receive."" On the likelihood of Britain's involvement in Syria, Hammond said that it is not inevitable but that the possibility hasn't been ruled out yet. The United States and its coalition partners began bombing raids in Syria this week against ISIS targets. U.S. aircraft had already been carrying out airstrikes against ISIS -- the group also known as ISIL, which calls itself the Islamic State -- in Iraq since last month. 'Haven for terrorism' Miliband, explaining his support for the motion, said that ISIS' ambition to create an Islamist state risks destabilizing the region and make it more likely that Iraq would become ""a haven and training ground for terrorism"" directed at the UK. He said some in the House of Commons may be wondering if this is a repeat of what happened in the run-up to the 2003 war in Iraq. ""In my view, it is not,"" he said, arguing the circumstances now are ""demonstrably different."" On Syria, Miliband differed from Cameron's view, saying that he would want to see U.N. authorization for action there before Britain stepped in. Former Defense Secretary Liam Fox, a Conservative, said he believed there was a legal basis for action against ISIS in Syria and that it should have been up for debate too. ""Sooner or later we are going to have to do it. It would have been far better if we had said so today,"" he said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said earlier this week that his party would support the air campaign in Iraq because it is legal and has been requested by the Iraqi government. Also, he said, ""It's part of a much bigger coalition, a whole array of countries, crucially including a number of Arab countries which deprives ISIL of the ability to somehow portray it as a 'West vs. the rest' crusade."" Hostage plea . ISIS beheaded a British hostage, aid worker David Haines, earlier this month and continues to hold another British hostage, aid worker Alan Henning. The group has also released videos of the beheading of two U.S. journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Haines' daughter, Bethany Haines, said that she would support airstrikes against ISIS. ""(ISIS) need eradicating, they can't continue this way,"" she said. ""They can't be doing this to people and getting away with it, no matter what nationality, if they're Western or not. Hundreds of Syrians have been killed by them, and they need to be stopped. And, if air strikes or ground force, or anything, is what it takes, that's what it takes."" Muslim leaders around the world have called for Henning's release. They include Shaykh Haitham Al Haddad, a judge on the Shariah Council in London, who has said that ""whatever your grievance with American or British foreign policy, executing this man is not the answer."" ISIS has been ramping up its threats against the United States and the West. This summer, the group declared the establishment of a ""caliphate,"" an Islamic state stretching across the territory it has conquered. CNN's Isa Soares and Radina Gigova contributed to this report.","NEW: Parliament overwhelmingly backs UK airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- On some forgotten day in 2004, Cerro Negro, a soot-colored volcano in Nicaragua, was host to an unusual visitor. On the steep flank of the mountain, a man was bent low to the basalt scree, laboring upward. On his back teetered a small refrigerator, recently removed from a hotel minibar. Daryn Webb had a plan, and for someone intent on ""riding"" a fridge down the side of an active volcano, a great deal of optimism might be assumed too. What happened when Webb reached a suitably daring altitude, jumped aboard his fridge and set to his ambitious plummet isn't recorded, though he did survive to concoct more hair-brained schemes. Nobody I've met is sure about the fridge. Perhaps it wasn't sturdy enough for high-velocity volcano travel, or perhaps there was a disappointing, crawling end to the journey. Undeterred, Webb's next experiment on Cerro Negro involved a mattress, and, later, his front door. Perhaps because his home was getting a little breezy and running low on appliances, he eventually gathered some tools and wood and knocked up the world's very first volcano board, later to belt down the same volcano with more success. Unique conditions for fun . Almost a decade on and a successor to Webb's prototype is wedged under my arm as I plod through the sun-washed scrub beneath the cone of Cerro Negro, aka The Black Hill. Ahead, a 20-strong scrambling chain of fellow volcano boarders heading to the summit is a shock of orange against the dark basalt -- we're all donned in convict-style luminous jump suits. As I clamber up (the hike to the top takes about an hour), crunching the brittle rock formed by cooled lava under-boot, a thin breeze blunts the formidable heat. The sun is high, and the sky unmarred by clouds. It's tough to think of a more dramatic place to play in, and it's about to get more so. ""Check this out guys!"" hollers Jessie, our dreadlocked guide from Quebec, as she motions to a mass of pale rocks, beneath which steam leaks out into the thick air. Not far beneath our feet, the world burns. Cerro Negro is a baby in geological terms, the youngest volcano, in fact, in all of Central America -- some boast in an area with such a fund of them. Since its birth in 1850 it has erupted 23 times, the last in 1999 just before the sport of volcano boarding took hold. Jessie reminds us that The Black Hill doesn't just appear menacing, it really is. Another eruption is overdue. This is probably the only place in the world you can book a tour to go volcano boarding. There are a few reports of people trying something similar in Vanuatu, but the sport hasn't taken hold there. Neither too large nor too small for careering down (roughly 1,500 feet from peak to base), the smooth, denuded conditions on Cerro Negro make it the ideal place for such madness. ""To our knowledge, volcano boarding is only possible on Cerro Negro,"" says Timothy Brauning of the Bigfoot tour company, which leads volcano boarding trips. ""In parts of South America, and other parts of the world, there is something called 'sand boarding,' but this is nothing like volcano boarding. ""Because of the surface of the volcano and the weather conditions constant at this volcano, we are able to slide down at speeds up to 95 kph. ""When the volcano erupts, the prevailing winds push all of the ash and small pebbles to one side of the volcano, while the actual eruption happens on the other side of the volcano causing a smooth surface on the west side of the volcano."" ""Three-two-one, go!"" We all eventually heave ourselves to the top of a ridge, which curves around to the launching point. To the east rise other peaks in the Los Maribios volcanic chain, and beyond them, the Pacific glimmers. A smudge, jet black, covers the eastern side of the mountain -- a cooled lava flow from the 1999 eruption -- while most of the surrounding land is a sultry and baked expanse, so hot it dances. The city of Leon is below too, the country's largest after the capital, and launching point for tours like this by Bigfoot. From our vantage point, the angle of the slope looks too wild to be rideable, though Eric Barone might argue otherwise. The Frenchman descended the slope on a bicycle in 2002, achieving a world record of 172 kph on gravel, before wiping out and breaking, according to Jessie, ""pretty much everything you can break."" Meaning bones. ""Who's up?"" Jessie asks. Our silence is fractured by a few nervous giggles . Then a girl strides forward to claim pole position, goggles up and sits down on the board, which is rectangular and made of plywood reinforced with Formica and with metal mounted on the bottom. There's a rope to hold in your hands. Variations on the theme are constructed by individual tour companies operating out of Leon. Instructions are terse and delivered by Jessie with mock gravity: ""Elbows in, feet forward, good to go."" The girl and board crawl off with a sound of wood crunching rock, then momentum builds and she's soon just a soft orange mote chased by a smoky scar, like a jet trail. Then I'm up. ""Ready?"" ""Yep"" ""Three-two-one, go!"" Scattering gravel . The board edges forward and scatters gravel, the world tilts downward, air whistles by. I realize early that I'm close to sliding off, but I'm too committed now so I don't bother to brake by tapping my feet, and instead let the blurry landscape whip by with gathering pace. Then, at what will prove my terminal velocity, the board slips sideways. Basalt has little in common with other surfaces where you might encounter a board with a thrill-seeker on top -- snow and sand, for example. It's hard, abrasive and plunging face down into it will spoil the rest of your vacation photos. I see the spill coming in plenty of time though, and I pull the volcano boarding equivalent of the ejector seat, hurling myself sideways. When I hit the hard stuff I've managed to scrunch into a ball, and it only takes me a second to realize I haven't broken ""everything you can break."" In fact, I'm fine. I rejoin the board, take a second to drink in the vista from a new level, halfway down, and push off for a second time. Speed records . Back at the truck I watch the others descend. A few crash, but nobody stays a crumpled heap or shouts in anything but elation.

"(CNN) -- What do Copernicus and a Britney Spears look-a-like have in common? Despite centuries separating the two, both have inspired greatness in Poland. Maxim named Joanna Crupa, a Polish/American model and actress, 61st in its 2006 Hot 100 list. Here we look at some of Poland's most famous nationals -- from years gone by to the present day. Many have influenced a world far beyond their country's boundary. Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) Copernicus was a mathematician, astronomer, physician, classical scholar, translator, Catholic cleric, jurist, governor, military leader, diplomat and economist. He is primarily known, however, for his theory that earth is not the center of the universe. His book, ""De revolutionibus orbium coelestium"" (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), is often regarded as the starting point of modern astronomy and the defining moment that began the Scientific Revolution. Copernicus was born in 1473 in Thorn. Thorn was a city in Prussia, an autonomous region in the old Kingdom of Poland. Frederick Chopin (Fryderyk Chopin) (1810-1849) Born in the village of Zelazowa Wola in Warsaw, to a Polish mother and French father, he was regarded early on as a child-prodigy piano virtuoso. He is generally considered to be Poland's greatest composer, and ranks as one of music's greatest tone poets. Always in fragile health, he died in Paris in 1849 from chronic pulmonary tuberculosis. He was only 39. Mari-Sklodowska (Marie Curie) (1867-1934) Marie Curie, a Polish physicist and chemist, is arguably the most famous female scientist. She was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, the only person honored with Nobel Prizes in two different sciences, and the first female professor at the University of Paris. Her French husband Pierre Curie and both her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and son-in-law Frederic Joliot-Curie were awarded a Nobel prizes. Marie Curie was born in Warsaw. In 1891 she moved to Paris to further her studies and work on scientific projects. She found the theory of radioactivity and also found two new elements, radium and polonium (the latter being named after her native Poland.) Karol Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II) (1920-2005) Karol Józef Wojtyla was born on 18 May, 1920 in the Polish town of Wadowice. At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope elected since Pope Pius IX in 1846. He reigned as the 264th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005. His reign of over 26 years was the second-longest after Pius IX's 32-year reign. He has been the only Polish pope, and was the first non-Italian pope since the Dutch Adrian VI in the 1520s. The pope traveled extensively, visiting over 100 countries, more than any other pope and was fluent in numerous languages: Polish, Italian, French, German, English, Spanish, Croatian, Portuguese, Russian and Latin. He was the victim of several assassination attempts, but later said he forgave the perpetrators. He was chosen twice as person of the year by Time magazine. Andrzej Wajda (1926 - ) Wajda, born in Suwalki, Poland is an award-winning Polish film Director. He received an honorary Oscar in 2000. After the fall of communism in 1989, he was elected as a government senator while he continued his role as artistic director of Warsaw's Teatr Powszechny. His films often raise social awareness and have dealt with a number of subjects including war, communism and murder (based on the murder of his own father by the Soviets in 1940). Wajda married four times. He has one daughter and is currently married to actress Krystyna Zachwatowicz. Roman Raymond Polanski (1933 - ) Polanski is an Academy Award-winning and four-time nominated Polish film director, writer, actor and producer. After beginning his career in Poland, Polanski became a celebrated filmmaker and director of such films as Rosemary's Baby (1968) and Chinatown (1974). Recently Polanski has made acclaimed films such as the Academy Award-winning and Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or-winning The Pianist (2002), and Oliver Twist (2005). Polanski has a tragic personal history. He lived in Nazi-occupied Poland during the Second World War and was persecuted for being Jewish. He escaped death by hiding in a farmer's cow shed, while his mother was murdered in the infamous Nazi death camp at Auschwitz. After surviving the Holocaust and moving to the United States, Polanski married American actress Sharon Tate. In 1969, Tate, who was pregnant at the time, was murdered by serial killer Charles Manson's sect. In 1978, Polanski pleaded guilty in the United States to ""unlawful sexual intercourse"" with a 13-year-old girl. The director fled to France before sentencing. He now lives there and has French citizenship. He cannot return to the United States because he is likely to be imprisoned. Lech Walesa (1943 - ) A former President of Poland and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Walesa is often credited with changing the Polish political system. He founded the organization ""Solidarity,"" the country's first independent trade union, which was pivotal in bringing about the fall of the communist regime. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for his human rights activism. In 1989, after the fall of the Soviet Union, he persuaded leaders from formerly communist parties to form the first non-communist coalition government. He was president of Poland from 1990 to 1995. In 2000, Walesa once again stood for the presidential election, but received very little support and subsequently announced his retirement. Joanna Krupa (1979 - ) Krupa is a Polish-American model and actress. Born in Warsaw, the daughter of hotelier Steven Krupa, she eventually moved with her family to the United States at the age of five. Krupa has appeared on various magazine covers including FHM, Personal, Inside Sport, Stuff, Steppin' Out, Teeze and Maxim, in which she was named the Sexiest Swimsuit Model in the World. Maxim named her 61st in its 2006 Hot 100 list. She was also voted German Maxim's Model of the Year 2004-2005. She posed nude in the July 2005 issue of Playboy and also did a nude photoshoot for animal rights group PETA. The advertisements all have ""I would rather go naked than wear fur"" as a motto. Krupa has been quoted as saying, ""There is nothing sexy about wearing something that is so obviously tied to senseless pain and killing."" Robert Kubica (1984 - ) Born in Krakow, Kubica is the first Polish racing driver to compete in Formula One. Since 2006 he has driven for the BMW Sauber F1 team, promoted from test driver to race driver during the 2006 season. In June 2008, he achieved his maiden F1 victory at the Canadian Grand Prix, becoming the 99th F1 racer to win a Grand Prix. Dorota Rabczewska or ""Doda"" (1984 - ) Dorota Rabczewska, or Dorota Rabczewska-Majdan, is often nicknamed Doda or Doda Elektroda or ""the Polish Britney Spears."" She was born in Ciechanow, and is one of the most famous and successful pop singers in Poland. Doda started her career at the age of 14 and became popular after her participation in a reality TV show ""Bar."" In 2000, at the age of 16, Rabczewska became the vocalist of the Polish rock band Virgin. In December 2005 and October 2007, she posed nude for the Polish edition of Playboy Magazine. She also posed for CKM Magazine several times. Doda received a Superjedynka award on National Festival of Polish Song in Opole in 2006. In 2007, she left her record company, Virgin, to begin a solo career. Her first solo album was released in 2007 and was certified as gold on the day before its official release. In 2008, her album ""Diamond Bitch"" went double platinum after 60,000 copies of the album had been sold.","Top ten Poles: Marie Curie and her Nobel Prized family .

"(CNN) -- In the cases that make the news, the stories are often murky and much debated. The hazy memories usually involve underage drinking, bad decisions, sexual acts, photos snapped and shared. What's becoming clear in some recent high-profile sexual assault cases are the grave and lasting consequences for people on both sides of the camera. It's a double-edged sword, experts said. Sharing images of rape or assault through text messages or social media re-traumatizes the victim. But it also provides evidence that could be crucial to building a criminal prosecution. Depending on the state, sexually explicit images of minors might be considered child pornography. ""One of the issues that's always part of a criminal case is the defendant's state of mind,"" CNN legal expert Jeffrey Toobin said. ""Social media gives you an unusually direct picture of what's inside a defendant's head."" Related: When bullying goes high-tech . As evidence, however, it's often too little, too late. Two teens recently committed suicide after their alleged assaults were photographed and shared with others. Even if the photos and tweets lead to convictions, their existence does more harm than good for survivors. ""One of the reasons rape is so damaging is because it leaves you feeling a complete lack of control over your body,"" said Jaclyn Friedman, a rape survivor and author of ""What You Really Really Want: The Smart Girl's Shame-Free Guide to Sex & Safety."" Shared images of assault can reinforce feelings of helplessness and vulnerability, she said; the victim has no control over who sees them or how far they go. Backlash toward the victim can deter others from reporting sexual assault. ""Nothing ever goes away on the Internet, so the knowledge -- that one way or another, the attack will be with you forever -- can be a constant source of trauma,"" she said. Related: The healing process never ends after rape . Or worse.The family of 15-year-old Audrie Pott says she committed suicide in September after learning that someone shared a photo of her being sexually assaulted at a house party. Three teen boys were arrested last week in connection with the case, Santa Clara Sheriff's Office spokesman Jose Cardoza said. Formal charges have not been filed but they face two felony and one misdemeanor charge, he said. One of the felonies has to do with ""distribution of harmful matter of a victim,"" he said. The other charges are related to sexual battery. After learning that photos of the alleged rape had been shared with others, Pott wrote in an online post that her life was ruined. In a press conference Monday, Pott's mother read aloud posts from her daughter's Facebook page: . ""I have a reputation for a night I don't even remember."" ""I can't do anything to fix it."" ""I just want this to go away."" ""The whole school knows."" ""I have a reputation I can never get rid of."" The Potts family intends to file a lawsuit against the parents who own the home where the alcohol was allegedly consumed, attorney Robert Allard said Monday. The case has drawn comparisons to one that played out in court this year in Steubenville, Ohio, where two star football players were convicted of rape for assaulting a girl who had too much to drink. Images in that case were posted on social media sites. In that case, the survivor benefited from a strong support group, including parents who believed her and stood up for her, despite allegations from the boys' lawyers that the she was a willing participant, said Jennifer Long, director of AEquitas, which collaborates with national, state and local advocates to help prosecutions of violence against women. Related: Beyond vomiting, how to prevent rape . Images of the attack overcame the defense's arguments, said Long, a former sex crimes prosecutor in Philadelphia. A picture can mean a lot in cases where an accuser's credibility is called into question, when everyone was too intoxicated to recall details or when there's no physical evidence of an assault. An image can show the victim's condition, who was there and what took place. And yet, the existence of images doesn't immediately lead to a criminal prosecution. In another tragedy that made headlines this week, the family of Canadian teen Rehtaeh Parsons took her off life support Sunday. She had been hospitalized after she tried to kill herself. Her family said she became suicidal after being gang-raped in 2011, and was bullied for more than a year after the alleged assault. Authorities confirmed that a photograph allegedly showing Rehtaeh having sex with one of the boys was circulated to friends' mobile phones and computers. As a result, her family said, she developed suicidal thoughts. Law enforcement in the eastern Canadian city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, announced they were reopening the investigation Friday night after initially claiming that a joint investigation with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found ""insufficient evidence to proceed with charges."" Canadian justice officials told her family on Wednesday they would take a fresh look, the family told CNN. If charges arise, Long, the AEquitas director, said she hopes courts will consider that the photos exist and were shared. ""For the victim, it never ends,"" she said. ""That's definitely something the courts should keep in mind when determining a sentence.""

"(CNN) -- Hannah Anderson did what any teenage girl would do after a life-changing ordeal: she discussed it with peers online. The 16-year-old fielded anonymous questions on the website ask.fm, where she shared details about her abduction by the man she knew as Uncle Jim, James DiMaggio. She did not want to go with him, and did not escape after she was abducted out of fear he would kill her, she said in the postings. And, she added, she's ""absolutely"" glad he is dead. Alan MacNabb, whose son is one of Hannah's closest friends, confirmed to CNN Wednesday that the postings on ask.fm were by Hannah. A check of the site on Wednesday night indicated Hannah had disabled her account. The California teenager was rescued Saturday after family friend DiMaggio held her hostage for a week. This, police say, after he killed her mother and brother. The frantic search for the teenager stretched from southern California to the Idaho wilderness, where she was found at a campsite by a mountain lake. 'He was my dad's best friend' During the session, one user asked her if she wanted to go with DiMaggio. ""No, not at all,"" she said. Healing, answers could be slow . Why didn't you run? ""He would have killed me,"" she said. Why didn't you tell your parents he creeped you out? ""In part, he was my dad's best friend and I didn't want to ruin anything between them,"" she said. Tied up in a garage . Hannah shed new light on the night she was kidnapped -- the same night her mother and younger brother were killed and their bodies burned in DiMaggio's house. ""How did he separate you from your mom and brother?"" a user asked. She said he tied them up in the garage. ""How did he keep the fire a secret?"" Her response: ""He had it set where it would catch on fire at a certain time."" DiMaggio threatened to kill her if she fled and brought her at least in part, to help carry equipment in the wilderness, she said. Glad kidnapper is dead . Some questions were brutally blunt. ""Did he rape you? Hannah declined to answer that question. Amber Alert successes: More than 650 kids rescued . ""I'm not allowed to talk about it, so don't ask questions about it, thank you,"" she said. Are you glad he's dead? ""Absolutely,"" she said. Reports: Father of abductor has violent past . Planning funerals . Hannah, who lives in the San Diego area, went missing after cheerleading practice on August 3. The next day, the bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, 42, and 8-year-old brother, Ethan, were found about 45 miles east of San Diego, in DiMaggio's burned house in Boulevard. The body of a dog was also recovered, police said. Her ordeal came to an end after a tip from horseback riders sent FBI agents swarming to a camping spot outside Cascade, Idaho. DiMaggio, the man investigators had sought in her disappearance, was shot in a confrontation with an FBI tactical agent. When asked what she would say to Ethan and her mother if she got a chance, her response was a reminder of her trauma. ""I wish I could go back in time and risk my life to try and save theirs,"" she said. ""I will never forgive myself for not trying harder to save them."" Those who know her say she spent some of her day helping to plan their funerals. Psychotherapist: 'In a numb state' Some experts questioned the wisdom of the online chats. ""This is a 16-year-old who's totally traumatized, she's in a state of trauma and so she's not thinking,"" psychotherapist Wendy Walsh said. ""Sometimes in a numb state, you do things that you don't really consider the consequences."" The teen even posted a selfie ... a self portrait of one's face posted online. She also engaged in lighter conversation, but even some of that seemed painful. What design did you get on your nails? ""Pink for my mom and blue for Ethan,"" she said, referring to her 8-year-old brother. Ask.fm is a user-fueled, question-and-answer social media site, which claims to have 70 million users worldwide. Users can skip around the site asking people whatever they want, with the end result being profile pages that read like questionnaires. It has recently drawn heavy criticism as a hive of cyberbullying however, following several instances of teenage ask.fm members committing suicide after being harassed on the site. The suicide earlier this month of a 14-year-old British girl prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call for a boycott of ask.fm.

"(CNN) -- Earlier this summer, Kelsey Mirkovic, a disease detective with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, entered a hut with her team in Gueckedou, Guinea, to speak with a man who had Ebola. Their mission: to get the names of everyone he'd had contact with while he was ill, so that they could stop those people from spreading the disease. ""Who lives with you here? Who has eaten off the same plate as you? Who has bathed you and taken care of you?"" they asked him. Just his wife, the man answered. Mirkovic and her team knew that wasn't true. They knew he had children, and they knew that in West Africa, families and even neighbors eat off the same plate and bathe and care for sick people. They explained to the man how important it was to stop Ebola, and that his friends and family would be treated with respect. Their pleas didn't work. Mirkovic saw this scene play out over and over again. One of her colleagues at the CDC who's worked in Liberia says preliminary data shows they could be missing 40 to 60% of the contacts of known Ebola patients. ""This is one of the hardest parts of the response,"" said Dr. Brett Petersen, a medical officer with the CDC. Mirkovic agrees. She says she understands why Ebola patients don't want to name names: There was a rumor going around the communities she worked in that getting on a contact list meant you would die -- and the deaths would happen in the same order as they appeared on the list. ""I understand they're scared,"" she said. ""But it's very frustrating."" The Ebola outbreak in the West African nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria has killed nearly 1,500 people. Just one contact left un-traced could go on to start a whole new line of Ebola transmission. ""It's like fighting a forest fire. If you leave behind even one burning ember, one case undetected, it could reignite the epidemic,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the CDC, told reporters at a press conference earlier this summer. ""Contact tracing is a formidable challenge,"" said Dr. Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization. ""In some areas, chains of transmission have moved underground. They are invisible. They are not being reported."" There's no solid number of how many contacts have gone missing. Petersen said the CDC arrived at the 40 to 60% number because in some communities, each sick person has only listed an average of two contacts -- and households commonly have five or six people. Mirkovic, an officer with the CDC's epidemic intelligence service, said when she and her team felt patients weren't being honest, they would try to get information from neighbors or community leaders. Sometimes that helped, and sometimes it didn't. ""Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do,"" she said. ""We can't force them"" to give contacts. The World Health Organization estimates that 10% of contacts will go on to develop symptoms of Ebola. Occasionally, some of these Ebola cases go missing as well. ""Many families hide infected loved ones in their homes,"" according to a WHO press release issued Friday. Mirkovic, who left Guinea in the end of July, said she felt that the situation might improve as health care workers gain more trust in the community. But there's another problem with that: the availability of workers to follow up with contacts. For example, in Sierra Leone, there are 2,000 contacts that need following, but the group Doctors without Borders says they've only been able to follow up with about 200 of them. The group's teams in Sierra Leone and Liberia are ""stretched to the breaking point"" as the epidemic is ""spiraling out of control,"" the group wrote in a press release.

"(CNN) -- Six years ago Thursday, then-President George W. Bush appeared on television screens across America and somberly addressed the nation. An Iraqi crowd pulls down a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in April 2003. ""My fellow citizens,"" he began his four-minute speech, ""at this hour, American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people, and to defend the world from grave danger."" Six years later, the conflict in Iraq drags on -- with war-fatigued Americans shoving the military operation to the deep recesses of their psyches as they grapple with an economic crisis at home. Only 10 percent of voters questioned in exit polls during the November presidential elections picked the war as their top issue. Sixty-two percent said the economy was. ""This is already one of the longest wars in American history. There's nothing new in Iraq,"" said Steven Roberts, a professor of media studies at the George Washington University. ""We've read the stories of instability in the government a hundred times. Every single possible story has been told, and so there is enormous fatigue about Iraq."" Against that backdrop, the United States has accomplished much of what it set out to do when it invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was deposed, captured, tried and hanged for a brutal and deadly crackdown against his opponents during his regime. The rate of U.S. troop deaths has slowed. A surge of 30,000 additional troops in 2007 is credited for security gains the country has made. iReport.com: Share your salute to troops . And a fledgling democracy is taking hold, as President Obama announced that all U.S troops will be withdrawn by the end of 2011. But America has had to pay a steep price -- literally and figuratively -- to achieve its aims, analysts say. Taking into account operations for fiscal 2010, the conflict has racked up an $800 billion price tag since it began, the Congressional Budget Office said. By Wednesday, 4,261 Americans had been killed in the war, according to CNN's tally. The Iraqi casualty count, while harder to ascertain because of the lack of formal record-keeping, has reached at least 128,000, by CNN's tally. And leaked images of prisoner abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison and America's programs of detention and torture have tarred the United States' image internationally. ""From the first step until now, they destroyed our country,"" said Sheikh Moffaq Qaraghuli, a Baghdad resident. ""Smashed. Not destroyed. Smashed."" As the battles rage on, researchers are still trying to gauge the damage the war has done to troops. ""I still have the nightmares and wake up and find myself downstairs and I don't know how I got there,"" said Chris Tucker, who did three tours of duty in Iraq. ""Faces. Kids' faces. People that you have engaged or you have had contact with. ... You see your colleagues blown up. Things like that."" ""I thought we would get there quick and handle our business and we'd be out,"" he said. ""At least that's what we were told anyway."" Tucker received a medical discharge from the army last year and is now a police officer in Savannah, Georgia. Many in Iraq also are trying to move on, amid the constant fear of suicide attacks in their ruined cities. The Shahbander cafe, one of Baghdad's oldest, is a favorite haunt of the city's intellectuals. Inside, photographs of five young men hang on the wall.  Watch Shahbander Cafe patrons talk about the war » . All were sons of the cafe owner, Mohammed al-Khishali -- killed in a car bombing that ripped apart the cafe in 2007. A month later, al-Khishali lost his grief-stricken wife. For almost two years, he could not bear to reopen the cafe, he said. ""I remember the tragedies every day,"" he said, as his eyes welled with tears. ""But then I decided to take a hard decision to reopen this cafe for the sake of my people, my culture."" Many of the customers who gather there are critical of the U.S. invasion but are equally concerned about a potential withdrawal. ""Iran has ambitions toward Iraq,"" said Amer Naji, a cafe regular and a former Iraqi diplomat. ""With the Americans, they are afraid to do something aggressive against Iraq. But ... when you withdraw, that will be very dangerous."" Iraq and Iran fought a war in the 1980s that spanned eight years and killed at least a half-million people, by some estimates. The U.S. and Iraqi governments think Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard has been training militias and providing weapons, such as roadside bombs, to insurgents operating in Iraq. So, though many Iraqis agree that 2009 is better than 2008, they worry about 2011 when the United States pulls out. ""We are hopeless,"" Qaraghuli said. ""We are hopeless.""

"(CNN) -- Vietnamese authorities are searching for an oil tanker feared to have been taken by pirates just 40 minutes after it departed Singapore for Vietnam almost one week ago. The Sunrise 689 was carrying 18 crew and 5,200 tonnes of oil when it left Singapore's Horizon port on October 2, according to the Vietnamese News Service (VNS). The ship's owner, the Hai Phong Seafood Shipbuilding Join Stock Company, reported that it lost contact with the ship within an hour of its departure, VNS said. VNS reported that Vietnam's Foreign Ministry had sent ""diplomatic notes"" to the embassies of Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia in Hanoi, asking for assistance in finding the missing ship. Piracy rising in Asia . Southeast Asia has become a prime target for pirates who have staged a number ""serious attacks"" on tankers in the region, according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB). According to a report released in July, there had been at least six known hijackings since April, when small coastal tankers were targeted for their cargo of diesel or gas oil. ""The recent increase in the number of successful hijackings is a cause for concern,"" IMB director Pottengal Mukundanm said at the time. Until this year, most attacks had been petty thefts perpetrated on boats anchored at harbor, the IMB said. The missing ship, Sunrise 689, was last detected in the middle of a busy shipping zone in the Singapore Strait. According to warnings issued by the IMB, vessels in the Singapore Strait are advised to ""remain vigilant and to continue maintaining adequate anti-piracy / robbery watch and measures. Pirates / robbers attack ships while underway or while at anchor especially during the night.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Gale Storm, whose acting and singing talents earned her three stars on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, died Saturday, according to a Danville, California nursing facility where she was a patient. Storm was 87. Storm got her first movie contract, a stage name and a husband when she won a radio talent show in Hollywood at the age of 17. Her first TV show -- ""My Little Margie"" -- set the sitcom stage with Lucille Ball and other female stars in the 1950s, said Skip E. Lowe, a longtime friend who acted in some of Storm's first movies in the early 1940s. ""She was a wonderful singer,"" said Lowe. ""She started as a singer and became known as an actress and singer."" Born Josephine Owaissa Cottle in Bloomington, Texas, in 1922, she entered and won a CBS Radio talent show that offered a grand prize of a one-year movie contract with RKO Studio, according to her personal biography. She teamed up with the male winner, Lee Bonnell, whom she married and had four children with. The couple remained married for 45 years until his death in 1986. ""We fell deeply in love and were married two years later, just as soon as my mother would allow it!"" she wrote. The new name Gale Storm was also part of the prize, she said. Lowe, who interviewed her several times in recent decades on his cable TV show, said Storm was open about her bout with alcoholism. ""She was battling that bottle,"" Lowe said. Storm wrote about her alcoholism on her official Web site: . ""My successes have certainly not been without problems. During the 1970s I experienced a terribly low and painful time of dealing with alcoholism. I had Lee's unfailing support through the entire ordeal. My treatment and recovery were more than rugged."" Storm said she was ""fully recovered for more than 20 years."" She also chronicled her alcoholism battle in an autobiography published in 1980 and titled ""I Ain't Down Yet."" Her work in movies in the 1940s when she starred in dozens of B-movies -- mostly Westerns -- was great preparation when television became big in the early 1950s, she said. Her first TV series, ""My Little Margie"" was a radio show transferred to TV as a summer replacement for ""I Love Lucy"" in 1952. ""I was overwhelmed by the immediate success of it,"" she said. ""During the next four years, millions of people saw the 126 episodes of 'Margie' on TV and listened to separate, live episodes on network radio,"" Storm said. Her next sitcom was ""The Gale Storm Show: Oh! Susanna,"" airing from 1956 until 1960. Storm played the social director on a cruise ship. Along with film, radio and TV, Storm recorded several top-10 pop hits for Dot Records in the 1950s. ""I was thrilled when my very first record, 'I Hear You Knockin' ,' sold over a million copies and won for me the coveted 'gold' record,"" she wrote. ""After that, my hit records included 'Dark Moon,' 'Ivory Tower,' 'Teen Age Prayer,' and 'Memories Are Made Of This .'"" Her three Hollywood Walk of Fame stars are for recording, radio and television, according to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. She acted in a few TV episodes in the 1980s, including ""The Love Boat"" and ""Murder She Wrote."" Storm married Paul Masterson in 1988 after Bonnell died. Her second husband died in 1996.","Her first TV show , ""My Little Margie,"" set the sitcom stage with Lucille Ball .

"(CNN) -- Another round of nuclear talks ended late Thursday in Vienna. Nothing good, bad or even surprising has publicly emerged from the two-day talks between Iran and the P5+1 countries. Given the overall trajectory of the nuclear talks in recent months -- to external viewers a dreary process of back and forth, bluster and stalling despite a shared desire to continue talking -- two outcomes appear more or less certain. First, the much-anticipated November 24 deadline for a permanent deal will not be met. Second, the talks will continue and the negotiating teams need to decide whether they need three months, six months -- or any other length of time -- to try to reach a final deal. Given the high stakes, and the reality that there are no alternative means of moving forward other than continuing talks, all sides are apparently buckling down. The head of the Iranian negotiating team called the Vienna talks ""serious"" and ""helpful."" That was a more uplifting assessment than those that followed the October 15 Vienna meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. Earlier in the week, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson said that while ""90%"" of the work toward a permanent deal had been completed, ""important, sensitive and hard"" steps still needed to be tackled. In other words, there is still no agreement on two key issues: The scope of Iran's enrichment program and how and when to end sanctions on Iran as part of a deal. On these two key issues, each side has been trying to outmaneuver the other as part of an increasingly public war of words. The Iranians have been particularly quick to react to some reports in the West that Tehran can compromise on the scale and timing of the removal of the sanctions. Earlier, Reuters news agency claimed that Iranian officials had informed them that the leadership in Tehran ""would be satisfied with removing crippling U.S. and European Union energy and banking sanctions imposed in 2012,"" which have been the most damaging . Tehran has dismissed that claim, insisting it wants a compromise that would see all sanctions imposed on it lifted -- not just a suspension or partial removal. To Western negotiators, this Iranian stance is a non-starter unless Tehran is willing to make more compromises on the scale of its enrichment program. Iran presently has about 19,000 centrifuges, of which 10,000 are estimated to be in operation. The West would like to see the number of operating centrifuges substantially reduced although there is uncertainty about its specific bottom-line on this question. By all accounts, the P5+1 states themselves do not appear to have agreed on a target for Iran to meet, which means Tehran has been able to continue maneuvering around the issue. The Russians and the Chinese -- the two non-Western states in the P5+1 grouping -- are presumably more flexible on that front. Tehran's counter-offer has been to suggest swapping Iran's older-generation centrifuges for more advanced ones that produce more enriched uranium at a faster rate. However, this is not considered by the West to amount to a concession by Iran, as it ultimately does not reduce the amount of enriched uranium Tehran will continue to have at its disposal. Iran's access to enriched uranium has always been at the heart of concerns about its nuclear program. In other words, seeking to navigate around these two key stumbling blocks -- the question about the size of Iran's enrichment program and a timetable for removal of sanctions -- continues to keep the negotiating parties apart. What is also very evident is that neither side wants to walk away from the talks. There is no good alternative and not extending the talks beyond November 24 would essentially mean the collapse of a diplomatic formula. It is a formula in which both the Obama administration in the United States and the government of President Hassan Rouhani in Iran have invested massively, hoping for a major groundbreaking return. As U.S. Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman put it this week, the ongoing negotiation ""is a puzzle with many interlocking pieces."" But after a year of negotiations and eight rounds of meetings, it has become very clear that there are two critical pieces to this puzzle. Perhaps with more focus and determination, a solution can be reached. That is why an extension of the talks beyond November 24 seems to make sense to all parties involved.","The latest nuclear talks between Iran and the 5+1 countries failed to reach a deal .
Alex Vatanka says the November 24 deadline for an agreement is unlikely to be met .

"(CNN) -- Phil Rudd, the drummer for legendary hard rock band AC/DC, has been charged with attempting to have two men killed. The 60-year-old appeared in a New Zealand court Thursday afternoon facing a count of attempting to procure the murder of two men, said Bay of Plenty Police District representative Kim Perks. He was also charged with threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis, Perks said. The names of the men he allegedly wanted killed and the name of the alleged potential hit man are suppressed, CNN affiliate TVNZ reported. Rudd entered no plea to the charges at the Tauranga District Court, and was bailed until November 27, local media reported. Police searched Rudd's waterfront home in Tauranga on Thursday morning, TVNZ reported. The Australian-born drummer moved to New Zealand in 1983, after being sacked by the group. He rejoined the band years later. AC/DC is one of the world's biggest-selling musical acts, and in 2003 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's latest album, ""Rock or Bust,"" is scheduled for release December 2. In a statement Thursday, the band said Rudd's absence wouldn't affect the album's release or a tour scheduled for next year.

"(CNN) -- Almost one week after vanishing en route from Singapore to Vietnam, a Vietnamese oil tanker has been released by pirates who had taken control of the vessel. Nguyen Nhat, director of Vietnam's Maritime Department, told CNN that the eight pirates who seized the ship absconded with part of the cargo -- 2,000 metric tons of a total 7,200 metric tons of oil. The ship, called Sunrise 689, had returned to Vietnam with its 18 crew, arriving in port at 5 p.m. local time (6 a.m. ET). The nationality of the pirates was unknown, he said. The ship's owners lost contact with the vessel just 40 minutes after it departed Singapore on October 2, according to the Vietnamese News Service (VNS), citing the ship's owner, the Hai Phong Seafood Shipbuilding Joint Stock Company. It had been due to arrive in Vietnam on October 5. VNS reported that Vietnam's Foreign Ministry had sent ""diplomatic notes"" to the embassies of Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia in Hanoi, asking for assistance in finding the missing ship, which had disappeared from radar. Piracy rising in Asia . Southeast Asia has become a prime target for pirates who have staged a number ""serious attacks"" on tankers in the region, according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB).

"(CNN) -- Regional leaders on Saturday warned South Sudan's warring rivals to end their months of conflict or risk intervention by neighboring nations to restore peace. President Salva Kiir has been embroiled in a power struggle with his fired deputy, Riek Machar, whom he accused of trying to oust him through a coup last year. Since the attempted coup in December, militia loyal to both have battled each others' forces. Violence has quickly spread, with reports of mass killings nationwide. Talks and repeated pleas for peace have yielded no results. IGAD, a regional African bloc that comprises neighboring nations, has given the two sides 15 days to consult and come up with a resolution. Both sides must talk and produce a plan for an ""unconditional, complete and immediate end"" to all violence, it said. Any side that violates the resolution will face region-wide asset freezes, travel bans and an arms embargo, among other sanctions, the regional bloc said in a statement. ""The IGAD region shall, without further reference to the warring parties, take the necessary measures to directly intervene in South Sudan to protect life and restore peace and stability,"" it said. The conflict has continued unabated for nearly a year, raising fears it may spill into neighboring nations already taking in refugees fleeing the violence. More than 1.5 million people have been displaced, according to the United Nations, and thousands more killed. Some civilians have fled to U.N. bases in the country, making the facilities targets for armed militants. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation. Since the split, the nation has battled various setbacks, prompting IGAD nations, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda, to seek mediation. The violence is divided along tribal lines -- the Nuer community backs rebel leader Machar while the President is a Dinka. This would not be the first deal between the warring parties. Both the government and rebels signed a ceasefire deal earlier this year, which did nothing to stop the bloodshed. It called for an immediate end to all violence and military operations, but the fighting raged on.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama took veiled shots at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday for ordering quarantines for medical workers returning to the United States after ""doing God's work"" treating Ebola patients in West Africa. Obama told reporters on the White House's South Lawn that he had spoken by phone with Amber Vinson, a Dallas nurse who contracted Ebola while treating a patient but was discharged from Emory University Hospital on Tuesday after doctors declared her free of the virus. He said he'll meet with health workers who have returned from West Africa on Wednesday, and that American officials should not ""just react based on our fears"" by imposing policies that discourage more workers from volunteering in the region that is the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. Army major general speaks to CNN from inside Ebola quarantine . ""We don't want to do things that aren't based on science and best practices,"" Obama said, ""because if we do, then we're just putting another barrier on somebody who's already doing important work on our behalf."" Christie and Cuomo have faced pressure from the administration in recent days over their state policies mandating quarantines for medical workers returning from West Africa after treating Ebola patients. Obama ignored a reporter's shouted question about whether he has spoken to Christie this week. Chris Christie on Ebola policy: 'We're not moving an inch' ""This disease can be contained,"" Obama said. ""It will be defeated. Progress is possible. But we're gonna have to stay vigilant, and we've got to make sure that we're working together."" Obama said different rules apply, though, for military personnel who have been deployed to West Africa. The Army has imposed a 21-day quarantine on returning troops, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the Pentagon will decide soon whether that policy will apply to the entire military.

"(CNN) -- Not many people can combine a dream vacation with their place of work. But not many people ""work"" by drawing pictures in the sand on the beach. Andres Amador does. San Franciscan Amador, 42, is an ""earthscape artist."" He uses rope and a rake to create large geometric drawings on beaches. His work can span an entire beach -- often covering 9,300 square meters (100,000 square feet) in area -- and usually takes little longer than two hours to create. That's useful, for his canvas is ephemeral, often subject to rogue waves, high tides (he always sculpts during low tide) and dogs. None of that fazes the former computer technician, who has so far drawn hundreds of short-lived artworks on around 30 beaches in the United States, Mexico and the Channel Islands. He's been commissioned to create backdrops for marriage proposals, memorial ceremonies, commercial artwork for a car company and offers workshops for people who want to learn how to create their own beach art. ""Ultimately, when it is finished, I let it go,"" he says. ""For me the energy and draw is around the act of creation."" Inspired by crop circles . Amador was drawn to ancient geometric art after studying crop circle reconstructions. Then, one cloudless day 10 years ago on Kalalau Beach on the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i, Amador was showing a friend the geometric art he'd been studying using a stick in the sand. ""[I drew] one circle and [explained to my friend] the meaning it has had for people; two overlapping circles and the line between their centers; three overlapping circles which form a triangle,"" Amador tells CNN. ""I suddenly realized that all of the crop circle reconstructions I had been studying start in this exact way, which establish reference points for everything that follows. ""It felt like a bolt from the heavens, in which I had a vision that I could do enormous designs on the sand."" In 2004, Amador drew his first piece on Ocean Beach in San Francisco, a wide beach near Amador's home. His work grew from there. Dogs not the artist's ally . Amador keeps a log of ideas on flash cards and picks one before heading to the beach. He's created hundreds of beach murals on just 30 or so beaches. Not every beach provides the right conditions. ""The needs I have in a beach have been such that there are few that are available to me,"" says Amador. ""I need a large beach that is relatively flat. Then I need a high high tide followed by a low, low tide. These occur several times of the month. ""At these times the canvas I have to work with is maximized. Other considerations are the scenery of the beach and the quality of the sand -- some dries faster than others. ""I also appreciate beaches without a lot of traffic, particularly dogs -- they're the worst for creating scars in the sand."" Amador hopes to inspire people to ""follow what brings you joy."" ""I did this art for many years without pay simply because it was so enlivening to do so,"" says Amador. ""If I can inspire others, I hope that I can offer the message that the path is more important than the destination -- that the journey should be the focus. ""When one is experiencing joy, then the world also receives that joy. And the world can always use more joy.""","Artist Andres Amador started drawing on beaches with rake and rope in 2004 .

"(CNN) -- A medical marijuana advocate turned write-in candidate for Rhode Island governor has garnered instant social media attention by smoking what she says is pot in a campaign video. But her media stunt comes with a more serious political message about pot legalization. ""I'm Anne Armstrong, and I'm going to be the next governor of Rhode Island,"" she says in the minute-and-a-half-long video. ""And I hope that during my tenure, I will be able to dispel a number of misconceptions about cannabis use."" Armstrong, who said she smokes cannabis every day, uses it for medicinal purposes, and also argues that it helps her focus and communicate with people around her. In the video, she takes a hit off a pipe after insisting that pot users ""shouldn't be ostracized or marginalized."" ""It doesn't make people crazy the way you've been told,"" she says. ""We've been lied to for a long time by our government, and something that's been essential to our health has been taken away from us."" ""Yes, I do smoke cannabis. And yes, I do inhale,"" she says, invoking former President Bill Clinton's famous ""didn't inhale"" remark during his first run for President in 1992. The stigma about marijuana has clearly lessened since Clinton's comment. Then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2006 admitted, ""I inhaled -- that was the point."" And he went on to be elected. 'I like weed, and I'm a good person' Both Obama and Clinton have now said states should be able to carry forward with medical marijuana, as Armstrong says she uses. But it is the official position of the Department of Justice that marijuana is a schedule 1 narcotic. Some former politicians have gone even further than just advocating allowing medical marijuana. Upon retirement in 2011, former Democratic Congressman Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts became the president of a medical marijuana company in his home state, where medical marijuana is legal. He resigned from his post earlier this month after a failed bid to earn licenses to open three dispensaries in the state. Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico and Libertarian 2012 presidential candidate, has long been an advocate for pot legalization. Now, he's taking that support to a new level by signing on this summer as the CEO of a Nevada-based firm that aims to sell recreational marijuana products. ""I think in 10 years, for the most part, the U.S. will legalize marijuana. And what the U.S. does, so does the world,"" Johnson told the Associated Press. Large changes are already underway: Medical marijuana is permitted in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Ballot initiatives in Colorado and Washington state paved the way for legalization there for adults over 21. Voters in Oregon, Alaska and D.C. will find the legalization question on their ballots. And pot advocates filed paperwork Wednesday to begin a legalization campaign push in California. But it's still safe to say that Armstrong's single-issue campaign in Rhode Island is a long shot. She's up against a crowded field of candidates including Democrat Gina Raimondo, Republican Allan Fung, one candidate from the state's Moderate Party and two independent candidates. Armstrong's name won't appear on the ballot, but efforts like hers to ""remove the stigma"" about marijuana use could last long beyond November 4.

"Washington (CNN) -- A week after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of an Ohio law that restricts early voting, Attorney General Eric Holder argued the decision will disproportionately affect African-Americans, many of whom ""heavily"" use early voting. ""It is a major step backward to allow these reductions to early voting to go into effect,"" Holder said in a video message posted Monday. ""Early voting is about much more than making it more convenient for people to exercise their civic responsibilities. It's about preserving access and openness for every eligible voter, not just those who can afford to miss work or who can afford to pay for childcare,"" he continued in the video, which was posted on the Justice Department's website. The law cut down the state's 35-day early voting window by seven days. Proponents say that reducing in-person early voting would help create uniformity across the state's counties, and voters would still be able to vote by mail during that seven-day window. But critics argue the Republican-backed law will make it more difficult for minorities to vote. Opinion: Why does GOP fight early voting? While the Justice Department was not a part of the lawsuit, it filed a brief in the case in July. A federal judge had previously said the law was unconstitutional and placed a hold on it so it couldn't go into effect. That decision was upheld by a federal appeals court judge. But the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision allowed for the law to go into effect immediately. Early voting in Ohio now official starts this week. In his video message, Holder said early voting is ""heavily used"" by African-Americans because the practice is popular among people who have a hard time getting to the polls due to childcare responsibilities, hourly salaries, and reduced access to transportation. ""Restricting voting hours in ways that would disproportionately impact minority communities is not only unnecessary and unwarranted -- it is out of step with our history of continually expanding the franchise,"" he said. ""It is contrary to our fundamental values of equality, opportunity, and inclusion. And it is an affront to millions who have marched, and fought, and too often died to make real America's most basic promise."" Holder announced late last month he'll soon be resigning from his post, but will stay on until a replacement has been confirmed.","Eric Holder blasts the Supreme Court's ruling involving voting laws in Ohio .

"(CNN) -- Go to the theater? Visit his hometown? Drink like an Elizabethan? What's the most appropriate way to toast the world's best-known writer? This month marks 450 years since the birth of William Shakespeare. Bard-o-philes argue over April 23 or April 26 -- the exact birth date is unclear, though historic documents show the date of his baptism as April 26, and newborns were usually baptized within three days of their birth in the 16th century. Instead of getting into that argument, we prefer to propose six things Bill may have done himself to celebrate the day. 1. Stroll the streets of Stratford-upon-Avon . Shakespeare was born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, an ancient market town in Warwickshire in the middle of England. It's perfect for fans of the playwright and also lovers of gardens, cream tea, white swans and black-and-white Tudor buildings. This quaint town screams England ... or rather, murmurs it politely. Tea rooms serve cream-loaded scones as big as beef burgers and ale is pumped from 600-year-old pubs. The playwright's influence is everywhere -- from Shakespeare's Hotel to Hathaway Tearoom to Othello's Restaurant. But the town's biggest draws are the five houses linked to its most famous son, including Shakespeare's Birthplace and Anne Hathaway's Cottage. The former is a 15th-century house thought to be where the poet was born. The latter is the family home of Shakespeare's wife, with beautiful gardens. Stratford Town Walk is a great way to take in a thousand years of history in two hours. Tour guide John Hogg, 69, says the walk takes place every day, come rain or shine, even when the River Avon bursts its banks. Stratford-upon-Avon . 2. Join the birthday bonanza . Visitors to Shakespeare's Birthplace on April 23 will be able to sign a guest book that's brought out only once a year. The book was first signed in 1847 and contains signatures of literary legends such as Thomas Hardy and Charles Dickens. On the same day, the Stratford-based Royal Shakespeare Company will stage a fireworks show, scheduled to start at 10:30 p.m. from the theater's 36-meter-tall tower. The company is performing ""Henry IV, Part I"" and ""Part II"" during the birthday week. The traditional birthday procession in Stratford-upon-Avon takes place on the morning of April 26. Students from King Edward VI Grammar School, where Shakespeare studied as a boy, will parade from the Town Hall to the Holy Trinity Church then place quill pens on the writer's grave. The procession will be followed by a people's pageant at 11 a.m. Everyone can chip in to cheer, lament or act like the Bard. The Elizabethan street party will be joined for the first time by a six-meter-tall mechanical Lady Godiva. 3. Walk the City of London . After leaving his hometown, Shakespeare lived, wrote and acted extensively in an eastern part of London near the River Thames, known as the City of London. Actor-turned-tour-guide Declan McHugh, 53, hosts a Shakespeare-themed walking tour each Friday -- the tour follows a thread through the cobblestone backstreets of London's financial district. ""There are lots of memorials of one kind or another, including sculptures and plaques,"" says McHugh. ""But many aren't well known and are hidden away in odd nooks and crannies."" Highlights on the 105-minute tour include the sites of the only two documented London addresses where the playwright lived and reading Shakespeare's signature on his housing deeds. To celebrate the writer's birthday, McHugh will lead two special Shakespeare walking tours in South London (starting at 11 a.m., April 22 and 23), as well as two City Walks (starting at 6 p.m., April 22 and 23). The Shakespeare City Walk; Â£9.50 ($16); every Friday from 11 a.m. 4. Explore the Globe Theatre . Although the reconstructed Elizabethan theater is no longer standing on its original site (the original Globe, completed in 1599, was about 250 meters to the southeast), it provides a lovely excuse to imagine yourself as an ale-wielding, garlic-chewing, Elizabethan fun seeker. The theater tour is brilliant. For a Tudor penny -- or Â£13.50 ($22.75) in today's money -- you're taken through a brief history of the Globe and Elizabethan theater. You can watch a show at the Globe's new addition, the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. The four-month-old candle-lit playhouse is a reproduction of Blackfriars Theatre, another important Shakespearean theater that once existed north of the Thames. The oak and thatched-roofed structure will open its doors for free on April 21 from noon to 5 p.m. It will also stage its newest interpretation of ""Hamlet"" from April 23-26 before the show embarks on a world tour, visiting every country on the planet in the next two and half years. Shakespeare's Globe, 21 New Globe Walk, Bankside, London; +44 20 7902 1400; opening time varies from month to month, check the official website before your visit . 5. Watch fringe events at The Rose . Minutes from the Globe Theatre lay the ruins of The Rose, the first Elizabethan playhouse on Bankside, built in 1587. They're the only surviving parts of an Elizabethan theater open to the public in London. The foundations of The Rose were discovered in 1989 under a demolished office block. Philip Henslowe, the playhouse's owner, kept a detailed diary, documenting everything from how plays were performed to how much had been spent on renovations. Through this diary, ""we know more about Elizabethan playgoing from The Rose than from any other source,"" says Suzanne Marie, an honorary artistic associate with the theater. The Rose is now used as a fringe theater. Plays written by Elizabethan masters are staged here almost every night. The space also hosts an Open Day every Saturday. Visitors can watch a 15-minute video about the playhouse's history, enjoy a few fringe-style theater scenes and learn about The Rose Revealed Project, a program aimed to convert the site into a permanent public display by 2016. The Rose Theatre, 56 Park St., Bankside, Southwark, London; +44 20 7261 9565; Open Day takes place every Saturday from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. 6. Grab a pint at an historic pub . It's hard to know how much or how often Shakespeare drank, but the playwright certainly gave the impression of enjoying a tipple. Records suggest he rented out half of his old home in Stratford-upon-Avon to a pub called Swan & Maidenhead, which operated for another two centuries after Shakespeare's death in 1616. The Garrick Inn in Stratford was likely a regular haunt for the bard. The three-story half-timber building is the oldest pub in town. It had already existed for about 150 years when Shakespeare was born and was once owned by David Garrick, a renowned 18th-century Shakespearean actor. It boasts to have served ale since 1594.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Occupy protesters returned to the streets of Atlanta on Sunday night, a day after a police crackdown on a gathering organized by the movement resulted in the arrests of 19 people. About 80 people converged on the city's Centennial Olympic Park for a peaceful gathering, according to police. The group was scheduled to return to Woodruff Park, the site of Saturday's arrests, later in the night to hold a ""Nonviolence Training Seminar."" Those arrested Saturday included two people who refused to leave Woodruff Park after the 11 p.m. closing time and 17 others charged with obstructing traffic after the crowd poured onto nearby streets, the Atlanta Police Department said. ""Before any arrests were made, people in the park were given several warnings over a loudspeaker, in English and Spanish, that anyone remaining in the park after the 11 p.m. closing time would be in violation of city ordinances,"" police said in a statement. In Atlanta, shortly after the park closed, protesters picked up their tents and tossed them onto the sidewalks to ensure that they were not confiscated. They then moved to nearby streets, where they planned to continue with their protests. ""We decided to leave two people at Woodruff Park to get arrested while the rest of us went onto the streets,"" said protester George Chidi. Police gathered to herd protesters away from the park and the sidewalks. ""A large Atlanta police force including motorcycles, mounted police, officers on foot, a SWAT team in riot gear and a helicopter moved in aggressively and faced off with the marchers,"" protest organizers said in a statement. ""Peace was maintained until a policeman on a motorcycle accelerated into a demonstrator."" Police said a protester was charged with aggravated assault and obstruction for assaulting a motorcycle officer patrolling the area. A spokesman for Atlanta police did not respond to a request for comment on organizers' claims -- citing video evidence -- that the officer accelerated into the crowd. The group may change gears and use other ways to convey its message, including ""occupying"" banking facilities and homes facing foreclosure, according to Chidi. Despite the standoffs with police, there is too much financial disparity -- and too much at stake -- to just sit back, he said Saturday. ""The financial services industry is not being properly regulated or overseen,"" said the 38-year-old consultant. ""We are cruising toward another 2008 meltdown."" And the protests will send a strong message, he said. ""We have not learned a lesson from the last catastrophe. If there are no people protesting, if banks start failing again because of Greece, they will come back to the government for a bailout. The government needs to know people are watching."" Occupy Atlanta is an offshoot of the Occupy Wall Street movement that started in New York in September as a call to action against unequal distribution of wealth. The movement has spread nationwide and beyond, with major cities continuing with protests despite encounters with the law. Last week, 78 Occupy protesters charged with nonviolent offenses were scheduled for arraignment in New York. All but 14 showed up in court, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. New York has made 555 arrests in the Occupy Wall Street movement on charges ranging from minor violations to felonies, the district attorney's office said. New York City Police said last week they charged a 26-year-old Brooklyn man with sexual abuse for inappropriately touching an 18-year-old woman at Zuccotti Park, the home base for the protests. In Oakland, California, demonstrators and police clashed last week, prompting authorities to use tear gas on protesters who defied orders to disperse. Meanwhile, in Vancouver, Canada, police said Sunday a woman thought to be in her 20s died after being found unresponsive inside a tent at the Occupy Vancouver encampment at the Vancouver Art Gallery. ""The cause of death has not been determined; however, no evidence has been uncovered at this early stage in the investigation to suggest the death is suspicious,"" Vancouver police said in a statement.

"Washington (CNN) -- New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will speak at U.S. Rep. Steve King's annual pheasant hunt in Iowa this month -- but he won't be shooting game himself. Ann Trimble-Ray, an advisor to the King reelection campaign, said Christie will be present at a fundraising luncheon in Iowa on Saturday, but he won't be hunting because he's on a campaign swing visiting other candidates. ""His schedule doesn't allow him to do more with the congressman,"" she said. Christie would 'rather die' than serve in U.S. Senate . Christie, who is widely considered to be mulling a 2016 presidential bid, hasn't broken through in Iowa, a state known for the large role its caucus plays in presidential elections every four years, at least according to recent polls. In a Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll out Tuesday, just 6 percent of likely Republican Iowa caucus-goers chose Christie as their first choice for president. He came in seventh in a pack of Republicans led by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Christie gets compassionate as he eyes 2016 . King's pheasant hunt has been a popular stop for conservative politicians looking to boost their own profiles over the years, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum. Unlike Christie, however, these prominent Republicans have toted shotguns.","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will attend Rep. Steve King's pheasant hunt.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In spite of prevention efforts, new cases of some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are going up, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Much of the burden of STDs falls on adolescents and people in their early 20s, the CDC says. The report, ""Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2007,"" also said that women and minorities in particular are more likely to have sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs. That fact isn't surprising, experts say, as studies on STDs in the past have also shown that women and minorities bear the greatest burden of STDs. The age of those affected hasn't changed much either -- nearly 19 million new sexually transmitted infections occur each year, and almost half of those affect 15- to 24-year-olds. The CDC began a national syphilis elimination program in the late 1990s, targeted at African-American heterosexuals, especially women and their babies. As a result, the condition was nearly eradicated as an ongoing health problem in the United States. But in the last two years, the trend has reversed, said Dr. John Douglas, director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention. ""The success we've been experiencing for a number of years in African-American heterosexual populations, particularly women, is beginning to be eroded,"" he said.  Watch more on the CDC's report » . Syphilis resurfaced as a danger in 2001, and cases went up by 15.2 percent between 2006 and 2007, the CDC said. Reported cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea together surpassed 1.4 million in 2007, the report said. Both of these conditions can cause infertility when left untreated. The CDC will address HIV rates in the United States in a later report. A record number of chlamydia cases were reported nationally this year, the report said. But Douglas noted that a major strategy is detecting infection before it spreads, so each case is an opportunity to prevent ongoing transmission. Chlamydia is the most common reportable STD and infectious disease, he said. Since the early 1980s, there has been a dramatic downturn in gonorrhea cases, but for the last 10 years, the rates have leveled off, especially in African-American populations. The CDC is looking at a number of ways to create awareness of the problem, he said. STDs affect not only individuals' health, but also the economy, the CDC said -- the conditions cost the U.S. health care system as much as $15.3 billion annually. The report reflects what Dr. Yolanda Wimberly, assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the Morehouse School of Medicine and the medical director for the Center for Excellence in Sexual Health, sees in the clinics where she works. In her 14 years of practicing, she has been diagnosing more and more cases of chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea, she said. Based on the report and her own observations, it's safe to say that some of the prevention efforts are not working, Wimberly said. New, innovative methods will be required to get through to this generation of young people, for whom text messaging and the Internet are integral parts of daily life. Many people hold the misconception that STDs come along with a visible sign, such as irregular discharge or a rash or bump. But, in fact, most STDs do not present symptoms, she said. ""That's how STDs are so easily spread,"" she said. ""It's not people who know they have gonorrhea and who go out say, 'I'm going to spread it to all these people.' It's the people who don't even know, who maybe don't get checked up regularly."" It's important to be screened at least once annually, even twice a year for younger people, Wimberly said. She offers to test everyone who comes into her office for STDs, even if they do not have any symptoms or came to see her for a different reason, if they haven't been tested in at least the last six months. However, not all doctors are so conscientious about STD testing, Douglas said. Particularly in nonminority populations, doctors are inclined to think, ""The young woman sitting in front of me looks pretty healthy, she looks pretty respectable -- she wouldn't have a sexually transmitted disease, right?"" Douglas said. ""We simply miss those screening opportunities."" Other doctors simply don't want to broach the subject of sex with their adolescent female patients, he said. There's also the problem of access to health care -- some women do not have physicians for this reason. Current prevention efforts include promoting awareness of STDs, personal protective behaviors such as limiting partners and using condoms, and screening programs, Douglas said. A key area to work on is normalizing conversations about STDs and sexual health, he said. ""If the parents assume that's the doctor's business, or the teacher's business, and don't roll up their sleeves and get in there themselves, and if our schools aren't giving comprehensive education, and if our clergy and other community leaders who are interested in youth well-being aren't including sexual health on the agenda, we're going to create missed opportunities.""","CDC: Women, minorities, 15- to 24-year-olds bear greatest STD burden .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper might have been spotted near his former high school, police said Saturday -- a potential boost for authorities' weekslong and multimillion-dollar quest to find him in the woods. Investigators believe a woman saw Eric Matthew Frein in a wooded area near the eastern Pennsylvania town of Swiftwater on Friday night, State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters. The woman was taking a walk when she saw a man with a rifle, his face obscured by mud, just off a road near Pocono Mountain East High School just after 9 p.m., Bivens said. She couldn't identify him because of the mud, but investigators' minds went to Frein, who police say is a survivalist who has been hiding in the sylvan Pocono Mountains in the weeks since the slaying. Frein is familiar with the Swiftwater area, having attended the high school and having worked summers at a camp just to the west, Bivens said. ""Our investigators believe this was likely Frein,"" Bivens said at a news conference in Barrett Township. If Frein was in Swiftwater, he was about eight miles southeast of where authorities have been heavily searching -- the Canadensis area, where his family has a home. Frein, 31, is suspected in the September 12 ambush shooting that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, about 25 miles northeast of Sweetwater. Police: Suspect planned ambush for months . A massive search for Frein has been carried out since, at times involving as many as 1,000 officers, some from other states. Despite recent sightings and other leads -- including handwritten notes attributed to him left in the woods -- he has eluded authorities. The manhunt has cost several million dollars, Bivens said. Police read excerpts of notes they say suspect left . Police have not spoken about a possible motive, other than that Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. Authorities have said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack for years. Bivens said Frein also might have been sighted south of the Canadensis area earlier this week. He did not elaborate, but he added that Frein hasn't been spotted in or immediately near Canadensis ""for the past week."" Police testing whether porch 'blood' linked to case . Bivens told reporters that police are investigating whether a blood-like substance found on the back porches of two homes in the town of Cresco, between Swiftwater and Canadensis, has any connection to the case. Testing has determined that one of the substances is blood, but Bivens didn't say whose it was, adding that more tests are pending. Results on the other collection also weren't back, Bivens said. Asked whether authorities believed Frein was injured, Bivens said that they would have a better idea once testing is complete. Investigators are working on an assumption that Frein is mobile. On Friday, a law enforcement source speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN that there was no reason to believe that Frein was injured, or that the blood was Frein's. As for Friday's sighting, it was near the high school but not on the school's property, Bivens said. He said police weren't recommending that the school cancel classes. CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Police: Woman saw man with gun near high school in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania .

"Washington (CNN) -- New rules meant to temper the civilian death toll from unmanned U.S. drones won't apply in the fight against terrorists in Iraq and Syria, the White House says. The standards, which Obama spelled out during a high profile address last year, were meant partly to allay concerns many Americans felt toward lethal drones. President Obama said at the time the drone strikes were used with far greater frequency than his predecessor in going after militants -- including in his fight against ISIS. But while officials in Washington insist there are strict standards to prevent civilians from dying in Iraq and Syria, the rules Obama said last year would stem civilian deaths aren't being applied in the new war against ISIS. ""The specific standards at issue in the NDU speech apply only when we take direct action 'outside areas of active hostilities,' as was noted at the time,"" said Caitlin Hayden, the spokeswoman for Obama's National Security Council, referring to Obama's address at the National Defense University in the spring of 2013. ""That descriptionâ€”outside areas of active hostilitiesâ€”simply does not fit what we are seeing on the ground in Iraq and Syria right now."" In addition, the strikes in Syria and Iraq are being conducted by manned aircraft in addition to unmanned vehicles, although that distinction might not be apparent from the ground. Related: Did Obama keep his promise on drones? The White House's decision to exempt the mission against ISIS from the drone standards was first reported by the investigative journalist Michael Isikoff on Yahoo News. Incidents of civilians being killed by drones have helped fuel resentment for the United States in places like Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia, where al Qaeda cells have sprouted since 2001. During his widely-anticipated remarks about drones last year, Obama said civilian deaths were a facet of every war. But he vowed to do more to prevent them in his bid to go after jihadist cells. ""For the families of those civilians, no words or legal construct can justify their loss,"" he said. ""For me, and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred throughout conventional fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq."" In new criteria for drone strikes, the White House insisted there must be ""near certainty that non-combatants will not be injured or killed"" before an attack is ordered. Other parameters included ensuring the terrorist target is present and certifying capture isn't a feasible option. McCain: ISIS' rise like 'watching a train wreck' While the White House says those strictures don't apply in the battle against ISIS, they do claim measures are underway to prevent civilians from dying. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby described a process of choosing targets in Iraq and Syria that takes into account the potential for non-ISIS deaths. ""While we continue to hit [ISIS] where they are, it doesn't mean we can or even that we should hit them everywhere they are at every moment,"" Kirby said. ""We must choose. We must discriminate between targets that matter more to us in space and time than others, and between those that run higher risks of collateral damage or civilian casualties."" In the week since airstrikes began in Syria there have been reports of civilian deaths, though U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) has yet to verify any non-ISIS militants have died in the air campaign. On Sunday night, U.S. military forces targeted to an ISIL-held grain storage facility near Manbij. The facility was being used by ISIL as a logistics hub and vehicle staging facility, according to CENTCOM. A Syrian human rights group said the strikes in Manbij killed at least two workers at the grain silos, and a U.S. official said the military was looking into the possibility civilians were killed. Related: Syrian town fears massacre . As Obama noted during his remarks in 2013, civilian deaths happen during times of war. Military experts say that's an important fact for Americans to understand, even as the government works to prevent them. ""To suggest that we can do a clean war with near certainty that we won't have civilian casualties I think simply is misleading the American people. We haven't done that in the history of warfare and I don't think that history has changed,"" Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt said Tuesday on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""","White House says new rules to reduce civilian deaths from drone strikes don't apply to ISIS battle .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For several days, through sweltering heat and sudden rainstorms, the protesters have gathered in awe-inspiring numbers in this bustling city. They have turned multi-lane highways into sprawling camps of umbrellas, tents and political banners. Their demand: An open field of candidates in the next election for Hong Kong's top political position, not politicians pre-approved by the central Chinese government. Except for dramatic scenes on Sunday, when the police's use of tear gas on protesters shocked many Hong Kongers, the demonstrations have been impressively calm. But tensions are on the rise. Some protesters have issued an ultimatum to Hong Kong's Chief Executive C.Y. Leung, whom many view as a puppet of China: You have until the end of the day Thursday to resign or we occupy government buildings. The police, in turn, have warned protesters -- many of whom are students -- that such actions would face ""decisive enforcement."" What happens next is anybody's guess. For now, the demonstrations still radiate a largely festive atmosphere. But underneath runs a gamut of feelings -- optimism and fear, confusion and exhaustion, determination and frustration. Opinion: China's Hong Kong dilemma . Hope: . Vian Lo, an 18-year-old high school student, says she remains hopeful about the outlook for the protest movement. ""People are very peaceful. This revolution really can help Hong Kong,"" she says, sitting on a concrete barrier in the middle of a highway occupied by protesters. She says she's been part of the student actions since Friday and has slept in the protest areas three of the nights. ""The road is very dirty, and it feels hot,"" she says, but adds that with lots of other students around, the atmosphere is upbeat. ""People didn't fight, didn't argue and they also help each other,"" Lo says. ""The feeling is good out here."" The key, she says, is for Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung to ""come out and talk to us."" Confusion: . Hui King To, 19, says he's been part of the demonstrations since a class boycott began last week. A student in business administration, he's spent nearly every night at the protests. But now he's feeling ""a little bit confused"" about what will happen next and what the consequences of the protests will be. ""I think for most protesters, they also feel a little bit confused right now,"" he said, sitting outside one of the entrances to the government headquarters. He says the movement started well, gaining a lot of support from Hong Kongers. But the lack of an overall leader means ""there is no clear and obvious direction for us to take."" Hui says he is personally in favor of occupying government buildings but is doubtful it will go down well with the wider population. ""Most Hong Kongers are against this kind of action,"" he says. ""They support a peaceful protest."" Hui fears that if the demonstrations simply remain as sit-ins on highways, ""more and more people will go home."" Fear: . Hilda Chan, 19, was at the protests on Sunday, the day when police fired tear gas at demonstrators. But she then fell ill with a fever and returned for the first time on Thursday. The social sciences student says she finds the calmness at the main protest site unsettling. ""I'm afraid something more serious will happen later because it's too peaceful,"" Chan says, talking of possible action against demonstrators by authorities. ""People should be more alert,"" she says, sitting in the shadow of an overpass. ""It feels like a festival or a party."" Chan says she won't stay at the site overnight, because she has to go home to take medication. But she plans to return Friday, even though it's not a public holiday. In the current circumstances, she says, ""missing class is not really a big problem."" Determination: . Brian Lam, 21, a student who's participated in the protests for the past five days, expresses concern about the thinner crowds at the main protest site on Thursday afternoon. ""It's so quiet,"" he says, ""there are so few people"" compared with the two previous days. He says he's worried that the smaller crowd could make it easier for the police to move in. But Lam is willing to stick it out amid the heat and the humidity. ""We need to stay a long time,"" he says. ""We need to fight for our freedom."" How long the protest go on is in the hands of the Hong Kong government, he suggests. But the government's position will probably ""not change so fast,"" he admits. Frustration: . Samuel Ho, a 20-year-old student, says he's ""disappointed and frustrated"" because ""the government is still not listening to us."" Ho has spent five days at the protests, sleeping overnight once. He says the tear gas fired by police on Sunday night made his eyes water. But he's not convinced that the demonstrations will last a great deal longer, because of the impact they're having on business in the city. ""The umbrella revolution cannot sustain very long because of economic concerns of other Hong Kong people,"" he says, using a popular term for the protests. Ho says he thinks a threat by some students to occupy government buildings was risky, as it could give police a ""chance to use violence.""","""This revolution really can help Hong Kong,"" says a high school student .

"New York (CNN) -- A gun law passed by the New Jersey legislature more than a decade ago may be set into motion as tech savvy gun makers get closer to being able to sell so-called smart guns in the United States. The idea behind this firearms technology is to create ""personalized"" guns that only fire in the right hands -- whether by recognizing a certain signal from a watch, a ring or even just the right grip. The New Jersey law is the only one of its kind in the United States. It requires that within three years of the technology being available, only smart guns be sold in the state. The new technology has become one more point of contention in the gun debate, with gun-control supporters expecting it to lead to fewer injuries and deaths and the pro-gun side arguing that it will take away options from gun owners. ""The problem is you have an industry that is totally reluctant to embrace any changes to make their products safer,"" said Ladd Everitt, communications director of the Washington D.C.-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. ""The benefits of this technology should be obvious to anyone,"" he said. ""The key is implementation. It is going to take some political will. Will you have a state government in New Jersey with the political will to see this through?"" The country's largest gun advocacy organization, the National Rifle Association, did not respond to requests for comment. ""New Jersey's smart-gun law is as dumb as it gets,"" said Scott Bach, executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs, a group affiliated with the NRA. ""It forces you to use an unproven technology to defend your life, and then exempts the state from liability when the gun goes 'click' instead of 'bang,'"" he said. ""If it's such a great idea, then law enforcement shouldn't be exempt, and the free market should be allowed to determine its viability."" One Germany-based company, Armatix, which already sells personalized guns in Europe, expects to have its Armatix iP1 digital pistol available on the nation's shelves ""within weeks,"" according to Belinda Padilla, president and CEO. Armatix uses radio frequency technology in its .22-caliber digital pistol, which unlocks with a digital watch and a PIN. If someone who isn't wearing the watch grabs the gun, it immediately deactivates. ""Our digital pistol is the first of its kind and has gone through rigorous testing in Germany -- some of the highest standards -- and in the U.S,"" Padilla told CNN. ""Anybody who picks up the handgun, whether it's a child or it's actively stolen, they can't activate the watch."" Another firm, Kodiak Industries of Utah, markets an ""Intelligun,"" which uses a fingerprint-based locking system. Bill Gentry, president of Kodiak, said the company began taking preorders in January. The personalized weapon will be in full production by the end of December. Armatix, Kodiak and other smart-gun makers are poised to force acting New Jersey Attorney General John Jay Hoffman, a Republican, to decide how to implement the law. ATF tests show 3-D guns lethal as metal detection law expires . For more than a decade, researchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology have been working on a grip-recognizing gun that measures the pressure applied and the size and shape of the hand holding the gun. Triggersmart, which was founded by Irish entrepreneur Robert McNamara, also uses radio frequency technology to enable -- and disable -- guns. The chip that activates the gun can be placed in a ring, bracelet or potentially even embedded in the owner's hand. So what does this mean for the law? The state Attorney General's office declined to comment. Under the law, Hoffman must determine whether the smart guns meet industry standards and are available for retail sale. The law says ""personalized handguns shall be deemed to be available for retail sales purposes if at least one manufacturer has delivered at least one model of a personalized handgun to a registered or licensed wholesale or retail dealer in New Jersey or any other state."" UK police raise spector of 3-D printer-made guns . The New Jersey State Police then will issue a list of firearms that meet the technological standard. Within three years of the guns hitting the market, they will be the only kinds of firearms sold in New Jersey. In New Jersey, 2013 firearms background checks -- needed to obtain permits required to purchase handguns -- increased by more than 50% through October, compared with the same period in 2012, according to the FBI. In the first 10 months of 2013, 100,922 background checks were conducted, compared to 66,912 during the same period the year before. According to the latest data available from the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics, there were 456 firearm related deaths in New Jersey in 2010. In August, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a bill that would ban certain long-range rifles and sent several gun-related bills back to the state legislature for changes, according to his office.","New Jersey law could take hold with new smart gun technology .

"London, England (CNN) -- It was the world's first multinational company, a trading giant during the colonial rule of the Indian subcontinent. This week, The East India Co. is being reborn as a luxury brand -- under Indian ownership. Sanjiv Mehta, an Indian-born importer and entrepreneur, bought the intellectual property rights to the company in 2005, after they had lain dormant for a century. His goal was to create a global luxury brand. His dream is realized in a new store off London's high-end Regent Street, where the new East India Co. now sells gourmet tea, chocolate, coffee and gifts. ""Its name has a huge relationship with all that is high-end products,"" Mehta said. The East India Co. began as a trading monopoly under Queen Elizabeth I in 1600 to ship commodities to the West from India, China and the Spice Islands, countering the clout of the Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese. At various times, the company controlled the trade in indigo dye, cotton, silk, opium and tea. The ""tea library"" at the new store features more than 100 different types including green, black, herbal, and flavored teas. ""There would not be tea on the tables of London but for The East India Co.,"" Mehta said. ""So, in a way, we own this category."" In time, the company and British colonialism became one and the same. It was the company's tea that was dumped in Boston Harbor in 1773, and the company once controlled Singapore and India. ""It brought all the exotic foods from the East to the West,"" Mehta said. That idea is infused in the goods for sale at the store, from Japanese mustard to chocolate and biscuits flavored with sea salt and red peppercorns. The British crown slowly took control of the company's routes, ports, currency and military, becoming the symbol of the British empire. In 1874, the company ceased trading, prompting an obituary in The Times newspaper now inscribed in a marble table at the new store: ""It accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other company ever attempted, or is ever to attempt in the years to come."" The company's name may also remind some of the illegal opium trade from China, and oppression and wars in India. Mehta, however, sees another side in his native India. ""The English language, the ports, the railway system, the civil system ... the bridges -- all was built by The East India Co.,"" he said. ""So there's a huge relationship between The East India Co. and various walks of life. It is not just food products."" Mehta said he has invested around $20 million in the company so far. He hopes to open more stores and launch leather goods, jewelry and home interiors, plans that will take an additional $100 million, he said.","Indian-born entrepreneur has relaunched The East India Co.

"(CNN) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is being treated in Saudi Arabia after an attack on his compound, will return to Yemen on Friday, senior adviser Ahmed Al-Soufi told CNN. The ruling GPC party said the president will be received by celebrations, but anti-government demonstrators throughout the country likely would not welcome his return. Yemeni security forces and pro-revolution armed tribesmen have been clashing intermittently in Taiz City starting late Tuesday night, according to eyewitnesses. The clashes have been in the Al-Hoban and Kalabah areas of the city, approximately 1 kilometer (half-mile) west of Freedom Square, according to eyewitnesses. Residents also report hearing gunfire in the city. Taiz is one of the epicenters for the anti-government movement in Yemen . The protesters are demanding that Saleh leave office, and there were celebrations in the streets when he left for treatment. ""Saleh's arrival back to Yemen is not a surprise; we said all along that he is traveling for medical treatment and, like any other president in the world, is expected to be back to his country and continue with the role of leadership,"" said Yasser Al-Yamani, a senior Saleh aide. Al-Soufi said Saudi doctors have given Saleh the green light to return home. ""When he is back, he will rule as normal and the country will continue to be under his control. Saleh will return strong and the will of the people will stand against any other will,"" he said. Saleh will rule until the end of his term in 2013, Al-Soufi added. Opposition leaders called news of Saleh's return false rumors. ""The ruling party are experts in lying and that is why we are not taking their comments seriously,"" said Hasan Zaid of the opposition Haq party. Khaled Al-Anesi, prominent Yemeni rights activist and a leading figure in the youth revolutionary movement, said the ""youth are now coordinating with the political powers here in Yemen in preparation for the post-Saleh era"" and noted that it is ""impossible for Saleh to come back."" ""The youth have the backing of the international community and the Saleh era is over,"" he said. ""Yemenis will not allow Saleh back in Yemen and he is smart enough to know that he is not wanted anymore and that Yemenis have decided to live without him."" Wassem Al-Qirshi -- representative of the revolution youth organizing committee, the largest of the groups that comprise the youth revolutionary movement -- said ""the youth want to coordinate and create a transition council but we are trying to involve all political factions in the process except the ruling party."" In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said at the briefing Tuesday that she was not aware of reports that Saleh planned to return to Yemen Friday. But she added, ""Whether he stays in Saudi Arabia, whether he goes back, our request is the same: He needs to sign the GCC agreement and we need to move on with the transfer to a more democratic, progressive Yemen."" Saleh had voiced agreement with the plan by the Gulf Cooperation Council, a group of six Persian Gulf states, for his gradual departure, but he refused to sign it. Government forces have been locked in conflict with al Qaeda's Yemen wing, and authorities fear the group, called al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is exploiting the political instability. It has a strong presence in southern Yemen. Many people have fled their homes because of violence. Close to 45,000 people in southern Yemen have been displaced, particularly in Aden, Lahj and Abyan provinces, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated this week. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","NEW: Gunfire heard in Taiz City, eyewitnesses say .

"(CNN) -- Nurse Kaci Hickox and her boyfriend are planning to travel to southern Maine from Fort Kent, Maine, after her 21-day monitoring period ends this week. Hickox, who recently returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities. A judge eventually ruled in her favor, saying that local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine and ordered Hickox to submit to ""direct active monitoring,"" coordinate travel with public health officials and immediately notify health authorities should symptoms appear. Maine authorities had wanted Hickox to stay home for the remainder of a 21-day period -- the incubation time for the deadly virus -- following her return to the United States, although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms. Hickox did not say exactly where she and her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, were headed. She also did not indicate exactly when they would travel. Monday is the final day of her 21-day monitoring period. Hickox: 'The fight is not over' ""We are going to southern Maine and will decide what's next from there,"" she told CNN on Sunday. They were only in Fort Kent because Wilbur was in school there, Hickox said. He has since withdrawn. Wilbur previously told reporters he was upset that his school would not allow him to return to classes for a period of time. A spokesman for the University of Maine system said officials were working to address Wilbur's concerns and ""regret that he characterizes our efforts to accommodate him as being insufficient."" Opinion: How to avoid Ebola quarantines . ""Officials at the University of Maine have put forth a tremendous amount of work to educate people about the threats of Ebola, but we still had concerns about safety and security and we were working with law enforcement and health officials and unfortunately we weren't able to accommodate Ted in a manner he was satisfied with,"" said Dan Demeritt. Hickox first made news when she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders. Hickox had an elevated temperature at an airport in Newark, New Jersey, officials said. She was put into an isolation tent. She blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of Ebola, including an elevated temperature, to be isolated. ""The biggest reason that I fought is because I, you know, felt so much fear and confusion, and I imagined what my fellow aid workers were going to feel if they came back to this same situation -- and the more I thought about the fact that these policies are being made by politicians, really not the experts in the field -- the more I felt like I had no choice but to fight back,"" Hickox told CNN last week.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Gen. Hahn Sung-Chu never believed North Korea could dig a tunnel that reached Seoul -- until now. Standing inside a basement of an apartment block in the heart of the capital, the former two-star general in the South Korean military says, ""This is a kind of invasion, North Korean soldiers working underneath us."" Hahn says residents had complained of underground vibrations, but the subway does not run beneath them. He says dowsers detected three tunnels, 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) wide at a depth of up to 39 feet (12 meters). His team drilled two bore holes to lower a camera, but before they could, they detected two underground explosions and their drill holes were blocked. Hahn is certain that North Korean soldiers were working beneath their feet, protecting the tunnel. North Korea upgrades space center for larger rockets . A history of tunnels . Four tunnels from the North have been found in all, although none since 1990. The South Korean Defense Ministry still officially looks for them as it believes there may be 20 in all, but the budget is small and tunnel hunters believe it is merely a token effort. North Korea has said the tunnels were not for invasion, but part of its mining industry. While the Defense Ministry believes there may be up to several tunnels dug under the Demilitarized Zone, it is convinced that none would reach as far as Seoul. It believes that Pyongyang would not be able to dig more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the DMZ -- the heavily fortified border -- because of the Imjin River. Seoul's northwestern boundary is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the DMZ. ""To dig tunnels tens of kilometers, it must be angled properly,"" says Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-Seok. ""There is a huge amount of groundwater in the Korean Peninsula, so water and soil have to be removed consistently. South Korea and the U.S. have always taken aerial photographs, and we found no evidence of this."" A view from a former North Korean official . But a former intelligence official from North Korea says the notion is not as far-fetched as it might sound. The military defector, who is not using his name as he still has family in the North, said North Koreans ""usually pulled out soil and stones during the night so as not to be detected by the U.S. or South Korea. They dig into the ground vertically from 100 to 150 meters (328 to 492 feet) and slope upwards to South Korea so the water drains back to the North."" The man says he had knowledge of the tunnel digging when he lived in the North. Saying that operations peaked in the 1980s, he believes Pyongyang would still protect the multiple tunnels it dug over many decades. ""I was told the tunnels are not directly connected to the streets of Seoul because of the risk of being detected. The tunnels are connected to the sewers linked to the relevant organizations."" The relevant organizations that would be targeted are the U.S. Embassy, the Blue House presidential compound and government buildings, he says. The former official says that in case of war, infantry troops would flood into the tunnels dressed in American or South Korean uniforms. The tunnels would then be blown up behind them so there would be no retreat. But in recent years, many suspected tunnels have been proved false. And concerns about Pyongyang have shifted to its nuclear ambitions and long-range ballistic missiles. Tunnel hunters do not always get much respect in South Korea. But Hahn, and others who have dedicated their time and money to the search, say the government should not ignore the threat they believe exists under their very feet.","Ex-S.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- More than 2 million anti-government protesters gathered on Friday in Changes Squares across Yemen calling on revolutionary forces to take decisive action against President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime and at any costs. Protests took place in 16 of Yemen's 21 provinces. Youth protesters in Sanaa chanted, ""Escalation is a must for a quick ending of regime,"" and ""Yemen will follow Libya's footsteps."" This comes as defected military general Ali Mohsen released a video statement on Tuesday threatening to use force to ensure that the Yemeni revolution succeeds. ""We know that the revolution will need military interference, and we will work to make it happen,"" said Mohsen. He also advised Saleh to not ""follow the footsteps of Satan"" and step down from power. Saleh is currently in Saudi Arabia where he is being treated for burns sustained in an attack on his palace earlier this year. He has vowed to return to Yemen to finish his term as president. Other opposition officials are also calling for military action against the Saleh government. The Yemeni revolution will prevail only if the military is used said Hasan Zaid, the secretary general of the opposition Haq party. ""No real revolution can prosper peacefully from history's experience,"" he said. Fearing fresh clashes, heavily armed tribesmen loyal to the Ahmar family, chiefs of Yemen's most powerful Hashed tribe, started entering the capital and in large numbers. Eyewitnesses said that at least 200 entered Sana'a over the last 24 hours. The tribesmen created checkpoint near the residence of tribal chief Sheikh Sadeq Ahmar's, and blocked all roads leading to the Hasaba district. The Ahmar family waged a 12-day war with the government in June, which resulted in more than 200 deaths. Military planes were seen flying over the residence of Ahmar family in Hasaba and Hadda areas of the capital. On Thursday, the Interior Ministry announced that the Ahmar tribes killed a senior general in the army. The ministry said that the attacks on innocent civilians are not acceptable and the Ahmar family will be held responsible. Abdul Qawi al-Qaisi, the spokesman for Sheikh Sadeq Ahmar's office said that two of their tribesmen were killed when government forces attacked them. ""The government continues to attack our tribes and insist on escalating the situation in the capital Sanaa,"" said Qaisi. Yemen's capital is seeing its strongest security presence since the Sanaa war in June. Eyewitnesses said that more than 2,000 pro-government heavily armed tribesmen are stationed in the outskirts of Sanaa on a mission to cleanse Sanaa's Change Square from youth protesters. ""When we arrived to Sanaa today, they were in tents and said they were waiting for government orders to enter Sanaa,"" said Wissam al-Sabahi, a resident of Sanaa.","Opposition leaders call for military action against the Saleh government .

"(CNN) -- A research team has identified two more sets of remains from unmarked graves at a former reformatory in Marianna, Florida, reported the University of South Florida. Thomas Varnadoe and Earl Wilson were the second and third students at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys identified through a DNA match, USF said in a press release issued Thursday. Wilson was the first African-American student identified . For years, stories circulated that boys were beaten, tortured and murdered at the school about 65 miles west of Tallahassee, Florida, but nobody was ever prosecuted. The school opened in 1900 and closed in 2011 for budgetary reasons. Records about who died at the school are sketchy, authorities have said, so an effort to locate and identify remains began several years ago. Investigators now say there's evidence 98 boys died at the school. Remains have been excavated from 55 unmarked graves, USF says. Thomas Varnadoe, 13, was sent to the school in September 1934 with his older brother, Hubert, USF said. According to USF, a death certificate said Thomas died of pneumonia 34 days after being admitted. His body was found very close to the body of George Owen Smith, the first student whose remains were identified, USF said. Thomas's remains were positively matched with DNA from his brother, Richard Varnadoe, USF said. Four students killed Earl Wilson, 12, a few days after he arrived at the school in August 1944, USF said. Medical evidence presented at the trial of the students listed the cause of death as blunt force trauma to the head, USF said. Results of the trial were not included in the press release. Wilson was positively matched with DNA collected from his sister, Cherry Wilson, USF said. His body was found in an area of the school grounds where crosses were placed in the 1990s, though the crosses didn't reflect the location of the graves or the number of children buried. ""Our ability to provide answers and the physical remains of those who died to their brothers and sisters after more than 70 years is a remarkable privilege,"" said Erin Kimmerle, lead researcher and USF associate professor of anthropology, ""We recognize the need to help families and victims find resolution, no matter how many decades pass.""","The second and third sets of remains have been idenfied through DNA .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Even as President Obama is expected to raise the issues of democratic rights and press freedoms during a trip to China this week, there is a question whether he will hold his own news conference with reporters covering his three-day stop in Beijing. White House officials accompanying Obama cautioned leaders in Beijing are still balking at the U.S. proposal for a joint news conference with Chinese President Xi. But consultations with Chinese officials continue on the issue, aides said. ""No final word,"" one senior administration official said. A separate official stressed the President may go forward with his own news conference, without Xi, a move that may add pressure to already tense U.S.-Chinese relations. Obama administration officials prepared reporters for the possibility of limited access to Obama during a background briefing with reporters last week. Reservations among Chinese officials were cited as the sole reason for potential press restrictions. ""If you go back to when Chinese leaders have agreed to joint press availabilities, you'll have a very hard time finding one where they have been willing to take questions from the press,"" said Brookings Institution analyst Ken Lieberthal at a briefing on the President's trip last week. ""So we want it; they don't. They are the host. That's where we end up,"" Lieberthal added. Joint news conferences are a norm for U.S. presidents as they travel much of the world. Generally, Obama and foreign leaders will engage in a news conference described as ""2+2"" with journalists, meaning two questions each from U.S. and foreign reporters. But there are rare exceptions, such as Obama's visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this year. National Security Advisor Susan Rice raised the issue of press access with her Beijing counterparts in the weeks leading to the President's visit, which will include a formal bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi at a summit of APEC leaders. The President is scheduled to deliver a speech to the CEOs gathered at the APEC summit Monday. Obama and Xi will have ""candid and in-depth conversations"" on a range of issues, Rice told reporters last week. In addition to their meeting, both leaders will deliver statements to the media. But the possibility of taking questions remains the sticking point. Press freedom and human rights in China remain a major concern for the United States, White House officials said. Recent democracy protests in Hong Kong have only served to elevate the issue for Obama, aides said. ""We've been very clear about our views and concerns about Hong Kong and other aspects of human rights and civil liberties in China, as we have been elsewhere,"" Rice said. Unlike other recent trips abroad for Obama, he is not scheduled to meet with human rights activists or engage in other ""person to person"" events while in China. He is on a tight time line, administration officials explained. Aides said the President will hold a town hall with young Burmese in Myanmar, during the second stop of Obama's three-nation tour which ends at the G-20 summit in Australia later this week. The threat posed by Chinese hackers to U.S. businesses will also figure prominently in talks between the two leaders. ""With respect to China, clearly the issues of cybersecurity will be prominent on our bilateral agenda. This is a source of grave concern to the United States,"" Rice said Friday. ""We have reiterated on every occasion the fact that we oppose any efforts -- official or unofficial -- to engage in cyberespionage for commercial gain or other purposes,"" she added. Obama and Xi have fielded questions from reporters in the past, but on U.S. soil. At a joint news conference in California last year, Xi was pressed by an American reporter on the issue of cybersecurity. Xi responded China has its own concerns with hackers. ""China is a victim of cyber attacks, and we hope that earnest measures can be taken to resolve this matter,"" Xi said last year.","Beijing balks at proposal for joint news conference with U.S., Chinese presidents .

"(CNN) -- By the time photographer Luigi Baldelli arrived in Sierra Leone early August, the Ebola epidemic had spread like wildfire. Contagion and death rates grew exponentially during those summer months of seasonal rainstorms while, strangely, an eerie calm prevailed in the capital city of Freetown, he said. That's when Baldelli, on assignment with Italy's Corriere della Sera daily, trekked through the muddy roads of the West African nation, straight into the eye of the storm: the village of Kenema on Sierra Leone's porous border with Liberia and Guinea, an area cordoned off by presidential decree for its alarming rate of Ebola cases. ""Freetown was quiet,"" said Baldelli, adding that at the time, there was still a level of denial in the capital. ""Kenema is a place where you had to get a special permission to go there. ... When I arrived, the situation was so tense at the local hospital ... doctors and nurses would not touch anybody,"" he said. A bustling diamond hub in West Africa, the trading town of Kenema and its outlying villages by then seemed like an apocalyptic science fiction movie, said Baldelli. Panic was palpable in the streets, lined with health workers in white suits, wallpapering public spaces with alarming bright posters depicting figures vomiting blood, spraying bleach here and there and taking the temperature of anyone suspected of carrying the virus. This new body language in the age of Ebola is unnatural in such a tactile culture, where mourners embrace corpses and people are often seen holding hands. ""In the streets, you don't shake hands, you just say hello from afar,"" said Baldelli. ""Usually people talk about 1 meter away from each other because they are afraid."" But the real horrors, said Baldelli, he witnessed in the makeshift hospitals in the outskirts of Kenema where people suspected of having Ebola were put together in forced quarantine with little food or no access to family members. The state-enforced isolation, however, didn't stop family members from visiting these wards, said Baldelli. Daring fate, sisters, cousins, uncles traveled through the thick forest in order to bring food to family members infected with Ebola, several times a day. ""I tried to take a different point of view about Ebola: not only the cemetery, not only guys with white clothes but the people, but life as it is. I took a picture of two women walking close to each other talking but they don't touch each other."" Baldelli, who was only allowed to shoot from a distance of a meter or more, said he did not sense there was a great fear of contagion from locals in and near Kenema, at least the kind of hysteria he'd seen in developing nations. A very physically expressive culture, he said, people from the area found it hard to repress their desire to touch a loved one, heal a family member, kiss a child, frustrating many health officials. ""But it is in the culture of the local people. They touch all the time,"" said Baldelli. "" And in even smaller villages people follow old traditions. They are not afraid of Ebola because they don't believe it too much,"" he said. ""There is a much bigger relationship between each other in a smaller village. And if someone has Ebola, they are in denial. They say: 'Maybe this is Malaria.' "" The way a nation copes with a monumental crisis such as Ebola is revealing, said Baldelli. There is a lot to learn from their grief. ""They are fatalists,"" said Baldelli. ""They continue to live the same kind of life. They won't change anything. They are not so afraid. They say we need help, but they continue to go on as it was before,"" he said. ""One man said he was sick with Malaria and called a man with a taxi,"" said Baldelli. ""This man drove the sick one without any care or precaution and took him to another village. So both of them died of Ebola,"" he said. The avalanche of tragic stories are followed by moments of tenderness. And more tragedy. A priest who closed the eyes of a man infected by Ebola only to die a few days later. Mourners who insist on kissing the body of their deceased loved ones. Many who refuse orders not to perform important rites of passage in order not to contract Ebola. ""This is all normal to them,"" said Baldelli. Considering that in Sierra Leone more people die from Malaria than Ebola, ""it is normal for a mother to know that if her child reaches the age of 5, she is very lucky. Because many many children die when they are 2 or 3 years old,"" he said. Luigi Baldelli is an Italian photographer. You can follow him on Twitter.","Photographer Luigi Baldelli documented the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone in early August .

"(CNN) -- Washington is obsessed with the question of whether government can do anything anymore. With the lame duck session of Congress mired in confrontation over immigration and Congress about to shift to Republican hands in January, gridlock seems to define Washington. But there is an issue where politics might work toward a legislative breakthrough rather than against it: the fight against Ebola. The spread of Ebola has been an absolute disaster for several countries in Africa. As voters learned in the weeks leading up to the election, families and communities have been utterly destroyed as a result of this horrendous disease. For a moment, Americans started to learn about how this disease could also spread to our own continent, as there were some cases of infected people within the United States. President Obama is requesting that Congress provide $6.2 billion in funding to combat the disease in Africa as part of the spending bill that Congress is now considering. The request comes after a potential breakthrough in the development of a vaccine that could have a major impact. Money to develop this, as well as to strengthen the public health infrastructure in Africa, is urgently needed. ""I think in some ways Ebola has receded from the front page of the papers, but now is not the time to let down our guard,"" one White House official said. In the short term, the cynics aren't very optimistic -- and for good reason. Legislators seemed to have forgotten the issue as soon as voters made their decisions in early November. But if the White House handles the issue in the right way, the President might actually achieve his goals. President Obama can use the carrot and the stick to push Republicans toward a compromise. With Ebola, the carrot would be the appeal of Republicans building on their own party's public health record to demonstrate to voters --who are starting to think about 2016 -- that they can govern. One of the greatest successes of President George W. Bush's administration was the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) initiative. Often forgotten amid all the focus on Iraq, torture, and the war on terrorism, Bush scored a huge policy success when he supported a massive infusion of funds into the effort to fight AIDS in Africa. As a result of the program, the number of people receiving care increased from 50,000 in 2004 to over one million by 2008 . The initiative has been a big success and public health officials agree we are on the road to wiping out the disease. In 2012, even as he was ramping up his partisan attacks in the presidential election on behalf of President Obama, former President Bill Clinton said: ""I have to be grateful, and you should be too, that President George W. Bush supported PEPFAR. It saved the lives of millions of people in poor countries."" Obama can ask Republicans to join him with Ebola and build on that public health record. At a time that many Americans think of the GOP as the party of obstruction -- good at attacking President Obama but not much else -- this could remind voters of what the GOP has helped to do and what they want to accomplish now. Even if this does not make it into a temporary spending fix that the lame duck Congress might pass, the President must continue to turn up the heat in the coming year to get this done. Then there is the stick. In the weeks leading up to the midterm elections, Republican candidates made a huge deal about the Ebola crisis. They used this as a way to talk about how passive the President has been in dealing with the crises that the world has faced, from Ebola to ISIS. The Internet record is replete with statements calling on the White House to do something. ""I'm concerned,"" said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, ""that the administration is not treating it with the gravity it deserves...."" Up to now, the Republican record is pretty thin. The Republicans did not really offer any serious path forward and have not been jumping at the president's proposals. Now President Obama can float his measure and put them on the spot. He can use their record as a way for voters to start measuring whether the Republicans are serious about governance or whether they just want to score political points. In this case, he can raise the question of whether they are willing to address a public health crisis that they acknowledged or whether they just talk about these issues for their own political gain. To be sure, we have seen repeatedly how solutions that seem most obvious for the parties to agree upon collapse in this age of partisan gridlock. Nonetheless, if the President moves forward with this proposal and handles it in the right way, he will force Republicans into a position of showing what they are all about -- real solutions or more gridlock. The GOP can be sure that American voters are watching closely.","Julian Zelizer: Washington focuses on whether the government can accomplish anything .

"(CNN) -- The ice man cometh. And does so early this year, after a former Pacific typhoon flew up toward the Arctic and rammed the jet stream. The stream has whipped south, dragging down frigid air from Canada over the northern Plains and Mountain States and the Upper Midwest, according to the National Weather Service. It is already plunging temperatures below freezing there and will hammer them into the teens and single digits in many places by midweek, even lower in others. Great Falls, Montana, will shiver at 9 below zero on Tuesday night. It's the coldest weather of the season, the weather service said. Minneapolis could soon get a foot of snow, the service said, with the Minnesota city experiencing below-freezing temperatures that could last for eight days. Let it snow . The snap is forecast to lay down the first broad layer of wintry snow, flurries, sleet or ice -- long before winter starts -- from Montana down to Nebraska and over to Wisconsin. It will accumulate in inches in the northern Rockies, northern Plains and Great Lakes. People farther south will also shiver. ""Much of the nation east of the Rockies is expected to see a major pattern change by the beginning of the work week,"" the weather service said. The western Dakotas are also forecast to get significant snow. Lows will drop to freezing in Kansas City late Monday, then into the 20s a night later. The snap will stop short, leaving much of the Deep South and Southwest in a fall-like warm zone. Rain is expected to hit Chicago and Milwaukee on Monday and Tuesday, with a few snowflakes mixed in, according to the service on Sunday afternoon. Courtesy of Nuri .

"(CNN) -- Former Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali said Monday he has been unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country's past. Ben Ali, in a written statement released by his lawyer, Jean-Yves Le Borgne, said it was time to break his silence because he is ""tired of being made a scapegoat"" and is a victim of ""injustice."" Ben Ali said that recent searches conducted of his official and personal offices were ""merely stage dressing"" meant to discredit him. The former leader denied allegations that he has improper bank accounts or property holdings outside of Tunisia. He called various charges against him ""nothing but a masquerade with the only purpose of illustrating a symbolic break with the past."" Ben Ali argued, contrary to the assertions of his opponents, that he has always worked for what he thought ""was the good of the Tunisian people, improving living standards and progressing on the path to modernity."" Protests against Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- began to erupt late last year. Fed up with corruption, unemployment and escalating prices of food, people began demonstrating en masse after the self-immolation suicide of a fruit cart vendor in December. The revolt led to Ben Ali's ouster and triggered a wave of protests against longtime rulers across North Africa and the Middle East. The former strongman's political party has since been dissolved by a court order. Parliamentary elections have been scheduled for July. At least 300 people were killed and 700 injured during the Tunisian uprising, a top U.N. human rights expert said last month.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Five U.S. drone strikes killed six suspected al Qaeda militants in the southeastern Yemeni province of Shabwa on Monday, two security officials and one defense ministry official told CNN. The drones targeted militant hideouts, checkpoints, training facilities and weapons warehouses in the Azzan districts, considered the stronghold for al Qaeda in Yemen, officials confirmed. Al Qaeda took over Azzan district March of last year, from which it has launched numerous attacks in the south of Yemen. It was the first district to fall into the hands of Islamic militants in Yemen. Residents told CNN that the explosions were powerful and were heard miles away. Two security officials expected the death toll to rise. One of the strikes targeted a checkpoint run by militants near the entrance of the district. ""The attacks were fierce and we have not been able to get complete death tolls from the attacks due to the security situation in Azzan,"" one official not authorized to talk told CNN. Dozens of militants blocked roads leading to the areas of the attack, residents said. Experts are concerned that the growing number of U.S. strikes will cause a backlash and hurt the Yemen's efforts in fighting terrorism. According to two Defense Ministry officials, at least 11 U.S. attacks were conducted on Yemeni soil over the last week alone. ""U.S. involvement is far more than ever in Yemen. We have no evidence that all those being killed are terrorists,"" Abdul Salam Mohammed, director of Abaad Strategic Center, told CNN. ""With every U.S. attack that is conducted in Yemen al Qaeda is only growing in power and we have to ask ourselves why that is happening."" On Monday, the Defense Ministry announced that seven al Qaeda militants were killed in Abyan province, where government forces have been clashing with militants for 11 months. Two of the killed were from Somalia, the ministry said.","Officials: U.S. drone strikes kill 6 suspected al Qaeda militants .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russians and Americans have been duking it out in the Twitter world over who's scoring more points in high-stakes diplomatic wrangling over Syria, U.S. President Barack Obama or Russian President Vladimir Putin. Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tweeted Thursday: ""Three days ago there seemed no diplomatic way to hold Assad accountable. Threat of U.S. action finally brought Russia to the table."" In her tweet, Margarita Simonyan, head of Russia's English-language television network RT, quipped: ""If the Russian proposal on Syria works, Obama, as an honest man, has to give his Nobel Prize to Putin."" Taking Syria's chemical weapons out of government control and preventing another horrendous attack on civilians is too serious an issue to reduce to political one-upmanship. But after Putin's bombshell opinion piece in the New York Times in which, among other things, he takes America to task for an ""alarming"" pattern of intervening in the internal conflicts of foreign countries, it's obvious something has shifted. ""It absolutely is a diplomatic win by Putin right now,"" said Fiona Hill, expert on Putin and director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. ""If we think about this as judo, which is of course Mr. Putin's favorite sport, this is just one set of moves,"" she said. ""And right now, he's managed to get Obama off the mat, at least, and get the terms set down that play to his advantage."" Putin's comments cause a fuss . Putin stopped Obama's drive for military action against Syria in its tracks this week as Russia's plan to put Syria's chemical weapons under international control pushes the action to the United Nations, just where Putin wants it. Russia has veto power in the U.N. Security Council, and as Hill noted, it's an ""arena that they're really very skilled at, which is usually blocking other people from getting resolutions or moving forward."" Putin's op-ed is not going down lightly in Washington. Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up. ""Mr. Putin's personality has been widely demonized in the Western world, so anything that comes from Mr. Putin will be met not only with skepticism but a lot of people will reject just out of hand anything that Mr. Putin will say,"" said Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""However, in this particular situation, when so many people are confused in the United States, in Europe, including in the political classes of Western countries, the arguments that Putin is making so clearly could be used in the domestic debate,"" he added. Analysis: Is Obama a winner or loser on Syria? Trenin thinks Putin ""is trying to insert himself and the Russian position into the debate that's now ongoing on Capitol Hill, within the U.S. more broadly, in the European countries. He does not want to leave the field to Westerners alone. He wants to have a voice in that discussion."" Arguments Putin presents in his op-ed struck a chord with some in Washington, even if they dislike him. One example: ""Syria is not witnessing a battle for democracy, but an armed conflict between government and opposition in a multi-religious country. There are few champions of democracy in Syria. But there are more than enough Qaeda fighters and extremists of all stripes battling the government."" Other points, like his swipe at Obama's comment this week trumpeting American ""exceptionalism,"" are bound to irritate some of the Americans Putin is trying to sway. Sen. James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, said Thursday that ""Putin was lecturing to the United States, and I could hear (Ronald) Reagan turning over in his grave as this was going on."" Some Russians claim that Obama ""owes"" Putin for getting him out of a bind. Alexey Pushkov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee, tweeted tartly: ""Obama should be 'for' Russia's plan with two hands. It gives him a chance not to start a new war, not lose in the Congress, and not become another Bush,"" referring to his predecessor. Hill said Putin did do Obama a favor. ""For Putin, being the old KGB guy, having someone owe him something is always to his advantage,"" she said. ""But this is more about a win for Russia here. Russia gets an imminent U.S. strike off the table for a while,"" Hill said. The White House is trying to throw the ball back to Putin, cautioning that his chemical weapons proposal will boomerang if it doesn't work. Putin ""now owns this. He has fully asserted ownership of it, and he needs to deliver,"" a senior White House official told CNN. Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution and former deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration, tweeted: ""If Kerry-Lavrov meeting exposes Russian proposal as sham, it will strengthen Obama's hand with Congress, assuring what Putin hopes to stop.""

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran announced Wednesday that it successfully tested another ""Sajil"" missile, a surface-to-surface missile with a range that makes it capable of reaching parts of Europe. Image purportedly shows the test launch of Iran's new Sajil surface-to-surface missile. A similar test was carried out in November. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he understood Wednesday's test of the missile, with an approximate range of 1,200 miles, was successful. State media reported that the missile, a Sajil-2, was launched Wednesday morning from the northern Iranian city of Semnan and reached its target. The report did not say where it landed. The missile was test-fired successfully, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a group of residents in Semnan province, state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Ahmadinejad said the missile ""met the predetermined target,"" according to the news agency. Gates said he could not confirm that it had hit the intended target. A White House official said the test is noteworthy. ""I think it is a significant technical development,"" said Gary Samore, special assistant to the president on nonproliferation, in a Washington speech Wednesday. ""Of course, this is just a test, and obviously there is much work to be done before it can be built and deployed. But I see it as a significant step forward in terms of Iran's capacity to deliver weapons,"" Samore said. ""And I think it actually helps us in terms of making a case to countries like Russia, which were skeptical in the past whether Iran actually poses a threat. This is a very clear demonstration that Iran is moving in the direction of longer-range missiles."" An Israeli official, meanwhile, said the test should be more of a concern to Europe than to Israel, since previous missiles tested by Iran could already reach the Jewish state. ""If anyone had any doubt, it is now clear that the Iranians are playing with fire,"" Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said Wednesday in an interview on Kol Israel Radio. ""We know that the Iranians are developing capabilities of thousands of kilometers, that could reach the coasts of the United States."" ""The Iranian clock is ticking fast and it must be stopped,"" Ayalon said. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Obama ""expressed ... his great concern, his continued concern, about Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and nuclear weapons technology."" The Sajil is a new generation of surface-to-surface Iranian-made missiles that ""demonstrates a significant leap in Iran's missile capabilities,"" Uzi Rubin, the former director of Israel's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, told Jane's Information Group after the November test. ""Regardless of the success of the test, this missile places Iran in the realm of multiple-stage missiles, which means that they are on the way to having intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities,"" he said. Sajil missiles are powered by solid fuel, which uses smaller containers and helps the rockets travel longer distances, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the semiofficial Fars News Agency. Iran says the missiles have a range of almost 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles). If that is true, the missile brings Moscow, Russia, Athens, Greece, and southern Italy within striking distance from Iran, according to Jane's, which provides information on defense issues. Gates said the missile was probably ""on the low end of that range."" After the November launch, the United States restated its objection to such tests, saying they violate Iran's obligations under United Nations Security Council resolutions. U.S. officials have cast doubt on the success of past missile test launches by Iran, including a rocket launch in August and a series of missile tests in July. Wednesday's reported test comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. officials in Washington to discuss how to deal with the potential of a nuclear-armed Iran. He met Tuesday with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader John Boehner. Obama, who met with Netanyahu on Monday, stuck by his refusal to commit to an ""artificial deadline"" for Iranian negotiations on its nuclear program. But he also warned that he would not allow such talks, which he expects to accelerate after the Iranian presidential election in June, to be used as an excuse for delay. He said the United States is not ""foreclosing a range of steps, including much stronger international sanctions, in assuring that Iran understands that we are serious."" Netanyahu wanted a time limit for negotiations relating to such ambitions, with the threat of military action if no resolution is reached. Asked if the missile launch will dampen Obama's efforts to reach out diplomatically to Iran, Gibbs said, ""The president and the prime minister [Netanyahu] both agreed on Monday that engaging the people and the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, something that hasn't been tried for the past many years, is something that makes sense."" Both Israel and the United States believe that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear energy program; Tehran denies the accusation. Israeli leaders have pointed to Ahmadinejad's calls for the end of Israel as a Jewish state, and argue that quick action is needed. Netanyahu called Iran the biggest threat to peace in the region. ""If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, it could give a nuclear umbrella to terrorists, or worse, could actually give [them] nuclear weapons. And that would put us all in great peril,"" he said. Obama is considered to have a more conciliatory approach to the Arab and Muslim world than Netanyahu.

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisia's rappers have long made a point of speaking their minds, their lyrics often bringing them into conflict with the old regime. But more than simply upsetting the status quo, according to one of the country's leading rappers their music was the ""fuel"" for Tunisia's revolution. ""Balti"" is Tunisia's best-known rapper and one of the founding fathers of hip-hop music in the country. His most popular videos have reached 350,000 hits on YouTube and he's performed to audiences of over 50,000, sharing the stage with such Western rap idols as Method Man. His latest recording is ""Zine el Abadine Ben Ali and the 40 Thieves,"" a barbed account of the former president deceiving his people. Rappers risked the wrath of the authorities under the Ben Ali regime, writing and recording in secret studios. Balti says he was arrested and briefly jailed in 2005 for a song which wasn't one of his. In recent years Tunisian rappers have taken advantage of social networks to post music videos on the internet. Most notably, a rap by 21-year-old Hamada Ben Amor -- known as ""El General"" -- went viral after he was arrested by armed police at his home in the eastern coastal town of Sfax and taken to Tunis for interrogation. The song ""Mr President Your People Are Dying"" was a personal message to President Ben Ali outlining the corruption and deprivations besetting the Tunisian people. Eight days later ""El General"" had been released and Ben Ali had fled the country. Inside the Middle East traveled to a recording studio in the suburbs of Tunis where Balti makes his music to get his take on the role of rap in Tunisia's revolution. IME: How difficult was it to make music before the revolution and how has that changed now? Balti: Rap and hip-hop in Tunisia before the January 14th revolution was very difficult. It was forbidden by the old regime and some people were jailed. Rappers such as Philosoph, Ouled Bled and myself stood up to those difficulties and made our voice heard. Hip-hop music has contributed greatly to the revolution in Tunisia. The revolution started on the internet. Thank you to Facebook and guys like El General and Psyco M -- they spoke before and after January 14th and contributed to break the fear barrier among youngsters. The revolution is a social movement and rap is always talking about social issues. We come from very tough neighborhoods and we talk in our songs about social problems such as unemployment. We feel like our voices didn't get to the regime, to the top officials, but thank God our voices were heard by the people, so we were the fuel of our revolution. IME: Do you expect hip-hop to explode in Tunisia now you have more freedom? Balti: Yes, I welcome the new generation of rappers. Everybody has their own style and we will compete, but I am very glad that we will have a new rap scene. I think that rap music and hip-hop has a good future in Tunisia. Along with Psyco M and El General there are many other rappers who didn't get their opportunity before the revolution and now is the time to have their chance. IME: What are your thoughts about what's happened in other parts of the region since the revolution in Tunisia? Balti: I'm so happy to see other Arab countries looking to get back their freedom, and not just because I'm a Tunisian, but because Tunisia played a leading role in this matter. My message to them is to do things in a peaceful way. Yes, you can ask for your freedom and a job, but you can do it in a peaceful way. You can also ask for regime change -- it's the people's basic right to remove it. I want to emphasize, do it in a peaceful way. Don't let a lot of people die and lose your wealth by destroying your economy. IME: How do you see the future for Tunisia? Balti: This revolution has been made by the youth of Tunisia. They are the ones who stood up against the old regime and asked for their freedom of speech. The whole nation is happy about the revolution but after every revolution there are some economic and political problems such as unemployment, but we should stick together to make this happen. The stone which brought down the government we can use to rebuild the country.","""Balti"" is Tunisia's best-known rapper .

"(CNN) -- Nobel Peace laureate Tawakkol Karman has decided that the best use of her half million dollars in prize money is to give it all away. Karman, the Yemeni activist who in 2011 became the first Arab woman to be awarded the peace prize, says she has donated the $500,000 prize money to a fund for the people wounded and the families of those killed in Yemen's Arab Spring-inspired uprising. ""This is my duty to the youths who sacrificed for change and to build a Yemen founded on freedom, justice, equality and good governance,"" Karman, 34, said in a statement late Monday. She is donating the prize money to the Aid Fund for Families of Martyrs and Wounded in the (2011) Peaceful Revolution, which was set up by President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Hadi assumed power in February 2012 in a deal that forced the previous president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to trade his position for immunity after a year of political unrest destabilized the country. Karman was active in the protests against Saleh's rule. The Nobel committee awarded her the prize in October 2011, when Saleh was still in power. Karman said she heard the news that she had been selected as she was demonstrating in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. She was one of three women awarded the peace prize that year. The other two were Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and Leymah Gbowee, a social worker and peace campaigner from the same country. The three women were chosen ""for their nonviolent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work,"" the Nobel committee said. It commended Karman for playing a leading role in the struggle for women's rights for democracy and peace in Yemen. She is the president of Women Journalists Without Chains, a group campaigning for press freedom. Karman is not the first Nobel laureate to give away the prize money. President Barack Obama donated the roughly $1.4 million award from his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize to charity. The European Union, which was awarded the prize in 2012, said it would use the money -- doubling it with its own contributions -- to help protect and educate children in conflict zones. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Karman says she's given the money to a fund for victims of Yemen's uprising .

"(CNN) -- The decision to increase U.S. troop deployments to Iraq isn't a sign the U.S. strategy against ISIS is failing, but rather a signal the campaign is entering a new phase, President Barack Obama said in an interview broadcast Sunday on the CBS news program ""Face the Nation."" The additional 1,500 troops are being sent to help train Iraqi army soldiers and militia fighters to battle ISIS on the ground after weeks of U.S. and allied airstrikes.

""Now what we need is ground troops, Iraqi ground troops, that can start pushing them back."" ISIL is another acronym for ISIS. U.S. forces will not go into combat, Obama said, reiterating previous promises that there won't be a U.S. ground role in the fighting.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- The Yemeni government has lost control over five provinces, and security in the country is deteriorating, the nation's acting president told CNN in an exclusive interview Wednesday. In his first interview with a Western TV network, Vice President Abdu Rabu Mansoor Hadi detailed how U.S. drones are using voice recognition to target al Qaeda leaders and help the government win back control. Hadi has been Yemen's acting president since June 3, when President Ali Abdullah Saleh was wounded in an attack on the mosque at the presidential palace. During Wednesday's hour-long meeting, Hadi said Saleh's wounds from what he described as an assassination attempt were so severe that he has no idea when the president will return from medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. Hadi said he saw Saleh immediately after the bomb attack. The 68-year-old ruler's chest had been pierce by a piece of wood and his face, arms and upper body had been burned, Hadi said. But, he added, the president's health was improving daily. The interview in the sprawling and heavily defended defense ministry underlined the many challenges facing the vice president, who many in the opposition consider to be a weak placeholder until the president returns from Saudi Arabia. He acknowledges that his house is surrounded by opposing forces, but he challenges claims that he is unable to use the presidential palace. Hadi says he calls Saleh's son, commander of the powerful Republican Guard at the palace, whenever he wants to give him orders. He countered opposition accusations that he has no power, saying he has been given full authority to sign a new, U.N.-sponsored peace proposal. He outlined plans that are even less favorable to Saleh's opponents than a Gulf Cooperation Council initiative he has already turned down. Hadi said the new deal would have Saleh stepping down only when a new president has been elected, a far cry from the Gulf Council proposal that would have Saleh handing power to Hadi after 30 days with new elections within 60 days. At times, Hadi -- who lived in Britain during the 1960s -- shifted uncomfortably in his seat, even joking at the end of the interview that he felt he'd been through an interrogation. Nevertheless, he gave a robust defense of Saleh, challenging the widely held view that the embattled leader is now part of the problem, rather than part of the solution. Saleh still has 3 million supporters, Hadi said. ""He is part of the political balance here in Yemen. He has been an expert in dealing with all differences, and with all political and tribal differences,"" Hadi said. When asked how al Qaeda may have been taking advantage of deteriorating security, Hadi said government forces were targeting them aggressively. He detailed an ongoing operation in the southern Abyan province, where the capital recently fell to al Qaeda. He also gave an account of how U.S. spy planes eavesdrop on al Qaeda conversations, running voice recognition analysis that is shared with Yemeni authorities, the CIA and the FBI before targets are attacked. Hadi said there are two types of drones. ""One is taking pictures and collecting information, and the other one is carrying missiles. Drones carrying missiles, actually these missiles could not be fired ... unless the voice of the enemy himself is recorded,"" he said. Often, he said, the United States provides the targeting information and Yemeni military forces carry out the attacks. Hadi offered few insights into how he plans to end Yemen's spiraling economic hardships, growing fuel and power shortages and rising food prices -- issues that have sparked massive anti-government protests over the past several months and have worsened sharply since the president left for treatment in Saudi Arabia. But he said he expected Saleh to make a speech to the nation in the coming hours that will help change the situation. And he said the U.N.-sponsored peace proposal will create a new, parliamentary political system in Yemen, ""so it will wipe out or vanish any grievances, any complaints."" Saleh went to Saudi Arabia for treatment after doctors examined him shortly after the attack in early June. They recommended he get attention from specialists, including an eye doctor. Since arriving there, he said, the president had been improving and fully intends to return. But when asked when that would be, he said he did not know. ""It could be months. This is a decision up to the doctors. ... I have no idea about the exact date when he is coming,"" Hadi said. In Washington, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen said the chaos in Yemen has been a source of concern to the United States for years. ""Al Qaeda, the federated group that's in Yemen, is an incredibly dangerous group that has taken full advantage of the chaos that has been in that country,"" he told the National Press Club. But, he added, the military cannot provide the whole answer. ""The security piece is a necessary condition, but it is insufficient in and of itself and it's taken us a long time to figure that out.""","NEW: ""There's not a military answer anywhere,"" says Adm. Mullen .

"(CNN) -- Two Americans who spent months imprisoned in North Korea are back on U.S. soil, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered their release. They were freed following a rare visit to the secretive East Asian nation by a top U.S. official, who brought with him a letter from U.S. President Barack Obama. A plane carrying Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, the last two American citizens known to be held by North Korea, landed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state late Saturday. The two men got off the U.S. government plane -- Bae first, then Miller -- and walked into the welcoming arms of smiling relatives who were waiting on the tarmac. ""I just want to say thank you all for supporting me and standing by me during this time,"" Bae said in brief comments to the media at the base. He thanked Obama and the State Department for securing his release -- and he also had words of gratitude for the country that held him prisoner for two years. ""I'd like to thank the DPRK North Korean government, as well -- allowing me to come home and be united with our family,"" he said, using an abbreviation for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Asked about concerns about his health during his imprisonment, Bae, 46, said he was ""recovering."" He and Miller were released after James Clapper, U.S. director of national intelligence, went to Pyongyang as an envoy of Obama, a senior State Department official told CNN. Their release comes less than a month after North Korea freed Jeffrey Fowle, an Ohio man who spent five months in detention. North Korean authorities took Fowle into custody after he left a Bible at a club in the northern part of the country. Letter from Obama . Clapper delivered a letter from Obama, addressed to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, describing Clapper as ""his personal envoy"" to bring the Americans home, a senior administration official told CNN on Saturday. The letter was ""short and to the point,"" the official said. Clapper did not meet with Kim. Clapper had no guarantee he would succeed in bringing the Americans home, a senior State Department official told CNN. The North Korean government issued a statement about the release, saying it received an ""earnest apology"" from Obama for the men's actions. It also said the two were ""sincerely repentant of their crimes and (were) behaving themselves while serving their terms."" According to the statement, the first chairman of North Korea's National Defense Commission ordered the release. The title is one of several top positions that Kim holds in the North Koran hierarchy. Bae, a Christian missionary who ran a company specializing in tours of North Korea, was accused by Pyongyang of plotting to bring down the government through religious activities. He was detained in late 2012, and in April 2013 was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. On his return to America on Saturday, he thanked the ""thousands of people"" he said had prayed for him. ""Thank you all for supporting me, lifting me up and not forgetting me,"" said Bae, a resident of Lynwood, Washington. U.S.: No 'quid pro quo' China assisted in the monthslong process of arranging the release, the State Department official said. Clapper's visit came after North Korea contacted the U.S. government unexpectedly and urged the administration to send a Cabinet-level official to North Korea's capital to discuss the detained Americans, according to two sources close to the matter. A U.S. official told CNN that Washington believes Pyongyang reached out to show it had the clout to get a Cabinet-level official to visit and because doing so would help solidify Kim's power. The request came about two weeks ago, the official said. Clapper is not a member of Obama's Cabinet, but he is the U.S. spy chief. He canceled an event in New York on Wednesday as the trip was being arranged, an Obama administration official said. He went to Pyongyang ""prepared to listen"" on other issues, but his sole focus was to bring Bae and Miller home, according to the same official. An official in Clapper's office said the talks didn't touch on North Korea's controversial nuclear program. And other U.S. officials said there was no ""quid pro quo"" for the men's release. Obama expressed appreciation for Clapper's efforts ""on what was obviously a challenging mission"" and happiness that Bae and Miller would soon be home. ""It's a wonderful day for them and their families,"" the President said. 'Hard to believe this day is finally here' Bae's sister, Terri Chung, who has long campaigned for his release, said that it was ""hard to believe this day is finally here."" Although Bae is happy to be home, she said he had told her that his ""heart aches for the people of North Korea."" ""We know that there are many people in North Korea locked up like Kenneth was, and they remain apart from their families tonight,"" she said as she stood beside her brother. ""Please do not forget them."" On Sunday, she spoke to reporters outside her church in Seattle, Washington. ""First and foremost we thank God,"" she said. ""Kenneth has been in God's care all this time, and we are thankful that he brought him home."" She said her brother is in good spirits and doing ""remarkably well."" He bears no ill will to the people of North Korea. ""He only has the best wishes and intentions for that country, still,"" Chung said. Earlier, the family released a statement that read, in part: ""We have been waiting for and praying for this day for two years. This ordeal has been excruciating for the family, but we are filled with joy right now."" Miller family stays quiet . There was no public comment from Miller's family Saturday, and he didn't speak to reporters after he got off the plane in Washington state. His family, from Bakersfield, California, had shied away from the media throughout his detention. Miller, 25, was taken into custody in April of this year, with North Korean authorities accusing him of tearing up his tourist visa and seeking asylum upon entry. A North Korean court in September convicted him of committing ""acts hostile"" to North Korea and sentenced him to six years of hard labor. The country's state-run media described him as ""rudely behaved,"" saying he was sent to infiltrate a prison as part of a United States campaign against North Korea. Former North Korean captive and U.S. journalist Laura Ling said Sunday in a statement that she was ""overjoyed"" to learn the two men had been released. ""I hope their release is a signal of a potential opening between our two countries and that despite our stark differences we may find a common humanity,"" she said. 'He's not a spy,' Bae's sister says after conviction .

"(CNN) -- Imagine that the chair you're sitting on became a sofa on demand as the day moved from light to dark. Or if all your furnishings could move out of your way as you walk through a room. These thoughts could one day become reality through research being conducted at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). The EPFL biorobotics lab is developing self-configurable robotics known as ""Roombots,"" which can merge with materials and furnishings to create adaptable furniture for the home and office. ""It's a bit of a science-fiction project in my lab to create intelligent furniture which can change shape and functionality,"" explains lab director Auke Ijspeert. ""We envisage the Roombots moving and combining to create a diversity of elements including tables and chairs."" The goal is to create furniture that can be re-used in multiple ways. Read this: Electronic noses sniff out cancer . Designs would consist of Roombot modules -- which resemble two dice stuck together, and contain a battery, three motors for movements and pivoting, and a wireless connection. Each module is just 22cm long and the team imagine just 10 of them could combine to build a broad range of furniture. ""The Roombots would be coupled with more passive materials such as a table top or cushion to create the end results,"" says Ijspeert. However, the team's immediate goals are to create mobile furniture to assist the elderly and those with reduced mobility. ""Let's say an elderly person is using a walker, the furniture could have modules attached for it to move out of the way in a cluttered apartment or have a stool follow the person and remain close by,"" describes Ijspeert. For now, the team have managed to enable a few modules to interact, coordinated by algorithms on a PC, but they plan to improve human-robot interactions by either embedding cameras to track where users are or using voice recognition for people to instruct their furniture. Further hopes lie in using tablets to display a room virtually, with people using augmented reality to then move and place furnishings as they desire. ""Eventually we want less and less human interaction to have a more fluid transition of furniture,"" says Ijspeert. Designs aren't limited to the home and could be applied to the workplace to create high-end conference rooms that reconfigure according to functionality, and eventually anywhere, with people creating their own uses for the building blocks. ""What I really hope is to provide Lego blocks for people to find their own use such as artists or designers,"" says Ijspeert. Read this: Electronic noses sniff out cancer .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from clashes between Yemeni security forces and protesters rose to 13, an activist said. The clashes occurred in the cities of Sanaa and Taiz on Wednesday, said Ibrahim Mothana, an activist who said he spoke to doctors. The death toll could rise as he was trying to get reports on victims in at least three other hospitals, Mothana said. CNN could not independently verify his report. Witnesses said Yemeni security forces used live ammunition fired on protesters in Sanaa and Taiz on Wednesday. Doctors and witnesses in the cities told CNN that 169 more people had been injured, some critically. ""Security forces are aiming for a massacre in Sanaa,"" said Abdul Wahab Anesi, a medical staff spokesman at a field hospital set up in Change Square. Before Republican Guards began firing at protesters in the square, they reportedly clashed with military personnel who had been protecting demonstrators gathered there. Journalists, medical sources and other witnesses told CNN that these soldiers defected two months ago along with Maj. Gen. Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar, who withdrew his support from President Ali Abdullah Saleh in late March. At the time, he promised to protect civilians demonstrating against the president. In addition to the casualties in the capital, three people were killed and four were reported critically injured in Taiz. ""The attack took place while we were chanting, 'One more week left for you, Saleh,'"" said Sabir Ali, a protester in Taiz. The protesters were giving Saleh a week to step down, saying if he does not, they will make good on a vow to march to the presidential palace. Earlier, a senior security official denied that forces fired on protesters in Taiz.","Death toll could rise even higher, an activist says .

"(CNN) -- Five people, including a married couple, have been arrested in Europe on suspicion of terrorist activities, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official with knowledge of the case told CNN Sunday. Belgian, Dutch and Turkish police launched a joint monthslong investigation that included extensive surveillance of a suspected terrorist cell with ties to jihadist groups in Syria, the official said. ""Their links to groups in Syria have been complex to untangle, but point towards ISIS,"" the official told CNN. The couple -- Dutch nationals of Turkish origin -- were arrested August 6 at Brussels Airport on their way back from a two to three day trip to Istanbul. A third suspect was arrested in Belgium. A fourth suspect was arrested in the Netherlands and a fifth was arrested in Turkey. Several of the alleged members of the cell, who traveled frequently between Belgium and the Netherlands, were of Turkish descent, the official said. All five remain in custody. Authorities moved quickly to make the arrests after police learned the alleged cell had gotten handguns. The weapons were recovered in a raid on one of the suspects' Brussels residence on August 6. In the Netherlands, electronic media was seized during a raid in The Hague, including terrorist propaganda materials, the official said. ""It was obviously worrying when we discovered they'd obtained weapons,"" the official told CNN. ""We were concerned they might be planning an attack here [in Belgium], but we still don't know what if, anything, they were planning."" The official said there was no evidence he knew of that the suspects were planning to attack the European Commission in Brussels, as some media reports in Europe have speculated. Belgian security services have become increasingly worried about the threat from fighters returning from terrorist safe havens in Syria and Iraq. In May, Mehdi Nemmouche, a French ISIS fighter, allegedly killed four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels. Nemmouche, who allegedly guarded French hostages while he was in Syria, was arrested in France after the shooting and extradited to Belgium to stand trial. European officials believe about 2,000 EU citizens have answered the call to jihad in Syria, including the wives of fighters. Perhaps 500 to 1,000 of them have joined ISIS, officials say. In June, a Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN that authorities were aware of 150 Belgian fighters in Syria, most of them with ISIS. Up to 15 more were leaving every month. About 35 are thought to have been killed, and 60 to 70 had returned home. Round-the-clock surveillance is impossible for all but a very small number because of the prohibitive expense.","A married couple -- Dutch nationals of Turkish origin -- are arrested at Brussels Airport, official said .

"(CNN) -- She has played football at the highest level for her country, and has returned to the top of her game after a career lull, but Park Eun-seon is suffering ""humiliating"" scrutiny of the most personal kind. In a controversy that echoes the ordeal of South African runner Caster Semenya, the 27-year-old is facing accusations about her gender. At 1.80 meters tall and weighing 74 kg, Park was top scorer in the South Korean women's league last season with 19 goals and she led Seoul City Hall Amazones to second place in the table. However, six rival teams have threatened a boycott if Park, who went to the 2004 Olympics, continues to play. Her club manager Seo Jung-ho has leaped to her defense and was quoted in the local media saying it was a ""conspiracy"" because she had shown remarkably improved form after a slump. Park took to social media to give her side of the story. ""My heart aches and it is humiliating,"" she wrote on her Facebook page, according to local media. ""I've been through gender tests many times and competed in the World Cup and the Olympics. ""I know these people are trying to destroy me ... In the past, I would have thrown my hands up and left, but I've worked so hard to get to this point, and I will not give up so easily."" There was also a robust response from lawmakers at the government-run Seoul City Sports Council on Thursday. In a statement released to CNN, the sports council said the actions of the rival clubs were an infringement on her human rights and it demanded an official apology. ""Park's gender was tested by Korean Football Association in 2004 when she was selected to national team for Athens Olympics,"" it said. ""The demand from coaches from six different clubs to test the gender of Park again is double jeopardy. ""This is betraying the fundamental human rights of a player which should be protected at all means."" Like in the case of track and field star Semenya, the controversy has become a major talking point in South Korea, with high-profile politicians getting involved. The mayor of the capital Seoul, Park Won-soon, tweeted: ""As the father of a daughter, I will do my best to protect Park Eun-seon's human rights,"" local media reported. Back in 2009, Semenya came under international spotlight after dominating the women's 800 meters at the world championships. She was forced to undergo a gender test and was only cleared to return to competition the following year. Winning strong support in South Africa, Semenya carried her country's flag at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics and went on to win a silver medal.","South Korean female footballer caught up in gender row .

"(CNN) -- Penn State University revealed a record number of forcible sex offense reports for the 2012 calendar year, more than half of which it said had occurred years earlier, some as far back as the 1970s. As a result, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights announced last week it is launching an independent civil rights enforcement investigation of Penn State to determine whether the university ""has responded immediately and appropriately"" to complaints of sexual offenses. The investigation will also determine whether the university is in compliance with federal law in its handling of allegations of sexual violence committed by students or staff, with a particular emphasis on complaints of sexual assault, according to a letter sent to the university's president Thursday. The annual campus security report from Penn State listed 56 forcible sex offenses on its main campus in 2012, which is more than double the number of sex offenses reported for the previous year and 14 times the number reported in 2010. Victim 9 in Sandusky case sues Penn State . Under Title IX, a school must ensure that students are not denied or limited in the ability to participate in or benefit from its educational programs or activities on the basis of sex. Penn State, like other postsecondary institutions, must collect and disclose information about certain crimes on and near its campuses under the Clery Act, and compliance is monitored by the Department of Education, according to a statement on the investigation from Jim Bradshaw, spokesman for the department. ""Our initial review of Penn State's sexual harassment policy, compounded by a dramatic increase in the number of forcible sex offenses occurring on campus as reported by the university itself, raised legal concerns that compelled us to investigate,"" Catherine Lhamon, the assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement on the investigation. But the Penn State report also noted that 36 of the total 63 sex offenses -- some of which occurred off campus -- in 2012 actually occurred earlier, from the 1970s through 2011. Some of the listed offenses can also be attributed to the crimes of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted of sexually abusing young boys in 2012, according to the university's Clery Act compliance manager, Gabe Gates. In a news release, Gates also stated the overall increase might be due in part to the additional Clery Act training that's been provided for 5,000 individuals at Penn State over the last year. This training may have led to greater awareness of how to report these crimes and what resources are available to victims and witnesses, Gates said. Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers told CNN the university ""is looking forward to working with the Office for Civil Rights on this proactive compliance review in order to further the purposes of Title IX, promote and protect the safety of the Penn State community and strengthen Penn State as an institution."" In an op-ed published over the weekend, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan discussed the unprecedented national effort to address the alarming rate of sexual assault on college campuses. According to Duncan, colleges and universities reported more than 4,800 forcible sex offenses to the federal government in 2012, which is 50% higher than the number of reports in 2009. One in five female students report they suffered an attempted or completed sexual assault at college, along with 6% of male students, Duncan wrote in the article. ""No parent should ever fear for a child's safety when he or she departs for college. But the painful truth is that sexual violence is far too prevalent today on campus,"" Duncan wrote.

"(CNN) -- Holders Manchester United remain on course to become the first side to retain the Champions League, as two goals in the first 11 minutes saw them defeat Arsenal 3-1 for a 4-1 aggregate victory and a place in the final against either Chelsea or Barcelona in Rome. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring United's second goal as they reached the Champions League final. A carnival atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium saw the home fans optimistic that last week's 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford could be overturned, but those hopes were cruelly dashed as two individual mistakes allowed United to take a foothold in the game -- a position they never looked likely to relinquish. Arsenal went into the match unbeaten in their last 27 home matches in Europe, since Chelsea defeated them 2-1 at Highbury in 2004, and had yet to taste European defeat at the Emirates, but that proud record always looked in doubt from the moment United took an eighth-minute lead. Cristiano Ronaldo played a dangerous ball from the left into the Arsenal penalty area and young Gunners left-back Kieran Gibbs, who has deputized superbly for French international Gael Clichy in recent weeks, lost his footing -- allowing Ji-Sung Park to collect the ball and fire past goalkeeper Manuel Almunia. The goal, the first Arsenal had conceded at home in Europe this season, justified manager Alex Ferguson's decision to select Park ahead of Carlos Tevez in the only change to the United side from last week's victory at Old Trafford. Park's strike meant Arsenal now had to score three to reach the final, but their task was made even harder just three minutes later when Ronaldo's 40-yard free-kick deceived Almunia, who had kept Arsenal in contention in the first leg with a string of fine saves. Despite the ferocity and brilliance of Ronaldo's long-range strike, Almunia appeared to misjudge the flight of the ball as it nestled into the left-hand corner of the net. The second goal effectively killed off the contest, with 79 minutes remaining, and Arsenal were fortunate not to go three goals down on the night in the 17th minute when Almunia dived full-stretch to tip Wayne Rooney's superb curling effort around the post. The half-time interval gave Arsenal some respite, but United looked far from finished as an attacking threat and could have extended their lead six minutes after the break when Ronaldo twisted and turned the Arsenal defense before firing a fierce shot that Almunia did well to turn around the post. Arsenal pressed forward in search of a goal that would have given them some hope, but left themselves open to a United counter-attack and in the 61st minute the visitors added a devastating third. An Arsenal corner was cleared and the ball found its way to the marauding Park, who found Rooney on the left. The England striker looked up before picking out Ronaldo who had burst into the box, and the Portuguese winger clinically despatched his finish into the top corner of the Arsenal net. With the match over as a contest, Arsenal were now just playing for pride. Robin Van Persie's long-range shot stung the hands of fellow-Dutchman Edwin van der Sar in the United goal, while substitute Nicklas Bentdner fired into the side-netting after a promising run. However, There was a late sting in the tail for United when midfielder Darren Fletcher tackled Cesc Fabregas in the penalty area. The Scotsman appeared to take the ball but Italian referee Roberto Rosetti stunned United by pointing to the penalty spot before sending off Fletcher, meaning he will now miss the final. Van Persie stepped up to convert the penalty, but it was scant consolation for a well-beaten Arsenal side, as United moved to within 90 minutes of winning a fourth European Cup and a possible showdown against Premier League rivals Chelsea in a repeat of last year's epic final in the Moscow rain. ""We got the lucky break by scoring the first goal,"" a delighted Ferguson told ITV Sport. ""However, after that, I though our performance was terrific. ""It's just such a shame that Darren Fletcher will miss the final. He clearly took the ball and Mr Rosetti is one of the best referees in Europe, but he got that one wrong and unfortunately there is no appeal procedure."" Talking about the final, Ferguson added: ""Barcelona's display against Real Madrid on Saturday had me drooling with admiration, but Barca have defensive problems and I just think Chelsea might be too strong for them on the night.""","Manchester United reach the Champions final in Rome after defeating Arsenal .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Who is Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man whose toddler son died after being left in a hot car? Depends on whom you ask. Prosecutors portray him as an unfaithful husband who wanted a childless life, while the defense describes him as a doting dad who kissed his son every time he put him in the car. And friends say he loved to show off the blond, bright-eyed boy and talked about him incessantly. At a probable cause hearing Thursday, authorities provided more insight about Harris, who is charged with felony murder and second-degree child cruelty in last month's death of 22-month-old Cooper Harris. He has pleaded not guilty. A judge denied bond for Harris on Thursday, ruling that prosecutors have enough evidence to move forward in their case. Here's some details about Harris that emerged at this week's hearing and in court documents: . Harris allegedly sexted the day his son died . While at work June 18, Harris messaged six women, according to Cobb County police Detective Phillip Stoddard, the prosecution's lead investigator. He allegedly exchanged explicit photos, including one of an erect penis that he sent to an underage woman. Defense: He's deaf in his right ear . The defense brought up this point several times, perhaps to justify why Harris did not hear his son's movement in the car. ""I always have to go to the other side of his head to talk to him,"" his friend, Winston Milling, testified. Friends speak highly of him . Penny Harrison, a pastor at Harris' church, said she has known him and his wife, Leanna, for two years. ""I knew him to be at typical, loving father of a toddler,"" Harrison said when the defense called her to the witness stand. Milling, who had lunch with Harris on the day his son died, said everything appeared normal. ""He loved showing Cooper off to everybody. He liked picking him up, bringing him around. He was always happy. Cooper was always smiling,"" Milling said. James Alex Hall went to college with Harris and also had lunch with him on the day his son died. When asked how Harris was acting, he said nothing seemed out of place. ""I'd say normal as you can be,"" he said. ""Nothing stuck out, nothing was weird."" He had movie plans that day . The day his son died, Harris was planning to see ""22 Jump Street"" with friends after work, according to Stoddard. Detective: He swore at police officers at the scene . Harris never called 911 and said ""f*** you"" to a police officer on the scene who asked him to get off his phone, the detective said. Stoddard said that Harris told police he couldn't reach anyone on his telephone, but phone records show he made three calls after he discovered his son's body, and one between him and his employer lasted six minutes. Defense believes he was forgetful . Defense attorney Maddox Kilgore said it's not unusual for people to forget children in cars. ""It's easy to get distracted when you get behind the wheel. Everyone's done it. His mind is already skipping ahead to the rest of the day,"" Kilgore said. ""The results of that forgetting ... were absolutely catastrophic,"" he said. ""But an accident doesn't become a crime because the results were catastrophic."" Investigator: Couple had financial, intimacy issues . Harris and his wife had $2,000 and $25,000 life insurance policies on their son, according to the investigator. He also said Harris' wife ""was complaining about (her husband's) sporadic purchasing or overcharging credit cards."" Harris' wife told police the pair were having intimacy issues, according to Stoddard. Texts indicate that she knew he was cheating on her, he said. In warrants obtained by CNN on Friday, police said Harris discussed with family members the procedure for cashing a life insurance policy, but there is no other information or time element. ""Through the investigation Harris has made comments to family members regarding a life insurance policy that he has on Cooper and what they need to do in order to file for it,"" the warrants say. His Internet searches are a focus of case . Harris accessed sites about ""people who die,"" which showed videos of suicides, executions, war, etc., police said. He also visited a site on life without a child and did searches on surviving prison and on ""age of consent for Georgia,"" they said. ""We've only scratched the surface,"" Stoddard said of the searches. His activities on day of son's death questioned . The day Cooper died, the father and son stopped at Chick-fil-A for breakfast before he drove the 0.6 miles to work. The breakfast was not out of the ordinary for them. ""Justin stated that this happens two or three times a month. It's daddy-son time, a special occasion to them,"" Stoddard said. When he arrived at work, surveillance footage shows Harris backed up his car, according to Stoddard. He said Harris didn't have a backup camera and would have had to turn around or use his rearview and side mirrors. Investigators used a mannequin in the car seat and found the boy's head would have been visible over the top of the car seat. Harris told police he was supposed to drive his son to day care June 18 but went to work without realizing Cooper was in a car seat in the back. When Stoddard told him they were charging him, Harris allegedly responded by saying, ""But there's no malicious intent."" Detective: His statements were 'all about him' Harris became emotional when his wife arrived at the police station, according to the prosecution. ""It was all about him: 'I can't believe this is happening to me. Why am I being punished for this?' It was all very one-sided,"" Stoddard said. ""He talked about losing his job. ... 'What are we going to do? I'll be charged with a felony.' "" Leanna Harris later asked her husband, ""Did you say too much?"" he said. He has worked for Home Depot for two years . Harris, 33, a Web developer, has worked at Home Depot for two years, according to the Atlanta-based home improvement company. Home Depot placed him on unpaid leave after the charges were filed. Stoddard said Harris would take Cooper to day care in the mornings. The couple would split picking the boy up in the afternoons. When Leanna Harris went to pick up Cooper from day care that day, the center told her he was never dropped off. On her way out, she told witnesses: ""Ross must have left him in the car. ... There's no other explanation. Ross must have left him in the car,"" Stoddard said. He once lived in Alabama . Harris worked at the University of Alabama as a parking monitor and later as a mail delivery clerk between 2001 and 2006, the university said. Afterward, he was a police dispatcher in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, until 2009, according to Tuscaloosa police spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley. The department only confirmed his tenure, not details on his work history. Three years later, Harris graduated from the University of Alabama with a bachelor's degree in commerce and business administration. From there, he went to Home Depot. HLN contributed to this report.","Justin Ross Harris says he forgot his son was in the car on June 18 .

"(CNN) -- Instead of criticizing President Barack Obama's lack of an effective national security policy as the terrorist threat of ISIS grows in Syria and Iraq, it might be helpful to imagine the speech President Ronald Reagan would have given in response to the videotaped beheading of James Foley. There are many things a great power can do if it has leadership. This fictional speech is an effort to describe a Reagan-like grand strategy, clarity of moral purpose and emphasis on effective actions. This is not a speech President Reagan could have delivered in the 1980s. We set his speech at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, near the Reagan Ranch where he would be vacationing. This was also the site of his address to the nation after the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983 with a U.S. congressman aboard. President Reagan entered office when the Soviet Union was the great threat. He saw Moscow as the center of evil in the world. He was determined to defeat and not merely contain the Soviet Union. Through moral persuasion, a powerful military buildup, a grand anti-communist coalition, and an intense focus on a series of economic, diplomatic and psychological strategies, Reagan defeated the Soviet empire and it disappeared. This was one of the most extraordinary grand strategic achievements in history. It took enormous discipline and focus. In that era, terrorism was always a secondary or even tertiary issue. President Reagan sought to contain and minimize terrorism with minimum diversion of attention, energy and resources from the great campaign to defeat the Soviet empire. So, this speech is designed to illustrate an alternate U.S. approach and strategy toward this threat if Reagan were president in today's very different world. ------ . Text of Reagan address . My fellow Americans: . We have all been saddened and outraged by the vicious videotape of ISIS terrorists beheading an American journalist. Our hearts go out to James Foley's family. However, anger and sympathy are not solutions. We, the American people, must come together in a righteous determination to defend freedom and civilization from barbarism, savagery and terrorism. We must calmly, methodically and with the same grim determination we brought to winning World War II, implement strategies that eliminate the growing worldwide threat of radical Islamists prepared to kill us as individuals and our values as a civilization. Some will suggest this exaggerates the threat from the Islamic State. Let me remind them of some hard facts. There are now an estimated 12,000 terrorists from over 50 countries in the ISIS-controlled parts of Iraq and Syria. Great Britain estimates more than 500 British citizens have joined ISIS. Our government estimates roughly 100 Americans are now engaged in enemy activities. When we remember the death and destruction 19 terrorists achieved on 9/11, we have to take very seriously the threat from more than 12,000 terrorists. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, has warned that ISIS ""has an apocalyptic end of days strategic vision that will eventually have to be defeated."" He has expanded on the danger, saying their vision of a fundamentalist caliphate could ""fundamentally alter the face of the Middle East and create a security environment that would certainly threaten us in many ways."" Furthermore, Gen. Dempsey has warned that ISIS cannot be defeated only in Iraq. He asserted, ""Can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in Syria? The answer is no."" In fact the very existence of terrorists from over 50 countries means that we must be thinking in terms of a global campaign to eradicate the virus of Islamic Extremism and the spirit of terrorism and barbarism that it is fostering. This is fully as grave a threat to our survival as was Nazism or communism. With appropriate strategies and consistent policies executed energetically we can defeat and eliminate the Islamic State and its various allied factions. ISIS and its worldwide terrorist allies have become the focus of evil in the modern world. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel warned that we must take the Islamic State seriously when he said, ""They are tremendously well funded. This is beyond anything we have seen. ...They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess."" They must be defeated. Yet defeating terrorists and blackmailers is nothing new in American history. In the very first years of the new American Republic, then-Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson sent Thomas Barclay, American consul to Morocco, on May 13, 1791, a letter of instructions for a new treaty with Morocco that noted it is ""lastly our determination to prefer war in all cases to tribute under any form, and to any people whatever."" Jefferson hated war and loved peace. He also understood that there were times when vicious opponents give peace-loving people no choice but to engage in just war. As president, he sent the Navy and the Marine Corps in 1801 to the shores of Tripoli to reject blackmail, defeat piracy and establish that even a young America could project power in defense of principle and its citizens. We were saddened but not surprised by the vicious, barbaric video of the killing of James Foley. Back in January we noted that ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, gave a speech in which he warned America, ""Soon we'll be in direct confrontation, so watch out for us, for we are with you, watching."" They have promised to raise their black flag over the White House. Because I take very seriously the security of the United States and believe that my highest obligation as president is to protect America, I responded to this direct challenge with a series of quiet steps. We moved intelligence assets and began monitoring potential ISIS targets throughout Iraq and Syria. We began re-establishing ties with both the Sunni tribes in Western Iraq and the Kurdish allies with whom America has worked for decades. We created an anti-ISIS intelligence network working with Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. We informed the weak, chaotic government in Baghdad that defeating ISIS is our highest priority and we will arm, train and coordinate with them and with any effective group prepared to help defeat ISIS. We moved strategic assets including B-1 and B-2 bombers into position to be prepared to respond decisively to any ISIS outrage. In response to the deliberately vicious and barbaric killing of James Foley, we began hitting ISIS targets in both Syria and Iraq. In the last hour over 200 targets have been hit. The air campaign in coordination with Kurdish, Sunni Arab and Iraqi ground forces will continue until ISIS disintegrates and is incapable of holding territory. The 12,000 terrorists from over 50 countries should understand that they can surrender or we will hunt them down. Terrorists who videotape beheadings operate outside the rule of law and in the tradition of eliminating piracy they will be dealt with as outlaws. We will coordinate with Great Britain, Egypt, Jordan and every willing partner to develop a strategy and a set of operating principles for the destruction of extremist terrorism. When Congress returns, I will work directly with its leaders in a bipartisan effort to establish rules for protecting America and defeating this growing cancer of barbarism. With the bipartisan help of Congress and our allies, we will pursue our campaign to destroy ISIS with the four principles I outlined immediately after Beirut. We will have a clear plan to win. We will develop overwhelming forces among the combined civilized world. We will report to you regularly and work every day to keep the support of the American people for the campaign to destroy terrorism. We will define clearly who the enemy is and they will have no sanctuaries. In confronting an evil that seeks to kill us and destroy our civilization, our goal must be complete and decisive victory. The Foley family needs your prayers in this difficult time. America and the forces of freedom need your prayers in this daunting campaign. Together, civilization will prevail and barbarism will return to the dustbin of history. Thank you and good night.

"(CNN) -- Academic papers tend to be dull, but I just read one that disturbed me. ""A Veterinary and Behavioral Analysis of Dolphin Killing Methods Currently Used in the 'Drive Hunt' in Taiji, Japan,"" was published last year in the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science. And as we'll see below, the ""new"" method of killing dolphins (intended to be an improvement on the old method) creates such terror and pain that it would be illegal to kill cows in this manner under Japanese law itself. The paper is viewable free online, but it's not for the faint-hearted. A little background: Each year, people kill about 22,000 dolphins and porpoises in Japan's waters. In a town called Taiji, every year they catch and kill several hundred bottlenose, striped, and Risso's dolphins, Dall's porpoises and pilot whales. (The Arctic's Faroe Islands also stages an annual pilot whale drive-slaughter for food, which has the side effect of providing the residents with high doses of mercury.) Taiji got famous in the nervy Academy Award-winning film, ""The Cove."" The hunting season continues through March, activists have said. Caroline Kennedy, the new U.S. ambassador to Japan, is among those critical of the hunt; she tweeted: ""Deeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing."" Japanese officials have defended the hunt as legal and traditional. For some reason -- likely public relations -- officials in 2010 announced a ""new killing method."" Until recently, hunters speared and stabbed the dolphins to death after driving them onto the shoreline. The new method is supposed to reduce time-to-death. As such, it's bogus. On paper, the new method involves destroying the spinal cord with repeated insertion of a metal rod. Even on paper, the ""new killing method"" makes no attempt to damage the brain, which would at least end consciousness. In practice, the hunters splash around through the bloody water wielding their knives among the fully conscious, thrashing, squealing dolphins who have been trapped in the shallows and are being executed among their family and friends. Meanwhile, the humans have a very hard time getting into the spine. Several veterinarians and behavioral scientists who watched a covertly recorded video wrote, ""This killing method . ... would not be tolerated or permitted in any regulated slaughterhouse process in the developed world."" That includes Japan, oddly enough. Japanese prime minister responds to dolphin controversy . Japan's own slaughter guidelines for livestock require that the creature being killed must be made to lose consciousness and must be killed by methods ""proven to minimize, as much as possible, any agony to the animal."" These guidelines define ""agony"" as pain, suffering, fear, anxiety or depression. But those livestock guidelines do not apply to whale and dolphin killing, which is governed by Japan's Fisheries Agency, which treats dolphins and whales as nothing more than seafood with blowholes. The published Japanese description promotes this ""new"" method by saying it, ""results in a shorter harvest time, and is thought to improve worker safety."" (Faroe Islanders use a similar killing procedure.) After the Japanese drivers scare the dolphins into the shallows, they corral them and tie them together in bunches by their tails, hitch them to small boats, and drag them backward to where they'll kill them. While being dragged, the dolphins have a hard time getting their heads above water to breathe, and some drown. The killer is supposed to destroy the dolphin's spinal nerve by pushing a metal rod into the spine behind its head. But the nerve is encased in the spinal bones. Veterinarians and behaviorists who viewed a video noted that the first shove did not penetrate the spinal bone. They describe, ""the animal making vigorous movements during the insertion of the rod."" The man ""redirects the rod and repeatedly pushes it into the animal."" At this time, ""the rod makes first contact with the vertebral bones of the cervical (neck) vertebrae. The rod clearly requires very significant force to push further into the tissues at this time."" The hunter eventually withdraws the rod and inserts a wooden peg into the wound to prevent bleeding. This is part of the new method. Why prevent bleeding of a creature you are trying to kill? Because -- I'll quote the Japanese description so you don't think I'm making this up -- this ""prevents pollution of the sea with blood."" Slaughterhouse-killing rules for livestock such as cattle require ""rapid bleed out."" But when killing a dolphin, the workers create a massive spinal wound, then plug it to prevent the bleeding that would at least speed loss of consciousness to the dolphin, whose sensing brain remains undamaged. From this point, just to make a long and appallingly hideous story a little shorter for the sake of our comfort, the dolphin in the video who is benefiting from the new and improved killing method spends the next three and a half minutes thrashing, nodding its head rapidly, and opening and closing its mouth. The men around it ignore it; they're busy doing the same thing to other dolphins. The entire process lasts many hours, sometimes days. With some understatement, the veterinarians and behavior experts describing the video write, ""the treatment of dolphins in the drive hunts sharply contradict current animal welfare standards employed in most modern and technologically advanced societies ... The systematic mistreatment of dolphins and whales, allowed and sanctioned by a highly developed country such as Japan, is in striking contrast to European Union, United States, and even existing Japanese [livestock] legislation."" They note that in 2006 Japan instituted an unofficial ban on invasive chimpanzee research. They conclude by saying that there is, ""no logical reason to accept a killing method that is clearly not carried out in accordance with fundamental and globally adopted principles on the commercial utilization, care, and treatment of animals."" Dolphin killers have their reasons. They say it is ""pest control,"" claiming -- as if in self-defense -- that dolphins eat too many fish; and they do it for meat to sell, and to sell live young dolphins to marine parks and swim-with-the-dolphin programs in Japan and other countries. In a word, the usual reason: money. Not tradition. Most people in Japan don't benefit, and no one would go hungry without dolphin and whale meat; in fact most people don't eat any. But, officially, Japan reacts strongly to such assaults on its tradition and culture. Assaults, bear in mind, that come mainly in the form of trying to simply film or describe what is really happening, then politely asking them to stop it. For such a thoroughly self-westernized country as Japan, with its baseball, jazz, tobacco, subways, global business and automakers, to object to criticism of its ""culture"" is odd. To publicly stake a seemingly large proportion of their nation's cultural identity on slaughtering dolphins and whales while westernizing in almost every way seems, to me, strange. And, mainly, cruel. Let it end, for good.

"(CNN) -- This week, just over 250 days since the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan and inclusive bill to extend the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives allowed the clock to run out on protections that bill would have provided to millions of women across our country. It was an inexcusable failure by House Republican leaders and one that will have real-life implications for women who now find themselves with nowhere to turn for help. It was also another reminder, coming on the same day that House Republican leaders refused to pass aid to states ravaged by Superstorm Sandy, that these leaders continue to answer to the most radical elements of their party regardless of who or what is at stake. Since it was passed into law in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has provided life-saving assistance to millions of women and families across the nation. For battered women, the law has provided critical law enforcement protections and often a way out from a life of abuse. One reason the law has worked so well in protecting a broad group of women is that since its initial passage, every time Congress has reauthorized the bill, we have done so in a bipartisan way that extends the legislation's many protections to new groups of women. News: Backers hope to revive Violence Against Women Act . That was once again the case when the Senate took up the bill in 2012. We listened to advocates, law enforcement officers, clergy members and -- most importantly -- from the survivors themselves to find out what needed to be done to improve VAWA. And in April the Senate passed a VAWA reauthorization by a vote of 68 to 31, a rare bipartisan feat that included the support of 15 Republicans. Included in that bill were new protections granted to women who had been left out of previous versions of the bill. Specifically, the bill included increased protections for women on college campuses across the nation following the brutal 2010 murder of Yeardley Love at the University of Virginia. It included new law enforcement measures to safeguard women on tribal reservations, one in three of whom will be raped in their lifetimes. It included nondiscrimination language for those in the LGBT community who had been unfairly left out of previous bills. And it provided protections to immigrant women, regardless of their status, who are often scared into silence at the hands of their abusers. Opinion: Don't gut Violence Against Women Act . But for the leadership in the House of Representatives, passing a bill with life-saving protections to these new communities of women was simply not politically acceptable. So just weeks after the Senate passed our bill, in a purely ideological move, House Republicans passed a bill that specifically stripped the new protections for immigrants, the LGBT community and tribal women, and even removed protections that exist under current law. For me and for many of my women colleagues, as well as for mothers, sisters and daughters everywhere, the House Republican's decision to pointedly discriminate against these groups of women was stunning. Surely, we should all be able to agree that where a person lives, their immigration status or who they love should not determine whether or not perpetrators of domestic violence toward them are brought to justice. Surely no police officer should ever have to ask the sexual orientation or immigration status of a woman who lies bruised and battered at the scene of a crime. Yet, the House bill drew those lines. Debate over act centers on the vulnerable . So, over the course of the past nine months, I have joined with domestic violence advocates, fellow legislators and countless victims to call on House leaders to end the discrimination against these populations of women. On the Senate floor we have told the painful stories these women have shared of being scared for their own lives. In television appearances, these brave women have plead for the protections so many other women across the country enjoy. And most recently, every Democratic woman in the Senate wrote to the Republican women of the House of Representatives to appeal for their help in passing our bill. Opinion: Sadly, some don't see it as rape . Thankfully, in response to these many calls, one by one we heard from moderate Republican voices in the House who believed they should take up and pass the Senate bill. These members of Congress made clear that if House leadership would only bring up the bill for a vote it would pass the House and be sent to the president to become law. Yet, throughout the final weeks, days and hours of the last Congress, House Speaker John Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor refused to budge. Ignoring voices in their own party and the clear message sent by American women in the last election, they instead decided to side with the far right wing of their party by allowing the bill to expire. This political gamesmanship has taken a very real toll. Every moment the House continues to delay is another moment vulnerable women are left without protections they deserve. In the next Congress one of our absolute first priorities must be passing an inclusive and bipartisan bill to extend protections to the millions of new women included in the Senate bill. As a nation we cannot accept further discrimination or delay from House Republican leaders. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patty Murray.","Patty Murray: House GOP stalled renewal of Violence Against Women Act .

She says in partisan move, House then passed a bill stripping out new protections .

"Washington (CNN) -- To the pile of accusations against the IRS, now add one of the first opinions by a nonpartisan official that the agency went outside the law. That conclusion on Tuesday from the official responsible for managing historically important U.S. records came at a congressional hearing during which Republicans also tried to widen the spotlight of IRS scandal to include the White House. David Ferriero, who heads the National Archives and Records Administration, told a House panel that the IRS ""did not follow the law"" when it failed to tell his agency about the loss of emails belonging to former IRS official Lois Lerner. The Lerner emails are of particularly high-interest because she was the most senior manager so far connected to IRS targeting of tea party and other political groups. Lerner retired last year and has refused to testify before Congress, exercising her constitutional right not to do so. The House has charged her with contempt as a result and her lack of testimony has frustrated Republican investigators. Over a week ago, the IRS revealed that Lerner's hard drive crashed in 2011, destroying thousands of emails and documents. The agency insists it has retrieved some 24,000 of the missing emails by checking the accounts of other IRS employees who corresponded with Lerner. Republicans have pounced on the technical aspects of the crash as well as on whether the IRS followed federal records keeping law by not having a better backup system to retain electronic information. Those laws also require agencies to notify the archives of any loss of official records. Tuesday's hearing before the House Oversight Committee followed a contentious session on Monday night during which the panel grilled agency commissioner John Koskinen. In questioning before the panel on Tuesday, Ferriero told lawmakers that Lerner's emails were certainly federal records -- either temporary or permanent. And he said the IRS has yet to report the loss of the hard drive and the emails to his agency. ""Did they break the law?"" Rep. Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican, asked. ""I'm not a lawyer,"" Ferriero answered. ""Can we safely assume they broke the law?"" Walberg followed. ""They did not follow the law,"" Ferriero concluded. White House official testifies . The IRS has maintained that it did not realize the full extent of the hard drive crash until late April or early May. Koskinen testified the IRS waited to tell Congress because it was trying to retrieve and reconstruct what information it could at first. The same hearing included testimony from White House attorney Jennifer O'Connor, who worked at the IRS from May to November of 2013. Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa subpoenaed O'Connor after the White House initially said that she left the IRS before the agency knew about the hard drive crash and could not offer any meaningful testimony. She agreed to appear following the subpoena. That set up immediate tension, as the California Republican opened his questioning by accusing O'Connor of being a hostile witness, demanding quick yes or no answers. ""I'm definitely not hostile,"" she answered in an almost gentle voice, stressing that she was eager to cooperate and ultimately sparking Issa to say the term ""hostile"" was not accurate. As the White House foretold, she shed no light on the Lerner hard drive crash. But O'Connor did give one of the most detailed public descriptions yet of how the IRS initially responded to the congressional investigations into the tea party targeting. Tedious process . She laid out a tedious five-step process to find and collect tens of thousands of emails, for which the agency was unprepared at first. ""The IRS' material is protected with careful encryption,"" O'Connor said. ""So it needs to be processed before it can be reviewed. They have to load it and flatten it and then decrypt it. ... Then, they would run the (search) terms that the congressional committees had identified over the material and once that was done and the material was viewable, they would move it over into a review tool."" O'Connor said that then acting IRS Commissioner Dan Werfel was emphatic in directing that the agency turn over documents as fully and quickly as possible in response to congressional requests. But when she arrived, O'Connor saw an IRS that did not have the resources in place for such an operation. ""We (needed) to add people because the IRS had never encountered anything like this,"" O'Connor told the panel. ""We didn't have the staff in place to do this kind of document review production."" She added that the agency also had to add significant server capacity to handle the requests. ""I think the record of the IRS reflects very very hard work to produce the documents,"" O'Connor concluded. IRS blasted over lost hard drive, but no apology from agency chief .

"Sydney (CNN) -- The Australian Macquarie Dictionary has re-ignited the so-called gender war that shone so brightly after the country's prime minister's blistering attack on sexism and misogyny in parliament earlier this month. Julia Gillard's tirade, which drew global attention, and at the time of writing had been viewed almost two million times on You Tube, was directed at the Opposition leader, Tony Abbott. ""The leader of the opposition says that people who hold sexist views and who are misogynists are not appropriate for high office. Well, I hope the leader of the opposition has got a piece of paper and he is writing out his resignation,"" Gillard blared. Abbott's National-Liberal Coalition took deep offense. Had the prime minister conflated or confused ""sexism"" and ""misogyny,"" or worse, deliberately distorted the meaning of misogyny to score a resounding political point? Was Gillard seriously asserting that her opposite number held a pathological hatred of women, as most dictionaries define misogyny? For the Coalition, it seemed a bit rich that the prime minister saw misogyny in Abbott but not in one of her own supporters, the former Speaker of the House who resigned in disgrace following SMS texts widely viewed as meeting the dictionary definition of misogyny. Into the fray weighed Australia's leading dictionary. Editor Sue Butler surprised the nation Wednesday by declaring Macquarie Dictionary would alter its definition of misogyny, closer to the conflated version used by the prime minister. In its next published edition, the dictionary's editors said the word would be defined as both the ""hatred of women"" and ""entrenched prejudice against women."" Butler said Macquarie Dictionary had decided that for the past 20 or 30 years, ""misogyny"" had taken on wider meaning, particularly in feminist discourse and that with changed usage should come a changed definition. ""You're not really saying they [misogynists] have a pathological sickness, that they should be on a psychiatrist's couch discussing their early relations with their mother or anything like that,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). ""They merely have what we think of as sexism, an entrenched prejudice against women,"" she added. And so, Butler, who said she sees herself as the ""person with the mop and the broom and the bucket who's cleaning up the language after the party's over,"" decided that after this ""fairly big party,"" the word misogyny needed mopping. Abbott has refused to buy into the debate, dismissing the issue as the latest outbreak of the ""politics of smear."" But the decision has divided Australians. As ""Ron 1966,"" a reader of the ABC website, put it: ""This is just ludicrous! A prominent figure misuses a word -- and gets embarrassingly caught out for doing so by anyone who understands the English language or who can read a dictionary -- and so the Australian Dictionary decides to redefine the word to match the prominent person's intended meaning. ...Is the Macquarie Dictionary also going to redefine 'misandry', or is it only accusatory and inflammatory words used by women against men that need to have their definition broadened to save embarrassment?"" For the record, Macquarie has said that it's also considering redefining ""misandry,"" which it says currently covers ""entrenched prejudice rather than hatred."" Even for those who applauded Gillard's speech, the dictionary's move seemed odd and unhelpful. Comedian and columnist Corinne Grant said the debate over dictionary definitions was ""reductive and pointless."" She said she thought questioning the prime minister's use of the word misogyny detracted from what she said was Gillard's triumph -- calling out sexism -- and diminished the speech to a whine. ""... if the only way to have any kind of debate about gender in this country is to play the dictionary card, we ask Macquarie to change the definition of complaining to 'women defending their right to take part in public and private life without being ridiculed, negated or abused on the basis of their gender.'"" Grant found an army of supporters. One of them wrote: ""It is obvious that many males and alas females can't accept the idea that the behavior the prime minister called out is misogynistic. Much easier for their conscience that the word be attacked as the wrong word than face the truth of the situation."" One female who believes the new definition of misogyny is silly is prominent Australian Financial Review columnist Jennifer Hewett who wrote: ""He (Abbott) is now just to be officially accused of exhibiting entrenched prejudice rather than having a ""visceral hatred'' of half the world's population. It must be like the 2012 version of a mortal as opposed to a venal sin. Guilty as charged, apparently,"" she wrote. Hewett continued: ""What is even more astonishing though is how so much of the feverish argument has seamlessly managed to equate Julia Gillard's attack on Tony Abbott into a general and principled assault on the evils of sexism or misogyny, however defined."" The thing about fevers is that they can be catchy. Following the Macquarie Dictionary decision, the U.S. dictionary Merriam-Webster has said it is closely following developments in Australia. Merriam-Webster associate editor Kory Stamper told The Australian newspaper (itself, experiencing fever at the change of definition): ""A quick review of our citational evidence shows that 'misogyny' has been used to refer to a very broad range of behaviors, attitudes, policies, and so on .... no dictionary definition is set in stone. We will continue to gather evidence of the word 'misogyny' in use, and compare our definition against that use."" Watch out Mitt Romney, who like Abbott, is trying to mend his image with female voters, after his statement in the second U.S. Presidential debate that he'd been brought ""whole binders full of women"" by women's groups after he issued a plea for qualified women to work in his Massachusetts government.","Australia's Macquarie Dictionary redefines the word 'misogyny'

"(CNN) -- The head of the World Health Organization warned the world this week of a new virus, awkwardly dubbed MERS-CoV, found in Saudi Arabia. ""Looking at the overall global situation, my greatest concern right now is the novel coronavirus,"" Margaret Chan said, calling it ""a threat to the entire world."" ""We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat,"" the director general said in her closing speech to the 66th session of the World Health Assembly. ""Any new disease that is emerging faster than our understanding is never under control. ""These are alarm bells and we must respond. The novel coronavirus is not a problem that any single affected country can keep to itself or manage all by itself."" With just 49 cases of the new disease reported since June 2012, it may seem puzzling that Chan named the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus -- MERS CoV or MERS for short -- the greatest threat to world health today. Your questions about MERS, answered . But Hong Kong-born Chan can be forgiven a strong reaction. After all, she managed the response to SARS there in 2003, and MERS is a close genetic cousin. At least 8,000 people in 30 countries contracted SARS in 2003; 774 died of the disease. No doubt her sense of urgency also stems from the apparently high mortality rate: To date, 27 of the 49 people who have caught the disease have perished, or 52%. Although the majority of illnesses have been in the Saudi Arabia, cases have emerged in seven countries. Similarities between the SARS and MERS viruses are more than genetic. Both cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, and trigger reactions in the human immune system that are so severe, organs throughout the body are devastated -- collateral damage in an overly vigorous battle with the microbes. Both viruses spread between people through close contact, putting family caregivers and health care workers at risk for infection. In April, for example, according to a report in the British medical journal The Lancet, a French man who had traveled to Dubai fell ill with the disease in France, although it wasn't diagnosed immediately. Another patient who shared the first man's hospital room caught the disease. The first man died on May 28; the second remains in intensive care. 5 things to know about MERS . A new report in the New England Journal of Medicine offers a glimpse of the depth of mystery shrouding MERS. A team of Saudi Ministry of Health researchers describe a November outbreak in a Riyadh urban household of 28 extended family members, four of whom -- all men -- contracted MERS. The cluster of cases in this family presents a list of mysteries: Why were all the sick and dead men? With 28 people in this three-building urban household, why were these four infected, and the other 24 spared? The family lived in a big city, had no animals, ate supermarket food and had jobs that offered no contact with the virus. How did they catch MERS? Until researchers can determine what animal is the natural host of the virus, and how MERS spreads from the host to humans, each new outbreak is dangerous and mysterious. The science is still unfolding. Meanwhile, the WHO and world health community watch, anxiously, recalling how swiftly the SARS outbreak that started in southern China in December 2002 exploded a month later across Asia, Canada, and on, eventually hitting 30 countries. Sadly, resources for confronting such outbreaks have decreased since the 2008 financial crisis, and MERS has emerged in one of the most difficult regions in the world. Were the virus to reach any of the refugee camps that house more than 2 million Syrian refugees, a genuine pandemic could ensue. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Laurie Garrett.","The head of WHO said MERS CoV virus found in Saudi Arabia threatens ""the entire world""

"New York (CNN) -- New York City's comptroller Thursday announced the approval of a $40 million civil rights settlement to five black and Hispanic men wrongfully convicted in the horrific beating and rape of a white female jogger in Central Park in 1989. ""In my judgment, this settlement is a prudent and equitable solution for all parties to the lawsuit and closes a very difficult chapter in our City's history,"" comptroller Scott Stringer said in a statement. The settlement has to be submitted for approval to Judge Deborah Batts of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where the men filed their civil rights lawsuit. Michael Warren, a lawyer for three of the men -- Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray and Raymond Santana Jr. -- said his clients were thrilled with the agreement, which will be formally announced at a news conference on the steps of City Hall on Friday. ""We're not only elated but very relieved that this process has advanced to the point where these young men can finally begin to move on with their lives,"" Warren told CNN. The settlement closes a dark episode in recent New York City history. The sensational case polarized the city along racial lines and became emblematic of rampant crime. Five minority teenagers, who became known as the Central Park Five, said they were coerced into making incriminating statements, and they were convicted in 1990. The agreement between the city law department and the five men -- who served between seven and 13 years in prison -- averages about $1 million per year of incarceration, a source with knowledge of the settlement told CNN. One of the men, Kharey Wise, served 13 years in prison. Yusef Salaam, Richardson, McCray, and Santana Jr. each served about seven years. On April 19, 1989, a 28-year-old Wall Street investment banker jogging through Central Park was raped, viciously beaten and left for dead. She would have no memory of the attack. That same night, a group of black and Latino youths had been in the park, throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people in a practice the media and law enforcement at the time called ""wilding."" An investigation led to the arrest of five teens who were accused of rampaging through the park in a ""wolf pack"" and preying on innocent victims. They were charged and convicted. ""If they had their way,"" Salaam told CNN in 2012, ""we would have been hanging from one of those lovely trees here in Central Park."" The victim, Trisha Meili, kept her identity hidden for 14 years until the publication of her book, ""I Am the Central Park Jogger."" ""I guess there are lots of theories out there but I just don't know and it's almost too confusing for me to understand,"" she told CNN in 2003, referring to the false confessions given by the five men. ""I've had to come to peace with it by saying: 'You know what? I'm just not going to know.'"" Three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms, one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer in 2001 confessed to the crime and said he had acted alone. ""After being exonerated, it's like somebody running free through the...grass and throwing their hands up and yelling, 'Ah!' you know ... the feeling is overjoy and happiness,"" Salaam told CNN. DNA analysis later determined that Reyes was the perpetrator of the rape, and that hair evidence used in the boys' trials did not match. Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney at the time, ordered a new investigation and, on his recommendation, a judge vacated the convictions. A civil rights lawsuit filed by the five men accused police and prosecutors of false arrest, malicious prosecution and a racially motivated conspiracy. The administration of former mayor Michael Bloomberg fought the case, but his successor, Bill de Blasio, pledged to settle the suit before taking office.","Five men were wrongfully convicted in infamous Central Park rape case .

"(CNN) -- Why is the Mona Lisa the most famous painting in the world? Her enigmatic smile? The mystery surrounding her identity? The fact she was painted by Renaissance pin-up boy Leonardo da Vinci? Sure, all of these things helped boost the popularity of the 16th century masterpiece. But what really catapulted the small, unassuming portrait to international stardom was a daring burglary over 100 years ago. When Italian handyman Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911, he never could have guessed her absence would be the very thing that made her the most recognizable painting on the planet. Suddenly images of the artwork were splashed across international newspapers, as the two-year police hunt hit dead-end after dead-end. It wasn't until December 1913 -- exactly 100 years ago next month -- that Peruggia was finally caught and the Mona Lisa recovered, becoming the best known painting in a time before we shared images on TV, internet, and phones. Today, she is the jewel in the Louvre's crown, helping attract over 9.7 million visitors to the Paris museum last year, and immortalized in everything from Andy Warhol's pop art to Dan Brown's bestselling novel, ""The Da Vinci Code."" But had Peruggia instead slipped another artwork under his cloak that fateful day, it could have been a very different story. ""If a different one of Leonardo's works had been stolen, then that would have been the most famous work in the world -- not the Mona Lisa,"" said Noah Charney, professor of art history and author of ""The Thefts of the Mona Lisa."" ""There was nothing that really distinguished it per se, other than it was a very good work by a very famous artist -- that's until it was stolen,"" he added. ""The theft is what really skyrocketed its appeal and made it a household name."" Bold burglar . So how did Peruggia pull off one of the greatest art heists of all time? With mind-boggling ease, it seems. The handyman had been hired by the Louvre to make protective glass cases for some its famous works -- including the Mona Lisa. After hiding in a closet overnight, he simply removed the painting, hid it under his smock, and was about to waltz out of the building when he discovered the door was locked. Desperate Peruggia removed the doorknob, but still it wouldn't open -- until a helpful plumber passing by opened the door with his key. It was 24 hours before anyone even noticed the Mona Lisa was missing, with artworks often removed to be photographed or cleaned. ""The Louvre had over 400 rooms but only 200 guards and even fewer on duty overnight,"" said Charney, founder of the Association for Research into Crimes against Art (ARCA). ""There were basically no alarms in play."" ""It was under-secure. But to be fair, most museums were at that time."" Front page news . The French press had a field day, seeing it as an opportunity to poke fun at the seemingly inept government which ran the Louvre. This was an era where newspapers were really taking off, and pretty soon the theft -- and the image of the Mona Lisa -- was splashed across the world. ""60 detectives seek stolen Mona Lisa, French public indignant,"" reported the New York Times. For the first time there were queues outside the Louvre, just to see the empty space where the painting had hung. ""The theft launched it into becoming a household name for people who had never been to Europe and had no interest in art,"" said Charney, adding: ""And it's really just continued from there."" Over the next two years, the bungling police investigation dragged on, with Pablo Picasso a suspect at one point. The force even interviewed Peruggia twice, before concluding he couldn't possibly be the man behind the brazen burglary. Discovery . The head of the Paris police retired in shame. And then two years later, an art dealer in Florence received a letter from a man saying he had the Mona Lisa. It was signed ""Leonardo."" The man was of course Peruggia. After setting up a meeting with the dealer and the director of the Uffizi gallery in Florence, Peruggia turned up with the painting which had spent years hidden in a trunk in his apartment. Peruggia, then 32 years old, claimed to have stolen the artwork to return her to her native Italy. He was arrested and eventually sentenced to seven months jail. ""He seemed to have genuinely been convinced he would be heralded as a national hero and genuinely dismayed to discover he wasn't,"" said Charney, adding: ""He was maybe a few pickles short of a sandwich, but not a lunatic."" For most of us, the Mona Lisa will only ever be seen from behind bullet-proof glass, a thumbnail in the distance, smiling her knowing-smile behind jostling tourists with camera phones held aloft. But for over two years Peruggia had the famous woman all to himself. Did he fall in love with her? ""I think so,"" said Charney. ""There are a number of thieves who have stolen art and have suffered a sort of 'reverse Stockholm syndrome' -- where the hostage-taker falls in love with the hostage."" ""In this case, the hostage was a work of art."" Stove ashes probed for traces of stolen Picasso, Matisse, Monet works .","The Mona Lisa is the most famous painting in the world. But why?

"(CNN) -- The top court in Arkansas has ordered the immediate dismissal of a judge who leaked confidential details about an adoption involving Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron, according to court documents. Faulkner County Circuit Judge Michael Maggio admitted posting details from Theron's closed-record adoption of a child in 2012 on ""tigerdroppings.com,"" a Louisiana State University fan site, using the online name ""geauxjudge,"" according to documents that a judicial commission submitted to the state Supreme Court. Maggio commented in January 2012 that a friend of his handled a single-parent adoption case involving Theron, and that she came to court wearing a ""long brown wig, oversized clothes"" so as not to be recognized, the commission's report says. He wrote online that he ""offered to be the baby daddy,"" documents said. Theron is one of Hollywood's top actors with roles in movies ranging from ""Monster"" and ""Mighty Joe Young"" to ""North Country"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" Efforts to reach Theron's representatives were not successful Friday night. Maggio's published comments on the adoption case involving Theron are part of a report by the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission, which investigated claims against the circuit judge. Maggio has been on the bench in Arkansas since 2001. The commission's report includes five pages of comments Maggio made in the social media forum on other cases under the username ""geauxjudge,"" including statements on various aspects of gender, race and sexuality issues. The report concluded that he had violated at least 23 judicial codes. In March, after the identity of ""geauxjudge"" was confirmed to be Maggio, he said in a statement: ""I take full responsibility for the comments that have been attributed to me. I apologize deeply for my lapse in personal judgment and for that, I have no excuse. ""The comments posted were not acceptable. These comments are not a reflection of who I am,"" the judge's statement said, according to CNN affiliate KATV. The Arkansas Supreme Court order prohibits Maggio from holding any judicial office in that state and orders him to be removed from office without pay.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber must pay $80,900 restitution for damage caused to his former neighbor's mansion by eggs he threw. The pop star accepted a plea deal to settle a vandalism charge that puts him on probation for two years. The probation will be supervised until he completes 12 weekly anger management sessions, works five days of community labor and pays the restitution. The sentence also requires Bieber to stay at least 100 yards way from the victim's family. Bieber must let the probation officer know if he is deported or otherwise leaves the country, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Leland Harris said. ""Justin is glad to get this matter resolved and behind him,"" his representative said in a written statement. ""He will continue to move forward focusing on his career and his music."" The misdemeanor charge was filed Wednesday morning by the Los Angeles County District attorney five months after a sheriff's investigator recommended it be prosecuted as a felony. Assistant District Attorney Alan Yochelson told the judge that while the damage to Jeffrey Schwartz's ""dream house"" was ""incredible"" he did not think it warranted a felony charge. Yochelson called it ""an extremely immature and silly act"" that caused ""incredible amount of damage"" to what the neighbors considered their ""dream house."" Bieber's lawyer previously called it a ""silly prank."" Bieber, 20, was not required to be in court. Attorney Shawn Holley, known for her frequent appearances defending Lindsay Lohan, entered the ""no contest"" plea on his behalf in a Van Nuys, California, court Wednesday afternoon. Is Justin Bieber getting special treatment? The vandalism case is what lawyers call a ""wobbler,"" meaning the district attorney could have prosecuted it as a felony -- which would have much more serious consequences for the singer -- or as a misdemeanor. Bieber has since moved from the neighborhood, selling the mansion to Khloe Kardashian. Justin Bieber: 'Don't believe rumors' Bieber's drunken driving charge in Miami is also still pending, although a source close to that case said talks are under way to reach a plea deal to avoid a trial. Justin Bieber avoids felony robbery charge in cell phone 'tussle' Los Angeles prosecutors decided in June not to pursue charges against Bieber for an incident in which a Los Angeles woman accused him of trying to take her cell phone. Justin Bieber caught in racial controversy . The egging case began when the singer's neighbor called 911 to report that someone was throwing eggs over a fence from Bieber's home. Residents of the exclusive community had previously reported several incidents allegedly involving Bieber, including speeding on the residential streets. Investigators with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department searched Bieber's home on January 14 for video from Bieber's security cameras they hoped would show what happened. They later presented prosecutors of video they said supports a vandalism charge against Bieber, an investigator said. Bieber house guest Lil Za, a rapper whose real name is Xavier Smith, was arrested on a felony drug charge during the raid. Deputies added a vandalism charge when he damaged a jail phone. He later accepted a plea deal for probation. Bieber buddy Lil Za gets probation for drug, vandalism charges .","NEW: ""Justin is glad to get this matter resolved and behind him,"" his rep says .

"(CNN) -- A Los Angeles police officer has been charged with assaulting a woman under arrest, Alesia Thomas, who lost consciousness in a patrol car and was declared dead soon thereafter, prosecutors announced Thursday. Mary O'Callaghan, 48, was charged a day earlier in a felony assault case, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. The prosecutor's office said it will request $35,000 bail for the officer who, if convicted, could spend three years in state prison. Tyler Izen, president of the Los Angeles police union,in a statement said ""the alleged actions of the officer are incongruous with her reputation as an officer who was known to be diligent, courteous and ethical."" O'Callaghan's lawyer Robert Rico describes his client, an 18-year veteran of the department, as ""devastated."" ""As an officer, a Marine and a mother, she's used to fighting and defending others,"" Rico said. ""And she will fight and defend herself in a court of law to prove her innocence."" The charge stems from an incident July 22, 2012, when police investigating a possible child abandonment went to Thomas' home. This was after Thomas had dropped off her two children at a police station because she felt her drug abuse had made her an unfit parent, according to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. At the mother's home, police talked with Thomas and arrested her. It was then that O'Callaghan arrived on the scene, helping her fellow officers put Thomas -- then wearing handcuffs and leg restraints -- in a patrol car. Video captured what happened next, the prosecutor's office said, including ""O'Callaghan kicking Thomas in the stomach and groin area and pushing her in the throat."" Thomas lost consciousness in the patrol car, then was transported by paramedics to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Prosecutors said they didn't file involuntary manslaughter charges against O'Callaghan because it couldn't be proven that she directly caused Thomas' death. Her official cause of death was ""undetermined,"" according to a coroner's report. Thomas's relatives, though, believe O'Callaghan is responsible, family spokesman Najee Ali said Thursday. The family is grateful for the charge filed this week, added Ali. But they're not satisfied yet, pushing for the public release of the video showing Thomas' final moments.

"(CNN) -- With his frequent use of Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram, Barack Obama has often been called the most tech-savvy of U.S. presidents. So it makes sense that he was also the first president in 2009 to appoint a federal technology officer, a high-level adviser who helps guide government initiatives on tech, entrepreneurship and innovation. That appointee, Aneesh Chopra, stepped down in January. Now his successor, Todd Park, is continuing the effort. A Harvard graduate, health-tech entrepreneur and former chief tech officer for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Park took office in March and has only recently begun speaking publicly on his goals for his new job. We spoke to Park recently about Obama's high-tech agenda, the power of big data and how technology can help drive job growth. Here is an edited transcript of our conversation. CNN: Tell me a little bit about your position as you understand it. Park: My job is to be tech entrepreneur-in-residence at the White House. My role is to be an internal change agent that works with the best innovators inside and outside of government to conceive of, and then execute, at high speed, a portfolio of initiatives that unleash the power of data, tech and innovation to improve the well-being of the American people. And about 20% of my time is functioning a senior advisor on [these] issues. What kinds of things does the president ask your advice on? The president's team asks me to get involved in everything from, say, helping to move the health insurance exchange programs along to assisting on, say, initiatives to help streamline the student loan process. It actually tends to be issues that relate to how technology and data can be applied to advance the ball on key national priorities, like education, energy, health care, public safety, job creation. How would you describe the president's approach to technology? The president is a hugely enthusiastic proponent of the power of data, technology and innovation to advance national priorities. Probably the highest compliment I can pay him is that his geek quotient is very high. What, exactly, is the power of government data? It's the notion of government taking a public good, which is this data -- say weather data, or the global-positioning system or health-related knowledge and information -- making it available in electronic, computable form and having entrepreneurs and innovators of all stripes turn it into an unbelievable array of products and services that improves lives and create jobs. Government supplies the public good that is the data and [the] private sector supplies the creativity. What is it about the private sector that is more nimble and creative? I think the real secret is Joy's Law. This is a law that we're very fond of citing. It's named after Bill Joy, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems, a legendary figure in [Silicon] Valley, who once famously said, ""no matter who you are, most of the smartest people in the world work for somebody else."" Which is always true, no matter who you are [laughs]. So, having worked, for example, in [Health and Human Services]. There are a lot of smart of people in HHS, a lot of smart people. There's just many, many, many, many ... more smart people outside HHS. And, so, I think the key there is that if you make data available to everybody else, just by sheer numbers and sheer diversity of who they are and where they are, they will, of course, create many more powerful services and products ... than any group of people in any one organization possibly could. We are enabling entrepreneurs and innovators across all walks of life to tap into fields of data sitting in the vaults of government in machine-readable form. They can, as they did with weather data, as they did with GPS data, create all kinds of services and products that we can only even barely imagine. Can you briefly describe your history in the private sector, why you got into government and how it's prepared you for your current role? When I was 24, I co-founded a company called Athenahealth which built the first Web-based software and back-office service suite for doctors' offices. Ten years later, we took it public. It ended its first day of trading with a market cap of over $1 billion. A year later, with the company doing incredibly well, and in order to stay married, I retired, joined the board, started a family with my wife and moved to California to be near her folks. I then co-founded another company, called Castlight Health, which provides health care shopping services to consumers, and helped start a third company called Healthpoint Services, which provides affordable telemedical services, clean water, drugs and diagnostics to rural villages in India. Then, in the summer of 2009, I got an e-mail ... asking to speak with me about the position of chief technology officer of HHS, a person who would serve as a ""tech entrepreneur-in-residence,"" an internal change agent dedicated to leading initiatives that would help HHS unleash the power of data and technology to improve the health of all Americans. They were very interested in bringing in someone with deep private sector entrepreneurial experience, as they felt that this person would be ideally suited to the role. At first, the prospect of losing me again to 24-7 workaholic mode was not a big hit at home. But after thinking about it for a few days, my wife said that if HHS was really looking for a tech entrepreneur-in-residence, then it was my national duty to do that job, and that we should go serve. So we did. Here's what I'll say about my experience in government thus far: It has been the most entrepreneurial experience of my life. How do you hope the federal government will change its approach to technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship? We believe [our agenda] will significantly increase return on taxpayer investment in government. The agenda has three key components: . One, go mobile, enabling more and more government services to be accessed on mobile devices, bringing government literally to your fingertips. Two, buy smarter, revamping how government buys technology to get a bigger bang for taxpayers' buck. Three, open up our data, enabling it to be used as a national resource by entrepreneurs and innovators to create new products and jobs. To help advance this agenda, we've launched a new Presidential Innovation Fellows program. This program will pair amazing innovators from outside government with amazing innovators inside government on five game-changing projects that aim to deliver significant initial results within six months. These projects in sum aim to save taxpayer dollars, contribute to economic growth and job creation and improve the lives of Americans in multiple ways. And they aim to do so through the work of small, entrepreneurial teams working inside the government, teams of citizen innovators and government innovators who are working together to get amazing things done for the American people. What's the best way for the American people to get involved? The president is catalyzing a remarkable change in government. Government is truly beginning to embrace the power of innovation for the people and by the people, the idea that if government collaborates openly with and unleashes the ingenuity of the public, it will get much more done, much faster and at much lower cost than if government acted alone. The Open Data Initiatives program exemplifies this approach. The government could have decided to keep all of its data in-house and be the sole builder of tools that utilize government data to help citizens. Instead, we're working to open up our data so that entrepreneurs and innovators across the country can build many more tools and create much more benefit with our data than government could possibly deliver alone. The five Presidential Innovation Fellows projects, which include the Open Data Initiatives program, embody this idea of innovation for the people and by the people. We're asking for amazing citizen innovators to come to D.C. and serve their country for a short-term tour of duty starting in July. Folks who can't tear themselves away to be Fellows can sign up to follow one or more of the five projects and participate in them in other ways. For example, you might be an entrepreneur who is interested in making a difference in the world of education. You can sign up to follow the Open Data Initiatives program, learn more about the education data we're making available, give us feedback about the data and use it as fuel to build something amazing that will help a family make the best possible decision about where to send their daughter to college and create jobs in your community at the same time. The thing I love about this emerging philosophy of government, this idea of a government that embraces the power of innovation for and by the people, is that at its core is the belief that government and the people are one. We as citizens are the true owners of government. Any of us, if we choose, should be able to stand up, serve our country and make a difference. If we can continue to move government more and more in that direction, that will be a wonderful legacy to leave our children.","Todd Park is the White House's new chief technology officer .

"CNN -- Fleet-footed winger Cristiano Ronaldo is Manchester United's most deadly weapon and officially the best footballer in the world. Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo is the current FIFA World Player of the Year . Born in 1985 on the Portuguese island of Madeira, the 23-year-old cut his teeth with Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon, where his amazing skill and dribbling ability alerted a host of top European clubs. However, it was Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson who nipped in before his rivals to sign Ronaldo for a reported fee of $19 million in 2003. With Manchester United he has won three Premier League titles, two Football League Cups, the FA Cup, the World Club Championship, and the Champions League. After a phenomenal 2007/2008 season, in which he scored 42 goals for Manchester United in all competitions, he was voted FIFA and FIFPro World Player of the Year and European Player of the Year. That season his 31 Premier League goals won him the Golden Shoe award, making him officially Europe's most prolific goal scorer, and he was also the leading scorer in the Champions League, with eight goals. He capped a remarkable campaign by scoring the opening goal, before also netting from the penalty spot, as United beat Chelsea in a dramatic Champions League final in Moscow. Tall, elegant and powerful, Ronaldo is as good in the air as he is with the ball at his feet, as he proved with his header against Chelsea in last year's final. He also possesses a remarkable and unique free-kick technique, managing to bend and swerve the ball to devastating effect, notably with the goal that effectively ended Arsenal's challenge in the semifinals of this year's Champions League. Apart from his success at Old Trafford, Ronaldo is a regular figure for his national side, making his full international debut in 2003 and going on to represent Portugal at the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008 finals. However, despite his god-given talent, Ronaldo still gets criticized in Portugal for allegedly failing to replicate his United form in a Portugal shirt. According to Forbes, Ronaldo was football's fifth biggest earner in 2008. Of his $21 million income, $12m was in salary and incentives from Manchester United and another $9 million came from endorsements with global brands like of Nike and Coca-Cola.","Ronaldo Voted FIFA World Player of the Year and European Player of Year .

"(CNN) -- A Syrian rebel carves the heart out of a dead man and bites it. His comrades nearby cheer: ""God is great."" This is from a video that is circulating on the Internet. The appalling footage has all the world asking: What kind of people could do this? We tell ourselves these men must be monsters, people utterly unlike us, people we could never understand. But we don't say this because it is true. We say this because it is comforting to think so. The far more frightening possibility we must face is that such evil is not diabolically inhuman or beyond understanding. It is human -- very human. How can ordinary men commit such horrific acts? The war criminals I have met did not start out by desecrating corpses, torturing villagers or murdering children. They got there slowly. There are some men who are natural monsters, but most monsters are made. This is how you make them. First, take a man (and yes, it is most often a man) and isolate him. Separate him from his family and friends and put him in an information bubble, an echo chamber cut off from the outside world. Make him conform to the values of his new group by exploiting his insecurity and need for approval. This is the first step in any war. Second, train him to think that the world is painted in black and white, not shades of gray. Train him in either-or, binary thinking. Either you are my friend or my enemy. Either you are pure or impure. Either the people you love are safe or they are in immediate peril. Either you are all right or you are all wrong. Third, physically exhaust him. Break down his body and spirit -- through brutal training or prolonged combat -- until he can't think straight. Subject him to a system of harsh and arbitrary punishment and equally arbitrary rewards. Condition him to feel helpless. A man who feels like he has lost control over his life is a dangerous man, because hurting others feels like control. Fourth -- and this is the most important part -- start small. Work up to atrocity step by step. Put him into a strange and frightening environment with minimal regulation. Let the aggression escalate. Each violent act he commits while trying to survive will make the next act feel easier, more natural. The first time he kills a villager, it is terrifying. The second time, it is hard. The third or fourth time, it starts to feel almost easy. Eventually, he finds himself competing with his fellow soldiers to see who can do it fastest, most often, most creatively. Watching videos like this, and thinking thoughts like this, it is easy to lose hope. In war, are we doomed always to descend into barbarism? The answer is no. The nightmare video from Syria is not inevitable. The very same steps used for creating monsters can also be used to stop monstrosity -- you just need to reverse the steps. Some people are born moral heroes, but most are made. And this is how you make them. First, take a young man and start small. Work up to altruism and moral courage step by step. Each small thing he does to attend to the suffering of another or stand up against injustice will make the next act feel easier, more natural. Second, give him a clear system of rules with predictable consequences. Teach him he has the ability to make choices about his life, and that these choices matter. Third, teach him that the world's problems aren't as simple as us-versus-them, good-versus-evil. Teach him that there aren't easy solutions to complex problems. Teach him to tolerate, without fear and anxiety, life's difficult ambiguity and uncertainty. And finally -- to those of you, like me, who are parents of young boys -- teach him to seek out ""the other"": Other clubs and groups, other sources of information, other places to see, other kinds of people, other cultural values. Spoil him with diversity, so that if there ever comes a time when he is called to war, he will always remember to see the world through the other's eyes. He will fight, but he will fight against an enemy that he sees as a person, like him. He will see their humanity, and in so doing, he will preserve his own. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Dawes.","A video shows a Syrian rebel carving the heart out of a dead soldier and eating it .

"Washington (CNN) -- Controversial remarks by the pastor of a Dallas church stole the spotlight from several Republican White House contenders Friday during the first day of the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of evangelicals and other social conservatives. After introducing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Robert Jeffress, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, told reporters that Republicans shouldn't vote for White House hopeful Mitt Romney because he's a Mormon and described the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as a ""cult."" Speaking live on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" Jeffress told CNN Political Correspondent Jim Acosta, ""I think Mitt Romney's a good, moral man, but I think those of us who are born-again followers of Christ should always prefer a competent Christian to a competent non-Christian like Mitt Romney. So that's why I'm enthusiastic about Rick Perry."" In the same exchange, Jeffress told Acosta that the Southern Baptist Convention ""has officially labeled Mormonism as a cult."" In fact, a website maintained by the Southern Baptist Convention lists the Mormon faith under its ""New Religions and Cults"" section, which also includes Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church of Scientology. Contacted by CNN, the Romney campaign had no comment on Jeffress' remarks. Michael Purdy, a spokesman for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, declined to comment on a statement ""made at a political event."" ""But those who want to understand the centrality of Christ to our faith can learn more about us and what we believe by going to mormon.org,"" Purdy said in a statement. The Perry campaign told CNN via email that it did not ask Jeffress to introduce the Texas governor at Friday's event. Asked personally about Jeffress' remarks after a campaign event in Iowa Friday night, Perry told reporters that he did not think Mormonism is a cult, a view Perry spokesman Mark Miner had expressed earlier on Perry's behalf. Speaking Friday evening on CNN's ""John King, USA,"" Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council and an organizer of the two-day event, said the Perry campaign was informed two weeks ago about event organizers' plan to have Jeffress introduce Perry and the Perry camp, in Perkins' words, ""signed off on"" that plan. Perkins also told CNN Chief National Correspondent John King that event organizers did not know what Jeffress was going to say in introducing Perry nor did the Texas governor's campaign. Alson on ""John King, USA,"" Jeffress told King that Perry did not know in advance what he was going to say and the Dallas pastor noted that he did not ""refer to Mormonism as a cult"" in his actual remarks introducing Perry at the event. Then, Jeffress affirmed his earlier comments about the tenets of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. ""This is not an unusual view, John, that Mormonism is not Christianity,"" Jeffress told King, ""Historical Christianity has never embraced Mormonism as a part of its faith."" Jeffress added that, in his estimation, because Romney is Mormon ""he doesn't embrace the historical tenets of evangelical Christianity."" Then Jeffress told King that, religion aside, he still did not think Romney was the right choice. ""There are plenty more reasons not to vote for Mitt Romney . . . and I think conservatives have plenty of reasons, leaving Mormonism out of it, not to be energized by Mitt Romney's candidacy,"" the pastor said. Jeffress' comments largely overshadowed the remarks of Perry, Herman Cain, Rep. Michele Bachmann, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and former Sen. Rick Santorum, all of whom addressed the conservative gathering Friday. Perry focused his speech less on social conservative values and more on the economy, taking a swipe at President Barack Obama along the way. ""[Americans] aren't looking for soaring speeches. They're looking for common sense solutions,"" Perry said Friday. ""They know our first order of business to get America working again is sending our current president to the private sector."" The Texas governor primarily talked about American 'exceptionalism,' arguing the best way to maintain freedom is to protect the country's economic and national security. And on the heels of an agreement this week between the White House and Senate Democrats on a 5.6% ""millionaire's tax,"" Perry blasted the idea of raising taxes as a way to stimulate the economy. ""When [liberals] utter phrases like 'fair share' you just know they're once again playing fast and furious with the truth,"" Perry said. ""And the truth is you can't rev up the engine of an economic growth by heaping higher taxes on job creators."" Perry did delve into his stance on abortion. Notably, he said he was a consistent anti-abortion advocate unlike other White House hopefuls. ""For some candidates, pro-life is an election-year slogan to follow the prevailing political winds,"" Perry said in apparent hit against his opponent, Mitt Romney, whom he didn't name. Cain, who recently joined Perry and Romney in the top tier of the GOP race according to several recent national polls, relished his new status. Cain told the gathering of social conservatives the rest of the Republican field is afraid, ""that this long shot may not be a long shot any longer."" The former CEO of Godfather's Pizza who has never held elected office also dedicated a good portion of speech to foreign policy, a policy area perceived as a weakness on Cain's part by some Republicans. Taking aim at Cain's '9-9-9' tax plan, Santorum introduced what he called his '0-0-0' plan: ""Zero corporate income tax on any manufacturer processor in this country... Zero corporate tax on all of that money brought back if invested in plant and equipment in this country... And zero -- we will zero out and repeal every single regulation the Obama administration has put in place that is 100 million dollars in business or more,"" Santorum said. Santorum said his plan would boost the middle class and manufacturing, an area of the economy that the former Pennsylvania lawmaker said used to be strong. ""Twenty-one percent of the people working in this country when I was growing up were involved in manufacturing,"" Santorum said. ""Now it's 9. We need to get those jobs back."" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, long known as one of the GOP's top ideas men, used his address to deliver a broadside against the notion of judicial supremacy and particular against more liberal judges on the federal bench. Bachmann, a vocal social conservative, shared how her faith played a role in her fight against abortion rights. She added that she introduced legislation in Congress on Thursday that would require women considering an abortion to hear and see the heartbeat of the fetus before making a decision. A longtime favorite of the tea party movement, Bachmann also sounded what is becoming a recurring refrain in her campaign for the White House; she told fellow conservatives that they should not settle for a moderate Republican as they make their decision about who to back in 2012. ""Don't listen to these people, who every four years, tell you we have to select a moderate from our party and we have to settle for the sake of winning,"" she said. ""I am here to tell you we are going to win. This year, we don't settle."" Perkins opened the event by telling social conservatives that electing a Republican in 2012 would not be enough. ""This election is too important to elect a Republican,"" said Perkins. ""We need to elect a conservative that will undo the economic and moral and social destruction this administration has unleashed on America. We don't need politicians that promise to slow down decline. We need leaders that are bold and courageous that will undo destructive policies."" Along with Rep. Ron Paul, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is set to address the gathering Saturday. It is not known whether Romney will speak directly to Jeffress' remarks about Mormonism. This isn't the first time the Dallas pastor has hit Romney over his religion. During the 2008 campaign, he made similar comments.","Rick Perry supporter says don't vote for Mitt Romney because he's a Mormon .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Civil Guards arrested five Algerian men early Tuesday in northern Spain on suspicion of providing logistical and financial support for Islamic terrorist activities, Spain's interior ministry said. The suspects, aged 36 to 49, allegedly supported ""terrorist groups that operate in the Algerian area of the Maghreb, specifically for al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,"" a ministry statement said. They also had suspected links to Islamic militants in Italy, France and Switzerland. Some 150 Civil Guards took part in the operation, making nearly simultaneous arrests and conducting searches of homes and premises linked to the suspects in two towns of northern Guipuzcoa province and two others in neighboring Navarra province, the statement said. Computer hardware and software was seized and will be analyzed. Spain's National Court, which handles cases of terrorism, is supervising the operation, the statement said. Spanish authorities have said repeatedly in the past few years that the group known as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is of key concern, because of its operational base in northern Africa, just across the Mediterranean Sea from Spain and southern Europe. Last week, Civil Guards arrested a Cuban man on Spain's Mallorca Island in the Mediterranean for allegedly recruiting and indoctrinating others for Islamic terrorist activities. A judge released the suspect from custody Friday, but he must report daily to police while authorities investigate computer documentation seized when he was detained. Since the Madrid train bombings of 2004 that killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others, Spanish police have arrested more than 400 suspected al Qaeda militants or collaborators, the Interior Ministry website says. Most have been of North African or Middle Eastern origin, with a few from Latin America.","The suspects had links to militants in Italy, France and Switzerland, officials say .

"VRINDAVAN, India (CNN) -- Ostracized by society, thousands of India's widows flock to the holy city of Vrindavan waiting to die. They are found on side streets, hunched over with walking canes, their heads shaved and their pain etched by hundreds of deep wrinkles in their faces. A widow makes her way in Vrindavan, India, where an estimated 15,000 widows live on the streets. These Hindu widows, the poorest of the poor, are shunned from society when their husbands die, not for religious reasons, but because of tradition -- and because they're seen as a financial drain on their families. They cannot remarry. They must not wear jewelry. They are forced to shave their heads and typically wear white. Even their shadows are considered bad luck. Hindus have long believed that death in Vrindavan will free them from the cycle of life and death. For widows, they hope death will save them from being condemned to such a life again.  Watch how some widows are rebelling » . ""Does it feel good?"" says 70-year-old Rada Rani Biswas. ""Now I have to loiter just for a bite to eat."" Biswas speaks with a strong voice, but her spirit is broken. When her husband of 50 years died, she was instantly ostracized by all those she thought loved her, including her son. ""My son tells me: 'You have grown old. Now who is going to feed you? Go away,' "" she says, her eyes filling with tears. ""What do I do? My pain had no limit."" As she speaks, she squats in front of one of Vrindavan's temples, her life reduced to begging for scraps of food. There are an estimated 40 million widows in India, the least fortunate of them shunned and stripped of the life they lived when they were married. It's believed that 15,000 widows live on the streets of Vrindavan, a city of about 55,000 in northern India. ""Widows don't have many social rights within the family,"" says Ranjana Kumari with the Center for Social Research, a group that works to empower women. The situation is much more extreme within some of India's rural community. ""There, it is much more tradition-bound; in urban areas, there are more chances and possibilities to live a normal life."" But the majority of India's 1.1 billion population is rural. ""The government recognizes the problem,"" Kumari says. ""It can do a lot, but it's not doing enough."" One woman, a widow herself, is working for change. Dr. Mohini Giri has formed an organization called the Guild of Service, which helps destitute women and children. Giri's mother was widowed when Giri was 9 years old, and she saw what a struggle it was. Then, Giri lost her husband when she was 50, enduring the social humiliation that comes with being a widow. At times, she was asked not to attend weddings because her presence was considered bad luck. ""Generally all widows are ostracized,"" she says. ""An educated woman may have money and independence, but even that is snatched away when she becomes a widow. We live in a patriarchal society. Men say that culturally as a widow you cannot do anything: You cannot grow your hair, you should not look beautiful."" She adds, ""It's the mind-set of society we need to change -- not the women."" Seven years ago, Giri's organization set up a refuge called Amar Bari, or ""My Home,"" in Vrindavan. It has become a refuge for about 120 of India's widows. Giri's organization is set to open a second home, one that will house another 500 widows. But as she says, ""Mine is but a drop in the bucket."" At Amar Bari, most widows reject traditional white outfits and grow out their hair. Along the open air corridors that link the house's courtyard are green wooden doors, leading to dark tiny rooms, home for each widow.  See the widows of Vrindavan » . Bent over by osteoporosis, 85-year-old Promita Das meticulously and slowly sweeps the floor just outside her door and then carefully cleans her dishes. ""I came here when I couldn't work anymore. I used to clean houses,"" she says. ""Nobody looked after me, nobody loved me. I survived on my own."" She married at 12 and was widowed at 15. Seventy years later, she finds herself at Amar Bari. ""I used to live in front of a temple, but then I came here,"" she says. She carries with her not only the pain of a life without love, but also the loss of her only child. She gave birth at 14; her baby lived a year. Another widow, Ranu Mukherjee, wearing a bright red-patterned sari, shows off her room at the home and wants to sing for her guests.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The leaders of China and Japan on Monday held their first face-to-face talks since they took office, amid smoldering tensions between the two Asian powers. Chinese President Xi Jinping met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, the two governments said. The two shook hands in front of the cameras with subdued expressions on their faces. The United States has had to navigate the fraught relationship in recent years between Japan, a key ally, and China, whose regional and global clout is on the rise. Washington has attempted the balancing act of standing by its commitments to Tokyo without antagonizing Beijing. The last formal meeting at this level between China and Japan took place nearly three years ago, in December 2011, according to the Japanese news agency Kyodo. Since then, relations have dramatically soured, mainly because of the escalation of a bitter territorial dispute over a group of tiny, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. China's sudden declaration last year of an Air Defense Identification Zone over a large swath of the East China Sea added to tensions, drawing strong criticism from both Japan and the United States. Diplomatic ties became so bad that the two sides resorted to invoking Voldemort, the fictional villain in the Harry Potter books, in their verbal barbs about each other. New visa policy elevates U.S.-China relations . Meeting is 'the first step' But now, the emphasis appears to be on trying to mend fences between Asia's two largest economies. ""This is the first step towards the improvement of the bilateral relationship, based on the principle of the strategic mutually-beneficial relationship,"" Abe said after the meeting. For his part, Xi called on Japan to ""do more things that help enhance the mutual trust between Japan and its neighboring countries, and play a constructive role in safeguarding the region's peace and stability,"" China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported. Ahead of the meeting, the two countries issued almost identical statements Friday, saying essentially that they agreed to disagree. ""Both sides recognized the existence of disagreements on recent tensions over East China Sea waters"" around the disputed islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, the statements said. They said they had agreed ""to prevent the deterioration of the situation through dialogue and consultation, as well as to build the crisis management and control mechanisms to avoid the occurrence of unexpected events.""

"(CNN) -- A Texas couple married Tuesday in the neonatal intensive-care unit with their prematurely born son serving as ring bearer. Justin Nelson and Kristi Warriner wed Tuesday in the NICU of Cook Children's Hospital in Fort Worth, where baby JJ has been since September. He was born 15 weeks early on September 2; his twin, Colt Austin, died in utero. Dressed in a tuxedo onesie, JJ slept through most of the ceremony. He's being monitored for chronic lung disease. ""He has been struggling but has made great improvements,"" Warriner told CNN. ""We still grieve but keep strong for JJ."" The couple postponed their wedding plans when Warriner became a high risk pregnancy because of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, a rare condition that occurs in identical twins who share a placenta. Warriner went to the emergency room on August 31 and discovered baby Colt had passed away. She started having contractions on September 1, and JJ, which stands for Justin Jr., arrived the next day. With the help of Cook Children's staff, the couple wed in JJ's room, surrounded by family and their 8-year-old daughter, and invited local media to witness the event. ""Our mission behind sharing our story was to let those that have been there, are there or unfortunately could one day be there [know] that they are not alone.""

"Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- The unusually cold weather that struck Florida in January did more than damage crops and citrus trees. It has also caused an unprecedented number of deaths among Florida's beloved residents, the endangered West Indies manatees. Twisting and flopping in the shallow water, Baby Coral  probably doesn't realize just how lucky she is. When this 3-year-old female manatee was brought into Tampa's Lowry Park Zoo last month, she was 300 pounds underweight, unable to eat. Her skin was covered with small white, blister-like lesions known as ""Florida frostbite,"" the result of exposure to cold temperatures. Lowry Park Zoo is one of the three facilities in the state that provide medical treatment and a place for manatees to recover from cold stress, as well as other injuries. ""It's an exceptionally bad year for the manatee,"" said Dr. David Murphy, the zoo's veterinarian. So far this year, a record 280 or more manatees have died from cold stress-related illnesses. That's estimated to be 5 percent of the total population in Florida. Add that to last year's record mortality rate of 429 deaths from boat strikes and other causes, and that number may be as high as 10 percent. Marine biologist Andy Garrett says he's never seen anything like this before. The full impact of the cold weather on the manatee population is still unclear, according to Garrett, who works for Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. He says that when water temperatures dip below 68 degrees Fahrenheit, these subtropical animals simply can't cope with the cold.  Last month, Florida's water temperatures dropped as low as the 40s. While manatees are round and plump like seals and other marine mammals, their fat is not designed to insulate them from the cold, Garrett said. West Indies manatees roam the warm waters of the Caribbean, and in the summer have been known to migrate as far north as the New Jersey, and as far west as Texas. But those wintering in Florida are at the marginal edge of their habitat, and are always susceptible to the cold. On the other side of Tampa Bay, manatees have found a practical solution: Hundreds gather in a canal warmed by water discharged from a Tampa Electric Co. power plant. There, they are able to escape the cold, floating in waters that stay around 78 degrees. The carcasses of manatees who weren't able to find a warm water refuge have been turning up daily. Most end up at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's necropsy lab in St. Petersburg. The lab has been busy in recent weeks, at times examining a dozen manatees a day. There, Dr. Martine de Wit and her staff determine cause of death. It's normally the young manatees that are most stressed by cold weather, but this year, full-size adults are dying. ""That is a very bad sign,"" she said. The cold water shuts down their internal systems. Many were unable to eat; others drowned because they were unable to breathe. Garrett and de Wit believe that this may just be the beginning. They fear that more manatees will die during the spring, unable to recover from the trauma of Florida's deep freeze.","Cold has killed at least 5 percent of West Indies manatees this year, 280 in all .

"(CNN) -- As Jarod Tonneson went into a bathroom during the Denver Broncos game this past Thursday night, his father, Paul Kitterman, waited outside. When Tonneson came out of the restroom on the second level of the stadium, his dad wasn't there. Tonneson went back to their seats in section 230. No sign of him. He went to check with the friends they had come to the game with and met up with at halftime. There was more room in their section and perhaps Kitterman, who was attending his first game, would be there. No sign of him. There was no cell phone to call. Kitterman, 53, doesn't particularly care for them. They went to the spot where they were supposed to meet after the game. No sign of him. It wasn't like Kitterman to just take off. ""He wouldn't leave Jarod for all the money in the world,"" Tia Bakke, one of the friends who went to the game, said Monday night. ""He had plans the next day. He had things he wanted to do."" Kitterman doesn't have any health problems, Bakke said. Sonny Jackson, a spokesman for the Denver Police Department, said a witness remembers seeing Kitterman in the stadium during the third quarter. Jackson said investigators were looking through security video from Sports Authority Field at Mile High. According to CNN affiliate KUSA, Kitterman also didn't care for credit cards and was carrying about $50 in cash. ""Paul is the best guy you could ask for. They don't make them like Paul anymore,"" said Bakke, who met Kitterman through her boyfriend, who has known the missing man for a decade.

"Gary, Indiana (CNN) -- Seven women killed. At least. To make sure the toll isn't higher, Indiana authorities spent Tuesday canvassing abandoned properties in Gary, Indiana. This comes after authorities say Darren Deon Vann -- the man who, according to police documents, admitted strangling a woman inside a nearby Motel 6 room -- confessed to killing six others and led police to their bodies. ""This gentleman killed, and his MO was to put his bodies in these houses,"" police Sgt. William Fazekas said from Gary's Glen Park neighborhood, where several victims were found. Suspect identified after 7 bodies found . So teams of law enforcement officers hit the streets Tuesday, some accompanied by cadaver dogs. Gary Police Chief Larry McKinley said 35 officers spent the day going through about 120 structures, out of an estimated 10,000 vacant properties in the city of 80,000 people, and those efforts will continue. Even without any admissions of more killings, authorities are not taking any chances. ""He has been accurate about the information that he has been given, but that does not mean that we are simply going on his information,"" said Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson. As of late Tuesday afternoon, Vann, 43, did not have any legal representation and hadn't requested a public defender, said David Schneider, the chief public defender in Lake County, Indiana. Nor has he appeared in front of cameras or a judge; that will come Wednesday morning at a magistrate court hearing at the county jail in Crown Point. Yet authorities say he has been talking to them, including leading them to the six other bodies on Sunday. Asked why Vann chose to cooperate, Hammond Police Chief John Doughty said he wanted to cut a deal with prosecutors, but didn't provide further details. ""It was just something he wanted to do,"" the chief said. ""That's all I can say."" While taken aback by the horrific story, Gary residents aren't surprised the abandoned properties played into it. There's been a push to tear them down or do something else about them, amid fears that shady characters have used them for no-good deeds. One young woman, Tatianna Foster, said she doesn't leave home after 8 p.m. because of it. ""Because it's so dark out here, they call it 'Scary Gary,' "" she said. Ronnie Williams, who lives half a block from where some bodies were found, says the whole horrifying ordeal makes him want to leave Gary. ""I've got seven kids, two sets of twins,"" Williams said. ""I can't take that chance."" 'Low-risk' sex offender after aggravated sexual assault . The Indiana-born Vann spent time not only in Gary, about 30 miles southeast of Chicago, but also in Austin, Texas. That's where, in December 2007, he repeatedly struck, choked and raped a 25-year-old Hispanic female, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark. Vann was later convicted of aggravated sexual assault, a first-degree felony. He served five years in prison, from 2008 to July 2013. After registering as a ""low-risk"" sex offender in Texas, Vann told prison officials that he would be moving more than 1,000 miles northeast to Indiana, Clark said. He did register as a sex offender in Lake County. Officers checked in with him there on September 14 to confirm he was at his stated address. That's all that is required, Lake County sheriff's spokeswoman Patti Van Til said. ""If we had gotten an anonymous tip that he had gotten a job or was driving a car that didn't belong to him, that would be different. But we were not required, and there were no anonymous tips."" That 2007 incident wasn't Vann's only brush with the law. Records also show he was arrested on unspecified charges while living in Cherry Point, North Carolina, in 1993. And court records indicate Vann was convicted in Lake County, Indiana, of misdemeanor residential entry in 2004. The affidavit tied to that crime says he put his girlfriend in a headlock while holding a lighter near a gas can -- an apparent threat to burn her -- before police eventually grabbed and arrested him. Vann served 90 days in jail for that crime, a class D felony. Edward Matlock, whose mother married Vann in the 1990s, described him as ""a nutcase who I'd never allow near my kids or in my house."" Matlock said Vann and his mother divorced after 16 years. ""He was just a strange guy,"" said Matlock. Coroner seek help identifying 2 bodies . Right now, Vann faces charges in one death -- that of 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy, whose body was found in a Motel 6 in Hammond. But Gary Police Chief Larry McKinley told reporters on Tuesday that his department will file charges in ""the next couple of days"" against Vann in the deaths of 28-year-old Teaira Batey, 36-year-old Kristine Williams and 35-year-old Anith Jones, the latter of whom had been missing since October. ""Murder is our ultimate charge,"" McKinley said. The other three bodies have not yet been identified. The Lake County Coroner asked for the public's help Tuesday in trying to identify two of the women. One of them was wearing a bracelet that included the words ""Best Aunt,"" as well as a silver, heart-shaped ring. The other was wearing a pair of jeans -- the brand is twentyone black by rue 21 -- and white Nike shoes. Batey's boyfriend, Marvin Clinton, said her death leaves a big hole. The couple have a 2-year-old son. ""That's going to be the hardest part about it,"" he told WLS. ""Because he loved his mama, and she loved him. It's devastating.""

"(CNN) -- A Boeing 777, one of the world's most reliable types of airliners, is missing, and no one knows why. Was it a bomb? Mechanical failure? A hijacking gone awry? Pilots and others in the aviation community are deeply disturbed by the mystery surrounding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. It disappeared Saturday en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing over the Gulf of Thailand, somewhere between Malaysia and Vietnam. It's hard to believe that such huge questions remain four days after the Boeing 777-200ER went missing, carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members. A revelation Wednesday set off a fresh wave of speculation, as Chinese officials said they had captured satellite images that show what could be wreckage from the plane. The situation is so unprecedented that experts have been careful in speculating about possible explanations. Here are four scenarios they're talking about, and the related facts: . 1. Scenario: Mechanical failure? Fact: A satellite ""observed a suspected crash area at sea,"" China's State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense said Wednesday. The images captured three floating objects that are 13 by 18 meters (43 by 59 feet), 14 by 19 meters (46 by 62 feet) and 24 by 22 meters (79 feet by 72 feet). Analysis: The location of the objects is near the airplane's original flight path. ""This opens the door back to an aeronautical problem and not a human problem,"" said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. But Steven Wallace, the Federal Aviation Administration's former director of accident investigation, cautioned that the size of the objects might be too large to be wreckage from an airplane. ""When an airplane goes into the water, whether it impacts intact or breaks up at high altitude, what floats are lighter-weight, typically interior components. Major structural components will sink. So if this image -- and it's a blurry image; I'm sure it will be more carefully analyzed -- if it's true that the piece of wreckage is 40 by 70 feet, I would be very skeptical as to whether it's part of that aircraft."" Fact: Air traffic controllers in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, lost contact with the plane over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. A senior Malaysian Air Force official said Tuesday that radar tracking detected the flight an hour and 10 minutes later over the very small island of Pulau Perak, in the Strait of Malacca. This is hundreds of miles off course, traveling in the opposite direction from its original destination. But other Malaysian officials disputed that report. And on Wednesday, Malaysian authorities said radar records did detect an unidentified aircraft moving into the Strait of Malacca, but it wasn't clear whether that plane was Flight 370. Analysis: If the plane did indeed change course and fly for more than an hour, an electrical problem on the plane could explain that, some experts say. ""Perhaps there was a power problem, and then there's a backup power system. That backup power system is designed to last about an hour. It's natural for the pilot, in my view, to return to where he knows, the airports and a region he knows,"" said Kit Darby, an aviation consultant and former United Airlines captain. ""So turning around makes sense, and about an hour later, the airplane could become unflyable."" Fact: The missing plane had suffered a clipped wing tip in the past, but Boeing repaired it, and the jet was safe to fly, said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya on Sunday. Analysis: ""Anytime there's been previous damage to an airplane, even though it's been repaired, and repaired within standards ... it kind of sends a warning flag,"" says Wolzinger. Experts agree the Boeing 777 is one of the world's most reliable aircraft. During its development it was subject to some of the most rigorous testing in commercial aviation history. ""I've been talking with colleagues,"" Wolzinger says. ""We're all baffled by this."" The 777 boasts some of the most powerful and well-tested engines in the world, he says. ""The reliability of airliner engines in general is impeccable these days,"" he says. ""This is a safe plane."" Looking for a needle in a haystack . 2. Scenario: Hijacking? Fact: Before it disappeared, radar data indicated the plane may have turned around to head back to Kuala Lumpur. Is that a clue that a hijacker had ordered the plane to change course? Analysis: So far, there have been no reports that the flight crew sent any signals that a hijacking had occurred. Some experts say that could have been deliberate. Others say a mechanical failure could have been what stopped the pilots from reporting a problem. Fact: The plane had stopped sending identifying transponder codes before it disappeared. Analysis: ""Given that this airplane has so many redundant electrical systems on it, my first reaction would be that somebody...purposely turned it off,"" said John Goglia, a former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board member. ""A pilot would not do that. Somebody that didn't want to be seen very well would do that."" John Ransom, a retired commercial pilot and safety consultant, said the situation sounds fishy. ""This was a fairly modern airplane with a bunch of capability to communicate with the outside world. A lot of data transmissions from the airplane,"" he said. ""For them to all stop at the same time would take the work of somebody who has actually studied the systems in some detail to know how to turn off all of the systems at the same time."" Turning off a transponder is a ""deliberate process,"" Goelz said. ""If someone did that in the cockpit,"" he said, ""they were doing it to disguise the route of the plane."" Was someone unauthorized inside the cockpit, ordering the transponders to be turned off and the plane to be turned around? Or, he said, ""Did one of the pilots do it themselves?"" 3. Scenario: Pilot error . Fact: So far, there are no known indications that pilot error contributed to the aircraft going missing. Analysis: Some aviation experts have compared Flight 370 to the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009. All 228 passengers and crew died when the plane went down in a storm in the Atlantic en route from Brazil to Paris. After an expensive, nearly two-year search across the deep ocean floor, the twin-engine Airbus A330's wreckage was finally found and the voice and data recorders recovered. A French investigation blamed flight crew for failing to understand ""they were in a stall situation and therefore never undertook any recovery maneuvers."" But unlike Flight 447, weather was reported as good along Flight 370's scheduled route and didn't appear to present a threat. Asiana Airlines Flight 217 -- a Boeing 777 -- fell short during a runway approach last July at San Francisco International Airport. Three people were killed and more than 180 others hurt. National Transportation Safety Board investigators have focused on pilot reliance on automated flight systems as a possible contributor to the crash, but a final report has not yet been released. 4. Scenario: Terrorist attack? Fact: Two stolen passports have been linked to people who held tickets for the flight. Interpol identified the men using the stolen passports as Pouri Nourmohammadi, 18, and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Reza, 29, both Iranians. Malaysian police believe Nourmohammadi was trying to emigrate to Germany using the stolen Austrian passport. Analysis: Malaysian investigators say there's no evidence to suggest either person traveling with a stolen passport was connected to any terrorist organizations. Interpol has a similar take. ""The more information we get, the more we're inclined to conclude that it was not a terrorist incident,"" Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said. But some experts have questioned whether the use of the stolen passports suggests problems with the security screening for the flight. And CIA Director John Brennan said his agency is not yet willing to discount the possibility of a terror link in what he called a ""very disturbing"" mystery. ""No, we're not ruling it out. Not at all,"" he said Tuesday. Fact: No one has claimed credit for any terrorist act tied with the plane's disappearance. Analysis: But terrorism still can't be ruled out, said Shawn Henry, former executive assistant director of the FBI. ""There might be another reason for them not coming forward at this point,"" he said. ""If it was a terrorist incident...if this was part of a much larger or broader potential act, and for whatever reason, they wouldn't come forward at this point, but at a later time."" Fact: So far, no debris field of plane wreckage has been linked to the 777, which would indicate a bomb blast. Analysis: When Robert Francis, former vice chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, heard about the missing plane, his immediate thought was: ""For some reason the aircraft blew up and there was no signal, there was nothing."" The fact that the plane disappeared from radar without warning indicated to Francis ""there was something unprecedented that hasn't happened before."" What about satellite technology? Is it possible that data from orbiting satellites might show a flash or infrared heat signature from an explosion? Very unlikely, says satellite expert Brian Weeden, who spent years tracking space junk in orbit for the U.S. Air Force. Dozens of government and private satellites orbit the earth, looking down from distances from 300 kilometers to 1,500 kilometers (185 to 930 miles). It's a long shot that one of them coincidentally floated over at the exact right time and location to capture a flash from an explosion. However, there's an ""off chance,"" Weeden says, that a super-secret U.S. government satellite orbiting 22,000 miles in space might have grabbed evidence. These satellites are in geosynchronous orbit. As a group, they can observe virtually the entire globe. ""We know that their mission is to detect ballistic missile launches via heat,"" says Weeden, now a technical adviser for Secure World Foundation. ""We don't know if they're sensitive enough to track something like a bomb blast, even if that's what happened."" Then there's another unanswerable question: Would the government hesitate to release such an image for fear of revealing the satellite system's ultraclassified capability? Who travels with a stolen passport? CNN's Steve Almasy and Rene Marsh contributed to this report.","NEW: China: A satellite has ""observed a suspected crash area at sea""

"(CNN) -- A day after 16 died in an accident at a concert in South Korea, a man responsible for safety measures was found also dead, the country's semi-official news agency reported. It was an apparent suicide. On Friday, a ventilation grate gave way, and more than two dozen people standing on it plunged some 20 meters (66 feet) -- or four stories -- into an underground parking structure below, a government accident response task force said. In addition to the deaths, eleven people were injured, three seriously. On Saturday, the body of the 37-year-old safety official was found on a street near his office, Yonhap news agency reported, citing police. They think he jumped to his death. He left a brief message on his Facebook page. ""I apologize to the victims. I'm sorry to my family."" On Friday, Prime Minister Chung Hong-won inspected the gaping concrete hole that swallowed up concertgoers. Some media reports indicate the victims were standing on the grate in order to get a better view of the stage. A witness told CNN affiliate YTN, ""There was a sudden, loud screaming and when I turned, it looked as if people were being sucked down into a hole."" About 700 people were attending the concert, which featured South Korean artists, including the popular all-female group 4Minute, Yonhap reported. A ferry sinking in April killed more than 300 people, many of them schoolchildren, and caused nationwide outrage. Critics contend safety measures and regulation are not keeping pace with the fast-paced economic development in the country. CNN's K.J.

It has frightened me and my family, as we didn't know what was happening,"" the conservative radio and TV host said on TheBlaze, a network he founded. Eventually, he learned what was wrong: he had a variety of ailments, including an autoimmune disorder and adrenal fatigue. Speaking through tears, the former Fox News host detailed the progression of his illness and the symptoms he suffered. Beck said he struggled to remember names, faces and conversations. At other times, his hands would shake and he would be forced to curl up into a ball. ""While I was at Fox, the pain would get so bad that my camera crew, our executive producer Tiffany and I, had worked out hand signals so they would know when to take the camera off of me,"" Beck said. ""We didn't know at the time what was causing me to feel as though, out of nowhere, my hands and feet, or arms and legs would feel like someone had just crushed them, set them on fire or pushed broken glass into them."" Beck said he rarely slept, but was never tired. After taking a test for people with traumatic brain injury and testing in the bottom 10%, Beck said he was told he would no longer be able to function in about five to 10 years. He went from doctor to doctor and tried different diets and medications, but nothing really worked. Beck began to search for his replacements. At the same time, he said, Beck and his wife continued to look for answers and found them at the Carrick Brain Centers, a rehabilitation center in Texas. ""We went and after a few short visits they found that I had several things going on -- from an autoimmune disorder to adrenal fatigue, and they found the connection on everything that was going on,"" Beck said. ""Me never having to sleep was finally understandable. The last sign of adrenal failure is a hyperextension of your adrenal glands. In other words, I didn't need sleep. I could have been lifting cars during my time at Fox!"" After months of treatment and changing the way he eats, sleeps, works and lives -- along with hormone treatment and intensive physical therapy -- he believes he has reversed the process. ""My brain is back online in a big way,"" he said. ""I have received a clean bill of health.""","The conservative radio and TV host says he's hidden his illness for years .

"(CNN) -- The teenage gunman who opened fire in a high school cafeteria in Washington state last week may have had more victims had it not been for the bold actions of a young teacher. Witnesses say Jaylen Fryberg, a popular freshman, shot and killed a female student and wounded four others in the crowded lunchroom at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday, about 34 miles north of Seattle. Megan Silberberger, a teacher, was in a nearby office when she heard the shots, said Randy Davis, president of the Marysville Education Association. ""She ran into the cafeteria and saw students down,"" said Davis. Silberberger also saw a gunman. ""She ran towards the shooter,"" he said, ""to stop... and help secure (him)."" Davis would not reveal details of the confrontation, but one student who witnessed it told CNN affiliate KIRO what he saw. ""She just grabbed his arm,"" said Erick Cervantes. ""She's the one that intercepted him with the gun. He tried either reloading or tried aiming at her."" ""I believe she's actually the real hero,"" Cervantes said. Silberberger declined CNN's request to be interviewed but issued this statement: ""I am thankful and grateful for the support from everyone. At this time I am requesting privacy."" A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Fryberg was indeed having trouble reloading and that it was because his hands were trembling. Police have not yet said how many shots in total were fired, but there was at least one bullet left in the cartridge before the confrontation with Silberberger -- because the final shot was the one that ended Fryberg's life. A Beretta .40-caliber handgun believed used in the shooting has been traced to Fryberg's father, according to the source. Share your perspective on guns with CNN iReport . Victims weren't random . Students, parents and school leaders met inside the gym at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Sunday to remember, mourn and talk about ways to move forward. Students and parents were separated for private discussions. Authorities have not publicly released the name of the female student killed, however, her friends have identified her to CNN as Zoe Galasso. The wounded -- two girls and two boys -- are in intensive care in hospitals in Seattle and Everett. Among them are members of Fryberg's own family. Andrew Fryberg, 15, is in critical condition, and Nate Hatch, 14, in serious condition at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, according to hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg. ""All three of them are cousins, and they live right close to each other,"" Don Hatch, Nate's grandfather, told CNN affiliate KOMO. The boys were close friends, nearly inseparable, Hatch said. They even went to a school dance together recently, where Fryberg was named the freshman class homecoming prince. ""Only God knows what escalated this. Only God knows,"" Hatch said, according to KOMO. ""Nobody pushed a button with bullying. It's just something that happened, and we don't know why."" Hatch said he forgives Fryberg and plans on visiting his family. ""I'll say, 'I feel for you and I'll pray for you,' "" he said. The girls were identified as Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and Gia Soriano, both 14, according to Dr. Joanne Roberts, Providence Regional Medical Center Everett's chief medical officer. They were in critical condition with head injuries. At a news conference Saturday, Roberts read a brief statement from Soriano's family: ""Our family is in shock. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers during this tragedy. Our hearts go out to the other victims and their families."" Lunchroom in shock . Investigators in Marysville have not provided details, but students offered up accounts that painted a terrifying, chaotic picture. Fellow student Jordan Luton was finishing his lunch in the cafeteria when he heard a loud bang. He saw Fryberg go up to a table of students, ""came up from behind ... and fired about six bullets into the backs of them,"" Luton told CNN. ""They were his friends, so it wasn't just random."" According to a law enforcement source, witnesses said Fryberg pulled the gun out of a black backpack before he began firing. Witnesses described the look on his face as calm, said the source. Grief, disbelief . It was hard for Luton to make sense of the shooting. ""I have no idea what his motive was because yesterday at football practice, he was all fine, talking ... having a good time,"" he said. ""And then today, just horrible. I don't know what went through his head or what caused him to do it."" By all accounts, Fryberg was a popular student. Just a week ago, he had been named the high school's freshman homecoming prince, according to a YouTube video of the ceremony and accounts provided by students to CNN. ""It's weird to think about, because you see him and he is such a happy person,"" sophomore Alex Pietsch said. ""You never really see him be so angry and so upset. ... People were telling me who it was when I was getting in my mom's car and I was like, 'What? This is not happening. ... This is crazy.' It was just surprising to me that him out of all people would be the one."" Who was Jaylen Fryberg? CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Britain was withdrawing its troops Sunday from Iraq, ending a role that began with the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein, British defense officials said. The announcement that Britain was withdrawing its 170 troops came days earlier by Liam Fox, the defense secretary, who said the troops had completed their mission to train Iraqi naval forces. ""We now look forward to a strong, long-term defense relationship with Iraq,"" Fox told the House of Commons when he announced Wednesday that British troops would leave the country. The announcement effectively ended Britain's role in Iraq, a role that was widely unpopular in the United Kingdom. About 179 British troops were killed during operations in Iraq. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in Britain when the war began, protesting the deployment of British troops to join then-President George Bush's ""Coalition of the Willing."" At the height of the war, more than 46,000 British troops were deployed primarily in and around the southern port city of Basra. In 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown ordered an inquiry into the UK's participation in the war. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair testified during the inquiry that Iraq needed to be confronted over its ambitions to develop weapons of mass destruction. Britain ended its combat operations in Iraq in 2009 but maintained a small contingent, primarily members of the Royal Navy, to train Iraqi sailors and marines at the southern Iraqi port city of Umm Qasr. The remaining 150 or so military personnel were temporarily withdrawn in July 2009 after the Iraqi parliament failed to pass an agreement for their continued presence. Britain will leave behind a small contingent to protect its personnel at its embassy in Baghdad. Additionally, Fox said a small number of British troops will continue in a NATO training mission in Iraq. CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Jodi Arias and her legal team began fighting for her life Tuesday when a new jury heard opening arguments on whether she should receive a life or death sentence for her murder conviction. It's been a long legal journey for Arias, 34, whom a jury found guilty last year of first-degree murder in the gruesome killing of ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, 30. This week's court proceeding in Arizona is a retrial of the penalty phase. In 2013, the same jury that convicted her became deadlocked later on whether she should be executed for the 2008 murder of Alexander, who was stabbed 29 times, shot in the face and had his neck slit from ear to ear. The impasse came when the jury voted 8-4 in favor of the death penalty for Arias, a source with knowledge of the jury's vote said at the time. ""The tale of this relationship is one of infinite sadness,"" Arias's lawyer, Kirk Nurmi, told the jury onTuesday. ""The story of this relationship is one of tragedy, friendship, spirituality, lust, passion, forbidden sex, abuse and violence."" Nurmi said Arias went through an abusive childhood and developed a personality disorder early in life but had never committed a crime before the killing. She also suffered emotional abuse at the hands of Alexander, he said. She is very remorseful and is punishing herself, he said. The only appropriate sentence is life in prison, Nurmi concluded. The prosecutor in the case, Juan Martinez, cast doubt on Arias's feelings toward Alexander, saying ""she loved him so much that after she slaughtered him she showed up at his memorial service."" Martinez described the brutality of the slaying, telling the jury that Arias stabbed Alexander first in the chest while he was nude in the shower, then continued to stab him in the back when he was already bleeding and leaning over the bathroom sink. After making his opening argument, Martinez called police officers as the first witnesses. They showed the jury photos of the bloody scene in the bathroom. A death penalty requires a unanimous vote by the 12 jurors, and during the penalty retrial, a similar 12-0 vote will be required if Arias is to die by lethal injection, said Jerry Cobb, spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's Office. During the retrial, if all 12 jurors can't vote for death, then Arias will be eligible for one of two life sentences: life without the possibility of release or life with the possibility of release after 25 calendar years, Cobb said. That means Arias and her legal team will need to persuade only one of the 12 jurors to vote against the death penalty for her to be spared from execution, Cobb said. The judge swore in six men and 12 women as jurors for the penalty phase. Nobody knows, not even the jurors, which of them will be the 12 to actually make a decision about Arias's life. Graphic testimony expected . The 12 jurors and eight alternates are expected to hear evidence for three to six weeks, Cobb said. That testimony won't rehash whether Arias committed murder. That's already been decided. Rather, the jury will hear evidence from the prosecution on why a death sentence is warranted and from the defense on how Arias' background and relationship with Alexander pose mitigations favoring a life sentence, Cobb said. Nevertheless, the testimony is expected to be gruesome and grisly because prosecutors must show the murder was done in a ""cruel, depraved or heinous"" manner, among other factors, Cobb said. ""The state will be arguing and building on that theme,"" Cobb said. Arias' legal team is arguing that life is ""the appropriate penalty"" for the convicted murderer for a number of reasons, according to court papers they filed this month. Her legal team notes that Arias has no prior criminal history. She was only 27 when she killed Alexander and has since been remorseful, according to court papers. She also has a psychological makeup that ""impaired her ability to cope with the tumultuous relationship she had with Mr. Alexander,"" court papers said. No live telecast until verdict . Unlike the 2013 trial, the penalty retrial won't be televised live. Rather, Judge Sherry Stephens, who will preside over the retrial as she did in the 2013 trial, has ruled that while TV cameras will be permitted in the retrial, no video can be aired until a verdict has been rendered. The judge's decision came after the defense argued that live TV coverage would keep their witnesses from testifying. The 2013 trial was sensational, attracting a media circus and a national audience riveted by themes of sex, violence and 18 days of testimony by Arias, who detailed what she called an abusive relationship with Alexander but claimed she remembered nothing of his killing. Public fascination . The trial also featured phone sex conversations between Arias and her boyfriend as well as video of her interrogation by police. The public also became fascinated with Arias because she took the stand in her defense. More recently, she sought to act as her own attorney in the penalty phase retrial and was initially granted permission in August. But Arias changed her mind in September. During last year's trial, jurors and the public saw Arias on video making a number of declarations to police investigating the murder. ""I'm not a murderer,"" she told detectives. ""If I killed Travis, I would beg for the death penalty."" The police video also showed her doing bizarre behavior when left alone in a police room: she began stretching and doing handstands. In another police interview, Arias blamed Alexander's killing on intruders. ""They didn't discuss much, they just argued,"" Arias told a detective. ""About what?"" the detective said. ""About whether or not to kill me."" ""For what reason?"" ""Because I'm a witness,"" Arias said on video. Then came a moment of high courtroom drama: the packed gallery sat in stunned disbelief when Arias took the stand in her defense. ""Did you kill Travis Alexander on June 4th, 2008?"" the attorney asked her. ""Yes, I did,"" she said. ""Why?"" ""Um, the simple answer is that he attacked me, and I defended myself,"" Arias said. But the jury didn't buy it and convicted her of first-degree murder.","NEW: Defense lawyer says Arias had abusive childhood, personality disorder .

"(CNN) -- For almost 90 years, the casket lay beneath the earth, Thomas Curry's family believing the teen who died too young rested in peace there, in an unmarked plot with his great-grandparents. Curry was a charge of Marianna, Florida's Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, a now infamous juvenile detention facility that closed in 2011 for budgetary reasons, capping a chilling, 111-year legacy of brutality. From 1900 to 1952, according to a court document, 100 boys died there, but only about half were buried on the reform institution's grounds. Others were shipped home to their families. Curry, 17, became part of that tally in 1925 when he died ""under suspicious circumstances while escaping Dozier twenty-nine days after arriving,"" says the court order permitting his exhumation this week. The coroner at the time ruled Curry's manner of death was unknown. The ledger entry at the Dozier school said he was ""killed on RR Bridge Chattahoochee, Fla."" Another document at Old Cathedral Cemetery in Philadelphia says he was ""killed by train."" No one from Dozier ever reported his death to the state. He was returned in a casket to his family, who, in turn, buried him in Philadelphia. Or so the family thought. It wasn't until a state investigation beginning in 2008 that Curry's death certificate was found at Dozier. It said he died of a crushed skull from an ""unknown cause."" And it wasn't until Tuesday, when University of South Florida anthropologists who have been working to unearth and identify remains on the former campus visited Philadelphia with Pennsylvania authorities, that the family learned Curry wasn't in the casket -- no bones, no clothing, no sign of him at all. ""Wood. Layers of pieces of wood,"" said anthropologist Erin Kimmerle, explaining what she and her team found in the casket. ""It was completely filled with wooden planks."" At first, the team thought they had the wrong grave, but then they found Curry's great-grandparents beneath the wood-filled casket. 'Decades of efforts to deceive' Kimmerle was still incredulous Wednesday, as was Cpl. Tom McAndrew of the Pennsylvania State Police, who along with Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Brendan O'Malley, was instrumental in clearing the path for Kimmerle's team to exhume Curry's remains, she said, . ""It was a little bit of a shock. It was certainly anticlimactic,"" McAndrew said. ""Something was shipped up from Florida, and it was buried, and someone believed it was Thomas Curry."" Does he think, as a law enforcement officer, that the finding is indicative of school officials' intent to deceive Curry's family nine decades ago? ""Absolutely,"" he said, but it's not surprising when you consider that the investigation into the Dozier school has uncovered ""decades and decades of efforts to deceive, coverups, and not just by one but by many people."" McAndrew has been in contact with two of Curry's distant cousins, and while they weren't familiar with Curry or his death before Kimmerle's team began investigating, they've done what they could to advance the investigation, the police corporal said. They've provided names from their family tree and handwritten notes from their mother. One of the cousins, Eileen Witmier, who is 61 and is the granddaughter of Curry's mom's sister, provided DNA to identify Curry -- had he been found. ""Their interest lies in justice being served,"" McAndrew said of the cousins. Asked where his own interest lies, McAndrew gave a similar answer, but also noted that Kimmerle has been an invaluable ally to law enforcement. Quid pro quo among professionals . The ex-chief anthropologist for the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Kimmerle has conducted ""isotope testing"" in her lab to help McAndrew with homicide cases in Pennsylvania. For one particularly high-profile case -- a pregnant teen found dismembered in suitcases in 1976 -- Kimmerle's team analyzed the woman's hair and teeth. Via isotope testing, Kimmerle was able to determine where the woman lived based on the water she consumed while alive. Though police have yet to solve the case, they now know she was born in Europe and immigrated to the Southeastern United States at age 12, McAndrew said. ""When she turned to me for assistance, obviously I would've done anything for her,"" McAndrew said of Kimmerle. Kimmerle had hoped, of course, that Curry's remains would unravel some of the mystery surrounding his death. ""We went into it trying to answer questions,"" she said. ""What we have is more questions than answers."" But the investigation continues. Now armed with Witmier's DNA, Kimmerle's team can return to Marianna, about 65 miles west of Tallahassee, and attempt to match the sample to one of the dozens of bodies that have already been dug up on the 1,400-acre former campus. Though many of the boys died so long ago, it's important to find their family members, Kimmerle believes, if only because of the uncertainties surrounding their deaths and the controversy enveloping the supposed school where they died. A dubious legacy . That bodies lay there was never a secret -- 31 rusty, white crosses marked the resting places of victims who died from a dormitory fire, influenza, pneumonia and other causes -- but Kimmerle's team has found a total of 55 bodies there so far. Her team also has found records indicating that 22 boys who died at the school are unaccounted for. Already, Kimmerle and her colleagues have identified three sets of remains. One of those bodies was George Owen Smith, whose sister Ovell Krell, 85, told CNN in August she was elated that the seven-decade mystery surrounding her brother's death was finally solved. Though ex-students provided detailed accounts of vicious beatings, sexual abuse and disappearances, guards and administrators who are still alive have denied the beatings occurred. The state investigation in 2008 and 2009 said there was insufficient evidence of abuse at Dozier, but dozens of men, many of them now senior citizens, have come forward with stories. A support group for ex-students, dubbed The White House Boys, takes its moniker from the structure where boys say they were beaten with a leather strap attached to a wooden handle. They were whipped until their underwear was embedded in their buttocks, The White House Boys say. Some were beaten unconscious. Crying or screaming out would earn you extra lashes, they say. So while this week's exhumation didn't answer any of the myriad questions surrounding Dozier and its missing and dead boys, it was still an important part of the ongoing investigation, researchers and police said. ""It definitely had to be done,"" McAndrew said. ""We had to at least open the grave if this investigation down in Florida is going to be resolved."" Remains of 2 more boys identified at shuttered Florida reformatory . CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","Anthropologists, authorities exhumed casket of Thomas Curry in Philadelphia this week .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, Malala Yousafzai became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. But just a day earlier, she passed the two-year anniversary of the gruesome event that flung her and her cause onto the world stage -- the attempt on her life. Malala was riding home from school on Tuesday, October 9, 2012. Gunmen halted the van ferrying her through her native Swat Valley, one of the most conservative regions in Pakistan. They demanded that other girls in the vehicle identify her. Malala had faced frequent death threats in the past. She was pointed out. At least one gunman opened fire, wounding three girls. Two suffered nonlethal injuries, but bullets struck Malala in the head and neck. The bus driver hit the gas. The assailants got away. Malala was left in critical condition. An uncle described her as having excruciating pain and being unable to stop moving her arms and legs. Doctors fought to save her life, then her condition took a dip. They operated to remove a bullet from her neck, and extracted a piece of skull to relieve pressure on Malala's brain because of swelling. After surgery, she was unresponsive for three days. Recovery in the UK . Malala was taken by helicopter from one military hospital in Pakistan to another, where doctors placed her in a medically induced coma so an air ambulance could fly her to Britain for treatment. Little more than a week after being shot a world away, Malala got back on her feet again, able to stand when leaning on a nurse's arm at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England. It was nothing short of a miracle that the teen blogger, who fought for the right of girls to get an education, was still alive and even more astounding that she suffered no major brain or nerve damage. Less than three months after being gunned down, she was discharged from the hospital to continue her rehabilitation at her family's new home. A groundbreaking surgery later repaired the damage to her skull. Malala a global movement . Beyond her hospital room, a world sympathetic to her ordeal has transformed her into a global symbol for the fight to allow girls everywhere access to an education. The bloodletting sparked outrage inside Pakistan against the radical Islamist group, which continues to wield influence in parts of the country. Around the world, the young blogger became a poster child for a widespread need to permit girls to get an education. In Pakistan, the airwaves filled with leaders and commentators who publicly got behind her, and journalists closely followed her story, drawing death threats from the Taliban for their coverage. Her story spread around the world, and world leaders took up her cause, particularly former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The United Nations launched a campaign for girls' education named ""I am Malala,"" which Brown guided as special envoy on global education. And it declared November 10 Malala Day -- a day of action to focus on ""Malala and the 32 million girls like Malala not at school."" Malala's activism goes on . Malala founded the Malala Fund, which invests in local educational initiatives for girls in Pakistan, Nigeria and Kenya, and in Jordan, where it focuses on Syrian refugees. And she continued to advocate around the world for a girl's right to an education, speaking before the U.N. Last year, she was a contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, but did not win. She was modest about her prospects then, saying a win would be premature. ""I think that it's really an early age,"" Malala said. She wanted to do more to earn it first. ""I would feel proud, when I would work for education, when I would have done something, when I would be feeling confident to tell people, 'Yes! I have built that school; I have done that teachers' training, I have sent that (many) children to school,' "" she said. ""Then if I get the Nobel Peace Prize, I will be saying, Yeah, I deserve it, somehow."" Last year, she also was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Parliament, and she published her autobiography, ""I Am Malala"" on her struggle to get an education. World support for her cause has not deterred the Taliban from pursuing her death. After her book's publication, they renewed their threat. They also vowed to attack any bookstore that sold it. Extremists out to get her . Malala's struggle for education for girls and against the Pakistani Taliban predates the attempt on her life. Since she was 11, with the help of her father, a schoolteacher, she had encouraged girls and their families to resist extremists who pushed girls from classrooms. In January 2009, the militants issued an edict ordering that no school should educate girls. Malala wrote in her online diary, published by the BBC, about intimidation tactics the Taliban used in the Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan to coerce girls into not going school. They included house raids to search for books, and Malala had to hide hers under her bed. The extremists took issue with her blogging and issued the first threats to kill her. ""I was scared of being beheaded by the Taliban because of my passion for education,"" she told CNN three years ago. Despite her fears, she stayed in the public eye, giving media interviews about her struggle for education in the face of oppression. Friday's peace prize may be the most prestigious Malala has received, but it is not her first. At home, her writings garnered her Pakistan's first-ever National Peace Prize in late 2011.

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 47 people were killed and 79 were wounded Monday by a suicide bombing outside a school in northern Nigeria, police said. The attacker was disguised as a student when he set off the explosion in a government boarding school in the town of Potiskum, police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu said. ""We suspect Boko Haram is behind the attack,"" Ojukwu said. The explosion took place at 7:50 a.m. local time outside the principal's office, where students had gathered for a daily speech. ""We were waiting for our teachers to come and address us at the assembly ground when we heard a huge explosion,"" student Adamu Ibrahim said. It was not immediately clear how many of the casualties were students. Although no oneâ€Ž has claimed responsibility for the attack, Boko Haram is the prime suspect. The radical Islamic militant group has carried out deadly attacks on schools teaching Western curriculum. In February, Boko Haram gunmen killed at least 40 students when they opened fire and threw explosives in student hostels in a government boarding school in the town of Buni Yadi, in Yobe state. And last year, 42 students were killed when Boko Haram gunmen attacked dormitories with guns and explosives in a government boarding school near Potiskum. Bring Back Our Girls: Meet the man who never gave up hope . Potiskum, the commercial hub of Yobe state, has been repeatedly targeted by deadly attacks blamed on Boko Haram. Just last week, a suicide bomber blew himself up in Potiskum amid a large crowd of Shiite Muslims holding the annual Ashura ceremony to commemorate the murder of Imam Husseyn, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. That blast killed 15 people. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but Boko Haram was suspected.

"London (CNN) -- They've spent 10 years together, swinging by the Earth and Mars on a cosmic roadtrip that has taken them to a mysterious celestial body but on Wednesday they are due to separate -- the parting marked with farewell photographs. Watch Rosetta's incredible journey . The Philae landing craft that is due to touch down on the surface of a comet hurtling towards the Sun will snap some images of the mother ship Rosetta after it breaks its bonds and embarks on its seven-hour descent to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko -- 67P for short. Rosetta has already become the first probe to orbit a comet, and, if successful, Philae will notch up another achievement by becoming the first craft to land on one. Led by the European Space Agency (ESA) with a consortium of partners including NASA, scientists hope to learn more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the solar wind -- high energy particles blasted into space by the Sun. Some believe water may have been brought to Earth by comets, or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life. This mission may shed new light on the theory as Philae is equipped to detect organic chemicals on the surface. ""It's quite extraordinary that we are able to do this -- to track a comet and see the evolution of a comet. We have a ringside seat,"" said ESA lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke. Rosetta comet landing: 'We can do amazing things, if we dream big' ""This is the first time this has been done -- to land on a comet, to follow it."" But the landing on November 12 is fraught with difficulty. Engineers cannot steer Philae once it has separated from Rosetta and the trajectory has to be programed. Choosing a suitable set down point has also been problematic. Rosetta's survey from orbit revealed an irregular shaped body that is littered with boulders -- and scientists needed to find a site that is in enough light to charge Philae's batteries. O'Rourke says there's lots of risks and puts their chances of success at about 70%. ""You have to face reality,"" he said. This was the best of the five possible landing sites -- we've got what the comet has given us. It's the best of the worst. ""There's craters, crevices, boulders, gravelly areas. It [Philae] could tip over. The comet is a very strange structure and there's a lot of luck involved,"" he said. The comet's gravity is so weak that there's also a danger that Philae could bounce off so it has been designed to grip on like a limpet. O'Rourke explained that at touchdown, harpoons from two of the three feet fire into the surface and the attached cords rewind to help anchor the craft. A thruster on top of the probe fires to push down the probe, and screws on each foot bore into the surface -- all within 15 seconds of landing. If it works then the surface science can really begin. Philae will capture a high-resolution image of the landing site just before it sets down and then return a panoramic picture from its seven cameras on the top edge of the craft. Even the harpoons have another use. ""This is very cool,"" said O'Rourke. ""Accelerometers in the harpoons can measure the deceleration so you get a very good idea of the 'hardness' of the surface. It's an amazing what Philae can do,"" he said. Mission controllers will face a nail-biting wait for first news from the spacecraft. At landing, O'Rourke says the comet will be more than 500 million kilometers (310 million miles) from Earth so a signal from the probe will take just short of half an hour to reach us -- and more than an hour for the first pictures. Philae carries nine instruments that ESA says will measure the density and thermal properties of the surface, magnetic fields, gases, and the interaction between the comet and the solar wind. It also has a drill that can bore up to 20 centimeters (12.4 inches) into the comet and return a sample to a tiny oven that will heat the material and analyze its content. Philae has an initial 65 hours of battery life but scientists hope they will be able to recharge and continue working for three months. After that, they believe the comet will be so close to the Sun and the temperature so intense that Philae will not be able to operate. Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society in London says if the landing succeeds it will be an amazing achievement. ""Rosetta matters because it's the first time we'll be able to see and analyze a comet from its surface. Hopefully we'll also have the incredible experience of watching that surface change as the comet swings in towards the Sun. It might just be that Philae lands right next to an erupting jet that spews out the material that becomes the cometary tail."" Comet 67P is already giving off a dust jet as it is warmed by the Sun -- something that can be seen from recent Rosetta images. O'Rourke says that the coma (the gas around the comet) already extends to 19,000 km (11,875 miles) but the comet will eventually have a tail 100,000 km (62,000 miles) long as its orbit takes it closer to the Sun. The comet will make its closest approach to the Sun in August 2015 before returning to the outer solar system. Philae may not be working then but ESA mission controllers hope that Rosetta is still returning data a year from now. You can follow Rosetta's progress on ESA's blog .

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- Final arguments were heard Wednesday in the case of a California couple accused in Qatar of deliberately starving their 8-year-old adopted daughter to death. Matthew and Grace Huang, who were present in the Doha court, deny charges of murdering their daughter. Gloria, one of three children the couple adopted from Africa, died in January of last year. A verdict in the case is expected on March 27. The prosecutor, repeating the arguments he gave in the last hearing in the case, argued that the evidence proved the Huangs had deliberately starved Gloria. He said that in intentionally neglecting to take the girl to a doctor when they found out she had not eaten for days, the couple caused her death. Medical reports presented to the court concluded that the victim died of starvation and that her body was emaciated, he said. He also said that witnesses testified that the girl was locked up in her room as punishment and that she was deprived of food. The prosecutor also painted a picture of Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane people who had been cheaply sold their adopted child by her poverty-stricken parents in Africa. Brother says he saw her eat . Defense lawyer Sami Abou-Sheikha, who asked for an acquittal in the case, insisted on his clients' innocence and said Gloria died of reasons that had nothing to do with her parents' actions. Referring to the same reports as the prosecutor, he said the girl had an inflamed pancreas and lung, that her stool showed traces of food that was one or two days old, and that her bladder retained liquid. He also reminded the court that Gloria's brother had testified that he had seen her eat a short while before her death and that she had been playing with her siblings on that day. The attorney also said that Gloria always had water bottles in her room and, even if not, she had access to water from the bathroom in her room. Gloria also had a history of eating disorders, as shown by medical documents, he said. Travel ban . The Huangs appealed to the court to lift a travel ban preventing them from leaving Qatar and presented a psychiatrist's report indicating that their two sons were suffering as a result of their long absence. The U.S.-based doctor is overseeing therapy of the boys, who were separated from their parents after their arrest and taken back home with a relative. Their request to lift the travel ban was denied. ""We have lost our daughter, and our sons have lost their sister,"" Matthew Huang said outside the courtroom. ""This court has taken more than a year of our lives, and the process has only made it worse. In the midst of our innocence, we feel that we have been kidnapped, and we just want to go home."" U.S. Embassy representatives were also present for the hearing. Journalist Riham Schebl reported from Doha, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Grace and Matthew Huang deny murdering their adopted daughter, Gloria .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- It was 10 p.m. on Sunday and 22-year-old Michelle Li, a dancer, was supposed to be in her room doing homework. But when she saw mobile Facebook updates of police tear gassing pro-democracy protesters in downtown Hong Kong, she was too agitated to study. Grabbing her smartphone, she followed online postings to the protest site itself -- and soon had tear gas fired at her as well. Only then did she peel her eyes from her mobile device. ""While we were waging battle, we screamed out news to each other,"" she tells CNN. ""But before and after, I'd update people on the Internet."" It's a high-tech response to a high-stress situation. Armed with top-of-the-line phones on some of the world's fastest mobile networks, Hong Kong's young protesters are able to organize themselves at a lightning pace older generations of activists could have only dreamed of. ""The Internet is a critical reason these protests have exploded so quickly and so out of control,"" says Li. ""We all want instant news, and people are very unsettled."" Barely an hour after Li was sprayed by tear gas, many young people, clutching glowing smartphones, used group chat apps like WhatsApp and Firechat to set up a splinter protest some five kilometers (three miles) north of Hong Kong's downtown Central district. Just before the clock struck midnight Sunday, at least 1,000 protesters -- many heeding messages that had been posted online just minutes before -- suddenly flooded the main road in Hong Kong's Mong Kok shopping district, leaving police surprised and outnumbered. Then, in a coordinated move, dozens of young protesters parked vans and trucks in a tight formation, protectively surrounding protesters. The police seemed unable to respond, and withdrew from the scene. Along with many other parts of Hong Kong, Mong Kok remains occupied with protesters Monday evening. Crowd confusion . As protesters develop new ways to organize themselves online, it's become less clear who is leading. Last night, student protest leaders -- including high school striker Joshua Wong -- asked supporters to go home out of safety, but thousands of protesters continued joining protests after midnight. Rumors of an impending crackdown have also added to the confusion. One message forwarded to CNN contained a cell phone recording of a young man who claimed to be the son of a police officer. ""There will be 2,000 to 3,000 riot policemen tonight,"" said the voice. ""Please spread this, just don't quote my name."" Another image briefly sparked panic Sunday night, purporting to show Chinese military vehicles moving in toward the protest. They turned out to be photos from an unrelated date. To try and calm nerves, a group of 11 journalism students at the University of Hong Kong started a Facebook page with minute-by-minute protest updates that they claim to have verified. The page, launched less than 24 hours ago, already has over 70,000 followers. ""Not many of our friends really believe what they see on TV any more,"" says Gloria Cheung, 23, who helps run the Facebook page. ""But there are a lot of rumors causing panic on the internet."" ""Right now we just want to verify information, so people don't get confused."" Locals aren't the only ones looking for news, though. One group of volunteers has used social media to translate protest updates into thirteen languages, using the hashtag #UmbrellaMovement -- a reference to the umbrellas used by Hong Kong's protesters to shield against pepper spray. 'What's terrifying is, we're not scared' Despite the sophistication of their tools and the efficiency of their actions, students like Cheung and Li share a sense that the world they know is falling apart. ""It's such a shock for me and my friends,"" says Cheung. ""We have been living such a normal, protected, and comfortable life in Hong Kong. We never thought there would be tear gas explosions.'"" Li says it's frightening how quickly young people have adapted to chaos as a new normal. At first, she said her group of friends were scared of being arrested, then they were scared of pepper spray and then they feared being tear gassed. ""What's terrifying is, we're increasingly not scared -- and the police may have to deploy more terrible weapons to scare us."" The fear of bloodshed is perhaps felt most painfully by Hong Kong's older generation, who still have memories of Tiananmen Square etched into their minds. Li plays a WhatsApp voice message she was forwarded last night, from her former high school teacher. ""Hello students, this is your teacher, I'm safe right now, please don't worry,"" the woman says steadily. Suddenly, her voice wavers and cracks with emotion. ""But please, listen to me, don't come out any more, you are just high school students. You shouldn't have to face these scenes, please go home. ""Because I don't want anything to happen to you,"" she continues, now crying. ""If you are at the protest right now and you can hear the sound of my voice, please leave immediately, because we just don't know what's going to happen next.""","Hong Kong's youth protesters are using mobile apps to organize quickly .

"(CNN) -- A father and his two young sons were pushing a truck that had run out of gas down a road in December 2012, when a drunk driver plowed into it, killing the boys. The drunk driver was then shot dead at the scene of the crash near Houston. On Wednesday, a Texas jury handed down a verdict of not guilty to father David Barajas in the shooting, CNN affiliate KHOU reported. After the hearing, prosecutor Jeri Yenne stepped in front of cameras to say that she still believed that Barajas killed Jose Banda. Otherwise, the state wouldn't have prosecuted, she said. ""We also know that the jury did not believe that beyond a reasonable doubt,"" she said. ""We respect that."" During the trial Sam Cammack, Barajas' defense attorney, was able to cast some doubt on the charges. He told jurors that the blood of a third, unknown person was found in Banda's car. He accused authorities of jumping to conclusions. ""Obviously, at least how the evidence developed, they made up their minds at the scene that night and they never considered any other potential leads, even after the DNA came in,"" KHOU reported Cammack as saying. The victim was a gang member, the defense argued, and someone else shot him that night in his wrecked car. The prosecution called an eyewitness who testified that Barajas had left the scene, returned minutes later then leaned into Banda's car. He said he heard a gunshot but didn't see a gun. Barajas was relieved by the verdict. ""A lot of weight is lifted off my back. I'm still destroyed. I'm missing my sons,"" he said. Son David was 12, and Caleb was 11 when they died in the crash. Barajas and his wife have two remaining children. Barajas said he was praying not only for his family but for Bandas' as well. ""They lost a son, too,"" he said. ""This was a loss for everybody.""","David Barajas and his sons were pushing a truck that ran out of gas .

"(CNN) -- A young Indiana mother was gagged with chloroform and held captive for two months, forced to wear a dog collar tethered to an ""intricate restraint system"" and kept in a wooden cage built by one of her ""sadist"" captors, police said. The woman was repeatedly beaten and raped until a stranger risked his own life to rescue her, officials said. CNN does not name victims of sexual assaults, but the woman's accused captors are now behind bars, charged Monday with a litany of offenses. Police said the victim's ordeal began July 9, when the 30-year-old left the Evansville, Indiana, apartment she shared with her boyfriend after the two had a booze-fueled argument. She meandered the city's streets that night, bouncing between groups of friends before being spotted by Ricky House Jr., a man who was familiar to her, according to Chief Deputy Tom Latham of the Posey County Sheriff's Office. House offered her a ride. She accepted. Three days later, police said the woman's mother reported her missing after she failed to show up to a planned family outing. Over nearly two months, Latham said Evansville Police followed up on plenty of leads, ""they just never got the right lead,"" he said. The ride with House on July 9 became a 40-mile drive to the mobile home he shared with girlfriend Kendra Tooley in the small town of Stewartsville and the victim decided she wanted to leave, according to a police affidavit. ""(The victim) got up to leave,"" Evansville detective Tony Mayhew recounted in court documents, but ""Ricky placed chloroform over her mouth and nose (which caused) her to lose consciousness. (The victim) awoke to find her clothing cut off and she was bound to a bed within the trailer."" Throughout July and August, police said, House and Tooley kept their victim bound to the bed with zip ties or with ""an intricate restraint system."" Her captors treated her like a dog, forcing her to wear ""a red dog collar with a rope or leash attached to it,"" and forced her to stay inside a ""locked wooden cage"" that House built, according to court documents. Throughout her captivity, she was raped and beaten, she told police. Tooley told police that House, whom she described as ""a sadist,"" was ""attempting to impregnate (the victim) because (Tooley) was old and unable to have children of her own."" The victim was under constant restraint and supervision, according to police, and had seen nobody other than her captors until September 4, when Tooley invited her ex-husband to the trailer to show off the captive. ""(Tooley) slid over on the couch beside me and said 'I've got a girl back here in a cage.' Ronald Higgs told CNN affiliate WEHT. ""I said 'you got a girl back here in a cage? What are you talking about?"" The prisoner pleaded with Higgs to help free her. ""I didn't really know what I could do because I'm nowhere near the man I used to be,"" the 61-year-old father of girls told WEHT, ""but (I wasn't) leaving (that) house without her."" After his attempts to buy her freedom were rejected, police said the encounter turned violent and House retrieved his sawed-off shotgun. ""He stuck that shotgun right here under my chin with his finger on the trigger,"" Higgs told WEHT. ""I said if you're going to effing kill me you better do it now or I'm going to take this away from you and beat you to death with it."" Higgs said he was able to head butt House, who retreated into another room. It was then he was able to safely escape with the victim. House, 37 is facing 14 counts of rape, kidnapping, criminal confinement and battery, according to charging documents filed Monday by the Posey County prosecutor's office. Tooley, 44, was charged with 10 counts of rape, kidnapping and criminal confinement. A judge set House's bond at $500,000 and Tooley's at $150,000, according to the sheriff's office. WEHT reported the pair were assigned public defenders and the court entered a preliminary not guilty plea. The couple are due back in court October 1, but Higgs said he already knows what he'd like their sentence to be. ""I told the police ... I hope you all have some real small cells,"" he told WEHT. ""That's where they need to spend the rest of their lives, in a real small cell."" Police: Mother chained son to radiator for two weeks .

"(CNN) -- It's 45 years later but it's still a sunny day, sweeping the clouds away. ""Sesame Street"" debuted on November 10, 1969. Since then, it's entertained millions of children and adults. From learning to count to tackling tough issues like racism, Big Bird and the gang have used music and humor to both inform and delight. Here are five of some of the most adorable moments from the show over the years: . 1) Herry and John-John count to 20 . Ordinarily a little one might be afraid of a hairy, blue monster. But not when it's Herry the monster who offered an assist to a tyke named John-John as he tackled counting. John-John is also well known for counting backwards with Grover. A grown up John Williams III later appeared in the 1989 special ""Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting."" 2) Kermit and Joey sing the alphabet . This one recently made the rounds on the internet and was declared ""The Cutest 'Sesame Street' Moment Ever."" Joey is pretty adorable as she inserts ""Cookie Monster"" into the alphabet song. And who can resist when she and Kermit exchange some ""I love yous""? 3) C is for cookie . Two words for you: Cookie Monster. This one is a classic and we dare you to not sing along. It's good enough for us. 4) Norah Jones and Elmo don't know Y . ""Sesame Street"" is well known for its celebrity guest appearances and this one was especially precious. Norah Jones traded on the success of her song ""Don't Know Why"" to offer this lament for her missing friend, the letter ""Y."" Add Elmo to the mix and it's ridiculously cute. 5) Elmo and Lupita Nyong'o love the skin they are in .

"(CNN) -- The largest submarine hunt in Swedish waters since the end of the Cold War. A near collision between a Russian military plane and a Swedish passenger aircraft carrying 132 people. And the abduction of an Estonian official from the territory of the NATO member, only days after U.S. President Barack Obama visited the Baltic nation. Any of these three incidents could have led to direct military confrontation between Russia and the West, a new report suggests -- and they have all taken place within the past nine months. The incidents are outlined in ""Dangerous Brinkmanship,"" an analysis that lists more than 40 ""close military encounters between Russia and the West"" that took place in the eight months from March to October of this year. The report, by the European Leadership Network, classifies the submarine search, airline near collision and Estonian abduction as ""high-risk incidents."" It categorizes 11 other events as ""serious"" and suggests they could have escalated. Most of them involve Russian aircraft threatening NATO or its allies. Russia plans long-range bomber flights near U.S. shores . They include what appears to have been a mock attack on the Danish island of Bornholm, as well as Russian aircraft making passes at a U.S. Navy warship and a Canadian frigate, and several different incidents between Russian and Swedish planes. The dramatic events are an expression of Russian President Vladimir ""Putin's policy to claim (Russia's) proper place in the international system,"" to force the West ""to accept the fundamental change of the international order,"" said Russia expert Igor Sutyagin. ""Putin is trying to intimidate the West back to friendship with Russia,"" said Sutyagin, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. The London-based think tank focuses on defense and security. ""Putin openly said that Russia is a bear and a bear never asks anybody's permission to act as it wishes,"" Sutyagin said. The Russian Ministry of Defense, Russian Air Force, and Putin's spokesman all declined to respond to multiple CNN requests for response to the European Leadership Network report. Russian officials downplayed or dismissed many of the individual incidents at the time they were first reported. But NATO itself said at the end of October it had already conducted three times more intercepts of Russian planes in European airspace in 2014 than in all of 2013. There were four intercepts of groups of Russian aircraft in the last few days of October alone, NATO said. The European Leadership Network dates the upsurge in Russian activity to the conflict in Ukraine and Russia's annexation of Crimea. That prompted NATO to ""increase its military presence along its Eastern flank,"" including more air policing, more reconnaissance flights, more ships in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea, and more military exercises in the region, the report said -- all of which put the two sides in greater contact than before. The report speculates that Russia is testing and observing NATO and national defense systems and seeking propaganda victories by using force, or the threat of it, against its neighbors. The West's response will have repercussions far beyond Russia, RUSI's Sutyagin warned. ""It's not a matter of 26 combat planes flying somewhere,"" he said. ""There are many other people around the globe who would love to follow Putin's example. ""That is a very important wake-up call for American society, for European societies: It's necessary to defend your ideals, your prosperity, your wealth,"" he said. ""Dangerous Brinkmanship"" is based on media reports and statements from the Pentagon and NATO. CNN covered many of the incidents in the report, and is cited as the source for at least one of them. CNN's Alla Eshchenko in Moscow contributed to this report .","NEW: The West's response to Russia will have repercussions beyond the crisis, expert warns .

"(CNN) -- In an essay for Vanity Fair, famed model Beverly Johnson accuses Bill Cosby of drugging her in a meeting at his Manhattan residence in the 1980s -- adding herself to the list of women who have made accusations against the comedian in recent weeks. ""For a long time I thought it was something that only happened to me, and that I was somehow responsible. So I kept my secret to myself, believing this truth needed to remain in the darkness,"" she writes. ""Now that other women have come forward with their nightmare stories, I join them."" Bill Cosby facing litany of allegations . CNN has reached out to Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, but has not heard back yet. Johnson, a noted model in the 1970s and the first black woman to appear on the cover of American Vogue, says the alleged incident, which did not involve sexual assault, happened in the mid-'80s when Cosby was starring on ""The Cosby Show."" She was offered an audition for a small role on the hit program. ""I was in the midst of an ugly custody battle for my only child. I needed a big break badly and appearing on 'The Cosby Show' seemed like an excellent way of getting Hollywood's attention,"" she writes. After some initial meetings, including one in which Johnson took her child to Cosby's brownstone, she was invited back to Cosby's residence. She was working through acting exercises -- including one in which she acted drunk -- in front of the comedian when he asked her to have a drink from his cappuccino machine, she recalls. ""I knew by the second sip of the drink Cosby had given me that I'd been drugged -- and drugged good,"" she writes. Cosby then asked her to approach him. ""He put his hands around my waist, and I managed to put my hand on his shoulder in order to steady myself. As I felt my body go completely limp, my brain switched into automatic-survival mode,"" she writes. ""That meant making sure Cosby understood that I knew exactly what was happening at that very moment."" Johnson then repeatedly called Cosby a ""motherf*****."" ""By the fifth (epithet), I could tell that I was really pissing him off,"" she writes. Cosby yanked her down some stairs ""as my high heels clicked and clacked on every step. I feared my neck was going to break with the force he was using to pull me down those stairs,"" she writes. He then hailed a taxi and deposited her inside. There was a short postscript to the story. A few days later, she writes, she tried to call Cosby on a private number so he could ""come clean and explain why he'd done what he had."" Cosby's wife, Camille, answered the phone. When Johnson asked to speak to Cosby, Camille told her it was late and they were in bed. Johnson said she'd call back, but never did. ""In the end, just like the other women, I had too much to lose to go after Bill Cosby,"" she writes, adding that she was worried what telling the story would do to her career at a time when she was financially stretched because of her divorce. Johnson says she has wrestled with herself for years. She left the story out of her 2013 memoir because she ""didn't want to get involved in a he-said, she-said situation,"" she writes. Talking Friday morning to CNN's ""New Day,"" Johnson said ""it was only maybe 24 hours ago that I finally decided that, yes, this is what I wanted to do."" Her speaking up now was motivated in part to show solidarity with others, like her longtime friend Janice Dickinson (who says Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982, a claim attorney Singer has called ""a fabricated lie""), who have publicly accused Bill Cosby in recent weeks. And Johnson said that she hopes, by going public herself, to encourage anyone has been sexually victimized to speak out. ""This, to me, is not about Bill Cosby. This, to me, is about violence against women,"" she said. ""... What I want to see happen is that women come out and speak their truth.""","NEW: Beverly Johnson to CNN: I want more women victims to ""speak the truth""

"(CNN) -- The subject of erotica has a way of making people uncomfortable. Some might break into schoolboy titters in the face of mature art -- a harmless enough response when you stop to think that in the past, artists with a penchant for sexual depictions have actually been killed (or very nearly). Reverend Ted McIlvenna -- who, with 28 warehouses storing more than three million pieces of erotica, may own the world's largest collection -- recalls the life of Alexander Szekely, a Hungarian artist and collector who was ultimately put to death for his racy sketches. ""His work was hidden away for 30 years, and it's absolutely gorgeous stuff,"" says McIlvenna. In more recent history, there was the attempted shooting of pornography kingpin Larry Flynt, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. ""Erotic art hasn't had an easy route,"" admits McIlvenna, whose own trajectory has been anything but ordinary. An ordained Methodist minister, McIlvenna became a purveyor of the art form during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s, when he was often called in as an expert witness in a series of obscenity trials directed at the porn industry. In 1976, he founded the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality, where he currently houses some of his collection, and offers degrees in subjects of public health and sexological research. His interest, McIlvenna claims, is mainly academic, and while such a statement might draw ridicule in some circles (like claiming to read Playboy for the articles), he maintains that open access to erotica is pivotal not only in fostering an open society, but in education as well. ""I believe sex education through the arts is incredibly important. As I see it, the arts are a good way to help people to be less judgmental. It also helps give people an idea of what they can and can't do sexually, and I believe that everybody deserves a good sex life,"" he says. Over the years, a handful of sex-themed museums have popped up globally, aimed at forging a more open conversation on the topic. Here are some of the more unique offerings around the world. Harry Mahoney's Erotic Heritage Museum (Las Vegas) Formerly the Erotic Heritage Museum, this 24,000-square-foot space dedicated to all things sex closed its doors in February due to a falling out between the museum's founder and McIlvenna -- who loaned a good share of his collection. The good news is, the space reopened a couple months ago and, in addition to some of McIllvena's pieces, it will also exhibit examples of sexual hypocrisy in politics, religion and entertainment, strange sexual practices, insect genitalia and the history of sexology.

That's because it wasn't, until Sigurdur Hjartarson coined the term (which, incidentally, refers to the study of penises). Hjartarson founded the Icelandic Phallological Museum in 1997, a one-of-a-kind institution dedicated to the collection of mammal phalluses. Today his son Hjortur, who has grown the offerings to include 283 pieces, including a human specimen and a 165-pound, 5.5-foot long sperm whale penis, runs the museum.

Venustempel (aka, Sexmuseum Amsterdam) and Red Light Secrets (Amsterdam) It's hardly surprising that Amsterdam, often deemed one of Europe's freest cities due to legalized prostitution, is home to two sex-themed museums. Venustempel (Temple of Venus) has the honor of being the world's oldest and longest-running institution of this type. It's a small space, often crammed with tourists, and the collection remains fairly modest, with an assortment of Victorian pornography the main highlight. Red Light Secrets Museum of Prostitution opened earlier this year in a former brothel. The space offers a fascinating look into the everyday lives of prostitutes and offers a history of the profession, which was legalized in Amsterdam in 2000.

Museum of Sex (New York City) New York City's Museum of Sex has a gift for combining the academic with the just plain silly. In addition to a permanent collection of 15,000 erotic artifacts, the museum regularly hosts exhibits that can range from the informative (The Sex Lives of Animals) to the bizarre (a recent show, ""Funland: Pleasures & Perils of the Erotic Fairground,"" featured a breast-themed inflatable). The museum also features Play, a bar serving up bawdily named cocktails. Museum of Sex, 233 5th Ave., New York; +1 212 689 6337 . World Erotic Art Museum (Miami) Miami's World Erotic Art Museum (WEAM) hosts some of the most respectable erotica around. In addition to the curiosities that litter the 4,000-strong collection (a Karma Sutra-themed four-poster bed, a six-foot carved wood phallus) are works by Rembrandt van Rijn and Pablo Picasso. The museum's octogenarian owner, Naomi Wilzing, is invested in showing that there is more to erotic art than pornography; it can be fine art, and it can represent a window into different cultures. As a result, the museum showcases a range of art spanning both the globe and the ages. World Erotic Art Museum, 1205 Washington Ave., Miami Beach; +1 305 532 9336 . Tochka G (Moscow) The Russian capital may seem a strange spot for a sex museum, given the country's track record both with free speech and gay rights. But then again, museum founder and curator Alexander Donskoi doesn't much care for the current government. Some pieces on display are clearly aimed to provoke (the main attraction -- a painting by artist Vera Donskaya-Khilko that depicts Russian President Vladimir Putin doing naked battle with Barack Obama -- is a case in point). Other items -- such as Soviet-era condoms and pamphlets on VD -- offer onlookers a glimpse of what sex was like behind the Iron Curtain. On site is also a sex shop (Russia's largest), which sells everything from naughty-themed matryoshka dolls to sexy Aeroflot uniforms. Tochka G, Ul Novy Arbat 15, Moscow; +7 495 695 44 30 . Sex Machines Museum (Prague) As it happens, inventors have long been obsessed with tools to improve sex (or, inversely, abstain from it). Prague's Sex Machines Museum has a range of such gadgets on display, from 16th century chastity belts, to copulation tables (predecessors to the blow-up doll). There's also a cinema that shows early pornographic films. If nothing else, the space is tribute to the inventiveness of the human mind -- particularly when it comes to sex.

MusEros (St Petersburg, Russia) St. Petersburg's MusEros made headlines in 2004 when it acquired a 12-inch human penis supposedly belonging to the ""Mad Monk,"" Grigori Rasputin (the claim has not been verified). Either way, Russia's first erotic museum houses a great collection of historical paraphernalia, with particular focus on the sex lives of former Russian rulers. They even have a ""naughty chair"" that supposedly belonged to Catherine the Great. In addition to lifting the veil on sex, the curators hope to provide visitors with a fresh perspective on how sexual practices differ from culture to culture, and ultimately evolve over time.

El Museu de L'Erotica (Barcelona) Barcelona's El Museu de L'Erotica takes an artistic and historic approach by including work by some of the great masters (Picasso made enough erotic art to go around), as well as a historic look at Spanish pornography.

Secret cabinet, National Archeological Museum (Naples, Italy) The Roman Empire had an acute appreciation for erotic art. Such was made evident during a 19th-century excavation of the ruins at Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy. Alas, the freewheeling art that was uncovered proved too much for the socially conservative mores of the Victorian era. Well-endowed statues depicting various gods, sexually explicit oil lamps and a sculpture of Pan co-mingling with a goat were all moved to Naples' National Archaeological Museum, where they were eventually locked up inside a secret cabinet, opened only for the purview of well-educated gentlemen. The cabinet was frequently opened and closed to the public, depending on the conservatism of the regime in charge. In 2000, the collection was again opened, this time to women as well. 19 Piazza Museo (+39 081 442 2149), Naples, Italy; +39 081 442 2149 .","In recent years, several museums dedicated to erotica have popped up around the world .

"(CNN) -- Paul Kitterman, a Denver Broncos fan who disappeared during a game five days ago, has been found and is safe, the Denver Police Department tweeted Tuesday night. Kitterman was located some 112 miles away in Pueblo, Colorado. Police directed questions to Kitterman's family. They tweeted that there was no reason to suspect a crime was committed. Kitterman, 53, vanished while waiting outside a bathroom at Sports Authority Field at Mile High on Thursday, where the Broncos were playing the San Diego Chargers. He had gone to the game with his stepson, Jarod Tonneson, and two friends, who sat in another section in the stadium. According to one of the friends, he was last seen waiting for Tonneson, who was using the restroom just after halftime. Tia Bakke, one of Kitterman's friends, said this type of behavior is not customary of him. He was not intoxicated, and he had no mental health issues, she said. According to CNN affiliate KUSA-TV, Kitterman didn't care for credit cards and was carrying about $50 in cash. ""Paul is the best guy you could ask for. They don't make them like Paul anymore,"" said Bakke, who met Kitterman through her boyfriend, who has known Kitterman for a decade. Authorities had treated the disappearance as a missing person's case, but told Bakke they believed Kitterman just walked away from the game. He had been a passenger along with Tonneson and Bakke, whose boyfriend drove to the game from Kremmling, Colorado, which is northwest of Denver.

"(CNN) -- Reports of sex assault in the U.S. military are up by half, another startling annual figure around a problem the Pentagon believes is still under-reported. But the Defense Department said the sharp year-over-year increase for fiscal 2013 largely reflected steps to encourage more people to come forward if they've been assaulted. And Pentagon leaders acknowledged they've still got a long way to go, and have put special emphasis on getting male victims to file claims. ""The best way to combat this crime is to prevent it,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said after his department released the latest figures in a report. The numbers break out this way: There were 5,061 sex assault reports in the 2013 fiscal year, which ended last September 30. That represents a 50% increase from the same period the year before. There is no indication the spike was due to an overall increase in actual incidents, officials said. Hagel said victims of sexual assault are ""not only human beings, they are fellow soldiers, sailors and Marines. We cannot let them down."" The issue received heightened attention from the Obama administration and Congress after last year's report also showed a troubling jump in reported sex assaults. A serious problem . Rep. Niki Tsongas, co-chair of the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus and the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Subcommittee for Oversight and Investigations, said the figures continue to indicate a serious problem. ""The rise in reporting is encouraging, possibly signaling that legislative and military changes from recent years are having a positive impact,"" she said in a statement. But Tsongas added better reporting and other steps to address the issue ""does not obviate the simple fact that these heinous crimes continue to occur at an alarming rate, to both men and women."" Sex assault in the military has become a major concern for the Pentagon. Senate clears military sex assault prosecution bill . An anonymous survey from 2012 found that nearly 26,000 service members said they were the victim of an incident of sexual assault or unwanted sexual contact. But only a fraction actually filed a report. Issue involves generals, too . President Barack Obama demanded the military brass ""leave no stone overturned"" in efforts to prevent abuse. Directives from this year's report include calls to advance and sustain an appropriate culture within the military to report incidents as well as increased efforts to evaluate commander training in dealing with the issue. There have been several instances in which senior officers, including generals, have been accused or charged with a variety of actions that constitute sexual assault. Some actually oversaw programs that sought to combat sexual assault. The report also calls for a review of alcohol policies and highlights an effort to improve levels of reporting for male victims, long thought to be an under-reported demographic. According to military law, sexual assault is defined as intentional sexual contact characterized by use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or cannot consent. Tougher action in Congress fell short . It also includes categories of sexual offenses that include rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy, or attempts to commit these acts. The issue also generated outrage in Congress, which approved reform measures last year that included a provision preventing commanders from overturning convictions. The Senate sought to take things further, approving legislation this year imposing modest reforms to strengthen prosecution. But proponents of tougher action were disappointed the chamber rejected a proposal that would have altered the way crimes like sex assault and rape are handled. Survivors of military sex assault frustrated with legislation .","The latest annual figures compiled by the Pentagon show a 50 percent increase in reports .

"(CNN) -- One of the world's most successful horse racing operations has undergone a major reshuffle in an attempt to close the stable door on a damaging doping scandal. The changes come after the publication of a report into Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoun's Godolphin stable, which criticized ""management failings, insufficient oversight and complacency."" The report was commissioned by Sheikh Mohammed -- the ruler of Dubai -- after Godolphin's former trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni was banned by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) in April 2013, having been found guilty of administering anabolic steroids at the operation's stables in Newmarket, England. In the reshuffle, Godolphin's long-standing racing manager Simon Crisford has resigned, though he will take up a new role as a racing adviser to Sheikh Mohammed . With the position of racing manager no longer existing, responsibility for horses will be devolved to trainers Saeed bin Suroor of Al Quoz Stables and Godolphin Stables and Charlie Appleby of Moulton Paddocks and Godolphin Marmoom Stables. ""They will be the people ultimately responsible for their particular stables; they hold the delegated authority of the owner as defined by the condition of their license,"" said a Godolphin statement. Al Zarooni is serving an eight-year ban after 22 horses tested positive for anabolic steroids. The BHA has also banned 15 horses trained by the 37-year-old for six months. Sheikh Mohammed was cleared of any wrongdoing by former Metropolitan Police commissioner John Stevens' report, which concluded that Al Zarooni had acted alone in the doping scandal. ""Having dealt with the events of last year and seen the Lord Stevens inquiry through to its conclusion, I thought that this was a good moment to bring my time at Godolphin to a close,"" Crisford, who has been Godolphin's manager since the stable was created over 20 years ago, told the Racing Post. ""I had felt for a while that I would like a fresh challenge. I think the time is right for a new start for the stable and for me. ""Sheikh Mohammed has asked me to take on a new role as his global racing adviser. I am delighted to have accepted that position and I am very much looking forward to what will be an exciting new chapter for me.""

"(CNN) -- Ever since we saw him pop up on ""The Walking Dead"" last season, we've been wondering: Does Eugene really have the cure for the show's ""walker virus""? Sunday night's episode gave us a definitive answer to this burning question: Eugene is a fraud; he's not a scientist and doesn't actually know how to cure the plague. We spoke to Josh McDermitt, who plays Eugene, about his time on ""The Walking Dead"" and what might be next for the character (that is, assuming he's OK after being beaten up by Michael Cudlitz's Abraham). Also, we talked mullets: . CNN: Were you surprised at the truth about Eugene, or were you told ahead of time? Josh McDermitt: When I booked the role, I knew that Eugene wasn't a scientist, but I didn't know it was gonna come this season. When I sat down with (executive producer) Scott Gimple at the start of the season, we started to detail everything in vague terms about what's gonna happen for the character and the season. He said, ""In episode five, we'll find out he's not a scientist."" I was like, wow, I didn't expect it to come that quick. I thought it would play out over the season. For it to happen that quickly, it will be fun to see where Eugene heads next -- if he's alive! CNN: What do you think of Eugene's true motivation? McDermitt: I think we'd all be scared in this apocalypse. Some people have the strength and agility to rise to the top, and then there's people like Eugene who have to improvise and figure out a different way to survive. Abraham says it's to the point where everyone still alive is really strong, and either they help you or you kill them. Eugene looks at himself as not having anything to offer to the group. It's a scary place. I will defend the guy in terms of wanting to survive. I don't know if I would lie like that, but I'm just happy I didn't get Daryl killed or anything -- then everyone would hate Eugene for sure. Now they're just upset the hope is gone. CNN: What can you tell us about his current relationship with Abraham after this huge fight? McDermitt: It's not just that, it's the relationship he has with Rosita and Tara. He and Tara feel like outsiders, and she's trying to work her way back into the group. I think that's where Eugene will want to go: ""How do I get back into this group? How do I patch up the damage I've done and figure out where my place is in this group?"" There's a little bit of hope for Eugene, but at this point he's a broken man, starting over. CNN: How much did you know about ""The Walking Dead"" going in? McDermitt: I knew the comic but hadn't read it. Once I found out who it was I was playing, I went back and quickly caught up. It was very informative to see the choices (creator Robert) Kirkman made that they didn't necessarily go with (on) the show. I was able to bring some of that from the comics into the character and that brings something to what we're doing. I had to put it down for a while, because I was afraid I would influence it too much. I was a giant fan of the show and didn't want to be the one that ruined it. (laughs) CNN: So we have to ask: How do you like having a mullet? McDermitt: In the audition they're very secretive; they won't tell you the character name. The character they had me reading had a mohawk. I got so excited that I might have a mohawk. Then when I found out it was a mullet, I was like this is the only haircut I could get better. To be able to go on TV and be instantly recognizable as this guy representing so many lost souls in our country. I don't think we've had a good mullet on TV since Uncle Jesse from ""Full House,"" so I'm glad to bring it back. CNN: What is next for Abraham's army? McDermitt: At this moment, they're still together. We're not gonna flash-forward six months or anything. We'll see how the damage is repaired, and it's not pretty, I'll tell you that.","'The Walking Dead's' biggest mystery: Does Eugene hold the key to curing the ""walker virus""?

"(CNN) -- Experts are putting forward all sorts of reasons Mexico recently became more obese than the United States -- and one of the most overweight countries in the world. Poverty, tacos, urbanization, soda. Those are the widely discussed culprits. And they, along with the choices people in Mexico make, are no doubt part of the story. But there's an uberfactor here: Mexico's neighbor to the north. Could one reason for Mexico's growing, deadly obesity problem be that the country is unfortunate enough to share a border with the United States -- land of the Coke, home of diabetes? I started thinking about that issue after seeing news bounce all over the Internet that nearly a third of Mexicans now are obese, compared with 31.8% of Americans, according to a recent report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Maybe U.S. trends such as fast food, fried food and soda drifted south. It reminded me of a smart Economist story I read in April. ""Perhaps for Mexicans, the biggest problem is living next door to the United States, which means the fast food and super-sized culture has a particularly strong influence,"" the British magazine wrote. ""So do the American food and drink giants who sell vast quantities south of the border and have already proved adept at fending off sin taxes and other forms of anti-obesity regulation in the United States."" I called up Dr. Juan Rivera, director of the research center on nutrition and health at Mexico's National Public Health Institute, to see what he thought of this theory. Rivera didn't blame the United States, but he did blame ""sugary beverages,"" which the United States produces and markets. Mexico's soda-and-sugar-water consumption numbers are staggering. The average Mexican drinks 163 liters of sugary beverages per year, Rivera said, which tops the world. That's almost nine cans of soda per week. A rising middle class as well as the prevalence of greasy street food, including tacos and quesadillas, also accounts for much of the problem, said Christopher Wilson, an associate at the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute. But Mexico's rich neighbor also plays a role in (here's the crucial part) shaping the country's tastes, he said. ""Potato chips are very popular, as is drinking lots of soft drinks,"" Wilson said. ""But we see similar trends not only related to food and junk food but, at a broader level, commercial tests in Mexico are fairly closely linked to tastes in the U.S. And that's because of the intensity of cultural interactions"" between the countries. This influence applies to other countries, too, of course. According to the FAO report, 1.4 billion (yes, billion!) people worldwide are overweight and 500 million are obese. The fast-food-ization of the world, and the health problems that have followed, started with America and have spread far and wide. At a certain point, though, does it matter where the problem started? Rivera, the public health official in Mexico, was quick to claim obesity as a problem Mexico has to own -- regardless of its origins. ""I think there is more influence of the fast food industry (and) the sugary beverages in Mexico than in other countries as a result of being neighbors to the U.S.,"" he said. ""... But I think that globalization is such now that you see very, very similar things in many other countries, even in countries that are less developed. So I would not blame too much on the U.S. The problem is ours, and we have to solve the problem."" Some important steps already are being taken. Mexico banned soda in schools, Rivera said, and might soon propose new programs to combat obesity. Mexico's close relationship with the United States, however, means that America and its corporate proxies should share the responsibility of implementing solutions. ""Let me remind you,"" Dr. Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, said in a June speech at a conference in Finland. ""Not one single country has managed to turn around its obesity epidemic in all age groups. This is not a failure of individual willpower. This is a failure of political will to take on big business."" It does matter where these deadly trend originated -- and who started them. The least the U.S. could do is be a better neighbor. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","U.N. report says Mexico is now more obese than the United States .

"(CNN) -- American drivers across the country are rejoicing at falling gasoline prices, but the world's oil producers are understandably less thrilled at the drop in revenues. That discontent could devolve into something more serious: instability, and even unrest. And that, in turn, would drive prices back up, leaving no one feeling happy. This is a hard cycle to break. Ultimately, there's only one way out, and that's to depend less on oil, for both producers and consumers. In the meantime, the U.S. economy will just adjust to lower prices, even if that adjustment is painful for some companies and their investors. That may be true almost nowhere else in the world. A number of oil-producing countries may have trouble paying their bills if oil prices stay below a certain level. Expert opinion generally puts that level between $80 and $100 per barrel, but given how much money goes missing in most oil-producing countries, it's hard to be sure about that breaking point. No one really knows the price elasticity of corruption. In countries that are already experiencing unrest -- and unrest often goes hand in hand with oil wealth -- any shortfall could spell disaster. Some producers are more vulnerable than others. Norway, for example, will be fine. The country has a fairly diverse economy, a well-run national oil company that plays by the rules, and a democratic government. Saudi Arabia, like Norway, has a large sovereign wealth fund, which the country is actively using now to weather price volatility. There may even be a silver lining for the U.S. in the case of some countries. For Russia and Iran, already feeling the bite of international sanctions, the domestic pressure that comes with low prices may prompt their leaders to be more accommodating in international negotiations. At least for now. It's the countries that are already in deep trouble, such as Iraq and Libya, that are truly at risk. Oil income has been propping up embattled central governments, but with less money to ensure political and popular support, and the ongoing assaults, these governments could fall. But there are other less obvious, but no less consequential, producers at risk. Consider Nigeria, an important global supplier with the 26th largest GDP in the world. Nigeria should have everything going for it, but instead, the country ranks 153rd out of 187 countries in the United Nation's human development index, rating low in everything from life expectancy to education. The nation's highly corrupt energy sector is partly to blame. 2015 is an election year for Nigeria, and if the unpopular President, Goodluck Jonathan, lacks the patronage dollars to spread around and won't step aside, expect problems. Venezuela is not much better off. Still an important trade partner for the U.S., the country's oil production is in steady decline, even though Venezuela has the largest petroleum reserves in the world. The Chavez era was tough on Venezuela's once-respected national oil company, featuring political purges and a devastating strike. If the increasingly decrepit energy sector can no longer bankroll social programs, that will roil an already unsettled population. Energy subsidies to other Caribbean nations may well be the first thing to go, and U.S. refiners will feel the bite, too. One of the top energy trading partners for the U.S., Mexico, has seen its production drop by almost a quarter in the last decade. Mexico's largest field, Cantarell, has long been in decline, and the national oil company lacks the technical expertise to drill new deepwater sites. The Pena Nieto government is currently shepherding through reforms that could change that picture, but lower prices could be a complication, given that 30-40% of government revenues come from oil. All of this instability is bad news for U.S. national security -- but also for the American consumer. This is the cruel full circle of the global oil market: unrest provoked by low oil prices in these countries can run prices back up. The United States is still a net importer of petroleum, and even if that should change -- which is possible -- the United States will remain tied to the global oil market. Their crises will be our crises. So, while it's nice to get the break at the gas pump and the economic benefits of an energy boom at home, the national security price of oil remains high. In the near term, the United States should be doing everything it can to diversify global energy suppliers, including allowing exports of U.S. crude oil. In the long term, the only way out is a sustained, long-term investment in the alternatives to petroleum. This is a critical but not a quick fix, given the scale of global oil consumption and the technological challenges involved. It would help to be strategic and consistent in these investments: innovation in the transportation sector is especially important, for example, given its near-total dependence on oil. Of course, if the U. S. succeeds in energy innovation, that will in itself be destabilizing for other oil-producing countries. Ultimately, the only way out is for them is to diversify their economies and promote good governance and rule of law for their energy sector. That is something they have to do for themselves, but the U.S. should do everything it can to press, persuade, and support such reforms as a matter of national security, no matter how much oil we produce at home.

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite being out of office for more than two decades, former President George H.W. Bush has been a regular feature in political news this year -- receiving awards for volunteer work or jumping out of planes to celebrate his birthday -- and this week he kicks up his schedule right as his last name is again buzzing with presidential speculation. Bush 41 will receive a prestigious award for his work as his presidential center observes the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, a major milestone which occurred during his presidency. He then will appear with his son, former President George W. Bush, in a public event as he unveils a biography he has written about his dad -- an occurrence which is sure to draw a lot of public attention on both of them, their relationship and the Bush presidencies. On Monday the European Parliament awarded the elder Bush the Robert Schuman Medal, which recognizes public figures who have advanced the cause of peace, the construction of Europe and human values. He is the first American to receive the honor. ""Throughout his long career in public service President Bush was always mindful of human rights and the need to advance the cause of peace in the world,"" said former Ambassador Ryan Crocker, dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University. That is where the presentation occurred during a conference commemorating the wall's fall and will include key officials from Bush's administration -- his national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State James Baker. On Tuesday, Bush and his wife Barbara will be on hand at a very different type of event. Their son will unveil the biography he wrote ""41: A Portrait of My Father,"" which is described as a personal look his father through his own eyes. Bush 41, a prolific letter writer, never wrote an autobiography but did release copies of many notes he penned throughout his life to family, friends and colleagues giving the public a glimpse of his personal thoughts and impressions of his life and career. In his new book George W. Bush not only discusses the professional highlights of his dad but also his influence on his own life -- growing up in Texas, recounting early campaign trips with him, his decision to go into politics then following in his footsteps into the White House and the decision to go to war in Iraq -- a country which dominated both Bush presidencies. Now the elder Bush just saw a new generation of his family enter government service. His grandson George P. Bush won statewide office in Texas capturing the politically powerful position of Land Commissioner in a landslide and is looked at as a rising star in the Republican Party. Bush 41 now waits to see whether his son former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will run for the White House as he has urged him to do -- although other members of the family have not embraced a possible third President Bush as enthusiastically. ""Forty one believes strongly that Jeb would be a superb president and very much hopes he will run. Mrs. Bush also knows - and has stated several times - that Jeb would be a superb leader in the Oval Office, but what mother wants to see their son or daughter attacked and pounded the way she saw it happen to her husband and eldest son? As John McCain often says, presidential politics 'ain't bean bag,'"" Bush 41 spokesman Jim McGrath told CNN. The elder Bush also has kept his hand in politics this campaign year endorsing several successful Republican candidates, including Georgia Senator Elect David Perdue. In an interview with NPR Bush 43 talks about one moment -- the 1992 speech accepting the Republican Party's presidential nomination -- when Bush 41 did not meet his son's expectations. ""I was very disappointed, not in him, but in the process. And he gave - he did give a flat speech [at the 1992 Republican National Convention] and it frankly wasn't full of many interesting ideas. It was kind of defensive. And there's a couple of lessons there about this moment. One is - is that if you're gonna give a big speech, get it written early and get used to it,"" George H. W. Bush told NPR. ""Get comfortable with it because it enhances the delivery. And secondly, that if you expect to win political races, you better have strong policy platform. And they were playing - they were kind of playing small ball at this point, and presidents have got to have bigger agendas.""","Former President George H. W.

"(CNN) -- When will homophobia in the United States start seeming so ridiculous it's laughable? Not in 2013, it seems. Certainly not this week. On Thursday, the governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Corbett, grinned as he compared, in a television interview, same-sex marriage to a brother marrying his sister. ""I apologize to anybody who feels offended by that,"" he said later. Feels offended? Please. That's offensive. Worse, football players and other students from Ole Miss reportedly heckled a Tuesday night performance of ""The Laramie Project,"" a play about a gay college student, Matthew Shepard, who was tortured and murdered in 1998. They yelled anti-gay slurs, including the three-letter f-bomb, the play's director told the university newspaper. ""This behavior by some students reflects poorly on all of us, and it reinforces our commitment to teaching inclusivity and civility to young people who still have much to learn,"" two university officials said in a prepared statement. Homophobes and the football teams that harbor them understand they should apologize. Maybe that should be seen as an improvement. But it doesn't seem genuine to me. These apologies are designed to placate the gay community, not embrace it. The comments themselves are reduced to the realm of political gaffes instead of being seen for what they are, which is hate speech that contributes to gay kids committing suicide and to parents rejecting kids who come out to them as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender. So, how to respond? One route has been taken by writers like Edward Aschoff at ESPN and Greg Couch at FOX Sports. They've called for Ole Miss to find and suspend the football players who yelled the slurs. Another way to react -- the one I'd prefer -- would be to laugh these inane remarks off because they're so isolated and aren't indicative of attitudes in modern America. But that's clearly not the case yet. I spent two weeks in Mississippi earlier this year talking to LGBT people, both closeted and open. The state is hostile to them. Celebrate same-sex marriage in California all you want, but in Mississippi, and in many other states, gay people not only can't get married, but they also can be fired by their employers, evicted by landlords and denied the right to adopt children simply because of their sexual orientation. Related: The county where no one's gay . These comments aren't random or isolated. They come from a place of deep-seated ignorance about homosexuality and gay people that leads both to hateful slurs and backward legal arguments. Silencing those voices won't do the trick. They need to be won over. The university is taking a smart step by requiring all students who attended the play on Tuesday night to participate in a ""dialogue session"" about the hate speech. But I'll also propose a symbolic response: Root for Ole Miss. If you're going to their game versus Auburn at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, or to other games this season, wear something to indicate your support for the LGBT rights movement. If you're staying home, tweet a photo or put it on Instagram with the hashtag #gaysforolemiss. Or, if that feels weirdly new-media-for-the-sake-of-it, just tell a friend that you hope Ole Miss wins the game. (Dear Auburn fans: I don't hate you. Please don't e-mail me.) One problem I encountered in Mississippi is that LGBT people are largely invisible. They can be out and open about who they are, but their friends and neighbors are comfortable ignoring them, pretending they don't exist, or pretending that's not who they are. The antidote: Be seen. And give people a chance to change. Show the football players that Gay America is on their side -- that we want to see them succeed. And if you can't do it for them, do it for Garrison Gibbons, who told the Daily Mississippian about what it was like to be the only openly gay member of the heckled cast. ""... [T]o be ridiculed like that was something that really made me realize that some people at Ole Miss and in Mississippi still can't accept me for who I am."" If you're in Mississippi, prove him wrong. If not, show him you've got his back. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Ole Miss football players reportedly heckle a performance of ""The Laramie Project""

"(CNN) -- John Sutter: Hi Will, So the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing two cases on same-sex marriage this week — one on California's (Proposition) 8, which bans same-sex marriage; and one on the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Regardless of how the justices rule on these issues, I'm pretty sure 2012 or 2013 will be remembered as the ""Year of the Gay."" Republicans, business leaders, the president -- everyone seems to be coming out in favor of LGBT rights. The culture shift (in most parts of the country) has been incredible. How did that happen so fast? It used to be political suicide ... Will Cain: ""Year of the Gay""? Can you say that? Can I say that? What are the parameters here? I'm genuinely curious ... is ""gay"" as a noun offensive? For example: ""The gays are interested in today's Supreme Court case."" Or is it the ""the"" that makes it feel like a sword of political incorrectness cutting through the conversation? I need help here John. Sutter: The gays say it all the time! Usually half-sarcastically. It's one of those appropriation things. Picture a preacher shaking a fist and railing about ""THE GAYS!"" It's designed to steal their thunder. Cain: Hmmm. So I can't use it until I come out. While I agree the culture is shifting, it hasn't yet shifted. And I fear the outcome of today's Supreme Court case could stop the shift in its tracks. This is a fear held not only by conservative and liberal legal scholars, but also by one of the Supreme Court justices. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has said the Court ""moved too far, too fast"" with Roe v. Wade and shouldn't have struck down abortion laws in ""one fell swoop."" It's not that she disagreed with Roe, just that she recognized the backlash of freezing the abortion debate in cryogenic chamber for the last 40-plus years. I think this tells us two things: . 1.) A grand pronouncement from the Court puts an end to the debate at the ballot box and could push both camps into their polar foxholes. 2.) It suggests the Court may look for a narrow decision, possibly just affecting California, on whether states can ban gay marriage. One thing it doesn't tell us is what is right or wrong or where the legal arguments should take the Court. Only the effect the Court has on society. As for how this is all happening so fast ... that's a great question. It took thousands of years for society to settle on the fact that slavery was wrong. This by comparison is taking place over a 50-year time period. What do you think? Sutter: On the ""the gays"" thing: You can use it anytime. You have the blessing of the gays. (At least one...) On the court: I hope the justices are influenced by right and wrong — not by what they fear will be the reaction of the public. I hear ya on the kick-back point. A pro-same-sex marriage opinion would make lots of people angry. And there are plenty of corners of the country where being gay is still not OK (I went to one recently for this op-ed on the ""county where no one's gay""). But I hope the justices realize legalizing same-sex marriage would strengthen families and support inclusion/equality. Both of those sentiments would trickle down through America. And, after the initial freakout, we'd all be better people for it. As for why this happened so fast? No clue. But I'd guess Ellen (DeGeneres) had something to do with it. Cain: Ellen, Will from ""Will and Grace,"" Andy Cohen, Omar from ""the Wire,"" Rosie O'Donnell ... actually I'm not sure the last two have done anything to advance acceptability. We joke, but those people played a big role because they made it easier for ... ""your gay friend."" And ""your gay friend"" has had a huge impact on how society views the gays. (See, I tried out ""the gays"" thing. Didn't feel right.) Look, I support gay marriage from a policy/voting booth perspective. I also happen to think that gay marriage bans like Prop 8 are violations of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection clause. And I suspect including gay marriage under the umbrella of ""marriage"" will strengthen families. But I'm not sure. That was a big part of the Supreme Court hearings. We have very little data on the effects of same sex marriage and - for example - the effects on child rearing. The question then became: is caution a valid state interest to discriminate? Alito asked this question. Kennedy asked this question. Scalia asked this question. Ultimately, I think not. But I think it's a worthy question. Sutter: I'll go ahead and disagree with you on that. Asking whether same-sex marriage is fully blessed by social science is like asking, in 1967, whether data support interracial couples getting married, or being parents. I get why it's coming up, but it's offensive on some level. Ask kids who were raised by same-sex parents. Many will say, as this kid did during a hearing in the Iowa House, that they're doing just fine. Plus there are lots of same-sex couples who would want to get married and don't want to have children. The more fundamental question is whether LGBT people are equally human. And if so, why our laws don't reflect that. Cain: I think one of the fundamental divides between progressivism and conservatism is conceit versus humility. Your anecdotes of kids raised by same-sex parents or the kid at the Iowa House hearing are compelling. But they are still anecdotes. And as Justice Kennedy, Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, and Justice Sotomayor all recognized today...we have 5 years of data on gay marriage versus 2,000 on traditional marriage. This is all to point out that the position (a position I hold) that gay marriage won't have detrimental effects should come with some humility. We can't see the future. You are right that ""detriment to child rearing"" was the same argument used to support bans on interracial marriage. The argument was wrong then. And I suspect it's wrong now. My point is: I don't think this is a compelling reason to discriminate. I don't think the procreation reason, the harm-to-traditional-marriage reason, or the tradition reason are compelling reasons to discriminate. But I say that humbly. Sutter: Amen, brother. So what do you expect the Supreme Court to do about all of this? Cain: Not much. Here are the four potential paths the Court could take with Prop 8: . • 50 State Solution - Declare that all state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. This does not look likely for all the reasons we've discussed. • 9 State Solution - Declare that you can't get halfway in. This requires states that recognize civil unions to recognize those unions as marriages. If the justices liked anything less than the 50 State Solution, it was this option. They seemed to feel that it punished states who afforded gay couples more rights than those who offered gay couples nothing at all. • California Only - Declare that you can't grant marriage rights and then take them away, as happened in California. This seems likely to me as they ruled similarly in a Colorado case. • Reject the Case - The justices didn't even seem to want the case before them, questioning if anyone had ""standing"" to bring the case. If they find there was no standing to appeal this case it will effect, essentially, the California Only option. So I don't think much will happen outside the state of California. And this debate will continue. Sutter: You may be right on the outcome, but every day this legal debate drags on is a big slap in the face to the notions of equality and fairness that were the founding principles of this country. Simply because of who they are, gays and lesbians aren't allowed to get married in most states, can be fired for their sexual orientation in 29, can be evicted from their homes in just as many. As I've written for this site before, these laws create a climate of fear that keeps people hidden, encourages gay people not to speak out and contributes to disproportionate rates of suicide and homelessness in the LGBT community. LGBT people, I've argued, live in 50 Americas. It's completely unsustainable and unfair. And it will change. No question on that. Just hope it's sooner than later. Ready for me to drop the mic? Have anything you want to add? Thanks for having this discussion, by the way. Cain: All good. This was fun. I tell you something though John, when it comes to DOMA, it didn't seem like the Supreme Court wanted to talk about any of the issues we just discussed. They didn't want to discuss equal protection much at all. The justices pressed for a source of federal power to regulate marriage. Without that DOMA goes down.

"(CNN) -- A nonprofit's attempt to expose -- and stop -- the degrading street harassment women face every day has turned dangerously ugly. Last month, HollaBack, an international movement dedicated to ""developing innovative strategies to ensure equal access to public spaces,"" released a hidden camera video of Shoshana Roberts walking down the streets of New York City, just minding her own business. According to the video, during the 10-hour filmed experiment, more than 100 men made unwanted, unprovoked and sometimes unnervingly harassing remarks toward Roberts. In a matter of minutes after its release, the video went viral. And with this, the story took a drastic and disturbing turn as an aggressive backlash took place. Threats to rape and kill her were posted across the Internet as part of an assault that seemed intent on humiliating and silencing not only Roberts, but any woman who dares to speak up against inequality and expose the truth about how women are treated in our society. This was not the first time such an attack was mounted against a woman advocating for gender equality. A month earlier, actress Emma Watson endured a similar attack. In September, Watson stood before the United Nations, where she spoke eloquently about the virtues of an equal society -- a world in which men and women enjoy freedom and security in equal measure. Her call to action excluded no one and threatened no one. But almost before this speech could be digested, a website featuring a timer was created to count down the hours and minutes until naked images of Watson would supposedly be released. One report suggested the countdown was a hoax run by Internet spammers. But the fact that Watson would be a target after her speech is in itself extremely telling -- and intimidating. Sadly, systematically silencing women through rape threats and revenge porn has become the newest weapon in the war on women. In fact, weaponizing women's bodies -- whether by making rape threats or disseminating unwanted and compromising images of women's bodies -- are crimes, violations that are born of a deep-rooted hatred toward women and a drive to shame into submission any woman who dares to speak out. These threats are not just happening to high profile women, but to women and girls everywhere. It is happening to girls in high school, when private naked images and rape threats are viciously sent into cyberspace as revenge for their refusal to comply with the wills of the boys at school. It's happening to celebrity women advocating for gender equality. It's happening to women who dare speak up on behalf of the rights of all women. This devastating crime is gender specific. It is a hate crime against women. Let's look at this another way. Imagine that there were a rash of threats targeted only at LGBT individuals, gay celebrities and gay youth under constant threat of rape and sexual violence. Or imagine this was happening to only people of color. When such hate-fueled acts are targeted specifically at another historically oppressed group in our society, then they are seen for what they are, a hate-based violation. And we would express outrage and rally to the defense of the victims of this crime. You don't have to look too far to see how women are dehumanized in popular culture. On TV and in film, we are bombarded with images of women's bodies that are often bloodied and bruised, naked and dead. These bodies are presented as little more than that -- just bodies to be bought and sold, rented and brutalized. It's no wonder that men and young boys become desensitized and think it's OK to objectify, harass and threaten women who challenge the sexual status quo. Women's bodies -- those amazing, life giving, powerful bodies -- are being weaponized by personal images that are disseminated against their will. This is, of course, is just one aspect of the war on women, but it is one of the most insidious and damaging. It is time that we were collectively outraged -- men and women -- about the use of sexual threats online. It's time to stop turning a blind eye. It is time for the silencing of women stop.","Response to HollaBack campaign turned ugly: Lauren Hersh and Aimée Lagos .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- High in a rugged, mountainous region in Myanmar's north, the country's army remains locked in a conflict that seems to contradict the image of a nation committed to abandoning its brutal past. Days after a government-ordered ceasefire on January 19, clashes were reported between Burmese soldiers and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) around the town of Laiza on the Chinese border. The Myanmar government said its troops were ordered to fire only in self-defense, but the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), the KIA's political arm, claimed it was under attack . Laiza is the headquarters of the KIA and the KIO. Around 20,000 people live there, and thousands more are sheltering in temporary camps around the town after being driven from their homes, according to human rights groups and other reports. ""People who live in Laiza, they are standing by to flee. Every day they hear bombing and the noise of guns. The government is saying that it's stopped the offensive, but the reality in the Kachin area it has not stopped, and the fighting and the offensive is ongoing,"" Moon Nay Li, coordinator for the Kachin Women's Association told CNN on Tuesday. Though based in Thailand, Moon Nay Li said she'd been speaking with people in Laiza who were ""afraid for their future."" She said they were digging holes to shelter from the shelling, and were desperate for the fighting to stop. Why has fighting intensified now? In a statement dated January 18, the Myanmar government said that it had requested back up from the Air Force to ensure ""accurate hitting of KIO/KIA targets"" after repeated attacks on convoys seeking to resupply an outpost near Laiza. It accused the KIA of blasting roads and bridges, attacking troops and recruiting and abducting civilians to aid its fight. Despite the government's self-defense claims, Matthew Smith, a consultant to Human Rights Watch (HRW), told CNN the government appeared to have recently stepped up attacks on Kachin fighters, possibly in an attempt to gain more ground and leverage in any future peace talks. ""Some of the strategic outposts that the Burmese government has been attacking over the last several weeks are strategic to the protection of Laiza so I think that appears to be the target,"" said Smith, who wrote a damning report for HRW on the conflict between the two sides called ""Untold Miseries - Wartime Abuses and Forced Displacement in Burma's Kachin State,"" which was released in March 2012. How long have they been fighting? The Myanmar army and the KIA -- which formed more than 50 years ago -- have been trading shots since a series of incidents brought a sudden end to 17-year ceasefire in June 2011. Smith said tensions rose after leaders of the KIO were unable to participate in the November 2010 election -- the first vote to be held in Myanmar in 20 years. According to Smith's report, the Burmese army launched a ""major military offensive"" on June 9, 2011, to which the KIA rapidly responded by blowing up bridges, planting land mines and ambushing military convoys. At the time, conservationists claimed the two sides were fighting for control of a multi-billion dollar hydropower dam project on the Taping River, one of several being built in the region. However, dams are not the only source of tension in the area, Smith said. It is also rich in mineral deposits, including the jade mines of Hpakant, a source of some of the world's most valuable stones. And pipelines snake through the state delivering lucrative oil and gas to China. How has the world responded? News of the escalation of attacks in Kachin has raised concerns outside the country as the international community keenly watches Myanmar's transition to democracy from a military regime. ""We're obviously deeply troubled by the increased violence,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a news conference in early January. Later, China urged both sides to ""exercise maximum restraint"" after a bomb landed about 500 meters over the Chinese border on January 15. ""We believe that talks are the only correct solution to the north Myanmar conflict and expect all related parties to seek a ceasefire and start negotiations,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei on January 22. The United Nations welcomed President Thein Sein's calls for a January 19 ceasefire but the Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Myanmar, Vijay Nambiar, said it did not want renewed tensions to ""undermine the overall direction of reform and transformation in the country or adversely affect the positive international atmosphere that had been generated so far."" Since coming to power in March 2011, Sein has won praise for steering the country on the path of reform, easing media restrictions, granting amnesty to political prisoners and opening up the political system to competing parties. How committed is the government to peace? Days after the apparent failure of the ceasefire, Sein reiterated that he wanted the fighting to stop. ""I have ordered the Tatmadaw (Myanmar's military) and other relevant government agencies to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict,"" he told Myanmar's first Development Cooperation Forum on January 21. He also suggested that the KIO would need ""to reciprocate in a similar way."" The KIO is the only one of 10 armed ethnic groups in Myanmar that hasn't yet agreed a long-term ceasefire with the government. Talks would start soon with the other ethnic groups, Sein said, as he again extended an invitation to the KIA to join the process. ""My government will continue to do everything necessary to turn ceasefire agreements into lasting peace,"" he said. ""It is very important to create job opportunities in order to improve socio-economic conditions of internally displaced people and ceasefire groups,"" he added. How have civilians been affected by fighting? Since June 2011, tens of thousands of Kachins have been terrorized by renewed fighting, according to HRW. More than 90,000 people have been forced from their homes, according to the latest estimates. However, the exact number of internally displaced people -- or IDPS as they're known -- is hard to confirm because the government has limited access to the region. The lack of access has worried aid agencies who say tens of thousands of people are being denied vital care. ""The government feels it's unsafe so they're not granting access,"" said Maria Guevara, Medecins San Frontiere's Humanitarian Representative for ASEAN. ""We've tried to support some of the areas with drug supplies but the roads that we've used in the past are generally inaccessible, because that's where the fighting usually takes place, so it's been difficult to resupply."" She called on the government to allow humanitarian agencies ""independent and neutral access"" to affected areas, while Smith warned of ""a looming humanitarian emergency."" What are the chances of a long-term ceasefire? There are no easy solutions to resolve the unrest in Kachin. It dates back to the early 1960s when the KIO and KIA were established to protect the interests of the Kachin people against the influence of the central government. The KIO still has administrative control over most of Kachin State, providing schooling, teacher training colleges, a police service, a TV station, newspapers, libraries and hospitals, according to the Free Kachin Campaign website. HRW says the latest offensive has deepened divisions between the Kachins and the government, which threatens to spill over into other ethnic groups. ""You have an entire population of ethnic Kachin who for the most part right now are very bitter towards the Burmese government and that's going to be a serious problem, not only for Kachin state but the other ethnic nationalities throughout the country right now who are negotiating peace agreements. ""They're taking all this into consideration so this could pose a serious problem for long-term peace in the country,"" he said.","Renewed fighting reported in Kachin despite government ceasefire order .

"(CNN) -- Dear Justice Scalia, . Like everyone on the Internet, I read with interest your recent interview with New York magazine's Jennifer Senior. Many sections were intriguing, including your firm belief in the existence of the devil and your passing fondness for ""Duck Dynasty."" You're a fascinating person. But one passage troubled me deeply. Not because of what they say about you, but because of what they say about me and us and this great country that we call the United States. It would be easy for me to laugh off the interview -- to write a column with a few ""argle-bargle"" or ""fairyland castle"" references. All in a day's work at the digital snark factory, right? More ""blurbing things on the Internet,"" to borrow your words. I'm not going to do that. Because when you, the Supreme Court justice who has power over my rights as a gay citizen, said that you ""have friends that I know, or very much suspect, are homosexual,"" but that you don't have any friends who are openly gay, I was at first shocked and then puzzled and then saddened -- both for you and for all of us. ""Have any of them come out to you?"" Senior asked. Your response: ""No. No. Not that I know of."" At first that seemed unbelievable. How is it possible to live in 2013 America -- to be one of the most important and powerful people in 2013 America -- and not have any friends who are openly gay? Then I thought about it a little more. I'm gay, but, growing up in Oklahoma, I don't think I was friends with an openly gay person until I left the state, after high school. I've traveled around the country, to places such as Mississippi, where there are still people who aren't sure whether gays exist, much less whether they should befriend them. And I looked into the numbers. You're far from alone. According to a 2013 Gallup poll, a quarter of Americans said they, like you, do not have ""any friends or relatives or coworkers who have told (them), personally, that they are gay or lesbian."" Meanwhile, respondents listed having gay and lesbian friends as the fourth most common reason for supporting same-sex marriage. Many people -- especially the ""shrilly liberal"" media -- would blame you for not knowing anyone who's openly gay. It would be hard to expect to be accepted by someone who wrote, in 2003, that Americans who don't want gays to work as teachers, business partners or scoutmasters are ""protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive."" ""I would write that again,"" you said in the New York magazine interview. That's unfair, and it's a sign you're from another time -- that you need to do more to widen your influences, reading material and social circles. But I also don't blame you, personally. I blame all of us, including the gay community. The U.S. gay rights movement, as I'm sure you know, was founded on the idea that openness creates social and political change. It's easy to see how this is still true in Russia and Uganda, the centers of violent struggle for dignity for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. A transgender Ugandan man, Pepe Julian Onziema, recently wrote for this site that ""visibility is magical for those of us who once roamed the land like ghosts."" Until I read your interview, though, I'd forgotten how much this ""magical"" visibility is needed in modern America. In the age of Anderson Cooper and Ellen DeGeneres, LGBT people have become invisible anew, hiding in plain sight. Either we're afraid to speak up, as was the case with the LGBT people I met in Mississippi, who can be fired from their jobs and evicted from their rental properties for doing so. Or, on the other end of the spectrum, we're demagogues -- screaming so loud we're no longer heard. At least not by that quarter of America that still doesn't know us. We've stopped listening, too, and stopped reaching out to the people like you whom we too often see as enemies and bigots -- and not as people. ""We don't know the other side anymore,"" Dahlia Lithwick wrote for Slate. ""We don't even know anyone like the other side anymore. We can't even believe those people exist anymore. And maybe this is really what the devil's been up to."" I agree. And that's why I'm extending my hand in friendship. Not as some gay-hater snare trap, but as a genuine offer to talk through these issues if you'd like. I'd be honored to be your friend. I promise not to judge you. You, like me, are shaped by your personal experience. I'm sure there are plenty of things we share. I can quote ""Seinfeld"" and I sometimes question the narcissism of Facebook, too. All I would ask is that you withhold your judgment of me as well -- and to seek, whether it's from me or one of your closeted gay friends, to understand where we're coming from and why so many of us are offended by your opinions. I know that will be hard for someone who wears a black robe for a living. But it's also the first step in mending two countries into one.

"(CNN) -- The Rolling Stones have postponed the rest of their tour of Australia and New Zealand, according to a statement on the band's website. The move comes in the wake of the death of Mick Jagger's longtime girlfriend, fashion designer L'Wren Scott. Scott was found dead Monday in her New York apartment from an apparent suicide. The 49-year-old was discovered hanging from a door knob with a scarf around her neck, said a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. ""Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood wish to thank all of their fans for their support at this difficult time and hope that they will fully understand the reason for this announcement,"" the statement said. ""The Rolling Stones are planning to reschedule these postponed shows at a later date."" Scott had been dating Jagger, 70, since at least 2003, and the rocker was often a fixture at his girlfriend's fashion shows. MickJagger.com, the singer's official website, posted the following statement Tuesday: ""I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me. I have been touched by the tributes that people have paid to her, and also the personal messages of support that I have received. I will never forget her."" The same statement was also posted on Jagger's Facebook page where fans left messages of encouragement for the singer, including, ""My deepest condolances mick, there are no answers for these kind of situations"" and ""peace, mate."" A representative for the New York Police Department said the New York medical examiner will determine the cause of death as the investigation continues into what led up to it. CNNMoney reports the designer's business was facing mounting losses and debts. CNNMoney: L'Wren Scott's business was in trouble . The fashion industry registered shock at the death of the famed designer whose fashions graced such luminaries as first lady Michelle Obama, Madonna and Oprah Winfrey. Scott was beloved for her designs as well as her personal fashion that she honed as a model for designer Thierry Mugler in the 1980s before she began a steady climb, first as a stylist, and later with her own label. ""She was so tall and so glamorous, so unlike anyone else you'd ever seen,"" Amy Larocca of New York magazine wrote. ""She was easy in her six-foot-three skin as she'd sit down to watch the models parade their narrow pencil skirts, their snug little cardigans, and their general air of film-noir fantasy up and down the runway."" In a reflection of Scott and her early career in The New York Times, fashion writer Suzy Menkes noted, ""As a much lauded but discreet stylist, she became a power behind the Hollywood thrones."" Menkes added, ""The discretion that the designer showed in her work was mirrored by her attitude as a partner to a rock icon. Her clothes suggested a strong and feisty woman, yet she remained a very private person."" Scott was once quoted as saying, ""I'm a fashion designer. I don't want to be defined as someone's girlfriend,"" and following her death several observers took exception with the media focus on her relationship with Jagger. Fashion writer Nico Bellay tweeted, ""My thoughts are with Mick, but her name is L'Wren Scott, not 'Mick Jagger's Girlfriend."" Another admirer of Scott's work, Johanna Fuentes, tweeted, ""L'Wren Scott was a renowned designer, successful model and stylist. Can we not reduce her to being called Mick Jagger's girlfriend?"" There was also buzz surrounding the timing of a reported picture on Scott's Facebook page. The New York Post reported that following her death a pre-written post with a picture showing several dresses hanging from trees appeared on the designer's Facebook page and tweets were sent from her Twitter account, causing some to question if news of her death was a hoax. The social media accounts have since been deleted.","Concerts in Australia and New Zealand postponed after death of designer L'Wren Scott .

"(CNN) -- Why dream of a white Christmas? People in the upper Midwest are fully expecting a white Veterans Day on Tuesday. An icy blast out of Canada is expected to drop a swath of snow from Idaho down through South Dakota and northern Nebraska and over to northern Michigan. An earlier-than-usual deep freeze in the Midwest will follow, sending cold but not frigid temperatures to other parts of the United States by Thursday. In Saint Paul, Minnesota, CNN iReporter Katie Robinson was surprised by the early advent of winter weather. She woke up Monday to find snow on the ground. ""This is the first snow I've seen this season, and it's a major snowstorm, rather than the usual light dusting you'd expect to start off the winter with,"" she said."" I think that's the biggest thing -- that we went from a very warm and mild fall to now being thrust so abruptly into winter."" Minneapolis got several inches of snow on Monday and expected more on Tuesday morning. But heavier snow fell not far away. St. Augusta, Minnesota, about 70 miles northwest of Minneapolis, reported a whopping 16.5 inches of snow Monday, according to the National Weather Service. ""Right now it's freezing to the roads, creating slippery conditions,"" said Sgt. Andy Rose of the Stearns County Sheriff's Office, a jurisdiction that includes St. Augusta. ""Plow trucks are having trouble with it. It just throws cars in ditches. ""We've managed to get everybody home. We don't have anyone stuck at convenience stores or service stations. It's very slow going though."" Temperatures plummeted on Monday across the Midwest. In Billings, Montana, the Sunday high was 53, but on Monday, it barely got into the 20s. By Tuesday, it will be only 8. The weather is the result of a ""bomb cyclone"" -- a swiftly and markedly intensifying storm -- that shifted the path of the jet stream and sent cold air rushing toward the United States, CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. A weekend buzz . But people in the North know how to deal with snow. It even excites them. ""This has been the buzz this weekend,"" Greg Graves, an employee at Mel's Trading Post in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, told CNN affiliate WJFW. ""Everyone is talking about the storm that we are supposed to be getting. Most of our customers love to be outdoors so everyone is really looking forward to it,"" he said. In Eau Claire, Jason Stuttgen told CNN affiliate WQOW the snow's coming at the perfect time. ""Especially two weeks before gun hunting (season), that's always going to help the deer move,"" he told the station. Despite the enthusiasm, some problems were evident. Flightaware.com reported that 153 flights were canceled Monday at Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. That's a lot, especially considering only 225 cancellations were reported across the entire United States. Slippery roads were reported throughout the region. Minnesota State Patrol spokesman Lt. Eric Roeske said troopers responded to 475 crashes from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday, 45 with injuries and one fatal. He reported 702 spinouts and incidents of vehicles running off the road. In Wisconsin, a school bus slipped off a road in Outagamie County, according to CNN affiliate WBAY. No students were hurt, but the driver and an aide were taken to a hospital for evaluation, the station reported. The coming snowfall could snap tree limbs and branches, bring down power lines and cause widespread outages, said CNN meteorologist Tom Sater. ""It's OK to get a nice cold snap now and then, but this one could be dangerous,"" Sater said. The northern Mountain States, the Plains and the Midwest are not the only targets. Much of the nation will feel the punch of cold weather, if not quite as hard, according to CNN meteorologists. ""I think we're all going to be feeling the bite,"" CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. Prefer snow or cold? It's hard to decide whether the snap will be more bearable in Sunburst, Montana, or in Rice Lake, Wisconsin. If you prefer bitter cold over deep snow, you might like it better in Sunburst. It didn't exactly live up to its name early Monday with a low of 4 degrees predicted by the National Weather Service. And that was nothing. By Tuesday night it should drop to 11 below zero, and it won't rise above 6 degrees through Thursday night, the NWS forecasts. Snow fell there early Monday and was expected to continue through Tuesday, but only about 3 inches should accumulate. Not enough snow for you? Then Rice Lake is your place. Fourteen to 22 inches were forecast for Monday and overnight into Tuesday, then 2 to 4 inches for Veterans Day on Tuesday for a whopping total of 16 to 26 inches. Broad sweep south . The cold snap will bring lows in the teens and single digits into Iowa, Kansas and Colorado this week but also spread freezing temperatures as far south as Texas. ""Much of the nation east of the Rockies is expected to see a major pattern change by the beginning of the work week,"" the weather service said. The frosty blast will move across the rest of the United States but not be as harsh as in the Midwest. Atlanta and Birmingham, Alabama, are expecting daytime high temperatures of 46 on Friday, according to the National Weather Service. That was close to the nighttime low for both cities on Monday. But even in the thick of it, some places will pull the longer straw. Milwaukee should see more rain than snow, Chicago the same, and temperatures there should be relatively mild, the weather service said. Thanks, Nuri! Residents in the northern United States can thank a whopping Pacific tropical cyclone for the wintry blast. Super Typhoon Nuri was akin to Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy rolled into one. It had the strength of a category 5 hurricane, CNN's Sater said. It is the strongest Northern Pacific post-tropical cyclone on record, the NWS said. Its remnants explosively intensified up north over Alaska's Aleutian Islands last week and plowed into cold air, which added violent energy to the storm. It was similar to what happened with Superstorm Sandy in the Atlantic two years ago and earned the storm the little-used ""bomb cyclone"" moniker. The hybrid storm rammed into the jet stream, causing it to whip south, dragging Arctic air down with it. It also continued to spin, Sater said, further fanning down polar cold. The biggest chill arrives on Wednesday and Thursday. Things will get warmer over the weekend, but it won't stay that way, he said. Another Arctic blast is on its way for next week.

"(CNN) -- Seven months of marathon training have made my 30-year-old knees feel like those of a person decades older. At times, I've hobbled down stairs and winced unexpectedly. If I owned a cane, I'd shake it at the trim women who run past me while pushing strollers full of infants -- and the gazelle-ish teens who spring by at two to three times my running pace. Griping about irritating run-spiration T-shirts that say things such as ""Preserve the Sexy"" is a coping mechanism -- a way to distract myself from the somewhat-frightening marathon I signed up to run, like many of you, in response to the Boston Marathon bombing. Until Monday, I wondered if I could finish. That was the day I had a conversation with a Boston bombing victim who, after three surgeries, ran her first marathon a few weeks ago. Before that, I worried about ""Mile 20,"" which is when many runners quit. In most marathon training programs, you don't run farther than 20 miles before race day. It seems natural to a Woody-Allen brain that Mile 20 should induce panic. How are you supposed to get energy for those extra 6.2 miles, which will take me at least an hour to run? RELATED: 'Run for Boston' iReport group . All of those complaints and fears seemed so childish after I e-mailed with Lee Ann Yanni, a 32-year-old who was standing near the finish line in Boston in April when the bombs went off. Chips of wood and shrapnel the size of a half-dollar lodged themselves in her leg. Her fibula broke through the skin. Her eardrum popped. The doctors thought she was crazy, she said, when she told them she was going to run the Chicago Marathon. Before the bombing, she signed up for the race in honor of her dad, who died of cancer in October 2012. Injuries weren't about to change her mind. ""I'm not letting these fools take my first marathon away from me,"" she told the Boston Herald. Three months after the bombing, Yanni walked without crutches. In September, she ran for the first time since the surgeries, which removed the shrapnel, repaired the bone and grafted skin across the bottom part of her leg, pulling the flesh from her thigh. Yanni is a physical therapist in Boston, so she knew what she was up against. ""I know I wasn't ready to run, and I said many times that this was the dumbest idea I had ever had,"" she wrote to me, ""but no one argued with me. Guess they were smart."" RELATED: I'm running a marathon for Boston . A friend suggested she walk most of the marathon, but Yanni insisted she would run it within the 6 1/2 hour limit. ""I said, 'NO.' That's not even an option. It's not an option not to FINISH.'"" ""My dad fought his cancer for six weeks,"" she added, ""and I could suck it up and do whatever it took for 6 or 6 1/2 hours of 'pain.' He was a fighter, and I knew that it was in me in some form."" The world of running was new to me when I began this process. This spring, two miles stole my breath. I had to do a training program to be able to start the marathon training program. For all their quirks -- the Gu packets, the Band-aided nipples, the overendorphined Instagram feeds -- runners all seem to harness a sense of determination you don't find in day-to-day cubicle life. It can't be a question of whether or not you'll finish. You will finish. To believe otherwise is to fail, in a sense. I believe that now, but only because I've heard so many stories like Yanni's. Earlier this year, I traveled to Oklahoma City to watch Sara Hunt finish the marathon she started in Boston but was cut less than a mile short by the bombing. ""Once I hit the point where I stopped in Boston, I was like, 'No more walking. I'm running this,'"" she told me. ""This race, this is for Boston. I'm finishing."" There, I also met Gary Woodbridge, whose wife, Ronota Newberry-Woodbridge, was killed in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. He ran his first marathon in her honor. ""She always wanted to run a marathon, and I finally lost enough weight where I thought I could try,"" he told me. He struggled, but he finished. He had to. RELATED: In OKC, a run to finish what she started . When I'm running the marathon next week in North Carolina, I'm sure there will be points when I'll want to give up -- but I won't. I'll have too many stories with me. I'll think of how Yanni's husband washed her damaged leg while she held a towel over her face and cried, unable to walk and not wanting to look at the limb. About how she only had run about 11 1/2 miles in her premarathon training. She hit ""the wall,"" so to speak, at Mile 22 of her race. ""It was like a wall or a curtain came down,"" she said. Everything got hazy. She doesn't remember seeing mile markers 23 or 24. ""My legs started to cramp, but I didn't want to stop and stretch because I was scared I wouldn't be able to get going again."" She did keep going, of course. ""My advice would be just take it one step at a time,"" she wrote. ""We are only a select group of people that make that journey and take the time to achieve such an insane goal. ""Take each mile and savor it."" ""I am glad that I can inspire people,"" she added, ""but I just feel like a normal person who loves running and who is wicked stubborn! ... I was gonna cross that finish line one way or another."" After hearing Yanni's story, I'm sure I will, too. I'd also encourage you to consider signing up for a race -- of any length -- as part of CNN iReport's Run for Boston group. Hundreds already have pledged to do so. The goal is to show support for the truly brave people such as Yanni and others who are taking steps each day toward recovering from the Boston tragedy.

"(CNN) -- With the tap of a toe or the blink of an eye, those with ALS are redefining what it means to be alive. I have to admit it took some time to come up with that line and believe it -- to have that kind of positive outlook on this nasty deadly disease and the future. Just a year and a half ago, my mother, Myrna Malveaux, 69, was healthy. Our family's matriarch, she was the one who was the life of the party, the trusted confidante but town crier of all family secrets, the glue that held my father, me, and my three siblings together. When I was told she had ALS I honestly didn't know what it was. But then my sister described it to me over the phone and I had to pull over the car. It's a fatal, fast-moving neuromuscular disease that would paralyze my mother limb by limb. First robbing her of her ability to swallow, then speak, move and breathe. When that reality set in, I spent many nights in my home, crying on the floor. What enabled me to get up was that my mother accepted her fate with a strength and grace I'd never seen before. In anyone. When she began choking on her food, losing her ability to swallow, she got a feeding tube. When she lost her ability to walk, she got a motorized wheelchair. When she could no longer speak, she picked up a word board and started spelling out her conversations, still telling my father what to do. And finally when she lost her ability to breathe, she got a tracheotomy and ventilator to stay alive. Which is why the notion of what it means to be alive, for me, has completely changed. I've met people like former NFL New Orleans Saints player Steve Gleason, who now, at age 36, with ALS, is completely paralyzed. He uses eye-tracking technology to open doors, send e-mails, and tweet by blinking his eyes. I've also met Augie Nieto, the founder of Life Fitness gym equipment. The 53-year-old Californian is running a corporation, communicating and raising millions of dollars for ALS research, by tapping with his toes. So you can see where I might get my inspiration in telling their stories. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a devastating path to travel. Someone described it to me as ""imagining yourself, sitting in a chair, and being completely duct-taped head to toe, with only your eyes left open. That's what it's like to have ALS."" It robs you of your physical abilities but it leaves your mind and spirit strong. Being alive looks different. It becomes all about your emotional connections to those you love. My mother smiles when she sees her grandchildren, her eyes light up when you walk in the door, she relaxes when the sun shines on her face. These days our family is just about hanging out. Very little is known about how people get ALS. In 90% of cases it just happens out of the blue. It's considered a rare disease, in part, because patients don't live long enough to be counted. Right now there is no cure. I hope by sharing my own experience, as well as that of others, we can learn more together.

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. district judge granted a preliminary injunction Monday to stop federal funding of embryonic stem cell research that he said destroys embryos, ruling it went against the will of Congress. The ruling by Judge Royce C. Lamberth was a blow to the Obama administration, which last year issued guidelines to allow federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. Lamberth's ruling said all embryonic stem cell research involves destroying embryos, which violates the Dickey-Wicker Amendment included in federal spending bills. ""The Dickey-Wicker Amendment unambiguously prohibits the use of federal funds for all research in which a human embryo is destroyed,"" said the ruling by Lamberth, who was nominated to the federal bench by then-President Ronald Reagan in 1987. ""It is not limited to prohibit federal funding of only the 'piece of research' in which an embryo is destroyed. Thus, if ESC [embryonic stem cell] research is research in which an embryo is destroyed, the guidelines, by funding ESC research, violate the Dickey-Wicker Amendment."" President Barack Obama signed an executive order in March 2009 that repealed a Bush-era policy limiting federal dollars for human stem cell research. Obama's act permitted the National Institutes of Health to conduct and fund studies on embryonic stem cells. Monday's ruling involved a lawsuit against the National Health Institute filed by researchers opposed to use of embryonic stem cells, a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization, the non-profit Christian Medical Association and others. The ruling stops the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research while the lawsuit proceeds through the legal system. The government can appeal the injunction, and a Justice Department spokeswoman, Tracy Schmaler, said the decision was being reviewed. The field of embryonic stem cells has been highly controversial because the research process involves destroying the embryo, typically four or five days old, after removing stem cells. These cells are then blank and can become any cell in the body. Embryonic stem cell research differs from other kinds of stem cell research, which don't require embryos. Some scientists believe embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities, because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. While some advocates praised the executive order as a giant step forward for medical research, conservatives groups objected, contending that the destruction of human embryos ends human life. Ron Stoddart, executive director of Nightlight Christian Adoptions -- one of the groups that filed the lawsuit -- said he supported adult stem cell research that doesn't require destroying embryos. ""Frequently people will say why are you opposed to stem cell research and of course are answer is, we're not,"" Stoddart said. ""We're opposed to the destruction of the embryos to get embryo stem cells."" In a statement Monday, the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research said it was disappointed by the injunction granted ""in response to the latest maneuver by an ideologically driven fringe group."" ""We have full confidence that the extensive, deliberative process that shaped federal guidelines now in place will be upheld upon further review,"" the group's statement said. CNN's Shelby Lin Erdman contributed to this story.","NEW: No word on possible government appeal as the lawsuit proceeds .

"(CNN) -- The CEO of popular messaging app Snapchat is apologizing after a set of filthy e-mails he wrote several years ago to his fraternity brothers at Stanford University was leaked publicly this week. In the e-mails, acquired by Gawker's Valleywag blog, Evan Spiegel encourages fellow Kappa Sigma members to get sorority women drunk enough to have sex, mocks another fraternity by suggesting its members are gay and refers to a different group of sorority members as ""sororisluts."" ""Hope at least six girl[s] [performed a sex act on you] last night because that didn't happen for me,"" he wrote in one e-mail after a fraternity party, according to the Gawker blog. In another, the blog says, he jokes that the point of a laser-tag outing was to ""shoot lazers at fat girls."" In a written response sent to CNN by Snapchat, Spiegel, now 23, apologized for the e-mails. ""I'm obviously mortified and embarrassed that my idiotic e-mails during my fraternity days were made public,"" he said. ""I have no excuse. I'm sorry I wrote them at the time and I was a jerk to have written them. They in no way reflect who I am today or my views towards women."" A Snapchat spokeswoman told CNN that Spiegel had no further comment. In other messages that were screen-grabbed onto the Gawker blog, Spiegel described a party ""shopping list"" that included ""3 kegs, 5 ... plastic shot glasses, 1 ounce of marijuana, 1 kilo of blow (cocaine)."" In another, he writes, ""I'll roll a blunt for whoever sees the most (breasts) tonight,"" according to the blog. Some of the messages were too sexually explicit for CNN to publish. Snapchat is a mobile messaging app popular with teens and young adults. It lets users trade photos and videos that disappear after a few seconds. Spiegel created Snapchat along with fraternity brother Bobby Murphy while attending Stanford. He left the university in 2012, shortly before finishing his degree, to focus on Snapchat. A third Kappa Sigma member, Reginald ""Reggie"" Brown IV, is suing Snapchat, saying he was the one who came up with the app's concept of disappearing messages and designed its logo but was omitted from the launch of the company. It's now valued at around $4 billion. Spiegel has denied the lawsuit's allegations. Spiegel and Murphy founded their company as Picaboo in July 2011 and later changed its name to Snapchat. The app, which developed a reputation early in its history as a tool for sharing sexual images, is estimated to have more than 30 million users. Snapchat claims its users send more than 700 million photos and videos a day. Snapchat reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook last fall. Time magazine last month named Spiegel and Murphy among its 100 Most Influential People of 2014. Spiegel's leaked e-mails may be seen as yet another example of a ""brogrammer"" culture in Silicon Valley and the male-dominated tech industry, where some female employees have complained about sexist comments and a lack of respect from their male co-workers.","Snapchat's CEO apologizes for crude e-mails he sent while at Stanford .

"(CNN) -- A jet crashed Sunday near Freeport, on the island of Grand Bahama, killing all nine people on board, authorities said. The aircraft hit a crane at the Freeport Ship Yard and crashed into a nearby ""junk site,"" police said. No U.S. agencies are involved, and the Royal Bahamas Police Force is handling the investigation, a police spokesman said. Police released the names of five victims Monday that includes Myles Munroe and his wife Ruth. Myles Munroe was the senior pastor of Bahamas Faith Ministries International Fellowship, that group's website says. Ruth served as co-pastor.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration will sue to halt a Texas requirement that voters show identification at the polls, signaling a new effort on voting rights enforcement following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling this year that threw out a key part of a landmark federal law. The Justice Department said on Thursday that had put in motion a plan to seek a court order declaring that the strict 2011 Texas law violates the Voting Rights Act and certain constitutional guarantees. ""Today's action marks another step forward in the Justice Department's continuing effort to protect the voting rights of all eligible Americans,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. ""The department will take action against jurisdictions that attempt to hinder access to the ballot box, no matter where it occurs,"" he added. A divided 5-4 Supreme Court in June invalidated the formula used to determine which states or local jurisdictions -- mostly in the South -- could remain under special federal oversight, requiring approval from Washington before they can change voting procedures. That blunted much of the government's enforcement power in states and localities with a history of discrimination at the polls. But the decision did not change the fact it remains illegal to discriminate against a person when it comes to voting. But it does change how some states have been singled out. Holder said previously the administration would use a different section of the Voting Rights Act that allows federal authorities to ask a judge to order a state to be placed under the preclearance regime. To do so the Justice Department must prove ""purposeful"" discrimination. Texas will be test case of that tactic but a Justice Department spokesman said prosecutors may pursue similar action in other states with similar laws. Texas is the subject of two ongoing court fights over its voter identification law and the voting boundaries created by the legislature. Texas Gov. Rick Perry reacted sharply to the move, building on previous comments from state officials that the administration was trying to circumvent the Supreme Court decision. ""The filing of endless litigation in an effort to obstruct the will of the people of Texas is what we have come to expect from Attorney General Eric Holder and President Obama,"" he said in a statement. ""We will continue to defend the integrity of our elections against this administration's blatant disregard for the 10th Amendment."" The Justice Department also announced on Thursday that it would file a motion to intervene in one of the redistricting cases, allowing it to formally present evidence about the impact of the state's new voting map. A federal court in the District of Columbia had previously held that Texas had failed to show that its redistricting plan and the voter ID law did not discriminate. But the Supreme Court decision vacated that ruling. The NAACP praised the decision to challenge Texas, saying that Texas had a history of suppressing African American and Latino voters. ""The voter ID law in Texas is a solution in search of a problem. A Texas voter is more likely to be struck by lightning than to see someone attempt to vote fraudulently at the polls,"" Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the group's legal defense fund, said in a statement. CNN's Bill Mears and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","Obama administration takes new approach to voting rights enforcement following court ruling .

"(CNN) -- Grand Canyon National Park wants to increase its entrance fees, and several other national parks may do the same. For the first time in eight years, the National Park Service has given park sites that charge entrance and amenity fees permission to increase their rates by set amounts. They have to engage their communities, note what the increases will cover and get approval by park service headquarters. Fee increase proposals are due by March 15. Though just 133 of the 401 National Park Service sites across the United States charge an entrance fee, they're some of the parks that travelers often think of first. Think Yosemite, Yellowstone and of course, the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon is proposing to increase several fees for the first time since 1997. The single vehicle entrance fee would increase from $25 to $30 for a seven-day pass, and the individual and motorcycle rate of $12 would increase to $15 per individual and to $25 per motorcycle. The individual park's annual pass would increase from $50 to $60. The cost of national park system passes will remain at $80 for the regular annual pass, $10 for the lifetime senior pass and free for the annual military passes and access passes (for those with permanent disabilities). These are five national park sites we think you must see, either now or after any fee increases take effect. They're still a bargain! Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona . The Colorado River cuts through the bottom of the magnificent Grand Canyon for 277 miles, and it's a full vertical mile from the South Rim to the canyon floor. The canyon's width varies, but it measures 18 miles in several spots. The South Rim is open year-round, but the North Rim -- generally the coolest place in the park -- is open during the spring and summer. Current vehicle entrance fee: $25 . Grand Canyon filled with river of clouds . Yosemite National Park, California . Yosemite National Park, which released its fee proposal in October, wants to increase its weekly entrance pass from $20 to $30. Camping fees would rise from the current range of $5 to $20 per night for family sites ($40 per night for group sites) to a range of $6 to $24 per night for family sites ($48 per night for group sites). President Abraham Lincoln first protected Yosemite with his signing of the Yosemite Land Grant on June 30, 1864, 150 years ago. Yosemite will celebrate 125 years as a national park in 2015. Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho . Old Faithful calls this place home. Established as the United States' first national park in 1872, Yellowstone is also one of the first 12 sites on UNESCO's World Heritage List, which recognizes the world's most important natural and cultural wonders.

Current vehicle entrance fee: $25 . Arches National Park, Utah . Arches National Park is one of the most unique spots on Earth, home to the world's highest collection of natural sandstone arches. They include the largest, Landscape Arch, and the tallest, Double Arch South. Current vehicle entrance fee: $10 . Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina and Tennessee . It's free! Despite its reign as the most-visited national park in the country last year, with 9.4 million visitors, Great Smoky Mountains National Park is our bargain park, with no entrance fees. (There are camping and other amenity fees.) That's because the park's Newfound Gap Road was once owned by the state of Tennessee.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's political gamble to call snap parliamentary elections appears to have paid off, with exit polls showing his party won a landslide victory in Sunday's vote. Official results are still being tallied, but Japanese public broadcaster NHK said Abe's ruling coalition had secured a two-thirds majority in Parliament's Lower House, winning 326 of 475 seats. And the White House offered congratulations to Abe and his Liberal Democratic Party for their success at the polls. The win gives Abe four more years to institute his policies aimed at reviving Japan's economy by flooding the market with cash, encouraging corporations to create more jobs and increasing government spending. Japan unexpectedly slipped into a recession this year, dealing a blow to Abe's much-vaunted ""Abenomics"" stimulus and economic reform package. On Sunday, Abe thanked voters for their support and said the election results are a mandate from the Japanese people to stay the course and keep pushing ahead. Strange timing . An election wasn't actually required until late 2016. And many had wondered why Abe, with a sizable majority in the Lower House -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early. Before the vote, E. Keith Henry, analyst and founder of Asia Strategy, a Tokyo-based government policy consulting group, said he found the timing ""puzzling."" ""Why call an election when you have such a dominant position?"" he asked. But as exit poll results came in on Sunday, it appeared that Abe's coalition had picked up more than 30 seats. Winning a two-thirds majority in the Lower House gives the party a chance to propose amending the Constitution and enact bills the Upper House rejects, NHK reported. Controversial reforms . While a key component of Abenomics has been extra government spending, a sales tax hike this year and rising costs have taken their toll on small businesses and their customers. In a bit to boost his election fortunes, Abe delayed a sales tax hike planned for October 2015. His special adviser on economic affairs, Etsuro Honda, has called for a further $25 billion in cash handout stimulus and tax cuts to kickstart the economy. But that hasn't satisfied all voters.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese artists are painting the globe red and the regional art market is no longer hostage to fickle buyers, the Asia president of auction house Christie's told CNN. The Asian art market has typically been driven by savvy investors and China's nouveau riche. ""Some invest in art as though it were a stock market, with artworks that are virtually split into multiples of dematerialized shares,"" according to Artprice, an art auction research firm. Hong Kong's ""success has been marred by the poor reputation of Chinese buyers,"" according to a recent report by Artprice. ""In Hong Kong, Christie's and Sotheby's have both experienced non-payment problems that have led to court proceedings... so much so that to avoid such problems, the major auction houses are now asking buyers to pay a HK$1 million (US$129,000) advance deposit for the more expensive items."" Deadbeat art buyers rise in China . However, Christie's Francois Curiel sees this paradigm changing. ""What was interesting this weekend is that with the exception of this picture (""La foret blanche II"" by Chu The-Chun) and maybe one or two others, there were no other records,"" Curiel told CNN's Patricia Wu. ""There were good, strong, solid prices and it seems that the speculative buyers have left town."" Christie's annual autumn auction in Hong Kong, which ended Wednesday, grossed $334 million. Although art sales in the region were down by 15% to 25% the first half of the year, sales in the second half of the year bounced back, according to Curiel, Christie's Asian head. Asia's growing art scene is reinforced by various government initiatives and local auction houses. ""The relationship between art and money is totally uninhibited in China and generates ever more ambitious projects,"" the Artprice report says. The ""world's first financial center for art"" is under construction in the city of Xiamen and is expected to be completed by 2014. The $260 million project promises auction sales, exhibitions, appraisal services, galleries, art restorers and other related businesses, according to the developer Beijing Huachen Auctions Co. Hong Kong is also developing a $3 billion ""integrated arts and cultural district,"" in the West Kowloon district, according to a Hong Kong government report. With a market of burgeoning art buyers, artists from the region are making their mark, too. Their art is being sold for record hammer prices -- this year, a Chinese artist Chu The-Chun's work sold for a record price -- the highest ever for this artist at US$7.7 million. ""Zeng Fanzhi and Zhang Xiao Gang are now the two Chinese artists in this very elite list of the top 10 living artists bringing more than $10 million in the world,"" said Curiel, 60, who is a renowned auctioneer in his own right. ""It was unthinkable five years to think they will be in the top 10 living artists in the world -- two Chinese artists -- but now it's done, which shows the interest of Chinese contemporary art, not only in China but also in Europe and America."" Five Chinese artists, including Zeng Fanzhi, figure on Artprice's list of top 500 contemporary artists in 2012, along with the likes of Damien Hirst. For Christie's -- which had global auctions and private sales totaling $3.5 billion in the first half of 2012 -- Asian market share is skyrocketing. Three years ago, Hong Kong accounted for only 3% of global sales; last year, Hong Kong accounted for 20% of sales, Curiel said. Hong Kong is now the world's third largest art market by auction sales, according to the Hong Kong government's investment department. ""Few years ago, it was London, Paris and New York,"" Curiel said. ""Now, it's London, Paris, New York and Hong Kong.""","Asian art market has typically been driven by savvy investors and China's nouveau riche .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The number of deaths in Sudan's Darfur region since 2006 may have been underestimated by as much as 50 percent, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs said Tuesday. An man injured in clashes with tribal fighters outside the African Union Mission in southern Darfur in 2007. In March, international figures, including U.N. data, put the death toll in Darfur at 200,000, with another 2.5 million people displaced. But 300,000 are believed to have died in the tribal conflict in the past two years, said John Holmes, who also is the United Nations emergency relief coordinator. Holmes said that sexual violence has increased and that food allotments for civilians affected by the civil war will be halved in a few days. Holmes gave the U.N. Security Council an update on conditions in the western Sudan region, revisiting a report he gave a year ago. ""I am sad to say that the humanitarian situation remains as grim today as it was then, if not more so,"" he said. In 2008, 100,000 civilians have fled their homes, many not for the first time. The Darfur conflict began five years ago, when ethnic African tribesmen took up arms, complaining of decades of neglect and discrimination by the Sudanese government. Sudan's Arab-dominated government is accused of responding by unleashing tribal militias known as Janjaweed, which are said to have committed the worst atrocities against Darfur's local communities. There also have been intra-rebel and tribal clashes, Holmes added. He blamed the military arm of the Justice and Equality Movement faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement for the most recent round of violence, and he accused the government of using ""disproportionate force"" and failing to differentiate between civilians and rebels in their response. ""Darfur today is still characterized by insecurity, lawlessness and impunity,"" he said. ""A particularly worrying feature is evidence of high levels of sexual violence and exploitation in the northern corridor of west Darfur over the past two months."" This is shown by the increased number of women and girls seeking treatment after sexual brutality, Holmes said. The World Food Programme announced last week that it will have to cut back its food distributions in May, partly because of attacks on convoys that reduced the amount of supplies they can get through, Holmes said. Six aid workers have been killed this year, and 42 humanitarian posts have been attacked. The supply line also is hurt by soaring food prices: The price of staples such as millet has doubled since April 2007, Holmes said. While expressing gratitude to the Sudanese government for improved cooperation under various agreements, Holmes said there still is no physical access to internally displaced persons and some other groups. He said he was ""saddened and angry"" that after five years, there has been no lasting solution to the suffering. He made several recommendations to the government, including disbanding the Janjaweed, providing security for citizens, ending impunity for criminals and shouldering more of the financial burden for humanitarian aid. Holmes also said rebels must stop their attacks against people and humanitarian convoys. E-mail to a friend .","In March, death toll in Darfur given as 200,000; 2.5 million people displaced .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The moderator's chair on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" stood empty on Sunday in remembrance of Tim Russert, the man who had occupied it for 17 years. The moderator's chair on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" stood empty Sunday in remembrance of Tim Russert. As the show's host, Russert became a mainstay of television journalism's political talk. He died Friday of apparent heart attack, according to the network. He was 58. The network said Russert collapsed while at work. Colleague and former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw, who broke the news about the anchor's death, spoke on Sunday the familiar first four words of the news program, ""Our issues this Sunday."" He noted that those were the same words Russert had been recording for the show when he collapsed and died. ""Our issue this sad Sunday morning is remembering and honoring our colleague and friend,"" Brokaw said. ""He said he was only the temporary custodian,"" of this program, which he called a national treasure, Brokaw said. ""Of course, he was so much more than all that."" Brokaw sat among some of Russert's other colleagues in the front of the show's set, including Pulitzer Prize-winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin and political analysts Mary Matalin and James Carville, who is also a CNN contributor. ""This is where you separated the men from the boys,"" said Matalin, who is married to Carville. ""You weren't a candidate until you came on this show."" A montage of clips from past years showed various politicians -- former President Bill Clinton, President Bush, former presidential candidate Ross Perot, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff -- sitting across the table from Russert.  Watch politicians, journalists pay homage to Russert » . Some showed the politicians as they squirmed. ""Look, I was asked -- I shouldn't have said that,"" New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said on the show in May 2007. Richardson had appeared on the show as part of the ""Meet the Candidates 2008"" series, and was grilled by Russert about his contradictory positions on numerous issues. ""So you're - I've been in public life for 25 years, you're going to find a lot of these; it seems you found them all here,"" he said, smiling somewhat sheepishly. ""I'm just trying to set the record and trying to give you a chance to respond, which is fair,"" Russert had responded. In another clip at the end of an April 2006 show, Sen. John McCain told Russert, ""I haven't had so much fun since my last interrogation."" Russert had appeared as an unlikely icon for television news, with his cherubic face and dimpled chin, but he was a prolific interviewer and tireless journalist, one with an intimidating breadth of political knowledge and insight. ""It was a very easy show to prepare for in the sense that you knew he was not going to ask you any questions out of left field; you knew his thing was going to be entitlements, you knew his thing was going to be past statements, you knew where he was coming from,"" Carville said Sunday of ""Meet the Press."" Matalin countered: ""It was simple in the fact that there was no 'gotcha,' but it was not easy. Because you had to be 10 questions deep, because he was going to be 12 questions deep."" As news of his death hit the airwaves and Internet, tributes rolled in -- with nearly everyone praising his prowess as a journalist and as an interviewer. Bush, in a written statement, called Russert ""a tough and hardworking newsman."" ""He was always well-informed and thorough in his interviews,"" Bush said. ""And he was as gregarious off the set as he was prepared on it."" Longtime CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite said, ""Broadcast journalism lost one of its greats today. Tim Russert was a giant in our field -- a standard-bearer of journalistic integrity and ethics. His masterful interviews and roundtable discussions are legendary. This is a tragic loss for journalism and for all who were privileged to know him."" But colleagues who knew him best also praised his warmth, and described him as a mentor. ""I think it's so poignant that we're talking about Tim on Father's Day because he was a father to so many of us,"" said California first lady Maria Shriver, who once worked for NBC. On Friday, NBC chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell said, ""He was always teaching each of us to be as rigorous as he was in looking at all the facts, examining everything and then being as balanced and fair and down-the-middle as anyone could possibly be."" Washingtonian Magazine once dubbed Russert the best and most influential journalist in Washington, D.C., describing ""Meet the Press"" as ""the most interesting and important hour on television."" In 2008, Time Magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. His two books -- 2004's ""Big Russ and Me"" and 2006's ""Wisdom of Our Fathers"" -- were both New York Times bestsellers.","The moderator's chair on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" stood empty Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Gay rights activists staged a ""kiss day"" at Chick-fil-A outlets nationwide Friday amid a controversy over the company president's stance against same-sex marriages. Organizers used social media to urge same-sex couples to participate in the event and post pictures and videos online. ""I like to liken it to a married couple sharing a light kiss over a romantic meal, it's the same thing. We're here, and our love is just as good,"" organizer Carly McGehee said. Two dozen protesters turned out in the afternoon at a Chick-fil-A location in suburban Atlanta. At least one couple shared a kiss for the assembled media. Marci Alt said she would like Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy to meet her wife and their two children. ""We share some of the same kind of values,"" Alt said. ""I think it would open his eyes to understand that just because we are a lesbian couple, we're really not any different than him and Mrs. Cathy."" In Los Angeles, same-sex marriage supporters Luke Montgomery and Eduardo Cisneros kissed outside a Chick-fil-A restaurant. Montgomery said Jesus Christ never said anything about gay people. Referring to Cathy, the activist said, ""He needs to open the Bible before he opens his mouth."" Opinion: What the Bible really says about homosexuality . Meanwhile, police in Torrance, California, were trying to find out who vandalized a Chick-fil-A restaurant with a picture of a cow and the words ""Tastes Like Hate,"" CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Police Lt. Martin Vukotic said there were no immediate leads. Friday's protests followed a Wednesday event dubbed Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day, in which Americans lined up at eateries nationwide to support the company. Chick-fil-A said it set a sales record Wednesday but declined to release the numbers. iReport: Chick-fil-A demonstrations . About 14,400 people had expressed their support on a Facebook page dedicated to Friday's protest, a tally dwarfed by those who went to Facebook to back Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day. McGehee said she hopes someone will protest at each of the more than 1,600 Chick-fil-A locations. Most demonstrators will remain outside, although some have said they plan to take the protest inside, she said. Some plan to buy food with cash marked ""gay money,"" she said. Chick-fil-A's Steve Robinson, executive vice president of marketing, issued a statement saying the company appreciates all of its customers and is ""glad to serve them at any time."" The controversy started after an interview with Cathy appeared in The Baptist Press on July 16. He weighed in with his views on family. ""We are very much supportive of the family, the biblical definition of the family unit,"" he said. ""We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that."" The statement caused an uproar, with activists saying Cathy voiced opposition to gay marriages. Some of the protesters in Los Angeles supported Cathy's stance, while Montgomery said same-sex marriage supporters should not be intimidated. ""We have separation of church and state,"" Montgomery said. ""It's great if they want to have their religion, but it should not interfere with our civil rights."" How the Chick-fil-A controversy evolved . Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee created a Facebook page urging people to buy food at the chain during the Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day. Throngs of people heeded his call, snaking around various Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide Wednesday. Proponents of same-sex marriage organized a simple counterprotest, asking people to donate the approximate cost of a Chick-fil-A meal, about $6.50, to gay and lesbian rights groups, according to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, known as GLAAD. Gay rights groups also are incensed about the chain's financial support for what they say are anti-gay groups, largely through the WinShape Foundation, a group started by Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy. It's financed almost entirely by Chick-fil-A profits. WinShape-backed groups deny that accusation, while WinShape stresses that its activities are almost entirely aimed at youth and families, as opposed to conservative advocacy.

"(CNN) -- British boxer Amir Khan has retained his WBA light-welterweight title after winning the much-hyped ""battle of the faiths"" by stopping challenger Dmitriy Salita in the first round on Saturday night. Khan, a devout Muslim, knocked down his Jewish opponent three times before the referee stopped after just one minute and 16 seconds. Salita, an American citizen who was born in Ukraine and is nicknamed ""Star of David"", was unable to follow up his bold claims made in the build-up to the fight, which took place in Newcastle in the north-east of England. The 22-year-old Khan was successful in his first defense of the belt that he won in defeating Andreas Kotelnik in July. He is trained by American Freddie Roach, who also guides Filipino star Manny Pacquiao, considered by many to be the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world. ""It was very explosive. The fight was just what we asked for, what Freddie asked me to do. We had too much power for this guy,"" a delighted Khan told reporters after the fight. ""I'm a growing young man and developing as a man. Freddie said to take it easy, pick the right shots and you'll take this guy out and we did. ""Freddie is a great trainer, he's like a father figure to me and to have him in my corner means a lot. Everyone knows I'm a hard-working fighter and if you put the hard work in you're going to get the benefits. ""After the first shot I could see his legs buckling and I just had to take my time. I knew he was going."" Roach has helped the Olympic silver medal winner to rebuild his career after a humiliating defeat by unknown Colombian Breidis Prescott last year. ""It was a blessing in disguise what happened against Prescott, I got beat and came back stronger,"" Khan said. Roach was equally impressed with his young charge. ""I would give him an A+. I said if you hurt him, finish him. We've been working on that power and the fight was really over after that first punch,"" he said.","British boxer Amir Khan retains his WBA light-welterweight title in his first defense .

"(CNN) -- Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston missed all of Saturday night's marquee game against Clemson --- not just one half as previously announced -- because of a vulgar comment witnesses said he made on campus this week, the school said. FSU, the nation's top-ranked team, struggled early but outlasted Clemson to win 23-17 in overtime. FSU initially said the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback would miss the first half of the Seminoles' game in Tallahassee, after people reported seeing him yelling an sexually explicit phrase near the FSU student union on Tuesday. But FSU Athletics Director Stan Wilcox increased the sophomore's punishment late Friday after hearing eyewitness accounts that differed from Winston's initial version, a source close to the situation told CNN's Rachel Nichols. The witnesses told FSU officials that Winston was standing on a table while shouting the phrase -- something Winston initially denied, the source said. Winston also initially downplayed the incident, but he admitted the full story after university officials confronted him with the witness accounts, according to the source. Redshirt sophomore Sean Maguire replaced Winston for the defending national champions (2-0) against Clemson (1-1). The game was Saturday's only match between two ranked teams. Clemson is No. 22 in the AP poll and No. 24 in the coaches' poll. Winston publicly apologized Wednesday for the comments. ""I want to be out there on the field with my team, but I did something. I've got to accept my consequences,"" Winston told reporters. ""I messed up. And I got to accept the fact that I did that. It eats me alive, man, that I did something like that. I can't carry myself that way,"" he added. This isn't the first off-field allegation that has attracted headlines for Winston. After a woman accused Winston of sexually assaulting her in December 2012, a Florida prosecutor announced last December that no charges would be filed in the case. The accuser alleged Winston had raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar; Winston maintained that the sexual activity was consensual. The prosecutor said authorities did not have probable cause to arrest Winston in the case. Florida State still is conducting a Title IX investigation in the case, an attorney for the accuser said this month. The Title IX law requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault even if criminal charges are not filed. Winston made headlines again in April when he was accused of shoplifting crab legs and crawfish from a Publix supermarket in Tallahassee. Police said that Winston said he forgot to pay. As part of a civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in Leon County -- Winston was not arrested but was ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, authorities said. Winston is once again seen as an early contender for the Heisman, college football's top award. It is given in December to the player who voters believe had the best college football season.

"(CNN) -- On May 27, Margaret Awino gave birth to Paul Mukisa with the help of her mother-in-law inside her home in Nabigingo, a small village in eastern Uganda. But instead of joy and jubilation for the birth of her fifth child, the 28-year-old mother was shocked: her newborn son had been born with four legs and four arms. The family rushed to a nearby district hospital for help but they were quickly referred to Mulago Hospital in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. There, a team of doctors examined the infant and made the diagnosis of ""parasitic twinning,"" a variant of conjoint twinning in which one of the twins is not fully developed -- baby Paul had been born with a full set of arms and legs and another set from a headless and heartless mirror image twin that never fully grew. The Ugandan doctors ran a series of tests on the eight-limbed newborn which showed that the host and parasitic twin shared part of the pelvic bone. Examinations of Paul's internal organs revealed further abnormalities: his heart was on the right side of his body, instead of the left, while his liver was on the left side as opposed to the right. After these initial investigations, Paul was discharged home for three months as the surgeons wanted to allow him to grow before performing an operation to separate the twins. Finally, on August 18, a Ugandan team of three surgeons, three anesthesiologists and two nurses successfully completed a three-hour operation to remove parts of the parasitic twin from the normal body. ""The baby was given general anesthesia and the torso and trunk of the parasitic twin -- which had two arms but no head or heart -- was detached from the host baby,"" said Dr Nasser Kakembo, one of the surgeons who carried out the operation. ""Then we also detached the lower limbs of the parasitic twin from the host, which included disarticulating the right and left lower limbs as they were attached by joints. We controlled the bleeding and fashioned skin flaps to close the resulting wound,"" he added. ""There were no intra-operative or post-operative complications and mild blood loss and a precautionary blood transfusion was given."" Three weeks after the surgery, the baby is progressing and breastfeeding well, according to the doctors. ""The father and mother were very grateful because at first they thought it was due to witchcraft, and their baby was a laughing stock because of the abnormalities,"" said Kakembo. The incidence of conjoined twins is one in 50,000, while parasitic twins are extremely rare. The condition is typically created after one of the twins stops developing at a certain point during the pregnancy, and the remnants of that twin merge with the twin that has continued developing. Back in 2007, an eight-limbed girl in India made global headlines after a team of 30 surgeons successfully completed a mammoth 27-hour operation to remove her ""parasitic twin."" For the doctors at Mulago Hospital, this was the first time they had ever performed a surgery like this. ""We have not had a prior experience with a parasitic twin but we work on many other children with multiple complex multi-organ congenital anomalies such as intestinal, urologic, cardiac, and orthopedic defects,"" said Kakembo. ""Although twinning is very rare worldwide,"" he continued, ""we have an increased incidence in Africa -- we [have] seen numerous sets of conjoint twins, five to six sets in the last few years."" Baby Paul Mukisa is still at the hospital and will remain there for the next two weeks, being treated by medics. Looking ahead, doctors say that they ""anticipate a healthy baby that may have a wide gait due to the large pelvic bone, and this may require orthopedic reconstruction in the future.""","Boy born with multiple limbs is progressing well after operation to remove ""parasitic twin""

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama steps in front of cameras Wednesday, he'll be addressing a nation that's simultaneously war-weary and ready for more military action against ISIS; critical of Obama's handling of the crisis yet largely supportive of his commitment to keep combat troops out. Those currents of public opinion, however convoluted, will shape how Obama frames his strategy for ""degrading and ultimately defeating"" the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, which Americans now believe pose a real threat and must be combated. Here's what the polling suggests Americans are listening for when Obama speaks Wednesday: . What's your plan? When Obama admitted to reporters his administration lacked a strategy for combating ISIS in Syria, Americans largely agreed with him. More than two-thirds said in CNN's most recent survey the President lacked a clear plan for dealing with the militant jihadists. Countering that perception will be Obama's main challenge on Wednesday, and aides say he'll point to both the ongoing U.S. effort in Iraq and new efforts to train and equip local forces as evidence of a clear plot to go after the terrorists. He's open to airstrikes in Syria, officials say, and wants a broad coalition of allied countries to back him up. That puts him in agreement with the nearly three quarters of Americans who say they're ready for a broader air campaign to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Certain specifics of the Obama plan, however, may be hard to come by -- on Tuesday, the White House said Obama would offer neither a timeline for his strategy in defeating ISIS nor a price tag. ""I wouldn't expect something that's quite that detailed,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. ""But the President is very interested in communicating clearly with the American public about what our priorities are and what our plans include."" Analysts say whatever strategy Obama announces -- be it airstrikes, broader training, or both -- must have a clearly articulated goal. ""The biggest mistake would be not presenting a strategy that's decisive,"" said retired CENTCOM commander Anthony Zinni. ""I think he has to clearly lay out what the objectives are. If it's the destruction of ISIS, that has significant meaning."" Obama: U.S. to ""start going on some offense"" Is ISIS a threat in the United States? Americans are worried about ISIS -- two-thirds told CNN in a poll the group posed a very or fairly serious threat. The White House agrees, saying the Islamic militants could threaten ""core American interests."" But as recently as Tuesday, the White House maintained ISIS had no current plans to attack the U.S. at home. ""There is no evidence to indicate that ISIL right now is actively plotting to hit the homeland,"" Earnest said, using the administration's name for the terror group. ""It is important for people to understand that."" So without a specific looming threat, Americans will want to hear the President's reasoning for ramping up U.S. military effort against the group -- particularly after the rhetoric used to begin the last war in Iraq turned out to be false. A majority of Americans do say they were upset by the ISIS beheadings of Americans journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and Obama has warned of Western-born foreign fighters who have the potential to return to the U.S. to stage terror plots. The timing of the speech -- on the eve of the September 11 attack anniversary -- will only serve to remind Americans of how terrorism can hit at home, even as federal officials maintain there's no current risk of attacks from ISIS. And while terrorism still ranks well below the economy as the issue most important to Americans, it is rising in standing. Just two years ago only 3% of Americans said it was their top issue; now 14% say it's what they care most about. Analysis: ISIS threat to U.S. mostly 'hype' Why not have Congress approve? When Obama was last considering airstrikes in Syria -- one year ago following President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons on civilians -- he scrapped his plans when it became clear Congress wasn't on board. This time around things are different. Any action Obama announces Wednesday night won't require authorization from Congress, the White House announced, though they're still looking for support from lawmakers. The past 12 months in Syria have created a new dynamic. It's now clear al-Assad isn't leaving power, having turned over his chemical weapons to international control. The terror groups that Obama predicted would gain a foothold in Syria have. And Congress is now closer to midterm elections in which a vote for broad military power could be politically harmful. That means the President will use his existing powers to go after the jihadist group which now controls land spanning the border between Iraq and Syria. The current air campaign in Iraq relies on Obama's ability to order strikes that protect American interests and help alleviate potential humanitarian crises. Airstrikes against ISIS in Syria, an option Obama is open to, would require those parameters to be broadened -- and that will require some explaining to the American people. CNN's poll showed a large majority -- 72% of Americans -- want Congress to sign off on new military force against ISIS. But even some lawmakers themselves aren't so sure. The top Democrats in Congress -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi -- both said they agreed with the White House decision to forgo Congressional approval. Related: CNN Poll finds most Americans alarmed by ISIS . Are U.S. troops heading in? The short answer is no. Obama, having been elected to office partly on his pledge to draw down the American combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, has adamantly maintained he won't be sending American troops back into war. ""You also cannot, over the long term or even the medium term, deal with this problem by having the United States serially occupy various countries all around the Middle East. We don't have the resources. It puts enormous strains on our military. And at some point, we leave. And then things blow up again,"" he told NBC News last week. ""We've got to have a more sustainable strategy, which means the boots on the ground have to be Iraqi. ... And in Syria, the boots on the ground have to be Syrian."" But there is an asterisk. A few hundred American troops are on the ground in Iraq to advise and help the military there. Such cooperation would be extremely difficult in Syria, where the President called long ago for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad.","President Obama will lay out his plan to deal with ISIS in Iraq and Syria .

"(CNN) -- Another patient is being tested in the United States for possible Ebola exposure -- this time, in California. The unidentified patient is being isolated in a ""specially equipped negative pressure room"" at the Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento Medical Center. Trained staff are using protective equipment, coordinated with infectious disease specialists, to provide care for the patient, said Dr. Stephen M. Parodi, director of hospital operations at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, in a statement. The patient is considered ""low-risk"" and tests are being conducted out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the California Department of Public Health said. There are currently no confirmed cases of Ebola in the state, the agency said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be testing the patient's blood samples to determine whether the Ebola virus is present. All necessary precautions are being taken to safeguard other patients and staff, the hospital said. No further information about the patient has been released. Earlier this month, a patient with a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City for Ebola testing, but tested negative. He recently traveled to a country in West Africa where Ebola has been reported, the hospital said in a statement. In July, two Americans, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly, became infected with the virus when working with Ebola patients in Liberia. Both are currently being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Ebola doesn't spread through airborne or waterborne methods. It spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. There is no FDA-approved treatment for Ebola, and Emory will use what isolation unit supervisor Dr. Bruce Ribner calls ""supportive care."" That means carefully tracking a patient's symptoms, vital signs and organ function and taking measures, such as blood transfusions and dialysis, to keep patients stable. The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Emory's isolation unit aims to optimize care for those with highly infectious diseases and is one of four U.S. institutions capable of providing such treatment.

"(CNN) -- An afternoon spent in a world-class museum can be an out-of-body experience -- a trip in a mental time machine to the courts of China's Ming and Qing dynasties, to the cradle of civilization in Egypt, to Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Picasso's studios or to the top of Gettysburg's Little Round Top, where the Union came within one Confederate flanking maneuver of dissolving. The Louvre in Paris topped the 2012 Museum Index with more than 9.5 million annual visitors last year. The list is part of the recently released Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) and AECOM global attractions attendance report. Based on attendance figures compiled by AECOM, the index lists the 20 most visited museums worldwide. The index includes lists for the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. Attendance figures from museums in Australia and Canada were used in compiling the report, but they did not make the top 20 worldwide, said John Robinett, AECOM's senior vice president of economics. He said attendance numbers from museums in Africa, Central America and South America were not included because they are difficult to obtain, and this is the first year museums were included in the report. ""We'll probably expand this as we go through time,"" he said. ""So stay tuned."" European museums make up 10 of the 20 on the list, and five of those are in London. Four of the six American museums are in Washington, three of them part of the Smithsonian Institution. Three of the four Asia/Pacific museums are in China. China wants to build 1,000 new museums in the next decade and projects museum attendance to reach 1 billion by 2020, according to the report.","The Louvre had more than 9.5 million visitors last year .

"SVAY PAK, Cambodia (CNN) -- Svay Pak has a disturbing reputation. The village outside Cambodia's capital of Phnom Penh is known as a place where little girls are openly sold to foreign predators looking for sex. One of the girls who was sold into the sex trade told CNN that before she could read she was working in a brothel. ""I was about five or six years old,"" she said. ""The first man said to me, 'I want to have sex with you.' At the time I didn't know what to do. No one could help me."" Dozens of girls have had the same experience in her neighborhood. She says she was approached by a man while playing outside. He asked her to come over and talk to him, and before she knew it she was alone and being asked for sex. Some of the girls were actually sold into the sex trade by their own parents. Many were housed with other girls her age in what looked like a cell. The room was pink had thick walls and no windows and was about 7 feet long by 7 feet wide. There were several rooms just like it stuffed into a building that had a gate over the front door and bars on the bathroom window. The brothel she lived in specialized in pre-pubescent girls. The young girls were sought after by the foreign men who came to the area for one reason: They knew they could find young girls for sale. ""At the beginning they talked to me gently but when they raped me, they also beat me up,"" the former sex slave said, her head bowed and tears rolling from her eyes uncontrollably. She is now 18 and no longer trapped in a terrible and painful life. Three years ago she found a safe haven after Don Brewster and his wife moved into the neighborhood and began operating a rehabilitation center for child sex slaves. ""I really think it's an evil -- I mean there is no understanding it. The girls, I mean, they're in such pain and suffer so greatly and it is obvious to the man that's raping them,"" Brewster said. Brewster says things have changed in Svay Pak in the past several years. It used to be girls who hung out in the open, beckoning from behind barred windows to the men who walked by. Pimps no longer descend on every foreign man who shows up in the neighborhood offering to sell them virgins. While the situation is changing, there is still a nasty underbelly in the area, but travelers have to go looking for it now. The sex trade has gone underground, but it is still there. ""If you just look on the surface you would say that doesn't happen but just yesterday we rescued a 5-year-old girl here in Svay Pak,"" said Brewster, who works with Agape International Missions. Now there is a place that provides a secure environment for children to just be children.","One former sex slave says she was five or six years old when approached by a man .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Betty White is alive and acting despite trending on Twitter as having died. Some White fans misread the headline of a satirical story published by Empire News on Wednesday that said the 92-year-old actress ""Dyes Peacefully In Her Los Angeles Home."" Many took to Twitter to spread their distress, not realizing that ""dyes"" is not ""dies"" and without reading the story which only revealed that White ""is not a natural blonde."" The story included an alleged quote from White's agent, Jeff Witjas, saying that she ""has been dying her own hair in her home for decades."" ""BettyÂ has often told me she feels it is relaxing and soothing to dye her own hair, peacefully in her home, where she can laugh and enjoy time with her animals,"" the satire quotes Witjas as saying. Witjas is actually White's agent, but he told CNN that he never dished to the Empire News writer about his client's hair coloring. Witjas gave a real comment to CNN Thursday, saying White ""will outlive us all."" ""Betty and I have an understanding,"" Witjas said. ""I have told her that I have already booked her when she turns 100 and there is no out clause. Betty never backs out of a date."" White, who has enjoyed a resurgence of late, has been busy acting in her hit sitcom ""Hot in Cleveland,"" which just reached the 100-episode milestone. The Twitter distress about White calmed down by Thursday, transitioning more to the raising of eyebrows about how it could have happened and to joking about it. ""Why on earth would people ever make a hoax about Betty white dying? People are so dumb..."" Brandi Diem tweeted. ""RIP, Betty. (Rinse In Peace.)"" read a clever tweet by Andrew Klavan.

"(CNN) -- ""A 13-year-old girl called me an ape."" Adam Goodes was not impressed. One of the most successful proponents of a sport that is more Australian than any other, a hero in a country where its stars are gods, he was not going to take such an insult lightly. ""I stopped, I called her out, got her escorted out of the ground, and from that point the awareness and the conversations that have been had around racism in this country have just skyrocketed,"" he tells CNN's Human to Hero series. Goodes is a star of Australian Rules Football, best described as an often-confusing mix of the two rugby codes, basketball, and its close Gaelic football cousin. ""Aussie Rules,"" also known as AFL, reflects the nation's continuing battle with the aftermath of its colonial past. On one hand it sometimes highlights appalling attitudes towards indigenous peoples -- after the incident with the girl, the president of the host team's club joked on radio that Goode should be used to promote a stage production of King Kong, effectively ending their friendship. On the other, it has made great efforts to welcome indigenous players; there are 68 registered at the 18 Premiership teams this year, and their 9% total of the sport's overall list is greater proportionally than the 2.5% they make up of the country's total population. So it was all the harder for Goodes to accept being abused during a game that was part of the AFL's 2013 ""Indigenous Round"" -- and played at arguably the country's most iconic sporting venue, the 100,000-capacity Melbourne Cricket Ground. ""I hope I'm a person people look up to and say, 'I remember the day Adam Goodes did that at the MCG. Today is the day I'm going to stand up for myself or stand up for somebody else who might not have a voice for themselves,' "" he says. ""Since last year, a lot more cases have come through, and I think that's what needs to happen for it to improve. A lot more people need to call it out, need to say no to racism ... and we're going to improve as a community from there."" In recognition of his work helping Aboriginal youth and battling racism, Goodes was named ""Australian of the Year"" in January, the same month he turned 34. ""It's a very humbling experience,"" he says. ""It's been an amazing platform for me this year to talk about things I'm passionate about -- like eliminating domestic violence and trying to get recognition in the constitution for Aboriginal people. ""It was quite dumbfounding for me to find out that we weren't part of (Australia's) constitution -- this is a document that's over 112 years old that doesn't recognize its first people."" When European settlers came to Australia in the 1800s, they took land from the indigenous people and forced the nomadic tribes to accept new ways of living, often splitting up families under a government policy of ""assimilation"" -- as highlighted in the acclaimed 2002 film ""Rabbit Proof Fence."" Australian politicians have since apologized for the past mistreatment, but Aborigines remain disadvantaged socially and economically compared with the overall population. Goodes, like many modern Aborigines, is from a mixed-race family, with a father of British descent. Born in South Australia, his tribal name is Adnyamathanha -- the people who live in the Flinders Ranges, the largest in Australia. His place of birth (Wallaroo, on the York Peninsular near Adelaide, first settled by Europeans in 1836) means he is also Narungga. ""Growing up, I didn't know what it meant to be Aboriginal,"" Goodes recalls. ""My mum was taken away from her family when she was five years old and we weren't really taught anything about what it meant to be Aboriginal -- no language, no culture, no ceremonies, no nothing. ""What we did know was where we came from, and that was Adnyamathanha and Narungga, so I've had to do a lot of that journey, to find out information about that, in the last 10 years. ""So for us, growing up, we just thought we were just like any other normal family. We didn't really see ourselves as mixed race. I copped stuff from people at school because of the different color and whatnot, but I had good support that helped me get through those tough times."" His parents separated when he was young, and he moved state to Victoria with his mother in his early teens, and they settled in another small country town. Up until that stage, Goodes was a big fan of basketball star Michael Jordan, while his own talents were in soccer. However, there were no teams in his new hometown -- so his mum suggested having a go at AFL. ""I was very athletic, so the running part of it was good,"" he says. ""Grabbing the ball was quite difficult because it could bounce everywhere, but I was able to pick that up pretty easily."" The main premise of AFL is simple: kick the oval-shaped ball between the two central posts to score maximum points; if it goes through the two outside posts, the score is lower. It results in basketball-size scorelines, and with 18 players on each team -- wearing sleeveless tops known as ""guernseys"" and notoriously short shorts -- all kicking, passing, running, jumping and jostling at high intensity for two hours, it can be a confusing spectacle, as Goodes admits. ""You might come and watch a game and not know what's going on. That's because the players, the coaches, the supporters and even sometimes the umpires don't know what's going on either,"" he says. ""I still think that I'm learning things and improving because it is a game that you can never truly master."" While it was started by European settlers in the 1850s, the game has strong links to an ancient Aboriginal sport known as Marngrook. ""We used to play a game where we'd have a possum skin filled with charcoal and they'd kick it around, hand-pass it around, 50-a-side, up and down these massive bits of land, and they would play for days,"" Goodes says. He has won two AFL titles, once as captain, and twice been awarded the game's highest individual honor, the Brownlow Medal. His biggest challenge becoming an AFL player, he says, was not being an Aboriginal in a white man's world, but having to uproot from his family at the age of 17 and chase his sporting dream in Sydney, where he had been drafted by the city's AFL club the Swans. ""In the first year, I didn't look even close to playing in the senior side, I played reserves all year,"" Goodes says. ""It was really a tough year for me and it wasn't until the next year that I actually really committed and decided, 'this is what I want to do, this is what I wanted to be.' I started to make those real sacrifices and really working hard, making all the right choices to be a professional athlete."" He was inspired by Aboriginal teammate Michael O'Loughlin, nearly three years his senior. ""The way our kinship system works, he's actually my nephew -- something I only just found out recently,"" Goodes says. O'Loughlin was the first Sydney player to pass 300 games, and Goodes broke his club record in 2012 when he made his 304th appearance. He is now the most-capped indigenous player, having beaten Andrew McLeod's record of 340 games for Adelaide this year -- the most by any player is 426. ""To have him there to help mentor me, and show me the way, has just been an ideal situation for me and that's what I would want for my brothers and any other people when they go to a football club,"" he says of O'Loughlin, who retired in 2009. Having had a long spell on the sidelines with injury last year, missing the club's run to the preliminary final, Goodes says he is determined to extend his career for as long as possible. ""I know I can still improve and I think that is what drives me,"" he says ahead of this weekend's opening playoffs, where Sydney will take on Fremantle after finishing the regular season as the top team. ""A lot of people would say I'm past it, but I still believe I have a lot to offer."" When he finally hangs up his boots, Goodes aims to focus on the foundation he set up with O'Loughlin, which provides school scholarships for Aboriginal children in Sydney. ""I've committed a lot of my time to my sport and there's going to be a big void for me to fill,"" he says. ""It'll be nice to have a bit more spare time for me.""","Adam Goodes is a leading AFL player who has battled against racism .

"Washington (CNN) -- Although all 435 House seats are up in November's midterms, redistricting has reduced the number of swing races and made it easier for political watchers to keep up with those seats truly up for grabs. But redistricting has made it more difficult for Democrats to retake control of the chamber for the first time since 2010. With fewer seats in play, they must capture 17 held by Republicans. Adding to the challenge for Democrats is that a traditionally older midterm electorate tends to favor Republicans. Regardless, they are still making a play and Republicans are defending their turf. Here are 5 key races to watch: . 5 Senate races to watch in 2014 . Florida 13 . Take a vacant House seat in a swing district in a purple state and you get what many see as a March 11 special election that could serve as a bellwether for midterms. The national political spotlight will shine on the 13th Congressional District race to fill the remainder of the term of Republican Rep. Bill Young of Florida, who died in October. The district covers most of Pinellas County and parts of St. Petersburg and it's up for grabs: While Young grabbed 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district. Obama also won it 2008, grabbing 51% support. ""It almost goes without saying, but this is the type of seat and race Democrats have to win in order to have any chance of gaining the 17 seats they need in 2014 to get back to the majority,"" wrote Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. Alex Sink, the former chief financial officer of Florida and the 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, is her party's consensus candidate. David Jolly, who served as a former general counsel for Young and also worked as a lobbyist, will face off against state Sen. Kathleen Peters in the January 14 Republican primary. Arizona 2 . A rematch in swing district in southern Arizona will receive plenty of national media attention in 2014. Democratic Rep. Ron Barber is running for re-election in the Tucson area district that he won by less than 2,500 votes in 2012. Barber will face off against the same Republican challenger he edged out last time - retired Air Force Col. Martha McSally. The top 12 campaign questions of 2014 . While Barber came out on top in the 2012 contest, GOP nominee Mitt Romney narrowly captured Arizona's 2nd Congressional District in the presidential election. It's been in the headlines the past four years. Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords pushed back against the GOP wave in the 2010 midterms and won re-election. But two months later, Giffords was seriously hurt in a shooting that left six people dead. She left Congress in 2012. Barber, a top Giffords aide and who was also injured in the shooting, won the special election to succeed her. Democrats are determined to keep the seat, but Republicans see it as a prime pickup opportunity. Massachusetts 6 . This is a race in the Northeast that could produce a lot of intrigue. Incumbent John Tierney has held the solidly Democratic Massachusetts seat since 1997, but nearly lost it in 2012 after his wife's conviction for her role in her brother's illegal gambling venture. Displeased Democrats saw an opening after Tierney's narrow victory, so now he faces a primary test from Seth Moulton, a Marine who served four tours in Iraq and has been able to raise a significant amount of money. The primary winner could face Tierney's rival last time out, Republican Richard Tisei. He is a longtime state legislator and would be the first openly gay member of the GOP to be elected to Congress. Mostly ignored, shifts emerge in the politics of poverty . Idaho 2 . There is no question that a Republican is going to win this race but who will it be? The contest in Idaho's 2nd Congressional District illustrates the deep friction within the Republican Party. Incumbent Mike Simpson has served in the House for 14 years, leads an Appropriations subcommittee, and is a close friend of Speaker John Boehner. But the tea party wing of the GOP wants him out. The influential outside group, Club for Growth, has listed Simpson as one of its primary targets. One of the many things it doesn't like about him is his vote to reopen the government following the 16-day shutdown in October. The group is backing tea party activist and Idaho Falls attorney Bryan Smith. But Simpson has his friends. The Main Street Partnership, run by former Rep. Steve LaTourette, has vowed to spend $1 million dollars helping him win re-election. When moderates fight back: GOP civil war could be brutal in 2014 elections . ""This May 2014 GOP primary has already turned into an all-out proxy war between the GOP's ideological purists like the Club for Growth .. .and Speaker John Boehner,"" Cook Political Report wrote. This is likely to be one of the most expensive - and closely watched - primary House races. California 10 . This electoral mood in the central California district currently favors Republican incumbent Jeff Denham. But this race is interesting because it could be closely tied to what happens -- or doesn't happen -- in Washington this year. The 10th Congressional District includes the city of Modesto and parts of the San Joaquin Valley. It is largely farm land. More than 40% of its residents are Latino, so immigration reform is going likely to be a critical factor for these residents. 4 ways immigration reform could happen - or not . Denham has been pushing fellow House Republicans to take up the issue but its fate is uncertain. Bee farmer Michael Eggman has already jumped in the race, running as a Democrat, and Denham's 2012 challenger, Jose Hernandez, the first Latino NASA astronaut in space, could also be a factor. While Obama won the district with just over 50% of the vote, Cook Political Report predicts the electorate will be more Republican in a non-election year. Honorable mention... Utah 4 . The election in Utah's 4th Congressional District will be in the national spotlight not because it's considered a close contest - it's not - but because of the candidate who's expected to come out on top come November. Republican Mia Love, an African-American Mormon, lost the 2012 race in the district that stretches from central Utah to the southern suburbs of Salt Lake City to longtime Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson by less than 800 votes. Love, who had the support of tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives, was featured prominently by the national party with a prime speaking slot at the 2012 GOP convention. Love announced in 2013 that she would once again challenge Matheson. But last month, Matheson announced he would retire at the end of his term, making Love the instant frontrunner.

"(CNN) -- FIFA is coming under growing pressure from some of Europe's leading football federations to take ""urgent action"" and restore confidence in the world governing body. Under-fire FIFA has faced heavy criticism over its refusal to publish a key report into allegations of corruption surrounding the World Cup bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments in Russia and Qatar. England's 2018 bid was singled out for particular criticism by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert when he delivered his 42-page summary of Michael Garcia's report last week. But the English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has hit back, confirming he will be writing to every member of the FIFA executive committee asking for full publication. ""I am writing to each member of the FIFA Executive Committee on behalf of the FA to urge you to insist on the publication of Mr Garcia's full report as a matter of some urgency. ""As you probably know the reputation of FIFA was already low in England and much of Europe before the events of last week."" FIFA had hoped Eckert's summary would draw a veil over the bidding process, but that hope was scuppered when American lawyer Garcia said the 42-page report was error ridden. ""The failure to publish Mr Garcia's report and his statement that the summary report which was published contained ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations"" has resulted in a further decline in public confidence of FIFA,"" added Dyke. ""We cannot go on like this. Complete transparency is required if the actions of all those who bid, including England 2018, are to be judged fairly."" Dyke went on to ask members of the FIFA executive committee to think of the greater good for FIFA and football. ""I know some of you believe that FIFA's reputation in England is the result of an obsession amongst the English media with FIFA and I know Mr Blatter sees their reports as an unfair attack on the organization he leads,"" said Blatter. ""However, in England we see it differently. If you read a whole range of English newspaper reports about FIFA, particularly those in the Sunday Times, they do provide compelling evidence of wrong doing. ""They cannot be simply dismissed as ""racist"" or ""an attack on FIFA"" as Mr Blatter described them at the FIFA Congress in Brazil. ""Urgent action is needed if confidence in FIFA is to be rebuilt in England. The FA is of the view that this action should start with the full publication of Mr Garcia's report."" Dyke's move comes after the England's 2018 bid team was accused of acting improperly during the bidding process by the report. The FA was accused accused of attempting to ""curry favor"" with former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner, who left his role in 2011 following allegations of bribery. The report claims that the England bidding team sponsored a $55,000 gala dinner for the Caribbean Football Union, allowed the Trinidad and Tobago under-20 squad to hold a training camp in the United Kingdom in 2009 and attempted to help a ""person of interest"" to Warner find a job in the country. A spokesman for the FA refuted the claims in a statement on the organization's website. ""We note the FIFA Ethics Committee has today published a 42- page report in relation to the bidding processes for the FIFA World Cups in 2018 and 2022. ""We were not given any prior notice of the report before publication. We do not accept any criticism regarding the integrity of England's bid or any of the individuals involved. ""We conducted a transparent bid and, as the report demonstrates with its reference to the England bid team's 'full and valuable cooperation', willingly complied with the investigation. We maintain that transparency and cooperation around this entire process from all involved is crucial to its credibility. ""We also note that after a lengthy investigatory process and assessment, the report has concluded that the 'potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report regarding the England 2018 bid were, all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the FIFA World Cup 2018/22 bidding process as a whole'."" Simon Johnson, who was part of the England 2018 bid, told CNN last week that the report was a ""politically motivated whitewash"". ""Even before it was published, I had no confidence in the report,"" he said. ""Now Garcia has come out and told us there are inaccuracies why should anyone believe anything? ""Mr Garcia had limited powers and couldn't investigate everybody he wanted to. ""He didn't speak to a number of members form the executive committee.""","FIFA coming under increasing pressure from member nations .

"(CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's intended presence as chief guest of honor at India's Republic Day parade in New Delhi on Sunday symbolizes the significance India places on an ever-closer relationship with Japan in their mutual quest to counter the economic and strategic might of China. Abe, whose Defense Minister, Itsunori Onodera, was in India earlier this month for talks on expanded bilateral defense cooperation, will see some of India's latest military hardware on display in the traditional parade, including its nuclear-capable long-range missiles, the Agni 4 and Agni 5. India successfully tested a 4,000-km range Agni 4 on January 20 from its Wheeler Island launch site in the Bay of Bengal. Republic Day is the most high-profile event on the Indian political calendar, and the government makes a point of inviting leaders from countries with whom it seeks to cultivate closer ties. Chief guests in recent years have included the presidents of Indonesia and South Korea, for example. Last month, India and Japan held their first bilateral naval exercise in Indian waters off the coast of Chennai, following on from a similar exercise in Japanese waters in June 2012. The two sides have also taken part in the multilateral ""Malabar"" naval exercises in recent years, joining US, Australian and Singaporean ships. Territorial disputes . Japan and India, the second and third-biggest economies in Asia behind China, both have an uneasy relationship with Beijing. Tensions between Japan and China are running high over territorial disputes in the East China Sea centered on the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, and over the controversial December 26 visit by Abe to the Yasukuni Shrine, the Tokyo site regarded by China, North Korea and South Korea as a symbol of Japan's imperial military past and honors war criminals. India and China fought a brief border war in 1962 and had a serious military standoff last April when India alleged that Chinese troops crossed into Indian-held territory near Ladakh in the Himalayan mountain range. China denied any incursion. There were further incidents in July near Ladakh and in August in Arunachal Pradesh, the northeastern Indian state where China also has laid claim to territory. Since then, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang have pledged ""maximum restraint"" on border issues. They vowed not to seek ""unilateral superiority"" along the 3,500-km border when they signed an agreement in Beijing last October. Japan -- and Abe in particularly -- has long regarded India as a powerful counterweight to China's strategic rise in the Indo-Pacific region. In his 2007 book ""Towards a Beautiful Country: My Vision for Japan,"" Abe singled out India for special attention, writing that it would not surprise him if ""in another decade, Japan-India relations overtake Japan-U.S. and Japan-China ties."" China-Japan trade . That goal looks improbable -- at least on the economic front. Japan's $340 billion of annual two-way trade with China dwarfs its $20 billion trade ties with India -- a consequence of the many Japanese businesses based in China -- but India has long been the biggest recipient of Japanese development aid and both sides are keen to grow business and investment ties. During Abe's upcoming visit, he and Singh are expected to discuss Japanese investment and assistance for the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and other infrastructure projects such as the Mumbai Metro. Japan is also keen to sell its unique ShinMaywa US-2 search and rescue seaplane to the Indian defense forces. Asked at a press conference in New Delhi on January 6 about Chinese concerns over the proposal, Japanese Defense Minister Onodera said he believed China was probably the world's biggest exporter of weapons. ""I feel there is an incongruity that China, which sells lots of weapons globally, is concerned about Japan's attempt to export the US-2, which is not even a weapon but just a seaplane. I speculate that the international community has the same view as ours,"" he said. Mistakes of past . Abe, who became Japanese prime minister in December 2012 -- a role he also held in 2006-07 -- has shown an assertive style in his attempts to rebuild Japan's economic and military status in the Indo-Pacific region. His approach prompted sustained criticism from China during 2013, urging Japan to ""adopt a correct attitude"" and reflect on the mistakes of its militaristic past. Predictably, Abe's December 26 visit to Yasukuni Shrine evoked strong reactions from both China and South Korea. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on January 9 that Abe, by his actions and words, had ""shut the door"" on dialogue with the Chinese side. ""It shows that he does not have even the slightest interest in improving relations with China and other Asian neighbors,"" Hua said. For China, a warmer relationship between Japan and India is just another indicator of what it regards as a U.S.-led attempt to encircle or contain China. In its view, the Obama administration's ""Asian pivot,"" with its enhanced military cooperation with countries such as Japan, Australia and the Philippines, is a vehicle to delay or derail China's natural ascension as the preeminent Asian power.","India and Japan have been in talks on expanded bilateral defense cooperation .
Both Asian powers have endured an uneasy relationship with China .
Japan has long regarded India as a powerful counterweight to Beijing's strategic rise .
Yet trade between China and Japan dwarfs trade between Tokyo and India ."
"(CNN) -- An Ottoman-era portico in Mecca's Grand Mosque has become the latest battleground in a conflict between those who want to preserve the city's architectural heritage and Saudi authorities pushing for redevelopment. The 17th century portico -- one of the oldest parts of the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest -- is being removed by Mecca authorities as part of an expansion project to create more space for soaring numbers of pilgrims. Millions of people visit Mecca and Medina annually (two million of them during the Hajj pilgrimage alone), a number that is only expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. However, one UK-based Saudi historian says what Saudi authorities are doing in Mecca amounts to ""cultural vandalism."" Irfan Al Alawi, executive director of the Islamic Heritage Research Foundation, which seeks to preserve historical sites in Saudi Arabia, says significant features of Mecca and Medina's architectural history are being lost on account of the renovations. He has called on the Muslim world to voice its disapproval at the demolitions, which he likened to the torching of ancient manuscripts by Islamists in Timbuktu, Mali. Every follower must carry out the Hajj once in their lives, if physically and financially able to do so. Overcrowding at the Hajj has resulted in fatal stampedes on a number of occasions, with 1,426 pilgrims killed in 1990 and more than 350 killed in 2006. Saudi Binladin Group's Mohammed Jom'a, the supervisor of the project at Mecca's Grand Mosque, told CNN the expansion would triple the amount of space there. ""(The authorities) want to offer more space to the pilgrims to avoid crowds,"" he said. But Al Alawi says there's a better way. ""I'm not against expanding the mosques at all, but there are ways you can go about it without destroying the historical aspects of these sites,"" he said. ""Rather than engaging with heritage concerns, the Saudis are simply not interested."" Clashes with Turkey . Turkey says it is alarmed by the loss of the Ottoman portico and its Foreign Affairs Ministry has been in correspondence with the Saudis over the matter since 2010. More from Inside the Middle East: Can Iraq's geeks save the country? ""It is very important to preserve the Kaaba porches as the legacy of the Ottoman Empire where they stand,"" Turkey's Directorate for Cultural Properties and Museums said in a statement to CNN. CNN contacted the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs, local officials in Saudi Arabia, including the Mayor and Municipality of Mecca and the Saudi Embassy in London. But we were unsuccessful in getting a response to our request for comment. Al Alawi said the authorities were inclined not to value aspects of Mecca's heritage that dated from before Saudi control over the city -- such as the portico, going back centuries to Ottoman sovereignty over the city -- because that evidence of a pre-Saudi Mecca undermined the kingdom's important position in the Islamic world as guardians of the city. This is not the first time Saudi authorities have clashed with Turkey over the destruction of Ottoman-era buildings in Mecca, which Turkey views as in important part of a shared Islamic heritage. In 2002, Ankara made a heated protest about the destruction of Mecca's Al Ajyad fortress, built on a hill overlooking the Kaaba in the late 18th century. Both the citadel and the hill it sat on were demolished to make way for the skyscraper city that today looms over the Grand Mosque, prompting Turkey's then Minister of Culture, Istemihan Talay, to accuse the Saudis of an ""act of barbarism."" Mecca's changing face . Over the past 10 years, Mecca's skyline has transformed. Lavish skyscrapers now tower over devotees circling the Kaaba in the Grand Mosque. Most imposing is the Royal Mecca Clock Tower, a 120-floor hotel that resembles London's Big Ben and which, at 601 meters, is the world's second tallest building. The U.S.-based Institute for Gulf Affairs estimates that 95% of Mecca's millennium-old buildings have been demolished in the past two decades. Saudi authorities say the changes are part of a push to modernize offerings to pilgrims, who have traditionally stayed in austere lodgings. The Saudi government is also pushing forward with major redevelopments at Medina's Mosque of the Prophet -- where the Prophet is believed to be buried. More from Inside the Middle East: Palestinian women change motor racing up a gear . Al Alawi claims the threat to the heritage of the mosques adds to a wider pattern of destruction of historic sites in Saudi Arabia. He says it reflects an ideological agenda stemming from the kingdom's ultraconservative Wahhabist brand of Islam. He added that the Wahhabis place great emphasis on avoiding the sin of ""shirq"" -- idolatry, or polytheism -- which they believe is encouraged by shrines, tombs or anything that could promote alternative forms of worship, or the veneration of an entity other than Allah. The Commission for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice says it plans to close or eradicate 14 historic sites around Mecca, so that pilgrims from other countries cannot engage in idolatrous rituals there, the Saudi Gazette reported last month. As a consequence of their Wahhabist beliefs, said Al Alawi, the Saudis had systematically destroyed such sites since the early days of the kingdom. Demolitions over the decades . In 1925, the year the first Saudi king, Ibn Saud, captured Medina, the Saudis demolished the mausoleums in al-Baqi cemetery attached to the Mosque of the Prophet. More from Inside the Middle East: Who will win battle for the new Tunisia? The raids at al-Baqi -- which is believed to house the remains of number of the prophet's wives, children and other relatives -- and at the Mualla cemetery in Mecca, caused an outcry from the international Muslim community. Some still mourn the destruction as a ""day of sorrow."" Separately, the site of the house said to belong to the prophet's first wife, Khadijah, which Al Alawi was involved in excavating in the 1980s, today contains a toilet block for pilgrims, while the site believed to be the prophet's birthplace was a cattle market before being turned into a library. Some Salafist groups abroad, such as Egypt's Ansar Al Sunna Al Muhammadyeh, support the renovations around the Grand Mosque. ""We do not sanctify places or people, but we go according to what the Quran said and what the Prophet said,"" the group's secretary general, Sheikh Ahmed Yousef, told CNN. ""There is no place that is holier than the Kaaba, so if the Saudi government decided to expand then this is because they care about Islam more than the heritage.""","Saudi authorities have begun dismantling a historic Ottoman area of Mecca's Grand Mosque .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday night's ""Larry King Live,"" guest host Joy Behar talked about whether the Rihanna/Chris Brown case sends a dangerous message. Robin Givens told Joy Behar Tuesday night that details of domestic abuse are often the same. Among her guests were Robin Givens and Denise Brown. In an emotional interview, Behar examines how domestic abuse starts and why it's hard to stop. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Guest host Joy Behar: In a ""Larry King Live"" exclusive, Robin Givens and Denise Brown sound the warning to one quarter of all women who will be kicked, punched, raped, even killed by partners in their life times. ... We're talking about Rihanna and Chris Brown and the allegations against him. As you've just heard, the numbers are pretty appalling. Joining me now is someone who lived it: actress, ex-wife of former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson and spokesperson for the National Domestic Violence Hotline, Robin Givens. Greetings. Robin Givens: Greetings. Behar: Does this Rihanna/Chris Brown [story] bring up bad memories for you? Givens: Yes, it does. Behar: Tell me how you've been feeling lately while you're watching this on television? Givens: Even sitting now, you know, here with you, it shakes you up. You know, you begin to sweat. You begin to feel sad all over.  ... It's hard to sit here.  Watch Givens describe living with abuse » . Behar. You were saying to me before that it's always the same story. What do you mean by that? Givens:  I've spoken to women every[where]. ...  Peoria, El Paso. ... And what's amazing is that I find that my story is their story; their story is my story -- down to the details. He dragged me down the hall by my hair. He pulled me out of bed by my panties. He would like to choke me. He would kick. When I wrote my book, I was somewhere talking about something. And a woman came up to me and she said I wanted you to stop talking because I felt like everybody would know that you were talking about me. Behar: Oh, boy. And it's the same progression, too, it seems? Givens: I was hit for the first time before I was married. And I did what you thought you should do, of course. You know, you don't take any phone calls. Three days, absolutely not. Absolutely not. All of a sudden, you start taking a phone calls. Behar: Softening up. Givens: Yes. And then all of a sudden, OK, let's meet and we'll talk. And then you meet and all of a sudden this person, this man that you love, that's claiming his love for you, is crying, you know? And then you're consoling them. And it just becomes, I'll never, ever, ever do it again. ...  I just love you so much. It's so hard for me to handle how much I love you. And it just begins. Behar: It must have touched you a little bit, too, like here's this big heavyweight champion crying ... Givens: Yes. ... To see a man crying like that and promising and professing his love, I thought well, he must love me. ... Behar: In the fall of that year, you and Mike sat down with Barbara Walters to talk about the relationship. Here's an excerpt: . Barbara Walters, host: What's it been like, this roller coaster? Givens: It's been torture. It's been pure hell. It's been worse than anything I could possibly imagine. ... He shakes. He pushes. He swings. Sometimes I think he's trying to scare me. Behar: That is a most interesting moment  in that interview, which I've seen many times. What was going on in your head during that interview? Givens: Well, I was so numb. Barbara knew what was going on in our lives and encouraged me to be honest. I wanted to be honest and thought it would help other people. ... Behar: By the way, he [Tyson] was never convicted of anything? Givens: No. ...  It's interesting, though. He had done an interview somewhere. ...  I don't know specifically, but [he said] the best punch he ever threw was against me and that he punched me in the head and I bounced from one wall to the other. Behar: After the interview [with Walters], though, you stayed with him. Givens: Yes. Behar: Why did you stay with him? Givens: Well, he had said that he was going to get help. And I loved him. I wanted to make it work. I was very bonded. And it's hard to be bonded and save yourself at the same time. Behar: One of the most influential women in the world used her considerable power to speak up about domestic abuse. Here's what Oprah Winfrey had to say. Winfrey: Heal yourself first. And, also, love doesn't hurt. I've been saying this to women for years, love doesn't hurt. ... And if a man hits you once, he will hit you again. ... He will hit you again. Behar: If Oprah was speaking to you, too, call the National Domestic Violence Hot Line now. The number is 1-800-799-SAFE. That's 1-800-799-7233. ... Denise Brown's sister was Nicole Brown. We all know Nicole Brown Simpson, O.J. Simpson's former wife. Greetings, Denise. How are you? Denise Brown: I am doing great. And I'm listening to all this information that you guys are talking about and it's amazing. It's so great to get out there. You talk about the dirty little secret. And it is. It's just that -- a dirty little secret. And then you're talking about what Oprah said -- if they hit you once, they'll hit you again. You can even go one step further, Joy, and you can say if they hit you once, they'll hit you again. And if they ever threaten to kill you, eventually one day they will. ... You know, it's the cycle of domestic violence, which is about the power and control of one human being over another -- the verbal, the emotional, the psychological abuse, you know, the chipping away at one's self-esteem. I'm sure you heard it, Robin: you know, nobody is going to want you. I'm the best thing for you. Givens: Um-hmm. Brown: And then that escalates into the physical violence, which is the hitting, the kicking, the punching, throwing up against the walls. And then, of course, [comes] the honeymoon phase. And that's the 'oh, baby, I'm so sorry. It's never going to happen again.' Givens: She's absolutely right. The woman -- every woman tells the same  story. Behar: If you read the Internet now, there's some hostility toward Rihanna. They're saying she provoked Chris. What do you make of that? Givens: I don't know why that is. I mean I don't know why in our society that is, that we blame the victim. Brown: Battery treatment programs is what people need. I spoke to a gentleman, Dr. Donald Dutton. He wrote a book, ""The Batterer."" He said right now, it would take three years for people that are batterers to get that mindset to change. And I'm sure that's even more. And our society does not take it serious enough ... until, of course, there's a murder or there's a celebrity or something of that nature, which is really sad. Givens: The one thing I'd like to say to Rihanna, actually; as difficult as this all is, she does not have to answer to the media. She doesn't have to explain it. She has to take care of herself. Behar: Thank you all very much. Go to CNN.com/LarryKing if you have something to say about domestic abuse. If you need help, there are resources listed there for you. Don't wait. Get help now.","Robin Givens, Denise Brown talk about women and domestic violence .

"(CNN) -- New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald confirmed Tuesday that it has agreed to settle with American Airlines for $135 million in a lawsuit seeking damages from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The settlement was announced on Friday, but the amount was not released until Tuesday. ""For the insurance companies, this was just another case, just another settlement, but not for us,"" Howard W. Lutnick, Cantor Fitzgerald's chairman and CEO, said in a statement. ""We could never, and will never, consider it ordinary. For us, there is no way to describe this compromise with inapt words like ordinary, fair or reasonable. All we can say is that the legal formality of this matter is over."" In 2004, Cantor Fitzgerald filed a lawsuit seeking $1 billion in damages from American Airlines. The firm claimed that American Airlines was negligent by failing to detect the hijackers, permitting them to board and hijack the airplane. The firm claimed the negligence resulted in business interruption losses and the destruction of its office and corporate property. Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 employees when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into its top-floor offices in the World Trade Center's North Tower. ""American Airlines and the courageous crew members and passengers on Flight 77 and Flight 11 were all victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. American has vigorously defended itself in litigation brought against it by property owners and their insurers who allege that American should have done what the government could not do: prevent the terrorist attacks,"" American Airlines said in a statement. The settlement still needs to be approved by the judge, which is scheduled for January 13. ""Our insurers have agreed to settle the claims by Cantor Fitzgerald. Although this settlement ends these particular legal disputes, American will forever honor the memory of the true victims and selfless heroes of 9/11,"" American Airlines said. CNN's Elizabeth Landers contributed to this report.","Cantor Fitzgerald lost 658 employees in the World Trade Center on 9/11 .

"(CNN) -- You've seen this person. Maybe you've even been this person. We're talking about someone shuffling along a sidewalk or through a shopping mall, so entranced by the phone in their hands that they bump into people or almost get run over. Yes, this behavior can be annoying. Now we have scientific evidence it can be dangerous. A new study has found that people who type or read on their phones while walking are less likely to look at their surroundings, keep their balance or walk in a straight line. This may seem obvious to anyone who has been jostled by an oblivious text messager. But researchers at Australia's University of Queensland say theirs is the first study to measure how typing text on a cellphone impacts ""gait performance"" and kinematics, or the study of body motion. ""Texting, and to a lesser extent reading, on your mobile phone affects your ability to walk and balance,"" said Siobhan M. Schabrun, an honorary senior fellow at the University of Queensland and the lead author of the study. ""This may impact the safety of people who text and walk at the same time."" The perils of texting while driving are well documented. But texting while walking has its own pitfalls. In January 2011 a woman fell headlong into a fountain at a Pennsylvania mall while tapping on her phone, a blunder that was captured by a security camera and was widely mocked on YouTube. Last October an Illinois man was struck by a car while texting on his phone and walking in the middle of a highway (authorities said he also was drinking at the time). And a nationwide study by Ohio State University last year found that the number of pedestrians treated in U.S. emergency rooms for injuries related to phone use while walking has more than doubled since 2005. In the new Australian study, scientists studied the effect of phone use while walking in 26 healthy people. Each person walked in a line over a distance of about 28 feet while doing one of three tasks: walking without the use of a phone, reading text on a phone, or typing the sentence, ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."" Their bodies' movements were evaluated using a three-dimensional movement analysis system. Researchers found that texting, and to a lesser extent reading, affected movements while walking. When participants were texting, they walked more slowly, deviated more from a straight line and moved their neck less than when reading on their phones. The study was published Wednesday in PLOS ONE, a peer-reviewed online journal that publishes reports on primary research from a variety of scientific disciplines.","Study: Texting while walking can pose a safety risk .

"(CNN) -- A year ago on April 15, two brothers of Chechen heritage who were raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, were alleged to have carried out a spectacular bombing at the Boston Marathon that killed three, wounded more than 200 and led to a massive manhunt that paralyzed the city and its suburbs for days. The older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police shortly after the bombing, while the younger brother, Dzhokhar, surrendered to authorities and is awaiting trial. As is often the case with big news events, much of what we understood to be the case in the immediate aftermath of the event and what we now know about the bombing a year later are quite different. Consider that shortly after the bombing, it was widely assumed Tamerlan Tsarnaev had traveled to Dagestan in southern Russia a year earlier to meet and train with some of the Islamist rebels there who are fighting the Russian army. Many commentators, including us, thought it was quite unlikely that the brothers could have learned how to construct two effective bombs that blew up within seconds of each other at the Boston Marathon without some kind of specialized training such as what could be obtained from the rebels in Dagestan. Also, at first blush, the Tsarnaev brothers appeared to be so-called ""clean skins"" who had no previous history of criminality, and therefore there was little reason that law enforcement should have been monitoring either of them. Similarly, both appeared to be regular guys with no history of mental disorders. All of these assumptions have turned out to be wrong. Here are four things we've learned since then: . One: There is no evidence Tamerlan Tsarnaev had any contact with Islamist militants overseas. In January 2012, Tamerlan left Massachusetts for a six-month trip to Dagestan. There he became close to members of an organization called the Union of the Just, a nonviolent group that is critical of the United States. He also began attending a mosque that was frequented by hardline Sunni Muslims. Russian security officials claim he met with Islamist extremists in Dagestan, but U.S. intelligence services have not been able to confirm those allegations. Russian officials also found ""frequent"" electronic communication between Tamerlan and Russian-Canadian extremist William Plotnikov, but FBI officials in Moscow say it is unlikely the two made contact in person while Tamerlan was in Dagestan. Media sources in the region have also alleged that Tamerlan met with Mahmoud Mansour Nidal, who was reportedly a recruiter for Islamist fighters in the region. Nidal was killed in a raid by Russian forces on May 19, 2012. Again, official American investigators have not unearthed any evidence that supports this claim. And experts on the security climate in Dagestan say it is unlikely that Tamerlan could have met with known extremists and not have then been detained and questioned by the Russian security service on his way out of the country (which didn't happen). Two: The Tsarnaev brothers did not have any formal training in bomb building. Instead, they apparently followed bomb-making instructions they found in an English-language al Qaeda webzine. The House Homeland Security Committee released an extensive report last month on the Boston bombings that did not mention that either of the Tsarnaevs had received any professional training on how to build an explosive device. Rather, they appear to have followed step-by-step instructions for how to build a bomb that were published in 2011 in Inspire, a webzine produced by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) that is targeted at English-speaking Muslims. Three: The FBI now alleges that Tamerlan was implicated in a triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts, in 2011. On May 22, 2013, a month after the Boston bombings, Ibrahim Todashev was shot and killed by an FBI agent after Todashev attacked him with a pole while he was being interrogated at his apartment in Florida. According to the FBI, Todashev was about to sign a written statement implicating himself and Tamerlan in the murders of Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman and Rafi Teken on September 11, 2011. Investigators reported that the victims' throats were slashed so viciously that they were almost decapitated, and their bodies were strewn with a pound and a half of high-quality marijuana. Another 8 and a half pounds of marijuana was left in jars and bags around the apartment, as well as about $5,000 in cash, and there was no sign of forced entry. Therefore, the murderers appeared to know the three victims. Mess was one of Tamerlan's best friends, but the law enforcement officials never questioned the elder Tsarnaev brother about the case, and it remained unsolved until after the Tsarnaevs were identified as the main suspects in the Boston bombings. If the FBI allegations are correct, Tamerlan was a dangerous killer well before the Boston bombings and a more thorough investigation of the triple homicide in Waltham, Massachusetts could well have derailed the Boston Marathon plot. Four: Tamerlan may have had mental health problems. According to an excellent investigation of the Tsarnaev brothers by the The Boston Globe, Tamerlan told his mother, Zubeidat, ""that he felt there were two people living inside of him,"" according to Anna Nikaeva, a Chechen who knew the Tsarnaev parents. Tamerlan also told Donald Larking, a friend at the mosque he attended, that he heard two angry voices inside his head telling him to do things. Could some kind of intervention by a mental health professional have helped Tamerlan with his problems and averted the Boston Marathon plot? This question cannot, of course, be answered, but what is clear is that the Boston bombings were not directed by al Qaeda or an allied group and are part of a trend in the United States over the past years in which fewer terrorist plots have any kind of a connection to an overseas terrorist organization. They are also part of a related trend in which plots no longer involve groups of conspirators but are carried out either by individuals or by pairs such as the Tsarnaev brothers. In a sense, this reflects a victory for law enforcement efforts. Lone-wolf type attacks of the kind we saw in Boston, while undeniably tragic for the victims, are not a national catastrophe of the scale of 9/11, which was carried out by a large, well-organized terrorist group.","Authors: Much of what we thought we knew about Boston bombing was wrong .
No evidence Tamerlan Tsarnaev plotted the crime with overseas terrorists, they say .
The bombs apparently were homemade, based on information found online ."

"(CNN) -- When confronted by gruesome images of a man being beheaded by terrorists, what should you do? News organizations have grappled with these kinds of questions for decades. Now, with the prevalence of social media, website operators and ordinary Internet users face the same question. On Tuesday, when ISIS published a video showing the murder of American journalist James Foley, most Western news outlets shunned the goriest portion of the video but chose to show still photos from the minutes before the beheading. Some commenters urged news outlets to exercise even more restraint and refrain from using the photos at all. That same dynamic played out on Twitter and Facebook, as well. As some users shared photos and links to the video, others exhorted them to share earlier photos of Foley's life and links to examples of his reporting instead. It was almost as if users were collectively developing their own sets of standards. Kelly Foley, a cousin of the slain journalist, wrote on Twitter, ""Don't watch the video. Don't share it. That's not how life should be."" But there's a big difference between individual user decisions and institutional decisions by Twitter and YouTube. For the Web sites, blocking objectionable content is a form of editing. YouTube removes video . The slickly-produced, high-definition video was originally uploaded to YouTube, but was taken off the site within a matter of hours. YouTube also sought to take down duplicates whenever they were posted. A YouTube representative said the site, owned by Google, has ""clear policies that prohibit content like gratuitous violence, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users."" ""We also terminate any account registered by a member of a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and used in an official capacity to further its interests,"" the representative added. Videos of ISIS executions are still accessible through other sites, however. One such site, LiveLeak, said Wednesday that it was ""currently experiencing an abnormally high volume of traffic."" Twitter suspends accounts . Twitter faced similar issues -- and a tremendous amount of pressure from its users about the balancing act between freedom of expression and basic human decency. ""We have been and are actively suspending accounts as we discover them related to this graphic imagery,"" Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo wrote in an early Wednesday morning post on the site. It all amounted to a particularly grotesque version of whack-a-mole. At one point Tuesday evening, simply tweeting the word ""beheading"" resulted in replies from spam accounts that attached a photo of Foley's severed head. Twitter briefly suspended the account of a journalist who shared photos of the beheading, but reinstated it later. Propaganda value of images . CNN is not airing the video on television or online, but is showing stills from the minutes before the beheading and an audio clip from it. ""It's news that the executioner's accent may offer a hint about his identity,"" CNN International anchor Jonathan Mann said in a television segment that explained the network's decision-making. ""It's news that may change what governments and armies do next. It's news that other journalists will spread... and that social media will spread without any journalists involved, no matter what we do. It's news that extremists wanted us all to spread... and they killed a man, at least in part, so that we'd do it."" Mann added, ""What should we do? We thought about it, and we hope we made the right choice."" The tabloid New York Post newspaper decided to go further, publishing on its front page a frame from the video that shows a terrorist beginning to cut into Foley's head. The newspaper headline says ""SAVAGES."" Some Internet users subsequently suggested that the Post's Twitter account should be suspended, too. The horrific case revived long-running debates about whether news coverage of a terrorist act gives the terrorists the publicity they seek. Many Internet users' arguments against showing even still images from the Foley video cited the propaganda value of the video. One of the counter arguments is that people should see -- must see -- the atrocities. Some of the same debates took place in 2002, after al Qaeda extremists beheaded the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl and published the video on the Internet. Steve Goldstein, who was the head of corporate communications for the Journal at the time, said he had to ""urge the networks not to run the video."" In Foley's case, he said, ""it's good to see that the networks are acting so responsibly in this case by refusing to show this barbaric action."" Twitter removes images of beheading . Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors . CNN's Laurie Segall and Samuel Burke contributed to this report.","Images and videos of James Foley's beheading are on the Internet .

"(CNN) -- Two children -- who were among five in a suburban Atlanta house without any adults -- died and another is in critical condition after their home went up in flames, a fire department spokesman said Saturday. Firefighters arriving shortly after 11 p.m. Friday found three of four sides of a Decatur, Georgia, home on fire, according to DeKalb County Fire and Rescue spokesman Eric L. Jackson. ""Crews kicked in the door and were met with heavy smoke,"" he said. Two children managed to get outside on their own, but the other three were inside the house when firefighters arrived. Firefighters found them fairly quickly, taking them outside to treat them, Jackson said. A third child was later located farther inside the house. ""They were bringing the kids out and that's it,"" neighbor Shantel Ammamoo told CNN affiliate WSB. ""They were gone.""

""I thought I would probably starve for four or five days and then I would have to buy something."" Instead, Dubanchet was surprised at the abundance of discarded produce he was able to scavenge from supermarkets, bakeries and restaurants. He was easily able to fuel himself on his epic trek through Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the Czech Republic. Along the way, the former fast food worker has learned valuable lessons about the trash habits of the different European nations he visited. Rooting through refuse . ""I'm trying to protest against the huge waste of food. It's completely absurd and pointless,"" says Dubanchet, who planned his trip to coincide with the European Union's declared ""Year Against Food Waste."" ""We're wasting really good resources -- there's so much water, energy and pollution involved in creating something that ends up in the trash. And there are millions of people starving."" Sticking to a strict rule of only eating food that had been thrown out or was destined for the trash, Dubanchet asked the permission of supermarket and restaurant staff before rooting through their refuse. Occasionally he climbed fences to access dumpsters. People in some countries were more understanding than others, he says. ""In the Czech Republic, it was quite difficult,"" he says. ""People didn't really understand what the project was -- they thought I was homeless, they didn't really understand the foreigner who asked for food from the trash and all the supermarkets had it quite well locked up. ""I went for days eating mainly just bread."" Germany, he says, was the easiest country for dumpster diving, not because there was more food waste, but because people were more receptive to his mission. ""I think all the countries' waste is about the same. The supermarkets in all countries work in a similar way: the fruit and vegetables must look perfect and the ones that don't go in the trash. ""In Germany, a lot of people were supportive of the project -- sometimes at supermarkets, my request would be asked of the boss and the boss would say no. But then a guy would come back and say, 'I'm really sorry my boss says no, but wait, my boss is a jerk, so come back later and I will get you something."" Right place, right time . Luxembourg, too, is a land of plenty for dumpster divers, according to Dubanchet, something he puts down to its relative wealth and relaxed rules on food disposal. As part of his mission, the sustainable development graduate also visited schools to explain his mission to students -- and at the same time chow down on leftovers from the school cafeteria. While he admits growing weary of a diet of stale bread and raw vegetables, there were some culinary highlights -- particularly during his darkest days in the Czech Republic. ""I arrived at a vegan restaurant in Prague where they were so busy they were turning people away,"" he recalls. ""I explained what I was doing to the waiter and he came back minutes later with this beautifully designed plate of food and said 'do you want this?' ""It was the wrong order for the customer and they were going to throw it away. I was starving and I arrived at the right place at the right time."" Other highlights included a jar of honey and dried apricots found in Germany, some tinned goods from Luxembourg and a box of 12 eggs -- consigned to the garbage can because just one was broken. ""I was always happy when I had cakes and sweet things because they don't need cooking and when you're on a bicycle, you need the energy,"" he adds. Dubanchet says he hopes in the future to work with supermarkets and restaurants to find ways of reducing waste. He doesn't rule out further dumpster diving missions. ""Why not? Although when you're eating absolutely nothing that doesn't come from the trash, you go a long time without eating what you want. ""And it's a very long time to go without drinking a single beer."" You can follow Dubanchet's ongoing project at La Faim du Monde.","Baptiste Dubanchet traveled from France to Poland eating food only found in trash cans .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Simone Battle, who appeared to be on the verge of realizing her lifelong dream of stardom, hanged herself Friday, the Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman said Monday. Battle, 25, was an ""X Factor"" finalist in 2011 and a singer with G.R.L., a girls group created last year to replace the Pussycat Dolls. She and her four bandmates found success this year with their music, including a collaboration with Pitbull. G.R.L. performed on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" last month. Battle's boyfriend last saw her alive at 3:45 a.m. Friday in the West Hollywood apartment they shared. He found her hanging in in a closet about four hours later, according to Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter. The autopsy conducted Sunday determined that it was a suicide, Winter said. G.R.L. collaborated with Pitbull on the song ""Wild Wild Love,"" which rose to No. 30 on Billboard's Hot 100 this year. Pitbull tweeted his condolences Saturday: ""My heart and prayers go out to @GRLSimone: @grl and her family. RIP Dios la bendiga."" G.R.L.'s latest single was ""Ugly Heart,"" released in June, according to Billboard. Pussycat Dolls founder Robin Antin created G.R.L. as the ""next generation"" of her original group last year. The G.R.L. Twitter account posted this message Saturday: ""Words cannot express the depth of our loss. Simone's incredible talent was only surpassed by the size of her heart."" Battle had said that Whitney Houston ""inspired my dream to be a singer,"" according to the group's official biography on the RCA Records website. She grew up in Los Angeles, singing in a church choir, studying ballet and tap, modeling and acting in television commercials before working an internship with a company associated with the Black Eyed Peas. She studied music and songwriting at the University of Southern California before competing on ""The X Factor,"" where she reached the top 16. The highlight of her acting career was a role in ""We the Party,"" a 2012 film directed by Mario Van Peebles, the bio said.","Simone Battle's group, G.R.L., had recent success with Pitbull .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States secretly shipped out of Iraq more than 500 tons of low-grade uranium dating back to the Saddam Hussein era, the Pentagon said Monday. In this 2003 photo, UN inspectors work at the nuclear facility in Iraq. The U.S. military spent $70 million ensuring the safe transportation of 550 metric tons of the uranium from Iraq to Canada, said Pentagon spokesman Brian Whitman. The shipment, which until recently was kept secret, involved a U.S. truck convoy, 37 cargo flights out of Baghdad to a transitional location, and then a transoceanic voyage on board a U.S.-government-owned ship designed to carry troops to a war zone, he said. The ""yellowcake"" uranium transfer was requested by the Iraqi government at the encouragement of the U.S. government, Whitman said. The United States approached Canadian company Cameco to bid for the material, according Cameco spokesman Lyle Krahn. He would not disclose the winning bid amount. Krahn admitted that this was not a ""routine transaction,"" but he said the agreement was approved by the Canadian government and was carefully monitored. The undertaking, named ""Operation McCall"" by Pentagon officials, was in the planning stages for months and was completed Saturday after the material had been in transit for weeks, according to Whitman. He said yellowcake uranium is a commonly traded commodity used for nuclear power generation. It is not enriched and cannot be used without first going through a complicated enrichment process, he said, but because of the unstable nature of Iraq, the United States and the Iraqi government decided it should be moved out of that country. Iraq has no nuclear power generating plants. The uranium was packed into 110 shipping containers moved by convoy from a facility in Tuwaitha, Iraq, about 12 miles south of Baghdad. The containers were first moved to the secure International Zone in central Baghdad and then to Baghdad International Airport, where thery were loaded onto C-17 cargo planes. It took 37 flights to move the shipping containers out of Iraq to a ""third country,"" Whitman said. A Pentagon official who asked not to be named said that third country was Diego Garcia, a British territory in the Indian Ocean where the United Kingdom and the United States operate a joint military base. From that third country, Whitman said, the containers were loaded onto the SS Gopher State, a U.S.-owned crane ship normally used to haul equipment in and out of war zones. The ship carried the uranium to Canada, where it was bought by Cameco, a private firm. The uranium will be sent by truck to two processing plants in Ontario, Krahn said. Once it has been enriched for energy use it will be sold to power plant operators, he said. The United States is Cameco's largest customer, Krahn said, but he did not specify if the Iraq yellowcake would ultimately end up in the United States. Whitman said the Department of Defense's cost of securing and transporting the uranium from Tuwaitha to Canada was $70 million, and the government of Iraq had agreed in principal to reimburse the United States for part of that cost. He said he could not say how much Iraq intends to repay the United States.","Pentagon: U.S. secretly shipped Iraq's low-grade uranium dating back to Hussein era .

"(CNN) -- The Chinese government has made life ""hell on Earth"" for Tibetans during the half-century since a failed uprising against its rule in 1959, the Dalai Lama said Tuesday. ""These 50 years have brought untold suffering and destruction to the land and people of Tibet,"" the 73-year-old spiritual and political leader of Tibetan Buddhists said from exile in Dharamsala, India. ""Today, the religion, culture, language and identity ... are nearing extinction; in short, the Tibetan people are regarded like criminals deserving to be put to death."" But Chinese officials blame the 50-year conflict on the Dalai Lama, accusing him of seeking an independent Tibet. ""The Dalai side still insists on establishing a so-called Greater Tibet on a quarter of China's territory,"" Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told reporters last week. ""They want to drive away the Chinese armed forces on Chinese territory and ask all non-Tibetans to relocate themselves, people who have long spend their lives in that part of the Chinese territory. You call this person a religious figure?"" Yang said China's ""contradictions"" with the Dalai Lama ""is not about religious, human rights, ethnic or cultural issues but whether or not China will remain unified.""  Watch a former Chinese government spokesman discuss Tibet » . The Dalai Lama has repeatedly denied China's accusations. He says he seeks genuine autonomy for the region -- not independence -- and advocates the ""Middle Way"" of non-violence. The Dalai Lama has won a Nobel Prize for advocating peace and is revered as an iconic figure overseas, but the Dalai Lama has never been allowed to return to Tibet, after fleeing his homeland in 1959. His emissaries have held sporadic talks with Chinese officials. But the talks, encouraged by the United States and other countries, have failed to break the impasse.  Watch an online address by the Dalai Lama » . ""Looking back on 50 years in exile, we have witnessed many ups and downs,"" the Dalai Lama said. ""However, the fact that the Tibet issue is alive and the international community is taking growing interest in it is indeed an achievement."" ""I have no doubt that the justice of Tibet's cause will prevail, if we continue to tread the path of truth and non-violence,"" he said. China has ruled Tibet since 1951, a year after sending troops to ""liberate"" the region from what it said was serfdom under the Dalai Lama. China has decreed that March 28 -- the day the Dalai Lama fled into exile in India -- is to be celebrated as ""Serfs Emancipation Day.""  Watch a recent history of Tibet » . In recent years, the region has seen an influx of Han Chinese and other ethnic groups, enticed by business and job opportunities. Although some Tibetans have benefited from the economic expansion, others have not. China's critics complain of ""cultural genocide"" and repression of religious freedom. Resentful Tibetans say they are often treated as second-class citizens. Last March, resentment spilled over when a peaceful protest in the Tibetan capital Lhasa turned violent, as mobs burned vehicles and shops and attacked ethnic Chinese. China blames the Dalai Lama for inciting protesters -- an allegation he has denied. Tibetan exiles say more than 200 people died when Chinese security forces clamped down, but Beijing denies this, saying 22 people, mostly Chinese civilians, died during riots. Tension was high ahead of the 50th anniversary. China prohibited journalists from traveling into Tibet, but there are reports that extra security troops were deployed to the region to avert a repeat of last year's unrest.","Dalai Lama: ""Untold suffering and destruction"" brought to Tibet under Chinese rule .

"(CNN) -- Where in the world are children toiling dangerous and dirty conditions, missing out on education and other basic rights? A new report by risk analysis firm Maplecroft, which ranks 197 countries, identifies Eritrea, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Sudan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Yemen as the 10 places where child labor is most prevalent. Countries with high poverty rates fare badly in the index due to the need for children to supplement their family income, the report said, but economically important countries like China, India, Russia and Brazil were also found to have extreme risks because child labor laws are often poorly enforced. Trafficking of children into forced labor or sexual exploitation remains a big problem, the report added. Despite its fast-growing economy, China has witnessed a substantial increase in child labor risks over the past year, ranking 20th compared with 53rd a year earlier. The report said that unofficial estimates suggested that 100,000 children are employed in the country's manufacturing sector. CNN Freedom Project . ""The use of vocational work and study schemes, along with the continued use of children in factories, present significant supply chain risks to companies even in the more economically developed provinces,"" the report said. Last year, electronics supplier Foxconn admitted that interns as young as 14 worked at one of its Chinese plants. However, the report pointed to minor improvements in the risk of child labor, with South America now ranked as ""high risk"" rather than ""extreme risk."" In September, the International Labor Organization estimated that the rate of five to 17 year olds engaged in child labor had decreased to 10.6% in 2012 from 13.6% in 2008. The number of children involved in the worst forms of child labor has decreased to 85 million from 115 million during this time. The company compiles the ranking by evaluating the frequency and severity of reported child labor incidents, as well as tracking how governments prevent child labor and ensure perpetrators are held accountable. The index has been developed to help companies understand the risks of children being employed in their supply chains.","Eritrea, Somalia top the latest list for countries where child labor is most prevalent .

When asked about it, Lucas reportedly replied ""I don't know anything about it. I haven't seen it yet."" Somewhere, director J.J. Abrams might be feeling a bit of a sting.

"(CNN) -- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford now has a new fight on his hands: a tumor. The president of Humber River Hospital announced Wednesday that the embattled mayor -- just over two months removed from treatment for substance abuse -- has been admitted to the hospital, where doctors will try to get ""a definitive diagnosis."" ""It is being investigated further and we need to determine exactly what type of tumor it is, and then we can decide on what type of treatment is required,"" said Dr. Rueben Devlin, the Toronto hospital's president. According to Devlin, Ford has been ""complaining of abdominal pains"" for over three months that got worse over the last 24 hours. That prompted the mayor to go the hospital, where a CT scan revealed the tumor in his abdomen. It's not known yet if the tumor is malignant, according to Devlin. Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and a Toronto city councilor, asked reporters ""just to give our family a day or so"" as they learn more about the situation and determine what to do next -- including deciding whether or not Rob Ford will continue his campaign for re-election. ""Rob is in good spirits, and I just want to thank the well-wishers for all the calls that are coming in,"" Doug Ford said. The health ailment adds to the list of struggles facing Ford, whose fall from grace began in May 2013 with the release of a cell phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. The Toronto city council largely stripped him of his mayoral powers months later over those and other allegations of bad behavior. Ford didn't back down, though, instead vowing ""outright war"" on the city council. The mayor apologized for ""a lot of stupid things,"" including having used crack cocaine, but he refused to resign or enter rehab. In fact, despite all the criticism and his becoming a punchline for jokes in Canada as well as the United States, Ford launched a bid for re-election. Yet this past spring, after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine, Ford relented on one front: by going into rehab. He returned to work in late June, after a two-month rehab stint, saying he was ""ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated"" by some of his past actions. But even then, he refused to resign or refrain from campaigning, saying to the voters of Toronto, ""I look forward to serving you for many, many more years.""

"(CNN) -- He had a 20-gauge pump shotgun, which police say he personally sawed off. He had three shells. And he had a plan. The 12-year-old had all these when he entered a Roswell, New Mexico, middle school gymnasium and opened fire, State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said Wednesday. His first shot, which Kassetas characterized as ""birdshot,"" hit the ceiling. The second went into the gym floor. The third sped toward the stands where, some 12 to 15 feet away, it hit two of a throng of students who had been waiting for classes to start. ""The victims were random,"" the state police chief said. Having carried out three search warrants and conducted at least 60 ""primary interviews,"" Kassetas laid out these and other details related to Tuesday morning's shooting at Berrendo Middle School. But he didn't disclose everything, including the preteen shooter's possible motive. ""We did find evidence that the suspect had planned this event,"" Kassetas said. ""I can't discuss the particulars as to why."" It's a question that many in Roswell, an eastern New Mexico city of just under 50,000 people, continue to ask themselves. That, and what do they do now. The suspect's parents, Jim and Jennifer Campbell, and grandparents, Robert and Nancy Bowles, issued a statement Wednesday saying they are ""praying that God will be with everyone who has been affected."" The family singled out the two hospitalized victims, in particular. They didn't try to explain the shooter's actions, which left ""his whole family ... heart broken,"" though they didn't ignore his impact. ""For all of the anguish that many suffered yesterday,"" his parents and grandparents said, ""our family offers our heartfelt condolences and remorse in words that we cannot fully express."" The preteen faces three counts of aggravated battery, according to New Mexico state juvenile court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KOAT. 1 student's condition critical, another is stable . Berrendo Middle was closed Wednesday, but it will reopen Thursday. When it does, its teachers will all become counselors, charged with helping their students deal with this tragedy even if they are scarred themselves. School district Superintendent Tom Burris said he told those teachers: ""It's a face of courage, it's a face of love, and it's a face of positive that you have to put on for every one of our kids. ... You are the leader that is going to lead these kids back (from) where they've been in the last two days."" Two students will not be among them. They include 13-year-old Kendal Sanders, who Gov. Susana Martinez said suffered injuries to her right shoulder in the shooting. Her family got good news Tuesday night when doctors at University Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas -- about 175 miles east of the school -- upgraded her to stable condition. Kendal is likely to remain hospitalized for a week or more, the governor said. The other victim, who is 12 and whom officials aren't naming because of a request from his family, suffered injuries to the side of his face and neck, Martinez said. This boy has undergone at least two surgeries since the incident. ""He is in worse condition than Kendal,"" the governor said Wednesday afternoon, ""and is still listed in critical condition."" As they recover in the west Texas hospital, Martinez urged people to keep praying for them and others affected by the violence. ""We want to be able to welcome them home,"" the governor said. ""We don't want ... the extreme tragedy of losing either one of them."" Police: Suspect took parents' gun . Another student, of course, who will be missing is the suspect. He is being held at an unspecified location in Albuquerque and has met with his parents, Kassetas said. In their statement, the parents indicated a judge ""ordered ... our son receive an evaluation and mental health treatment and sincerely want him to receive all of the help that he needs."" ""As a family we will cooperate in all ways with law enforcement to piece together how this awful tragedy occurred,"" they said, voicing confidence in law enforcement, the local district attorney and the judicial system. Kassetas did say the shotgun came from the suspect's home. His father bought the gun -- the only one of several weapons in the house not locked up in a safe -- some time ago at Walmart, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. Authorities believe the 12-year-old ""modified the weapon by cutting off the stock,"" Kassetas said. Three search warrants have been executed in connection with the investigation: on the suspect's locker, his duffel bag and his Roswell home. While the state police chief didn't elaborate, the law enforcement source said the suspect kept a handwritten journal at home describing ""what he was planning, what he wanted to do."" But just before he fired, authorities believe the suspect gave ""preliminary warnings ... to some select students who he ran into before he entered the gymnasium,"" Kassetas said. 'Hero' teacher . Teacher John Masterson didn't know the shooter had used up all his ammunition when he walked to the student and persuaded him to put the gun down, Martinez said. ""Mr. Masterson ... was a hero ... who stood there and allowed a gun to be pointed right at him,"" the governor said at a vigil Tuesday evening, ""and to talk down that young boy to drop the gun so that there would be no more young kids hurt."" The Berrendo staff directory lists John Masterson as an eighth-grade social studies teacher. Masterson has taught at the school for a decade, and also coaches track and soccer, according to the Albuquerque Journal. When contacted by the newspaper, he said police told him not to discuss details of the shooting. ""It was a harrowing experience,"" he told the paper. ""All I can say was the staff there did a great job."" Teachers train to face school shooter . 'These are our kids' The attack understandably has rattled residents of Roswell, a city about 200 miles southeast of Albuquerque. It becomes the latest community in the United States -- joining places like Littleton, Colorado, and Paducah, Kentucky, and Newtown, Connecticut -- to go from a relatively peaceful enclave to a site of a horrific school shooting. Burris, the Roswell superintendent, said he and other school officials have received tremendous support, including offers from one unspecified Colorado school that ""has been involved in things like this."" He said members of the New Mexico community are rallying around each other, with a focus on not just the two injured students but also the shooter. ""These are our kids,"" Burris said. ""They don't stop being our kids because they are injured or they are incarcerated."" For now, officials acknowledge that students are far from over the hump. Martinez recalled talking to one middle schooler who was in the gym that morning, who told her, ""I'm trying to shove it down, I'm trying to push it down."" Monique Salcido, 13, said she is ""in shock."" She was in the gym, and she saw two of her friends get hit. She told CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night that she doesn't want to go back. Said Monique: ""I don't want to go to Berrendo again because I'm afraid it's going to happen again.""

"(CNN) -- Two men charged with murder and another being held on armed robbery charges escaped early Saturday from a rural Alabama county jail, a local sheriff said. The three were locked down together in a single cell around 2 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) when one started screaming, saying another of them was very sick, Choctaw County Sheriff Tom Abate said. The jailer looked through a porthole, saw someone vomiting, then opened the cell door. When he did, the inmates jumped the jailer, stole his keys and cell phone, then fled on foot, according to Abate. Local authorities using tracking dogs tracked the escaped inmates about one-quarter mile away down State Highway 17 in Butler, Alabama, where Abate said they were either picked up or had a vehicle waiting for them. The two escapees who were being held on capital murder charges, for separate incidents, are 23-year-old Demarcus Woodward for allegedly fatally shooting a work release inmate and 32-year-old Gemayel Culbert for his involvement in the killing of two people at a private club in northern Choctaw County. The other escapee is Terrell Gordon, 23, who is charged with armed robbery in connection with a convenience store theft. Alabama's state Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Marshals from Mobile and local authorities all have roles in the manhunt. The jailer who these inmates allegedly choked was treated and released at an area hospital, Abate said Saturday morning. Choctaw County, with population of fewer than 14,000, is in southwestern Alabama, bordering Mississippi.

"Gaza (CNN) -- Nafoz Mohammed is living in a cramped two-room apartment with 16 other people, including several children, who spend the day- and nighttime hours holed up in fear. ""All the children feel so scared when they cut the electricity,"" said Mohammed, who shares the tight space with others whose homes were hit by artillery. ""They just keep holding their mothers."" For the more than 1.8 million people squeezed into a territory about twice the size of Washington, chaos has always infringed on the daily rhythms of life. But the latest conflict with neighboring Israel has compounded the misery of many. Since Tuesday, residents have been without electricity. Without television. Without refrigeration. Without water pumps and sewage systems. For the fortunate few who can afford them, buzzing generators provide some relief. At the main hospital, already stretched by weeks of fighting that left more than 1,500 people dead and thousands wounded, a pair of mega-generators powered crucial life-support equipment. Days after Gaza's only power plant was hit, the latest attempt at a cease-fire fell apart Friday after Israel said that one of its soldiers was captured by Palestinian militants. Gaza residents were left with the anxiety of an uncertain future. 'Killing civilian life in Gaza' As has happened with so many aspects of the conflict, the principals blamed each for the power plant's demise. Palestinian officials pointed at an Israeli airstrike. Israel insisted that the power plant was not a target. By early Tuesday, at least 40% of Gaza's fuel had been burned, according to Fathi al-Sheikh Khalil, deputy chairman of the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority in Gaza. The plant, which will have to be rebuilt, will not operate as it did for at least a year. ""This is a disaster,"" he said. He said a 300,000-liter fuel tank -- which supplied about a day of electricity in Gaza -- was hit and burst into flames. Heavy shelling delayed firefighters from responding, allowing the fire to spread to other fuel tanks. ""We cannot supply electricity to hospitals or water pumps or sewage treatment or for domestic use,"" Khalil said. ""People have to pump the water to the residential tanks but don't have electricity."" Jamal Derdsawoi, a representative of Gaza's electric company, also pointed at Israel. ""By attacking the power plant and cutting the electricity, they're killing the civilian life in Gaza,"" he said. An Israeli military spokeswoman said after checking with ground, air and naval forces in the area of the power plant that there was ""no indication that (Israel Defense Forces) were involved in the strike. ... The area surrounding the plant was also not struck in recent days."" Plant workers said the facility took fire for three days before Tuesday's strike. On Sunday, they said, the plant's administration building took a direct hit. The United Nations has said that a deliberate strike on the plant would be a violation of humanitarian law. Before the fighting, most of Gaza's power actually came from Israel, but transmission lines on both sides of the border have been damaged by either Israeli missiles or Hamas rockets. Repairs on the lines could take a week, but no agreement has been reached on when that work can begin. Last month, one Israeli politician called on the government to permanently cut electricity to Gaza, especially since the Palestinians owe tens of millions of dollars in electric bills. Darkness and isolation of war . Many Gaza residents have seen their neighborhoods hit hard and loved ones killed or wounded since Israel began Operation Protective Edge against Hamas on July 8. About a quarter of a million people in the small, impoverished territory have been displaced by the conflict, according to the United Nations. That's about 14% of Gaza's population of 1.8 million. Those killed include 327 children and 166 women, the Gaza health ministry reports. UNICEF said that about two-thirds of the children killed were 12 or younger. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% of the more than 1,500 Palestinians killed have been civilians. More than 150 were members of armed groups, the U.N. said. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths, saying militants encourage people to stay in their homes despite Israeli warnings that strikes are coming. Militants also use civilian facilities such as houses, schools, mosques and hospitals to launch attacks on Israeli civilians and store weapons. Three civilians have been killed in Israel since the conflict began, while many more have been forced to take shelter as rockets rained overhead. Sixty-one Israeli soldiers have been killed during the hostilities, with five of those deaths occurring Thursday evening. Yasmeen El Khoudary, a 24-year-old woman who lives in Gaza City, said she's had no power for two days. She has not left her house in a week. There is enough food available to residents, El Khoudary said, but safety was a bigger concern. ""We only eat when we remember to eat,"" she said. She added, ""We have seen that the bombings are not precise."" Her Internet service was restored Thursday, El Khoudary said. In the darkness and isolation of war, she blogs about life. ""My thoughts are interrupted by an Israeli bombing that shakes our two story house like a rattle in the hand of a little baby,"" she wrote. ""To my surprise, my brother is still awake.

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she's not seeking the White House. ""I'm not running for president and I plan to serve out my term,"" Warren, who's up for reelection in 2018, said in December. But she sure is acting like a potential 2016 contender. She's traveling around the country, introducing herself to voters, testing her message -- the sort of thing that candidates do. That's what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is doing on her book tour. Sen. Rand Paul is on his ideas tour and Gov. Chris Christie is raising money for Republican governors. And like Clinton, Warren now has an organized group supporting her and encouraging her to run. Ready for Warren also has a petition as well as a Facebook campaign and a Twitter feed to rally support. While Warren, a first-term senator and champion of the left, is becoming acquainted with a wider swath of Democratic voters, Republicans are taking notice, being proactive and preparing for a potential candidacy. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said her organization has started to ""build a narrative on her"" in order to define her to voters before she can do that herself. ""She appears to be seriously looking at a 2016 White House run and we're going to treat her as a contender,"" Kukowski said. Warren's schedule has ramped up as the campaign season has. She has raised $2.6 million for Senate and gubernatorial candidates this cycle, according to her office. Since March, the former Harvard law professor has campaigned in Ohio, Oregon, and Minnesota for liberal colleagues who fall mostly in line with her ideology of increasing the minimum wage, decreasing the student loan burden, reforming mortgages and attacking Wall Street. Going where few liberals will go . Warren catapulted onto the national scene during the financial crisis as a consumer advocate. Republican opposition kept her from running the agency created around her cause, the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau. But her popularity among the left helped her win the Massachusetts Senate seat in 2012. But Warren has also gone where many liberals won't -- to the most conservative states in the country. She campaigned for Senate Democratic candidates Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky and Natalie Tennant in West Virginia. Elizabeth Warren bashes Wall Street in West Virginia . ""Natalie Tennant and I do not agree on everything,"" Warren said Monday at a rally for Tennant in West Virginia. ""But on the core issues, on the issues that are about our values, on the issues that define us as human beings, Natalie and I agree. Our job is to fight for the families of America. That is our job."" Republicans, meanwhile, were quick to attack her and her message. The RNC called Warren's visit to West Virginia ""one of the more bizarre campaign moves of 2014"" because Warren's ""far left agenda"" won't sit well with West Virginians. In the Warren playbook, it's not so bizarre. In the red states of West Virginia and Kentucky, which voted for President Barack Obama 36% and 38%, respectively, and where the candidates are running away from the President, the arguably more liberal Warren received an exceptional reception. A ""long line"" waited to see her in Kentucky and a crowd of nearly 400 enthusiastically welcomed her in West Virginia. 'She represents and speaks for so many in our party' Democratic strategist Donna Brazile called Warren ""a perfect surrogate"" this campaign season for areas in which Obama is too divisive to enter. ""Warren has captured not only the spirit of the Democrats this political cycle but she represents and speaks for so many in our party,"" Brazile said. Warren's name comes up even when she's not in the room. At the Texas Democratic Party's convention in June, Rep. Joaquin Castro told the crowd that he wishes Texas could ""trade Ted Cruz to Massachusetts for Elizabeth Warren."" As Warren's reception has been strong, she has modified her response since her emphatic December statement that she is not running for president. In an interview with Huff Post Live in June, Warren dodged answering the question, instead saying, ""This is a moment in time for our country and, I believe, for our world, a moment in time where we decide who we are as a people and what kind of a future we're going to build."" In the latest national polling, Warren trails far behind fellow potential contender Hillary Clinton. But with 11% support among Democrats, according to a July Quinnipiac Poll, she is in second place. Republicans think she's ambitious. ""Contrary to saying it publicly, she appears to be aiming for higher office,"" Republican strategist Brian Walsh said. Tim Miller, the executive director of American Rising, which gathers opposition research against Democratic candidates, said Warren's aggressive campaigning has gotten his group engaged. ""If Warren does decide to start leaning forward, we're certainly going to be prepared to combat that,"" Miller said. Already, the GOP have attacked her not only for campaigning in conservatives states but also independently as well. For instance, in an effort to highlight government spending, the group said Warren's ""brainchild,"" the Consumer Federal Protection Bureau, which was created during the financial crisis to protect consumers' financial interests, cost more to build than Trump Towers. 'Headed to more friendly territory' But as she is finding a receptive audience wherever she goes, Warren's campaigning is not going to let up. From the conservative confines of West Virginia, her next stop is in more comfortable territory. She heads to Michigan at the end of this week to raise money and campaign with Senate candidate Gary Peters and will also be the star of the liberal grassroots conference Netroots Nation. Walsh said her strategy to go into conservative states where she might receive a bold reception from some in the Democratic base, the more moderate or conservative voters will be turned off. While he questioned her strategy, calling it ""odd,"" Walsh tried to stir the pot among Democrats. ""If you're Hillary Clinton's people, you're looking at how sincere her words were"" that she's not running for President. Elizabeth Warren: What happened to the middle class?

"(CNN) -- Think kids today are spoiled? That they only care about themselves? CNN Hero Yash Gupta says that's far from the truth. ""I think there's a misconception with our generation,"" said Gupta, 17. ""Many of my friends are doing things to improve their communities. ""Kids are passionate and can make a difference. It's just a matter of finding out what you care about and focusing on that."" For Gupta, it's helping children see clearer. Since 2011, he has given out more than 9,500 pairs of donated eyeglasses through his nonprofit, Sight Learning. But he's not the only young person who was honored this year as a CNN Hero. Two others, 24-year-old Blair Brettschneider and 15-year-old Nicholas Lowinger, have also come up with ideas to improve the lives of others. Here's how that trio is changing the world: . Blair Brettschneider . Blair Brettschneider has made it her mission to help young female refugees adjust to life in the United States. Her nonprofit, GirlForward, provides mentoring, tutoring, life skills and social support to nearly 50 young women in Chicago. ""Mostly, they are just normal teenage girls. We talk about celebrities and movies and books,"" Brettschneider said. ""But then at the same time, a lot of them have lost parents who've been killed. They've seen bombs in their city. They've lost people to disease and grown up in really dire conditions."" When they arrive in America, often from war-torn places such as Iraq, Ivory Coast and Myanmar, they face major challenges in building their new lives. ""It's hard enough to be a teenage girl in the United States. ... It's even harder to be a refugee teenage girl,"" Brettschneider said. ""Girls are, along with the rest of their family, learning the language, adjusting to a new culture, trying to get used to school. At the same time, they are usually in charge of taking care of their siblings or grandparents. They have to translate all the mail that comes, any bills, help go to doctors' appointments."" GirlForward mentors these young refugees to help them adapt to their new surroundings, and it teaches them the skills they need to become successful, independent young women and productive members of society. Read the full story . Yash Gupta . When Yash Gupta broke his glasses, he realized how hard it was to learn without them. Then he started thinking about the millions of children who cannot afford corrective eyewear. So at just 14, Gupta started Sight Learning, an organization that collects used eyeglasses from optometrists and donates them to organizations that can deliver them to children in need. Since 2011, Gupta has donated more than 9,500 pairs of glasses, worth nearly $500,000, to young people in Haiti, Honduras, India and Mexico. ""That dazed look the first time (children) get glasses, and just seeing that turn into joy and happiness ... it's just really inspiring,"" he said. Gupta knows that the glasses he's providing can make a big impact. ""A lot of times, these families are in poverty,"" he said. ""With a good education, you know, they can get a good job and get a good career."" Read the full story . Nicholas Lowinger . When he was 5, Nicholas Lowinger visited a homeless shelter and was shocked to find out that some of the children there did not own a pair of shoes. A few years later, he started a nonprofit, the Gotta Have Sole Foundation, that has provided new shoes to more than 10,000 homeless children since 2010. ""I've been very fortunate to grow up in a family that is able to provide me with whatever I need,"" Lowinger said. ""A lot of kids here in the U.S. don't have the same opportunities."" There were 1.6 million homeless children across the United States in 2010, according to a report from the National Center on Family Homelessness. With no permanent place to live, many stay on the streets or in shelters, motels, cars and abandoned buildings. ""Homeless children, they shouldn't have to worry about how they'll be accepted or how they'll fit in,"" Nicholas said. ""They shouldn't have to worry about not being able to play sports or go to school because they don't have a pair of shoes."" Read the full story .

Jon Burns is rallying fellow soccer fans to help children from poor communities in cities hosting the World Cup and other major tournaments. Since 2006, his nonprofit, Lionsraw, has engaged more than 500 volunteers in construction projects and educational programs that have benefitted nearly 6,000 children. ""We're trying to harness the passion of football fans to make a difference,"" he said. Pen Farthing . Pen Farthing, a former Royal Marine Sergeant, is reuniting soldiers with the stray dogs they befriend while serving in Afghanistan. His nonprofit, Nowzad Dogs -- named for the stray Farthing rescued during his tour -- has helped more than 700 soldiers from eight countries. ""My connection with Afghanistan stayed alive because of Nowzad,"" Farthing said. ""To be able to get that animal home to them, it closes the loop."" Rabbi Elimelech Goldberg . Rabbi Elimelech Goldberg lost his 2-year-old daughter to leukemia in 1981. Today, his nonprofit, Kids Kicking Cancer, uses martial arts to help children battling serious illnesses manage pain during medical treatments. The group has provided free lessons and support for 5,000 children and their families. ""They're often so afraid,"" Goldberg said. ""We teach kids how to control their pain and make them feel powerful."" Leela Hazzah . Leela Hazzah has dedicated her life to lion conservation. In 2007, she started Lion Guardians, a nonprofit that works with African Maasai warriors to protect lions.

"(CNN) -- In the movies, it's a familiar storyline: superheroes joining forces to tackle a world crisis. But CNN Heroes can do it, too. Marie Da Silva, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow and Evans Wadongo are working together to help AIDS orphans in the African nation of Malawi. In 2002, Da Silva started the Jacaranda School in Malawi, where half a million children have been orphaned by AIDS. For her efforts, she was honored as a top 10 CNN Hero in 2008. Today, there are 400 children in the school, and they're also benefiting from the help of two top 10 Heroes from 2010: Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, whose organization, Mary's Meals, feeds more than 600,000 schoolchildren around the globe; and Evans Wadongo, who has brought more than 23,000 free solar lanterns to rural African communities through his nonprofit, Sustainable Development For All. CNN recently spoke with Da Silva about the team-up and how it's helping the children. CNN: How did you connect with Magnus? Marie Da Silva: I went to the CNN Heroes tribute show in 2010, and I saw Magnus because he was one of the top 10 CNN Heroes. In his speech, he mentioned ... how he was feeding over 300,000 children in Malawi. And it touched me. So, after he got his award, I had to go and see him and say thank you. But there was something else that was happening at our school at that same time. For all the years that I had the school, I was buying the porridge for the children, costing me something like $500 a month. Then, for a time, we were given porridge by (another organization) ... but we had had a drought in Malawi, so I was panicking. I went up to Magnus and ... I told him what was going on at the school. I felt a little embarrassed, but I just asked him to consider us. Now, he's feeding all 400 of our students a day. Some of these children do go without food at home, and most of them come without breakfast to school. This porridge has all the nutrients needed and is made of soya, too -- one of the healthiest meals our orphans can have each day. We have many students who are HIV-positive, so Mary's Meals is saving lives by keeping our children healthy. CNN: How has Magnus' support enabled you to do more for your students? Da Silva: The high school students who stayed in school through the afternoon ... they were weak, most sleeping in class. (Mary's Meals) agreed to provide an additional meal of porridge for (them) at noon. This has resulted in a lot more attendance at the school and students studying with energy. One of our college graduates is now working for Mary's Meals as a field monitor. We are so proud. ... This is what we want: to see them graduate and get quality jobs. Mary's Meals built a new stove for us that uses less firewood and cooks our porridge even faster. ... Now, the most firewood we will use is about seven pieces, down from 40 pieces. So we've actually saved our costs. And the most important thing is, we're saving the environment. Magnus, he's really a saint to me. His support means a lot to us. Every day, the children will always have something to eat, so we are thankful. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . CNN: How did you come to work with Evans Wadongo? Da Silva: I first heard about Evans through CNN Heroes. I met him through a friend of mine, Lane Hill, who thought Evans should come to teach our kids to build the (solar lanterns). Then Robert Burke, a math teacher at the Shanghai American School in China -- one of our biggest supporters -- was looking for another project for his students to become involved in. ... Since seeing my story on TV, they've visited us and donated money to build our first toilets with running water, a clinic and a physics and science lab. ... So, (he) raised money to bring this project to life. Today, I'm happy to tell you that we have over 200 lamps made by the kids themselves with the help of Evans and his team, and we distributed the lamps to the kids who are taking their examinations. For the family, (this) cuts the costs. And for the children, it's helping them to study. And during this examination time ... I'm sure we're going to see better results, so we're very thankful to Evans. CNN: How did your students respond to him? Da Silva: Evans brought a lot more than just those lamps to our students. ... He's a young African guy, and they're young African students, so ... he's motivated our kids to be inventors. They've come up with their own little models that work just like Evans' lamps. ... He really gave them confidence that they, too, can make something that can help people and change people's lives. This summer, the kids will be making their own designs and (giving) a lamp and a book out in the villages and to schools. This will be our first outreach program ... teaching our kids to give back. CNN: Are you surprised that two of your fellow honorees have been able to help you? Da Silva: CNN Heroes coming together to work together is something that I don't see as that unusual. All of us (are) doing something that is helping others, so when we hear each other's stories, we just want to see if we can help. It's a family, you know? You want to help your family. I love it, and it makes a huge difference.","Three CNN Heroes are working together to help AIDS orphans in Malawi .

"Washington (CNN) -- Amid anger and frustration on both sides of the aisle, the Senate is set to take up a bill to help people with disabilities, displaying some rare bipartisanship before the 113th Congress is adjourned. Eight years after the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act was first introduced by Republican Rep. Anders Crenshaw of Florida, these individuals will soon be able to create tax-free bank accounts to amass assets in their own name, something current law strongly discourages. ""What we're doing is really helping them help themselves,"" Anders said in a press conference Thursday. ""We will open the door to a brighter future to so many people -- so many people in America that live everyday with disabilities."" Congressmen from both side of the aisle touted its passage, saying that this gives the targeted people economic freedom to save and live independently if desired. Families and friends will now be able to give money to their loved ones without fear of it being purged by service agencies that may help them with their daily lives. ""We believe that individuals across this country with disabilities have a lot of ability,"" said Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who is shepherding the bill in the upper chamber. ""And we believe that we have an obligation to do everything we can to give them tools that they need to live a full life."" The idea stemmed from Stephen Beck of Pennsylvania, whose daughter, Natalie, was born with Down syndrome. He lobbied Anders and many other members of Congress to take up his cause for most of the last decade. ""We decided that we would name this legislation after him, to honor him and all of the people that worked so hard all these years to make this dream a reality,"" Anders said. When the House took up the bill last Wednesday, it had 380 members signed on as co-sponsors. The bill passed with 404 votes. Beck, who reportedly cheered quite loudly after the vote from the gallery of the House. Beck died suddenly just this week of a heart attack . Anders took to the floor again afterwards to rename the bill as The Stephen Beck, Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014, which passed unanimously. For many members of Congress though, this is not just an intangible idea to legislate. It's very personal. Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers of Washington's son, Cole, was diagnosed with Down syndrome just three days after he was born. While going over the list of potential medical complications to be aware of, she was also given the financial advice many other parents are given after this diagnosis -- don't save money in Cole's name. ""I was like, hmm, seems like that's sending the wrong message to a new parent who is excited, ready to save, ready to sacrifice, so this child can have an opportunity for a better life,"" she told CNN's Dana Bash. ""We incentivize savings for retirement, for health care, for education -- it only makes sense that those children with disabilities would also have that same opportunity."" Cole joined the congresswoman on the House floor during its passage. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobachar's daughter spurred into action while her daughter was fed through a feeding tube for almost all of the first two years of her life. ""I was able to see life through the eyes of a parent with a child with a disability, even though she didn't end up having one,"" she said reflecting on her time living with this and her subsequent involvement in the disabilities community. ""You can see the struggles they go through every single day... I think every member of Congress knows someone that has been through something like this."" Alex Sessions, the Eagle Scout son of Republican Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, is a young adult with Down syndrome and is learning how to contribute on his own. When his father told him the bill passed, he smiled and said his favorite word. ""'Can.' His 'can.' And 'thank you',"" the congressman emotionally recalled. ""He will recognize the real difference because he wants to live independent."" ""To a disabled person, this is like what might be the glass ceiling -- where they have been looking at opportunities not to be excluded, and not to be treated differently, but to be treated just like everybody else,"" he said. ""To have a 529 savings account. To have, as in Alex's case, where his grandfather, if he wrote a check to all the grandkids but excluded Alex, for fear of losing what might be a government benefit at some point."" As the bill heads to the Senate and possibly the White House, advocates on both sides of the aisle hope this trend will continue. ""There are still people of good will that want to work together to get things done,"" Klobuchar said. ""I just think it's a great example, with the holidays coming upon us, of a spirit that I hope to see carried on into the New Year,"" McMorris-Rodgers added.","Legislation regarding people with disabilities has bipartisan backing in both chambers .
It allows people with disabilities to creat tax-free bank accounts .

"(CNN) -- It's just a few minutes after the final whistle has blown and the shiny basketball court of the Al Gharafa Sports Hall in Doha is filled with shouts and cheers. The sky blue-clad national women's basketball team from war-ravaged Somalia has just beaten Qatar, the host nation, at the 2011 Arab Games, in a hotly-contested match that ended 67-57 to the East African country. ""Words can't describe how I felt,"" says Canadian-born Somali team member Khatra Mahdi about last week's triumph. ""We were all jumping up and down, there were tears in the girls' eyes -- history was made right there,"" she adds. The victory marked a remarkable feat for the Somali players as it came against a backdrop fraught with difficulties and danger. Notwithstanding Somalia's prolonged civil war and shattered sports infrastructure, the team says it had to prepare for the Games in the bullet-ridden police headquarters in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. There, the women would train for two to three hours a day under the watchful eye of security officers, tasked to safeguard them against religious militants targeting women playing the sport. Fertile territory for Al Shabaab in chaos of Somalia . ""We try to protect them outside and inside,"" says Said Duale, the secretary general of the Somali Basketball Federation, adding that the safety of the women is ""taken very seriously."" In recent years, many Somali athletes have been threatened by members of the militant Islamist group Al Shabaab who see sport as an ""un-Islamic"" activity, according to Duran Ahmed Farah, the Somali National Olympic Committee (NOC) senior vice president for international relations. In summer 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), which then controlled Mogadishu, labelled sport as a ""satanic act"" and issued an order prohibiting women from playing sport, including basketball. A few months later, the ICU was deposed but Al Shabaab, which has connections to al Qaeda, is still fighting to impose its own interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, on the country. ""The threat is always there -- there are people who will see girls playing sport as a devil's thing and they will not allow it,"" Farah says. Women have been stoned to death for adultery; amputations and beheadings are common while in some areas Al Shabaab has banned listening to the radio. Inside Kenya's war with Al Shabaab . ""These girls are brave: in that kind of environment they're still playing their sport, the sport they like,"" says Farah. Basketball is one of the most popular sports amongst women in Somalia. Duale says that the country's first national female basketball team was created in the early 1970s but hadn't performed at an international tournament since 1987. The Islamist ban, coupled with the challenges presented by the lack of sponsorship and destroyed facilities, have all hindered the development of the sport in recent years. Yet, despite the threats and all the setbacks, Somalia's national women's basketball team concluded its participation at the Games on Monday with the very respectable tally of three losses and two victories -- Kuwait also lost to Somalia. Like some other teams representing Muslim countries, the national team plays in relatively modest uniforms: track pants and shirts with elbow-length sleeves; players also wear scarves that cover their hair. Coach Mohamed Sheekh put together an ambitious team comprised of women based in Somalia and the diaspora -- the United States, Canada, UK and Germany. Many of the players hadn't even seen their teammates before, let alone played a basketball game with them. ""I'm very happy and proud of them,"" says Sheekh of his players. ""They were excellent and everyone was talking about them."" NOC president Aden Hagi Yeberow says the team's success in Doha can act as a unifying factor in a country that's been plagued by insecurity, political instability, lack of unity and scarcity of resources. ""We want to use sport as a peace-building tool to bring the Somali people together,"" he says. ""What these young girls are doing in this tournament has laid the foundations, hopefully, of a good future of our people. ""We would like to capitalize on this and also to move forward and, hopefully, this will be the beginning and the start of the unity of our people.""","Somalia's national women's basketball team played at this year's Arab Games in Qatar .

"(CNN) -- Robin Williams was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease when he died this week, his wife says. Williams was found dead in his Northern California home Monday after what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging. What is Parkinson's disease? Parkinson's disease is a ""progressive disorder of the nervous system,"" according to the Mayo Clinic, that primarily affects a patient's movement. It often starts with a small tremor in the hand or muscle stiffness and gets worse over time. There is no test for Parkinson's, so it is occasionally misdiagnosed. Parkinson's patients often have trouble walking and talking. Symptoms include slowness of movement, a loss of balance and slurred speech. With Parkinson's disease, ""you may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk,"" the Mayo Clinic says. The symptoms are often worse on one side of the body. Whom does it affect? Approximately 1 million people have Parkinson's disease in the United States, according to the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. Men are more likely to get it than women, and it usually affects people over 50. What causes Parkinson's disease? Your body uses a chemical called dopamine to control movement, according to the National Institutes of Health. Dopamine is produced by neurons in the brain, which begin to die with Parkinson's disease. With fewer live cells, a dopamine deficit occurs, causing movement issues. Scientists don't know what exactly causes these cells to start to deteriorate but believe it's a combination of genes and environmental causes. About 15% to 25% of Parkinson's patients have a family member with the disease, the Parkinson's Disease Foundation says. In some cases, researchers have identified a single gene mutation that's passed from generation to generation, according to the Michael J. Fox Foundation. ""Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are the greatest genetic contributor to Parkinson's disease discovered to date,"" the site states. But in most cases, the cause is probably a combination of gene mutations. Studies have also linked chemicals like TCE and PERC to Parkinson's, though the relationship has not been proved. ""A simple exposure to an environmental toxin is never enough to cause Parkinson's,"" the Parkinson's Disease Foundation states. ""In fact, there is no conclusive evidence that any environmental factor, alone, can be considered a cause of the disease. Can you treat it? There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, according to the National Institutes of Health, but doctors can help patients cope with symptoms. A medication called levodopa is often given to patients to help their brains make more dopamine. It's often prescribed with carbidopa, which helps bring the levodopa into the brain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved deep brain stimulation, which is also used to treat depression, to reduce symptoms in Parkinson's patients. Electrodes are implanted into the brain and connected to a small device that emits programmed pulses to help control movement. Other patients prefer less invasive forms of therapy like tai chi. A recent study done at Harvard University found that patients with Parkinson's improved after researchers transplanted tissue from fetal dopamine cells into their brains. Patients with severe symptoms experienced 50% fewer symptoms in the years after surgery. People who had been taking medication to control their Parkinson's but found that the medicine no longer worked also saw significant improvements after surgery. Complete coverage on Robin Williams .

"(CNN) -- Politicians make gaffes almost daily. Some they can overcome. Some are fodder for late-night comedians. Some are deadly to their campaigns. Republican congressman Todd Akin's recent gaffe was so toxic, he may not only have killed his campaign, he may be the political equivalent of a zombie who also infects the Romney/Ryan ticket with his deadly virus. The American public is smarter than most political campaigns give us credit for. We may not be geniuses -- me included -- but we intuitively grasp when a politician has merely slipped up or when he or she has revealed something much more significant. The first type of political gaffes are just that: mistakes. For example, when then-presidential candidate Barack Obama said he had campaigned in ""57 states."" Or when Rep. Michele Bachmann suggested that the American Revolution had started in New Hampshire. These kinds of comments are generally overcome. The only time they're potentially fatal is if they occur with such frequency that they begin to define the politician. Note to Joe Biden: You are really getting close to achieving that feat. Then there are the gaffes that are not gaffes at all. These reveal the candidate's views on an issue or a character flaw that we had not previously seen. Rep. Todd Akin's notorious remark Sunday clearly falls into the second category. Akin assessing candidacy with conservatives in Florida . His statement that a woman being raped could magically shut off her reproductive system and avoid becoming pregnant was so outrageous that even Mitt Romney quickly denounced him. (Surprising, because Romney failed to condemn Rush Limbaugh's despicable comments regarding Sandra Fluke, the law student whom Limbaugh called a ""slut"" on his radio show after she appeared before Congress to discuss contraception.) Akin's statement also brought national attention to his radical position that a woman who becomes pregnant from rape should be required to carry the baby to term. Is this one statement enough to destroy Akin's Senate campaign? A quick review of the history of political missteps of this type tells us that Akin is probably ""dead candidate walking."" For example, in 1990, Texas Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams was leading his Democratic opponent, Ann Richards, by 11 points with less than three months to go before Election Day. Williams then uttered a campaign-changing wisecrack comparing bad weather and rape: ""If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.'' Thankfully, Williams lost by 2 points. Candidates have even been undone by a single word, as in the case of Mitt Romney's father, George Romney, who had been seeking the 1968 Republican nomination for president. Romney had supported the Vietnam War but then came out against it when running for president, as it had become unpopular. (This is apparently a Romney family trait.) Romney, trying to explain his new anti-war position, commented that in 1965, he had visited Southeast Asia and met with U.S. generals who ""brainwashed"" him into supporting the war. Romney's candidacy could never overcome this remark. And there was Republican Sen. George Allen's public use of the racially derogatory term ""macaca"" to describe a staff member of his opponent's campaign who was of Indian heritage. Allen had been leading in the polls at the time but went on to lose that 2006 election. Conservative Christians rally around Akin in face of GOP criticism . Some candidates have even been undone by simply showing too much emotion, causing voters to question the candidate's stability. In 1972, Sen. Edmund Muskie was a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. But his candidacy came apart when Muskie reportedly had ""tears streaming down his face"" as he emotionally defended attacks on his wife and himself by the publisher of a New Hampshire newspaper. Consequently, many were concerned that Muskie didn't posses the composure needed to serve as president. In the same vein, Howard Dean's 2004 presidential ambitions were derided when he released a flu-ridden (and blood-curdling) scream during a speech shortly after losing Iowa's Democratic caucus. But there's one big difference between Akin's gaffe and the other politically deadly ones above. Those hurt only the candidates who committed them. Akin's comments may even hurt the Romney campaign and other Republicans. Indeed, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, instructed Akin to not attend next week's Republican National Convention. However, the problem for Romney and others in the GOP is that while Akin may not be at the convention, his radical view that abortion should be banned in the U.S. with no exceptions for rape will be. This position is part of the Republican Party's national platform, adopted a few days ago and supported by Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan. As the postscript for this campaign is written after Election Day, we may find that Akin's comments mark the first time that a political gaffe not only doomed the candidate who made it, it also dragged down his party's presidential ticket. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Politicians can overcome some gaffes, but others are deadly, says Dean Obeidallah .

"(CNN) -- Former Serb international midfielder Sinisa Mihajlovic has been sacked as coach of Serie A side Fiorentina following a 1-0 defeat by Chievo on Sunday. The 42-year-old Mihajlovic, who played for Roma, Sampdoria, Lazio and Inter Milan in a sparkling playing career, has been relieved of his duties with the club lying 11th in the Italian league table. Mihajlovic had been under intense pressure this season and Sunday's defeat prompted the club's board to act, with Delio Rossi already being named as his replacement. Rossi, 51, is best known for two spells as coach of Palermo, guiding them to the Europa League on both occasions. However, Rossi fell out with controversial Palermo owner Maurizio Zamparini, who refused to renew his contract in the close season after sacking him following a 7-0 thrashing by Udinese, only to re-appoint him again a month later. As well as a distinguished playing career in Italy, Mihajlovic had also coached Serie A clubs Bologna and Catania, before being named Fiorentina coach at the start of last season in succession to Cesare Prandelli, who left to coach the Italian national side. Mihajlovic, who led Fiorentina ninth place last season, is the sixth Serie A coach to lose his job this season after Roberto Donadoni (Cagliari), Stefano Pioli (Palmero), Gian Piero Gasperini (Inter Milan), Pierpaolo Bisoli (Bologna) and Marco Giampaolo (Cesena).","Sinisa Mihajlovic has been sacked as coach of Italian Serie A side Fiorentina .

"(CNN) -- Evans Wadongo, 23, invented a way for rural families in Kenya to replace smoky kerosene and firelight with solar power. Through his Use Solar, Save Lives program, he has distributed an estimated 10,000 solar lanterns for free. Wadongo's work earned him a spot as one of CNN's Top 10 Heroes for 2010. Below are his thoughts on being selected for this honor. Q: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? Evans Wadongo: I was sitting watching a comedy show on a local TV station here in Nairobi when I got the call from CNN. At first, I thought they were just calling to ask questions. Then I was told I was in the Top 10. Wow! I am so, so excited. I wish to thank the Blue Ribbon Panel for choosing me. I really feel humbled, considering all the amazing work being done by all of the CNN Heroes highlighted this year. Q: What will this exposure -- and the $25,000 award you'll receive for being a Top 10 CNN Hero -- mean to your work? Wadongo: I do hope that being in the Top 10 will create even more publicity about the work that we are doing to help poor communities. We really hope to get support from individuals -- and more so from corporate companies and other nonprofits -- to reach our target of lifting 100,000 households out of poverty by 2015, by giving them lamps and helping them to set up economic ventures. We want to set up a modern workshop, with modern equipment that will include a plastic recycling plant, all for making the lamps. We need support to do this. Q: What do you want people to know most about the importance of your work? Wadongo: Just seeing livelihoods change, especially from the small economic ventures that are being set up [with] the money initially spent on kerosene ... it's the best thing we can ever do for these communities. I can talk and talk forever, I am just so excited now.

"(CNN) -- Sadly there is nothing new about the atrocities being inflicted against civilians in the Central African Republic. What is new is the scale of the violence and widespread and arbitrary targeting of people solely because of their religion. Christian militia loyal to former President Francois Bozize began an offensive last week against the capital, Bangui. The militia attacked mosques, daubing walls with the slogan ""Tuer les musulmans"" (Kill the Muslims) in what Amnesty International describes as ""a shocking escalation of anti-Muslim rhetoric within the Christian community."" In turn, largely Muslim militia known as the Seleka have killed Christians in their homes and attacked hospitals and churches. Tens of thousands of Christians have taken refuge in churches and Roman Catholic missions around the country. Some are taking shelter in hangars at the Bangui airport. One missionary in Bangui told a Roman Catholic charity: ""We have never seen anything as bad as this before. We're at the mercy of God, please pray for us."" French troops are trying to disarm rival groups of vigilantes before a Rwanda-style genocide can take hold. But the Central African Republic is the size of France, and there are fewer than 2,000 of these troops currently deployed -- along with some 2,500 African peacekeepers. The French intervention has reduced the violence in Bangui, but the long-term danger is that sectarian brutality will perpetuate communal hatred. Some analysts and U.N. officials also fear the situation may fuel a regional confrontation between Christians and Muslims -- one that has already devastated northern Nigeria and is percolating in neighboring Cameroon. According to a senior U.N. official, the militant Islamist group Boko Haram -- which has instigated much of the anti-Christian violence in Nigeria -- already has a presence in the Central African Republic, where the lack of government authority, porous borders and a ready supply of weapons provide the perfect incubator for such groups. In most provinces, there is no police or judicial system. The rise of the Seleka militia . Muslims make up 15% of the country's population and live mainly in the sparsely populated northeast. The Seleka, the loose alliance of Muslim militia, emerged a year ago in response to the neglect of the region as well as human rights abuses -- including rampant torture of prisoners -- by Bozize's government. The Seleka began advancing south this year, burning and looting as it went and seizing Bangui in March. One leader, Michel Djotodia, proclaimed himself president, the first head of state from the marginalized northeast. The Seleka was later officially disbanded, but as many as 15,000 kept their arms and instead continued to wreak havoc in Bangui and elsewhere. They mainly targeted Christian communities, which in turn mobilized self-defense units known as anti-Balaka (literally ""anti-machete."") In September, Human Rights Watch reported that ""with no checks on (its) power, the Seleka rule (operated) arbitrarily and with complete impunity, with the government failing to follow through on its public commitment to bring to justice those responsible for recent abuses."" Rape, summary executions, the theft of food and burning of homes were common. The rights group said some of the Seleka fighters were as young as 13. A report by a U.N. mission to the Security Council in October estimated 3,500 children were among the ex-Seleka fighters and found ""an alarming increase in inter-communal violence ... (which) threatens to degenerate into a country-wide religious and ethnic divide."" Complicating the picture, many of the Seleka are from outside the Central African Republic -- from neighboring Chad and Sudan. Some of the Sudanese were allegedly members of the militant Muslim Janjaweed militia, which killed thousands during the conflict in Darfur in western Sudan. Victims of Seleka attacks told Human Rights Watch that their assailants often spoke Arabic. Others in the Seleka had no ideology or political agenda: They just wanted power and wealth. The Central African Republic's northeast is rich in diamonds. Like the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country has long suffered from the attention of outsiders wanting a slice of its natural resources: diamonds, gold, timber and ivory among them. It has borders with six countries and in its 53 years as an independent state has rarely seen political stability or economic growth. A bewildering array of rebel factions, based on ethnic and tribal affiliation or simply to serve a warlord's ambitions, has risen and fallen. Sectarian killing may overlap with other problems . Some analysts believe the fighting in the Central African Republic is not about Islam and Christianity, which have become labels under which people have taken shelter as the state has collapsed. Few of the Seleka -- or of the country's Muslim minority -- would likely subscribe to Boko Haram's virulently anti-Western message. Louisa Lombard, an anthropologist who has been visiting the Central African Republic for the last decade, said the sectarian killing overlaps with other grievances. ""Intercommunal relations have deteriorated for a lot of reasons: economic decline, for one,"" Lombard told CNN. ""The speed with which alliances are made and broken in CAR shows that this is largely a question of resources."" There is also the perception that ""foreigners"" control the country's wealth, and a complete lack of trust among communities, Lombard said. ""This is not a case of religious extremism. This is a case of religion being bound up in other dividing lines in the society,"" she added. But the current carnage, the physical separation and mutual fear of Christians and Muslims, provide a fertile recruiting ground for extremists. The U.N. report warned the dynamic of religious violence may spill beyond the Central African Republic and be exploited by groups from outside the country. It said tensions between Muslims and Christians ""might well lead to uncontrollable sectarian violence with untold consequences for the country, the subregion and beyond."" That can work both ways. Edmond Mulet, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping, told the Voice of America this week there are indications Boko Haram has some kind of presence in the country. Lombard said radical Islam may be growing from a narrow base but said she sees no evidence of Boko Haram there. Recruiting ground for extremists . Militant Islamist groups do have a growing presence elsewhere in West Africa, from Mauritania in the north to Cameroon in the south. Moderate Muslim leaders in Cameroon allege that Boko Haram has begun recruiting there. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, Cameroon President Paul Biya told the U.S. ambassador in 2010 that he ""was concerned about the threat of Islamic extremism (and) beginning to worry about Islamic extremists infiltrating Cameroon from Nigeria and making inroads through Cameroonian mosques."" Last week, Boko Haram demonstrated its resilience in the face of a crackdown by Nigerian security forces with a mass attack on an air force base in the northern city of Maiduguri. Nigerian sources said several hundred men were involved and had arrived in a convoy of trucks. One captured fighter, paraded at a news conference, claimed that Boko Haram now had men from Niger, Chad and Cameroon in its ranks. Boko Haram has already shown it can operate beyond Nigeria, kidnapping a French priest in northern Cameroon last month. Intelligence sources told CNN this year that Boko Haram had trained with jihadist groups in remote areas of northern Mali before the French military intervention there, an assertion French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius recently repeated. But in the immediate future, the people of the Central African Republic face far greater challenges than the infiltration by militant groups. UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Mia Farrow, who has visited the country several times, said six years ago she felt its citizens were ""the most abandoned people on earth."" Their situation has worsened since then. Even before the latest implosion, some two-thirds of its people lived below the poverty line. Average adult life expectancy is 48 years, the second lowest in the world. In the past year, more than half a million have been displaced; one in four of the population has inadequate access to food. The United Nations said in the past week alone more than 70,000 people in Bangui fled their homes. Many have vanished into the bush beyond the reach of aid agencies. Even if the United Nations and nongovernmental organizations can raise funds needed to deal with the humanitarian crisis, Lombard and others said the Central African Republic faces a long, hard road to anything resembling stability. ""In the middle and longer term, a real political project will be needed -- something that makes the country's politics more inclusive and establishes a kind of social contract,"" Lombard said. ""Unfortunately, that is not something that international organizations are very well placed to help with."" She added, ""We'll really be starting from scratch, but we won't be starting with a clean slate. The long history of violent politics is inscribed in this place.""","Some analysts fear fighting could fuel regional confrontation between Christians, Muslims .

"Wimbledon, England (CNN) -- Roger Federer and Eugenie Bouchard, one experienced and the other almost a rookie, started as clear crowd favorites in the men's and women's finals at Wimbledon this weekend. They went 0-for-2 -- but in contrasting fashion. After Bouchard was crushed by Petra Kvitova on Saturday, Federer was only just denied a record eighth title at the All England Club by Novak Djokovic in a classic Sunday that saw the duo combine for 143 winners and a smallish 56 unforced errors. The Serb prevailed 6-7 6-4 7-6 5-7 6-4, disappointing most on Centre Court who backed Federer on every shot -- especially when he fell behind 2-1 in sets. The higher-profile guests in tennis' grandest arena included David Beckham and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The partisans almost got their way too since Federer had the advantage in the fifth after he rallied from 5-2 down in the fourth, saving a match point with an ace originally called long. He was thus on the verge of becoming the first man since 1948 to win a Wimbledon final after fending off a match point. ""I kept believing and trying to play offensive tennis,"" Federer, watched by his young twin daughters, told reporters. ""I'm happy it paid off in some instances. ""As you can imagine, I'm very disappointed not being rewarded with victory."" Had Djokovic lost -- and don't forget he entered the record books for the wrong reason last year when he was on the other side of the net as Andy Murray ended a 77-year British drought -- it would have gone down as one of the biggest chokes in grand slam history. Ultimately, Djokovic also prevented Federer -- a month away from his 33rd birthday -- from becoming the oldest men's Wimbledon champion in the Open Era and claiming a record-extending 18th major. ""I could have easily lost my concentration in the fifth and handed him the win, but I didn't and that's why the win has special importance to me,"" Djokovic told reporters. It might have been the Swiss' last realistic opportunity to capture a grand slam, though he has been brushed aside before only to rebound. As for Djokovic, with the boost of confidence he's sure to receive by bagging a seventh grand slam crown, he'll be hard to stop at the US Open and beyond. Perhaps he can replicate his 2011 form, when he won Wimbledon, the US Open and Australian Open. ""When Novak was No. 1 in 2011, there was no No. 2 or No. 3,"" Mats Wilander, one of those tied with Djokovic on seven majors, told CNN. ""I think Djokovic has the game to not only be No. 1 in the world but remove the challengers that are behind him. ""He has a chance to do that again, especially as the next six, eight, nine months are on his favorite (hard-court) surface. I think he can just run away with things now for the next nine months until we get back to the clay-court season."" Djokovic badly needed this title, as he acknowledged, given he had lost his last five grand slam finals outside Australia. As a bonus, he replaces Nadal as the world No. 1. The pressure on his coach, Boris Becker, will dip now, if only slightly. Judging by his shoddy semifinal performance against Grigor Dimitrov, not many would have picked Djokovic to win a second Wimbledon title. He led by a set then allowed the Bulgarian to find his way into the encounter. It turned into a four-set struggle. Slips on Friday rendered Djokovic frustrated and he took two bad falls Sunday, one necessitating a medical timeout in the fifth. When Federer broke back early in the fourth set, Djokovic was dragged into another dogfight. Instead of winning in five sets, Djokovic could have won in three in the pair's 35th meeting and first in a grand slam final since the 2007 US Open. ""I felt like all the sets were very close for me to take,"" said Djokovic. Consistently in Federer's service games in the first, Djokovic nonetheless fell behind 3-0 in the tiebreak. He surged, holding a set point on his own serve, but was pegged back to 6-6 with a Federer forehand down the line. Federer saved another set point with an ace, winning the last three points of the tiebreak. All the energy -- mentally perhaps more than anything else -- took a toll on Federer and the first break of the match handed Djokovic a 2-1 lead in the second. It was an advantage he would never relinquish and by the end of the third set, he hadn't been broken. Prior to Djokovic's meltdown in the fourth, it seemed like the third-set tiebreak would prove pivotal. Federer's forehand went awry and with three misses, Djokovic took that tiebreak 7-4. Federer's partnership with Stefan Edberg -- one of the best volleyers in tennis history and Becker's rival during their playing days -- has seen him charging forward more. He enjoyed success at the net in the first set, winning 71% of net points, but the number dwindled to 60% in the second and 50% in the third. The figure rose in the fourth, diminishing in the fifth. The stage was set for Djokovic in the fourth. Hitting with more zip from the baseline and with Federer losing sting on his serve, he broke for 3-1. When Federer broke back for 2-3 it was temporary respite since Djokovic upped his game to move to the verge of the Championship at 5-2. But he faltered trying to serve it out at 5-3, beginning with a forehand error with Federer stranded. The drama was nothing compared to the 10th game. Down the match point, Federer struck a serve down the middle called long. Federer -- a traditionalist not in favor of Hawk-Eye when it was introduced -- challenged and to his utter relief, was correct. He held for 5-5. A predictably out-of-sorts Djokovic immediately dropped serve and Federer sealed the fourth. ""It's really only until the fourth set when I was down a break that I started to understand more how to return him, which was a surprise for me because I've played him that many times,"" Federer said. The Great Escape was on. A toilet break ensued for Djokovic, aiding no doubt to clear his head. He saved the first break point of the fifth at 3-3 with a fine inside-out forehand but was trumped in the next game as Federer saved three -- one thanks to an outstanding low volley. They ticked on until the 10th game, when Federer buckled. Serving second in the set and now not able to generate free points on his serve, Djokovic pounced. Federer netted a backhand to Djokovic's joy on a second match point and Djokovic celebrated minutes later by eating the grass a la 2011. He dedicated the win to his late, first coach, Jelena Gencic. ""This has been the best quality grand slam final I've ever been part of,"" said Djokovic. For Federer, it was his second loss in a Wimbledon final in nine tries. ""I'm very happy to see that with feeling normal I can produce a performance like I did the last two weeks,"" said Federer, troubled by a bad back in 2013. ""That clearly makes me believe that this was just a steppingstone to many more great things in the future."" To that end, the fans hope to see him in a 10th final next year -- and emerge as the winner.","Novak Djokovic wins Wimbledon title for second time .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen wounded a prominent Pakistani TV news anchor on Saturday in an attack his brother linked to the nation's government, despite its firm denial. Hamid Mir was shot three times by gunmen in a car and on two motorcycles near Karachi's airport, his network Geo News -- a CNN affiliate -- reported. Shahid Hayat, the police chief for Karachi, said bullets struck Mir's intestines, leg and pelvic area. Dr. Aamir Hussain told Geo News that Mir then underwent a successful operation at a private hospital. Amir Mir -- the targeted news anchor's brother and a journalist himself -- said Hamid Mir believed ISI, Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency, and specifically its leader Lt. Gen. Zaheerul Islam, had plans to assassinate him. Yet the Pakistani military public relations agency ISPR said that ""raising allegations against ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading."" In the same statement, a spokesman for that agency condemned the attack and ""prayed for (Mir's) well-being and quick recovery."" The United States condemned the shooting, calling it the latest in a series of worrisome attacks on journalists in Pakistan. ""...Attacks like these should be a wake-up call to all who value democracy in Pakistan,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""We wish Hamid Mir a speedy recovery and urge the Government of Pakistan to bring all those responsible for these attacks on the media to justice."" A former newspaper reporter and editor, Hamid Mir writes columns and hosts a political talk show on Geo News. His guests have included members of Pakistan's ruling government and the opposition. Mir is also writing a book on Osama bin Laden, the late al Qaeda leader whose escape from the Tora Bora mountains of Afghanistan he extensively reported on. Two Pakistani governments -- once in 2007 and again in 2008 -- banned him from appearing on Pakistani television. Pointing to a late March attack against a Pakistani journalist, an official with the Committee to Protect Journalists called the targeting of Mir ""an indicator that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has not been able to reverse the country's appalling record of violence against journalists, despite pledges to do so."" ""Police must act swiftly and decisively in this and all cases that have been building up for years in Pakistan,"" said Bob Dietz, the journalism advocacy group's Asia program coordinator. ""And the country's media must use their capabilities to pursue their own investigations, as well as pressure the government to take action.""","NEW: The United States says the attack ""should be a wake-up call"" in Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- He's done it once -- and now he's done it again. Roger Federer welcomed another pair of twins into the world Tuesday after his wife Mirka gave birth to boys Leo and Lenny. The Swiss star, who had earlier pulled of out the Madrid Open ahead of the impending birth, announced the news on Twitter. He tweeted: ""Mirka and I are so incredibly happy to share that Leo and Lenny were born this evening!"" Federer and Mirka became parents to twin girls Charlene Riva and Myla Rose in July 2009. The 32-year-old revealed on Twitter on Christmas Eve that the Swiss sweethearts were expanding their family in 2014. But Federer would not reveal his wife's due date or whether the couple were expecting another set of twins. He will now swap new balls for new diapers although he hopes to be back on court in the near future. ""I apologize to my fans and hope to be back in Madrid next year. I'll be training near my home, and am excited to rejoin the Tour soon."" Federer, a three-time Madrid Open winner, will be replaced in the draw by Poland's Lukasz Kubot, event organizers have announced. The Swiss played his last match three weeks ago in the final of the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he was defeated by compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka. Novak Djokovic has already announced he will skip the clay-court event as he seeks to recover from an arm injury. With the French Open just three weeks away, Federer will now likely have little time for competitive practice before the year's second grand slam begins. The world No. 4 has previously intimated he would not play in the French if meant he may miss the birth of his child. ""I've played enough tennis matches. Missing a tournament or missing a match wouldn't change anything for me,"" the 17-time grand slam winner told reporters last month.","Roger Federer has withdrawn from the Madrid Open .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the most individual sports, yet it sometimes demands that fierce rivals unify to compete against other countries in what could be called the World Cup of tennis. A Davis Cup final already steeped in intrigue soared to another level Saturday and now the question is: Can Roger Federer and Switzerland recover against France in front of a potential record crowd this weekend? Federer's back -- the area of his body that has intermittently hindered the 17-time grand slam champion in a mostly healthy career -- is only part of the issue. His relationship with teammate Stan Wawrinka in the wake of 'Mirka Gate' is worth monitoring, too. It's certainly not the build-up the 33-year-old Federer wanted as he seeks one of the two biggest titles to elude him, the other being an Olympic singles gold. Federer's wife, Mirka, might have taunted Wawrinka during her husband's dramatic 4-6 7-5 7-6 (6) win at the World Tour Finals in London and it reportedly led to a verbal bust up between the men who captured doubles gold together at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Federer then handed only the third walkover of his career to an opponent, the back not healthy enough to take on world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. At least on the relationship front, though, things appear to be better between Federer and Wawrinka ahead of the affair at the Stade Pierre Mauroy, the home of Lille in football's Ligue 1. Federer posted a picture on Twitter of a united looking Swiss side and members of the squad said Tuesday in Lille that any tension was gone. ""We had a conversation after the match,"" Federer told reporters. ""Everything's totally relaxed about the situation. We're old enough. ""There's no hard feelings whatsoever. We're having a good time here. We are friends, not enemies. But obviously it was maybe one of those moments, heat-of-the-moment situations."" Wawrinka blamed the press for blowing things out of proportion. ""For us it's nothing,"" he told reporters. ""It took us five minutes to talk about it, to think about the next main goal that we have -- the Davis Cup this weekend."" Heading into the semifinal at the O2 Arena, the Swiss appeared to have the upper hand in the Davis Cup final. Federer maintained his excellent 2014 form, while Wawrinka -- the Australian Open champion -- arrested a slump by winning two matches and extended his compatriot to three tight sets. He even had four match points. The eventful Saturday changed the complexion of the series. Making the transition from one surface to another is difficult -- the home team chose clay for the Davis Cup final and has practiced on it for weeks -- although at least a long flight wasn't needed for the Swiss to get to northern France. Wawrinka actually took the train from London. But Federer's back is of greater concern. His spot was confirmed in the draw Thursday -- he will face Gael Monfils on Friday after Wawrinka battles Jo-Wilfried Tsonga -- but being at 100 percent seems unlikely. The majority of the at least 27,000 expected to be in attendance per day -- the largest tennis crowd for a professional match remains the 27,200 who turned up to watch Spain defeat the U.S. in the 2004 final in Seville -- probably wouldn't mind if Federer is sub-par since it would give France a massive advantage. Federer practiced on the clay for the first time Wednesday. ""I'm just really pleased that I'm actually able to play tomorrow,"" Federer said at the draw Thursday. ""I'll give it a go. Definitely looking forward to playing against Gael. ""Things have been going very well for me the last week. It's been a difficult week, but I'm happy where I am today."" Federer declined to reveal whether he had taken a cortisone injection for his back. All the turmoil in the Swiss camp doesn't mean tennis loving France -- desperate to end a 13-year drought in the competition -- can relax, according to French No. 1 Tsonga. ""I think for this weekend, the important thing for us is to stay focused on ourselves, on our team,"" Tsonga told reporters. ""What we need is to have a perfect performance. ""What we can do is just play tennis. Anything else is not really our business."" Federer and Wawrinka were sure things to play singles for Switzerland if deemed fit, with France holding more options. French captain Arnaud Clement didn't pull off a major surprise, however, when he named Monfils as the No. 2. Monfils habitually shines at home, spurred on by the crowd and raising his level. One of his two victories over Federer came at the Paris Masters and he held two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open in September. Federer, however, has topped Monfils three times on the clay of Roland Garros. Federer was omitted from Saturday's doubles, as was Wawrinka, though changes can be made on the day. If France falters early, the large crowd may not be beneficial. The French have been known to boo their own at Roland Garros, for example. ""This is a competition that you want to win,"" former French No. 4 Sebastien Grosjean, Gasquet's co-coach who played in three finals, told CNN.com. ""You play for your country and you play for your friends but you try to focus on yourself, on your game -- a simple plan.""","France hosts Switzerland in one of the most anticipated Davis Cup finals in decades .

"(CNN) -- A mixed season for Novak Djokovic is at least ending on a high. Djokovic, the world No. 1, clinched that position in the year-end rankings for the third time when he crushed Tomas Berdych 6-2 6-2 in yet another lopsided encounter at the World Tour Finals in London. In doing so Friday, the Serb became the seventh men's player to achieve at least a treble, joining Pete Sampras, Roger Federer, Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Rafael Nadal. ""It's a great deal of happiness knowing what I've been through the entire season in order to get to where I am and finish the year as No. 1,"" said Djokovic, who became a dad and got married in 2014 but also lost his first coach, Jelena Gencic, and suffered a wrist injury. ""It's one of the ultimate challenges in this sport."" Sampras leads the way with six year-end No. 1 men's finishes and with Djokovic going a perfect 3-0 in the round-robin stage this year, he ended Federer's slim hopes of tying the American. Djokovic celebrated by taking part in a group hug with his entourage -- which included coaches Marian Vajda and Boris Becker -- at the side of the court. ""Because Nadal and Federer are so good for so many years, they always make you win at least one or two grand slams if you eventually want to be No. 1, and of course with consistency, because they've been so consistent with their results. ""I know how difficult it is. It's why I'm proud of this achievement."" Djokovic, the two-time defending champion at the year-end championships, was almost assured a spot in the semifinals even before he faced the 2010 Wimbledon runner-up -- but he made sure of progressing with an emphatic display. It's almost as if Djokovic was trying to better the second-ranked Federer, who on Thursday evening thumped Andy Murray 6-0 6-1 in a score no one could have anticipated. Friday's drubbing in Group A was a little more predictable, given that Djokovic owned a 16-2 record against Berdych and pummeled his opponent 6-0 6-2 in the final of the China Open in Beijing in October. His best shot could have been a piercing backhand down the line at 5-1 in the second set that brought a smile to the face of Vajda, his lone coach prior to the arrival of Becker. In three matches this week, Djokovic has dropped a paltry nine games. And when he forced a forehand error from Berdych on match point, Djokovic saw his winning streak indoors rise to 30 matches. ""He just secured his spot for the No. 1 player in the world -- I think it shows how great he is,"" said Berdych. Djokovic will face Japan's Kei Nishikori on Saturday in a rematch of their U.S. Open semifinal. That day marked one of Djokovic's low points in 2014, as the 27-year-old fell in four sets to Nishikori when he was the substantial favorite at Flushing Meadows. But playing in London might help Djokovic. It was in London in July that Djokovic earned his lone Grand Slam title of 2014 on the grass at Wimbledon. Federer, who finished at 3-0 in Group B, will meet his fellow Swiss and Davis Cup teammate Stan Wawrinka in the last four. Wawrinka simply needed to win just three games against the player who beat Nishikori in the U.S. Open final, Marin Cilic, on Friday evening to book his place in the semifinals for the second straight year. Cilic missed the last regular season event, the Paris Masters, with an arm injury and says he's fatigued. His results in London would back up that claim, but he did salvage pride in the final group match. Wawrinka eventually prevailed 6-3 4-6 6-3 over Cilic, only the second match in 12 group games to go the distance. It was the Australian Open champion's second victory in Group A, but he was soundly beaten in straight sets by Djokovic in his other encounter.","Novak Djokovic crushes Tomas Berdych at the World Tour Finals in London .

"(CNN) -- Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger asked a federal judge Friday to allow same-sex marriages while an appeal over the struck-down law that banned them makes its way through the courts. Schwarzenegger and Attorney General Jerry Brown filed briefs two days after Chief U.S District Judge Vaughn Walker ruled California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage, known as Proposition 8, violated the constitutional rights of same-sex couples. In his Wednesday ruling, Walker also issued a temporary stay, which stopped his decision from taking effect. If he lifts his stay, officials in California could immediately be allowed to perform same-sex marriages again. They were able to do so, briefly, before the Proposition 8 ban passed in 2008. ""The Administration believes the public interest is best served by permitting the Court's judgment to go into effect, thereby restoring the right of same-sex couples to marry in California,"" read the brief from Schwarzenegger. ""Doing so is consistent with California's long history of treating all people and their relationships with equal dignity and respect."" Supporters of Proposition 8 argued, prior to Walker's ruling, that same-sex marriages would be performed soon after he issued his opinion and could be complicated by rulings and appeals down the road. They asked the judge to stay his decision pending appeal. The case goes next to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and both sides say it is sure to wind up in the U.S. Supreme Court. Walker could issue his decision on the stay as early as next week. Brown, a Democrat who is running to replace Schwarzenegger, also weighed in on the controversial case. ""As this Court has concluded that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional, the public interest weighs against its continued enforcement,"" read the brief from Brown. Brown's opponent in the governor's race, Meg Whitman, told reporters before Walker's ruling she is against same-sex marriage but favors civil unions, according to the Associated Press. The news agency reported Whitman, a Presbyterian, has explained her vote for Proposition 8 as one of ""faith and conscience."" ""I believe marriage should be between a man and a woman,"" the AP reported Whitman said at a campaign stop in East Los Angeles. Proposition 8 is part of a long line of seesaw rulings, court cases, debates and protests over same-sex marriage. It passed in California with some 52 percent of the vote in November 2008. Same-sex marriage is currently legal in five U.S. states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Iowa and New Hampshire -- and in the District of Columbia, while civil unions are permitted in New Jersey.","Governor and attorney general say enforcement of Proposition 8 is not in the public interest .

"(CNN) -- Uganda says it has captured a top commander of the Lord's Resistance Army, the guerrilla movement notorious for its attacks on civilians and use of child soldiers. Ugandan commanders displayed Caesar Achellam to reporters after his capture in what they said was a weekend raid in the Central African Republic. The CAR is one of several African Union countries that has committed troops to hunt down LRA chieftain Joseph Kony, who is wanted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. ""This is a big fish,"" said Col. Felix Kulayigye, a Ugandan military spokesman. ""For Caesar to be in our hands it is a big statement, as far as our efforts to end this rebellion."" Achellam told reporters he hoped his capture would lead ""my people remaining in the brush"" to give up, ""so that sooner maybe the war would come to an end."" Radhika Coomaraswamy, U.N. special representative for Children and Armed Conflict, called on Ugandan authorities Monday to ""not apply amnesty but instead, bring him (Achellam) to justice."" ""The arrest and subsequent prosecution of Achellam would send a strong message to the LRA leadership that they will be held accountable for their actions,"" Coomaraswamy said. Achellam was captured with his wife, child and a 12-year-old girl from the Central African Republic, according to the U.N. Achellam and his family are in Ugandan custody in South Sudan. The unidentified girl remains in the Central African Republic. It's unknown why she was with Achellam, the U.N. said. Kony led a failed uprising against the government of Uganda and was pushed out of Uganda in 2006. He has been moving around other countries in the region ever since. Abou Moussa, a special U.N. envoy for central Africa, told CNN in March that Kony may be in the Central African Republic with between 200 and 700 remaining troops. Kony is accused of using vicious tactics to recruit children to use them as soldiers and sex slaves and of slicing off ears, noses and limbs of his victims. There are reports of child soldiers brainwashed into killing their own parents. A celebrity-backed video that went viral earlier this year helped make Kony's alleged crimes more widely known. The half-hour documentary ""KONY 2012"" was viewed more than 89 million times on YouTube, but the video also spurred a flurry of questions about its producers' intentions, their transparency and whether the social-media frenzy was too little, too late.","NEW: Achellam was captured with his wife, child and a 12-year-old Central African girl .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Cost overruns on big-ticket Pentagon projects have left the U.S. military facing a budgetary ""train wreck"" at a time of growing budget deficits, Sen. John McCain said Tuesday. A Littoral combat ship is tested in July. The cost to build the ships more than doubled, according to a report. McCain and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan and the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the cost of 95 major weapons systems -- ships, aircraft and armored vehicles -- have ballooned by a total of 30 percent in recent years, to about $1.3 trillion. The senators announced an effort, including legislation, to rein in that spending and tighten Defense Department oversight. With U.S. troops fighting two wars overseas and personnel costs dominating the defense budget, ""We're facing a train wreck,"" said McCain, the ranking Republican on the committee and the GOP's presidential candidate in 2008. ""We cannot continue on this path of escalating costs without at some point making some tough choices, which may endanger our nation's security,"" he said. McCain and Levin singled out the Navy's planned construction of Littoral combat ships, a class of small vessels designed for coastal operations, for particular criticism. Levin said the ships are ""way beyond"" their projected construction time of two years, and the program has grown from a cost per ship of about $220 million to more than $500 million, according to a November report from the Congressional Research Service. ""We can't have a ship that's a small ship that's supposed to be built in two years run completely out of control to double or triple or quadruple its original cost estimates,"" McCain said. He also criticized the planned purchase of 28 new Marine helicopters for the White House that he said cost ""more than Air Force One."" But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Tuesday that President Barack Obama has put that $11 billion order on hold. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Tuesday that the Defense Department is committed to reviewing its big-ticket contracts, ""particularly those programs that are underperforming."" The presidential helicopter project ""is one of those programs,"" he said. Levin and McCain said their push will include hearings into military contracting, legislation creating new watchdog posts in the Pentagon and an effort to stiffen congressional oversight of big-ticket programs. ""The Department of Defense has the major responsibility to make sure that these programs are run efficiently. Congress has an oversight responsibility,"" Levin said. ""Neither of those activities have been carried out adequately."" Their announcement comes as Obama is scheduled to deliver his budget address to Congress, and Defense Secretary Robert Gates is already examining whether to cut back on some of the armed services' biggest purchases. ""This moment also presents an opportunity, one of those rare chances to match virtue to necessity, to critically and ruthlessly separate appetites from real requirements,"" Gates told a Senate hearing in January. Among the other items under scrutiny: The $950 billion joint strike fighter program, the Army's $200 billion Future Combat System and the Navy's Virginia-class attack submarines. ""We are going to have lots of fights in the next two or three months over various parts of the defense budget,"" said Winslow Wheeler, an analyst for the nonprofit Center for Defense Information. The plans have leading defense contractors and members of Congress with contractors' factories in their districts already arguing to keep their programs intact. Lockheed Martin's F-22 program, for instance, employs about 12,000 people in 44 states, its supporters argue. But Wheeler said defense spending produces ""significantly less"" employment than spending in other areas, such as mass transit or health care. CNN's Barbara Starr and Mike Mount contributed to this report.","Senators announce push to rein in weapons spending, tighten Pentagon oversight .

"(CNN) -- Pushpa Basnet, a Nepalese woman who supports children so they don't have to live behind bars with their incarcerated parents, was named the 2012 CNN Hero of the Year on Sunday night. Nepal is one of the poorest countries, and space is very limited in the few group homes affiliated with the government. So when a parent is incarcerated and no other guardian can be found, children have little choice but to live in prison as well. Basnet, 29, is determined to give these children another option. She started a home in Kathmandu where children can receive education, food, medical care and a chance to live a more normal life. She also runs a day care program for children who are too young to be separated from their parent. ""These children have done nothing wrong. They are simply caught in something they do not understand,"" Basnet said during ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,"" which took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and honored her and the other top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. ""We want to work with the government to bring them all out from of prison. And they deserve a better future."" Basnet talks to Anderson Cooper . Since 2005, Basnet has helped more than 140 children through her nonprofit, the Early Childhood Development Center. Basnet was chosen as Hero of the Year through a nine-week public vote held on CNN.com. For being named CNN Hero of the Year, she receives $250,000 to continue her work. That is in addition to the $50,000 that each of the top 10 Heroes are receiving. When accepting the Hero of the Year award, Basnet relayed a message to incarcerated children in Nepal. ""Mamu's going to take you out from the prison, and you're coming to my place,"" said Basnet, who is called ""Mamu"" by many of the children. ""This is for my children, and this is for my country Nepal. Thank you so much everybody who voted for me and who believed in my dream."" This is the sixth year of the CNN Heroes campaign. In that time, more than 180 CNN Heroes have been profiled on CNN, chosen from more than 45,000 nominations submitted through the CNN Heroes website. Each year, the campaign culminates with a live tribute show that brings together some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry. The celebrities who took part in this year's show included movie stars Susan Sarandon, Adrien Brody, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Harvey Keitel and Josh Duhamel; athletes Jeff Gordon and Cullen Jones; and hip-hop artist 50 Cent. Television stars Rainn Wilson (""The Office""), Rico Rodriguez (""Modern Family""), Jane Lynch (""Glee""), Miranda Cosgrove (""iCarly"") and David Spade (""Rules of Engagement"") also participated. There were two musical performances during the show. ""American Idol"" winner Phillip Phillips performed ""Home,"" and three-time Grammy Award winner Ne-Yo sang ""Heroes."" In addition to receiving $50,000, this year's top 10 Heroes will also receive free training from the Annenberg Foundation, a leading supporter of nonprofits worldwide. Each Hero will receive a customized version of the Annenberg Alchemy program, which provides practical guidance on fundraising, communications, management and much more. ""We have found that the most effective nonprofits are like the CNN Heroes -- organizations with strong and visionary leaders and a bold, new approach to getting the job done,"" said Wallis Annenberg, the foundation's president, CEO and chairman of the board.

"(CNN) -- The teenage fugitive suspected of flying a stolen plane to the Bahamas over the weekend may have surfaced Wednesday night, authorities there said. ""We've had some sightings of the individual,"" said Glenn Miller, assistant commissioner of the Royal Bahamas Police Force. Colton Harris-Moore, dubbed the ""barefoot bandit,"" may have been seen Wednesday evening on Abaco Island, Miller said. ""An individual was spotted, white male, running in the bushes,"" Miller said. ""We suspect it's him, and we advise him to turn himself in."" Harris-Moore, 19, has been linked to the theft of a single-engine plane Sunday at Monroe County Airport in Bloomington, Indiana. Bruce Payton, the airport director, said a 2009 Cessna 400 Corvalis was reported missing from a locked hangar. He said the Coast Guard told the owner of the plane that an emergency location transmitter on the Cessna was sending out a beacon from the Bahamas. The plane was found just off Abaco, Miller said, and investigators took evidence from the aircraft. He also said police were looking into several reported thefts and break-ins reported in the area since the crash-landing. Abaco Island has a population of approximately 15,000 to 20,000, Miller said. But he cautioned that it is ""a huge land mass where someone can hide."" The island, about 180 miles east of southern Florida, covers about 650 square miles. Abaco and Grand Bahamas are the northernmost islands in the chain. Harris-Moore's years on the run began in Oregon and Washington, where he was linked to a series of home break-ins. Over the past month, officials say he has moved eastward. Authorities believe he may have broken into airports in South Dakota and Nebraska. He also has been suspected of stealing several cars. A warrant for his arrest has been issued in Nebraska. The FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.","Police: Person who might have been Colton Harris-Moore was seen ""running in the bushes""

"(CNN) -- Orange is the new snack -- that's the case in Ukraine anyway after one of the country's top football players donated 20 tons of tangerines to local children. Darijo Srna, who plays for Donetsk-based Shakhtar, made the gesture which allowed for the fruit from his hometown of Metkovic in Croatia, which is renowned for the fruit, to arrive in Ukraine. ""As a child, back in Croatia, I also went through a period when I needed help,"" Srna told the club's official website. ""It is very important that there are people who support you in difficult situations. Donbass and Donetsk gave me a lot. And these citrus fruit is just a small gift that I can give back."" Donetsk has been besieged by fighting with the club's Donbass Arena suffering damage from shelling. In April 2014, pro-Russian activists took control of government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. This season, Shakhtar has been forced to play its home league games in Kiev, the capital city, while it has hosted Champions League fixtures in Lviv. ""I am missing it a lot,"" Srna said of Donetsk. ""Every day I read and watch the news. After each game I tell the guys that all the goals we score, all our victories are our gift to Donbass, to Donetsk, to the fans of Shakhtar, who currently have a tough time."" Srna, 32, who grew up during the Balkans war, says he hopes the arrival of the tangerines, each with their own greeting card, will help bring some solace to those in the region. ""I respect Donetsk a lot,"" he said. ""This is my city. The city in which I have been supported for 11 years, owing to which I matured both as a footballer and individual. ""I do it not for someone to say: ""Well done, Darijo!"" This is from the heart and soul. I'll try to support all those who need it,"" he added.","Darijo Srna donates tangerines to children of Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid smashed five goals past Rayo Vallecano to return to the top of the Spanish league after briefly being deposed by rivals Barcelona. The score flattered Real Madrid, who scored a flurry of second half goals late on after a brave Rayo Vallecano effort had threatened an upset. Gareth Bale returned to the starting line up to score within the first ten minutes and when Sergio Ramos added a second a heavy defeat was on the cards. But Rayo Vallecano's Alberto Bueno made the most of a horrific defensive mix up to pull a goal back before half time. But Madrid eventually imposed their superiority on the game, with Toni Kroos, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo completing the scoring. It was the tenth game in a row that Ronaldo has scored. It was also the fifth time in eight league games that Madrid have scored five goals. Suarez arrives? Meanwhile Luis Suarez came off the bench to set up two goals, save Barcelona's blushes and see the Catalan side briefly go top of the league. Barcelona had traveled to Almeria with question marks hanging over Luis Enrique's team. A two game losing streak was followed by an unconvincing 2-0 victory over Ajax in the Champions League. The returning Luis Suaraz, signed in the summer but banned until last month after biting a player at the World Cup finals, had been far from his best too. Suarez started on the bench and Barcelona went into half time a goal down after Thievy Bifouma took advantage of a Lionel Messi mistake to fire Almeria into the lead . But Suarez and Neymar were called into action in the second half which changed the shape of the game. The two combined midway through the second half to bring the sides level before Suarez's cross set up Jordi Alba in the 81st minute to score the winner. But Coach Enrique was far from happy. ""The second half was better for the ambition and attitude shown by the players rather than for good football,"" he said after the game.""To have a good season, though, you have to win even when you don't play well in games like today."" Bayern thrive, Dortmund dive . In Germany, Bayern Munich continued their imperious form by beating Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 thanks to a Thomas Mueller hat trick. The victory saw Munich go seven points clear at the top of the league, handing coach Pep Guardiola his eight victory in eleven league games. ""They were very aggressive in defense, we had a few problems with our structure,"" Guardiola told AFP after the game. ""But the last 20 minutes was a completely different game."" Munich's supremacy is no surprise to anyone, but the identity of the team propping up the league is. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund qualified for the knock out phase of the Champions League last week, but results on Saturday saw Dortmund fall to the foot of the table, the first time they have been in such a lowly position for seven years. Dortmund has lost five league games in a row. They play Borussia Monchengladbach Sunday.","Barcelona beat Almeria 2-1.

"(CNN) -- F1 championship leader Lewis Hamilton feels like a ""kid at Christmas"" thanks to the dominance of his Mercedes car which was underlined again Friday as he set the fastest time in both practices for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Hamilton needs to finish no lower than second to teammate Nico Rosberg in Sunday's final race of the season to clinch his second world title, but after edging the German out in either session could not have wished for a better start to the weekend. ""It's been a good Friday. The car feels great -- the best I've ever driven here without doubt,"" he told the official F1 website. ""When you know you have a package as competitive as ours it's like being a kid at Christmas. I don't feel any particular pressure this weekend. I'll just drive the way I always drive and what will be, will be,"" he added. The 29-year-old Briton clocked a best lap at the Yas Marina circuit of one minute 42.113 seconds in the second runs which finished in the twilight and under the lights. It left him 0.083 seconds clear of Rosberg, continuing the pattern of his Friday dominance this season, topping 15 out of 19 of those sessions. But Rosberg, who trails by 17 points, but with double points on offer in the final round under new rules, has claimed pole position in qualifying on no less than 10 occasions, so remains confident. ""In general the car felt great out there today. I just need to fine-tune it so that the set-up is exactly to my liking, then go for it and get the job done,"" he said. Rosberg will be hoping, assuming he can win the 55-lap finale, that another driver can come between him and Hamilton. He may have been heartened by the performance of Kevin Magnussen in the McLaren, who took third fastest in the second session. He finished just ahead of four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, who will be starting his 113th and final race for Red Bull before leaving for Ferrari. Valtteri Bottas of Williams was fifth best ahead of Daniel Ricciardo in the second Red Bull. Aussie Ricciardo is the only driver other than the Mercedes pair to win a race this season, claiming three victories in an impressive first year with the team. Friday's practice also saw a return to the timesheets for the cash-strapped Caterham team, which only made the final race of the season thanks to a crowdfunding scheme. Japan's Kamui Kobayashi and British rookie Will Stevens finished 18th and 19th but at least set a time. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, in his final race for Ferrari, had an electrical fault on his car and came to a halt by the side of the track at the start of the session and was unable to continue.","Lewis Hamilton fastest in Friday's practice session .

"(CNN) -- She grew up in one of the poorest spots on earth. She couldn't read or write. As a child, she scrounged for food each day for herself, her mother, and her brother. But a chance encounter with a chess coach turned her into a rising international chess star, the subject of a book -- and the protagonist in a future Disney movie. Ugandan teenager Phiona Mutesi is ""the ultimate underdog,"" her biographer says. Those who work with her believe she's 16. But since her birthday is unclear, she might still only be 15, they say. Her father died from AIDS when Mutesi was around 3. ""I thought the life I was living, that everyone was living that life,"" the teenager told CNN, describing her childhood in Katwe, a slum in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. Read more: Uganda's Little League team have a field of dreams . ""I was living a hard life, where I was sleeping on the streets, and you couldn't have anything to eat at the streets. So that's when I decided for my brother to get a cup of porridge."" Robert Katende, a missionary and refugee of Uganda's civil war, had started a chess program in Katwe. He offered a bowl of porridge to any child who would show up and learn. ""It teaches you how to assess, how to make decisions, obstructive thinking, forecasts, endurance, problem solving, and looking at challenges as an opportunity in all cases -- and possibly not giving up,"" he told CNN. ""The discipline, the patience ... anything to do with life, you can get it in that game."" Mutesi did not become a top player overnight. But from the time she first showed up in 2005, her aptitude was clear. Her talent is ""extraordinary,"" said Katende. Mutesi liked chess, and started training and practicing regularly. ""It took me like a year"" to get very good, she said. She walked about four miles a day to practice -- and to get that precious food. Soon she found herself beating the older girls and boys in the program. Read more: Doctor-turned-kayaker fights malaria in Uganda . Mutesi and her family faced pressure from some people in Uganda who insisted chess was a white man's game, or at least not something girls should be playing, according to her biographer, Tim Crothers. But in her slum, so few people even knew what chess was that they didn't give her a hard time, Mutesi told CNN. Eventually, she became her country's champion -- and represented Uganda at international tournaments. In 2009, she traveled to Sudan. Then, in 2010, she boarded an airplane to Siberia. When the flight took off, ""I thought that I was maybe in heaven,"" she wrote in a letter to her mother quoted in Crothers' book. ""I asked God to protect me because who am I to fly to the europlane."" Mutesi had also never seen ice before. Read more: Marathon man Kiprotich ends Uganda's long wait for Olympic gold . This year, she played in Istanbul. Mutesi is not one of the world's top chess players. But she is the first titled female Ugandan player. She has a fighter's instinct to reach the top level -- and to achieve much more. ""Chess gave me hope, whereby now I'm having a hope of becoming a doctor and ... a grand master,"" she said. A grant from a program called Sports Outreach has allowed her to go back to school. She's learning to read and write. Meanwhile, Mutesi is becoming an inspiration to people all over the world. Some learned about her through Crothers' article for ESPN, which went viral. Others have seen a brief documentary about her on YouTube. Crothers' book about her, ""The Queen of Katwe,"" was published this fall. ""That she's from Africa makes her an underdog in the world. The fact that she's from Uganda makes her sort of an underdog in Africa, because it's one of the poorer countries in Africa. The fact that she's in Katwe makes her an underdog in Uganda because it's the most impoverished slum in the entire country. And then to be a girl in Katwe -- girls are not treated as equals to the boys,"" said Crothers. ""Every hurdle that the world can place in front of her it has placed in front of her."" The extreme poverty and deprivation in Katwe is hard for many around the world to imagine. Crothers wrote that ""human waste from downtown Kampala is dumped directly into the slum. There is no sanitation."" Mutesi wakes at 5 a.m. every morning to ""begin a two-hour trek through Katwe to fill a jug with drinkable water, walking through lowland that is often so severely flooded by Uganda's torrential rains that many residents sleep in hammocks near their ceilings to avoid drowning,"" he wrote. In the country of 34 million people, about one-fourth live below the poverty line, according to the CIA World Factbook. About three-quarters of the men in Uganda are literate; only 58% of women are. Mutesi told CNN she's never heard of Idi Amin, the so-called butcher of Uganda, who helped plunge his country into economic chaos throughout the 1970s. She does know the name Joseph Kony, a brutal Ugandan warlord who was the subject of a viral video earlier this year. Kids talk about him, Mutesi said. ""He was in northern Uganda torturing people and could kidnap children. That's what I know."" Chess could prove to be Mutesi's ticket out of a hard life -- particularly through a project that lies ahead. Disney has optioned the rights to ""The Queen of Katwe,"" and is starting work on a movie, Crothers said. It's all too much for Mutesi to fathom. ""I feel happy,"" she said when asked about the growing attention. ""I'm excited. I didn't have hope that one time, one day, I would be like someone who can encourage people, and they start playing chess,"" she told CNN. As her world travels take off, she's in for more and more culture shock. ""I don't like New York because there's too much noise in it,"" the teenager said with a big smile. But while it may be somewhat overwhelming for her, Mutesi's success at the game she loves is bringing joy to her family. ""Some of them cried. Years back we didn't have hope that ... one day it can happen,"" she said. ""So they are very excited.""","Phiona Mutesi grew up in a slum in Uganda's capital .

"(CNN) -- In a dusty old attic in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Stephon Tull was rummaging through dilapidated boxes left there by his father many years before, when he came across an interesting find. In one of the battered boxes was an audio reel marked, ""Dr. King interview, Dec. 21, 1960."" ""I'm a rummager, a packrat,"" said Tull. ""That piqued my interest."" Tull acquired a reel-to-reel player and listened to what sounded like his father interviewing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. about nonviolence and the civil rights movement. ""I could not believe what I was hearing,"" said Tull. Tull's father had grown up in Tennessee during the years of racial tension, oppression, and the so-called ""Jim Crow"" segregation laws. ""He planned on writing a book on how bad things were back in that era,"" said Tull, but he never finished it, ""He fell ill, and is now in Hospice care."" Tull's father's recorded his conversation with King three years before the civil rights leader delivered his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, four years before President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law and eight years before King was assassinated in Memphis, across the state from where Tull's father lived. In the interview, King can clearly be heard discussing his definition of nonviolence, and its importance in the civil rights movement. ""I would ... say that it is a method which seeks to secure a moral end through moral means,"" he said, ""and it grows out of the whole concept of love, because if one is truly nonviolent that person has a loving spirit, he refuses to inflict injury upon the opponent because he loves the opponent."" King continued, ""I am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epics of our heritage,"" he said. ""It represents struggle on the highest level of dignity and discipline."" The Rev. Joseph Lowery, one of the founders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King in 1957, said the tapes are a reminder of the work King started that is not finished. ""One of the things that occurred back then, we effectively communicated that nonviolence as a tactic, as a technique, was very effective for civil rights protests,"" said Lowery. ""What we failed to do was express it's not just a tactic, but a way of life."" Lowery went on, ""We're losing the battle of violence versus nonviolence as a means of resolving human conflict,"" he said, ""I hope Dr. King's message, wherever it shows up will help us in the struggle."" In another part of Tull's recording, King describes a recent trip to Africa. He explains to Tull's father the importance of the civil rights movement both in the United States and abroad. ""There is quite a bit of interest and concern in Africa for the situation in the United States. African leaders in general, and African people in particular are greatly concerned about the struggle here and familiar with what has taken place,"" he said, ""We must solve this problem of racial injustice if expect to maintain our leadership in the world, and if we expect to maintain a moral voice in a world that is two thirds color."" The recording is intriguing to Clayborne Carson, a professor of history and founding director of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. ""It's hard to know what we're dealing with,"" he said, ""There are thousands of interviews with Dr. King, and it's hard to tell the historical significance of this (one)."" ""What is interesting about this is rather than just a transcript, you can hear his voice,"" he added. In 1985, King's widow, the late Coretta Scott King, invited Carson to direct a long-term project to edit and publish the civil rights leader's works. Based on the dates, Carson believes the African trip King mentioned in the recording was his trip to Nigeria. This is what Carson and his colleagues are most interested in. ""The trip to Nigeria is something we don't have a lot of information about,"" he said, ""In Nigeria he didn't do press conferences, didn't do interviews or write letters we know of."" Keya Morgan, a collector and expert on rare historical artifacts, authenticated the reel, and is working with Tull to arrange a sale through his Keya Gallery in New York. He says he hopes the recording will find a good home in a museum or at a university. ""When I heard it, I got goose bumps all over,"" Morgan said, ""It feels like he's sitting in your living room and talking to you.""

"(HLN) -- When Nelba Marquez-Greene lost her 6-year-old daughter in the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, she chose to cope with her loss in a unique way: by writing a letter. That letter, which addresses teachers and was published September 6 in Education Week, tells a story that will shake any parent to the core. Not powerless: What parents can do after Newtown . Marquez-Greene's daughter, Ana Grace, was one of the 20 first-graders killed December 14, when 20-year-old Adam Lanza arrived at the school with a rifle in hand. Six educators were also fatally shot by Lanza before he killed himself. ""While waiting in the firehouse that day to hear the official news that our daughter was dead, my husband and I made promises to ourselves, to each other, and to our son,"" Marquez-Greene writes. ""We promised to face the future with courage, faith, and love."" Teachers lessons in heroism and healing . Marquez-Greene goes on to speak about the courage and bravery of teachers, marveling at how they could return to work after an event as traumatizing as the shooting. When Marquez-Greene asked her son's teacher why she returned, she got an answer that made perfect sense to her as a parent. ""Because they are my kids,"" the teacher told her. ""And my students need me now more than ever."" Marquez-Greene says that the courage of each teacher requires faith and deep love on their part. Her image of a hero, she tells us, is the everyday worker: the principal, school lunch worker, custodian, reading specialist, teacher or bus monitor. ""Real heroes don't wear capes. They work in America's schools,"" Marquez-Greene writes. Opinion: Above all, teachers do it for the kids . While Marquez-Greene, the mental health director for the nonprofit organization Sandy Hook Promise, admits that she ""almost lost her mind"" when she had to return her son back to the classroom, she said they sent him back because they didn't want him to be afraid. ""Parents are sending their precious children to you this fall,"" she writes to the teachers. ""Some will come fully prepared, and others not. They will come fed and with empty bellies. They will come from intact homes and fractured ones. Love them all."" How Georgia school hero kept shooter calm .","Sandy Hook mom writes letter to teachers .

"(CNN) -- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's military may have more cracks in its armor as dozens more soldiers, including a general and two colonels, have defected across the border, Turkish media reported Monday. The 33 army defectors entered Turkey and were sent to a camp in southern Hatay province, the Anadolu news agency said, citing authorities. Malik el Kurdi, the deputy commander of the rebel Free Syrian Army, speaking to CNN by telephone from the Apaydin refugee camp, said that within the past week a general and three colonels had arrived, but he had not seen a group of more than 30 new deserters. The refugee camp houses the proclaimed leadership and other members of the FSA, the opposition force made up of Syrian army defectors. ""I receive soldiers daily,"" el Kurdi added. ""There are rumors, but I haven't received anyone in that number."" The defections included a Syrian general and at least four other officers, according to a Turkish Foreign Ministry official and a commander in the Free Syrian Army camp in Turkey. All were from the Syrian city of Homs, the commander said. Both officials spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity. More than 33,000 Syrians have fled to Turkey to escape the violence in their country, Anadolu reported. Speaking in Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland praised the reported defections, which is something the United States has called for, for some time, she said. ""This appears to be an increasing pace of these kinds of military folks voting with feet, voting with their airplanes, voting with their cars, voting with their families against the Assad regime,"" Nuland told reporters. The defections took place amid heightened tensions between Syria and Turkey, and the rest of the international community, over how to stop the bloodshed spurred by the Syrian government's crackdown on dissidents. Syria was in a war of words Monday with Turkey over the shooting down of a Turkish fighter jet by Syria, an incident that threatens to draw in NATO. Syria rejects Turkey claims on downed jet . Meanwhile, at least 80 people were killed Monday in violence across Syria, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition group. Twenty of those 80 were killed in Daraa, while 17 were killed in Deir Ezzor, the group said. Since Syria's anti-government uprising started in March last year, more than 15,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed, the observatory said. The United Nations has said that at least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Syria blames violence on ""armed terrorist groups."" On state-run news agency SANA, al-Assad's regime said 20 ""army and law enforcement martyrs"" were buried Monday. CNN cannot confirm specific reports of violence in Syria because the government has restricted access to the country by international journalists. Opposition groups say the violence began when a government crackdown on peaceful protesters generated a nationwide uprising, including the armed resistance. Turkey hardens military position after Syria downs jet . Navi Pillay, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said Monday that despite ""efforts to restore calm in Syria, the situation deteriorates relentlessly."" ""Both government and opposition forces have been involved in actions which have harmed civilians,"" Pillay said. ""Those responsible must be held accountable, including for attacks against United Nations observers. I reiterate my call for the Security Council to refer the case of Syria to the International Criminal Court. A prompt referral would serve to remind the actors in Syria that they will be held to account for their failure to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law and protect civilians."" The European Union announced a new round of sanctions against al-Assad's regime. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the move ""sends an unequivocal message that we will intensify the pressure until the Assad regime ends the killing"" and fully implements a six-point plan put forward by Kofi Annan, joint U.N.-Arab League envoy to Syria. ""We have also decided to strengthen the arms embargo"" to prevent weapons shipments to Syria, Hague said. ""This robust action comes on the back of our rapid coordination with EU partners to prevent a Russian ship providing attack helicopters to those leading the repression in Syria."" A Russian ship turned back last week. Russian officials said it was carrying repaired attack helicopters that the Syrian regime would use for defensive purposes. ""The UK will remain vigilant and continue to do all that we can to prevent the completely unjustified arming of a regime that is carrying out appalling crimes against its own people,"" Hague said.

"(CNN) -- The election of Aung San Suu Kyi to Myanmar's parliament capped a remarkable turnaround for the pro-democracy campaigner, who was kept under house arrest for a total of 15 years by the country's military junta. Suu Kyi was born in 1945, the daughter of Myanmar independence hero General Aung San -- a man almost universally respected in the country, including the top ranks of the omnipresent military. She was only two years old when her father was assassinated as the country, then known as Burma, prepared to transfer from British colonial rule. Her mother, Khin Kyi, became an active figure in the newly independent nation, eventually winning ambassadorial posts in India and Nepal. Suu Kyi followed her mother to India and continued her education in New Delhi, which culminated in a degree in politics in 1964. She went on to Oxford University in England to study politics, economics and philosophy. It was here she met Michael Aris, whom she married in 1972 after stints working in the United States and Japan. The couple had two children, Alexander and Kim. In 1988, Suu Kyi returned to Yangon, also known as Rangoon, to care for her sick mother. However she became involved in the massive pro-democracy demonstrations that erupted on August 8 that year, as thousands took to the streets to protest against the widespread oppression and economic mismanagement under the ruling military junta. This became known as the ""8888 Uprising."" At one rally in front of Yangon's famous Shwedagon Pagoda, Suu Kyi told protesters she ""could not, as my father's daughter remain indifferent to all that was going on."" She became an icon of the country's reform movement and co-founded the National League for Democracy (NLD). Myanmar: The lynchpin of Asia . But the uprising came to a shuddering halt in September 1988, when the military restored control after a brutal crackdown and imposed martial law. At the funeral of her mother in January, 1989, Suu Kyi vowed that as her father and mother had served the people of Burma, so too would she, even unto death. Despite continuous harassment from the military -- including a ban imposed on her standing for election -- she continued to campaign until she was placed under house arrest in July, 1989. When the military government called national elections in 1990, huge numbers of people turned out to vote for Suu Kyi and the NLD. The result, an 82% landslide in favor of the NLD, took the military rulers by surprise. Refusing to acknowledge defeat, they claimed foreigners and communists had rigged the election. In the subsequent weeks, hundreds of NLD members were rounded up and jailed, according to rights groups. In 1991, Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for what the Nobel committee described as ""one of the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent decades."" Suu Kyi's sons accepted the prize on their mother's behalf in Oslo, Norway -- she had rejected a release offer from the military in return for her agreement to leave Myanmar and withdraw from politics. The NLD leader was eventually released in 1995 on the condition she could not leave Yangon. Tragedy struck in 1999 when her husband died of prostrate cancer in London. The authorities in Myanmar had rejected his repeated requests to visit his wife, and instead encouraged Suu Kyi to visit her family abroad. Suu Kyi again rejected the offer to leave Myanmar, knowing she would never be able to return. In 2000, she was placed under house arrest for a further two years, during which time she was conferred the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- America's highest civilian honor -- by U.S. President Bill Clinton. But barely a year later, she was arrested after a clash between her supporters and a pro-government mob, resulting in a period of detention that would last until 2010. One of the most bizarre episodes of her confinement came in 2009, shortly before she was scheduled for release, when American citizen John Yettaw snuck into her house -- reportedly by swimming across a lake -- and stayed for two days before being arrested. Yettaw told CNN he made the trip to save Suu Kyi from assassination. The retired bus driver and Vietnam veteran from Missouri told his wife that he had a premonition he would become a political prisoner in Myanmar. He was convicted of violating immigration laws, municipal laws, and the conditions of Suu Kyi's house arrest and sentenced to seven years of hard labor, though he was freed shortly after. Suu Kyi was initially sentenced to three years in prison after a military court found her guilty of violating her house arrest, but the head of the junta later commuted it to 18 months of home confinement. On November 13, 2010, the pro-democracy campaigner was released and reunited with her sons. Despite spending 15 of the previous 21 years under house arrest, she pledged to keep working toward restoring democracy and improving human rights in Myanmar. Her release came too late for the national elections that year, which saw the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party led by President Thein Sein -- prime minister under the junta -- declare victory despite accusations of voting irregularities and voter intimidation. Suu Kyi and the widely-popular NLD boycotted the vote. Despite widespread criticism of the electoral process, the vote marked a turning point as the new government embarked on a serious of political and economic reforms that the U.S. described as ""encouraging."" In the past 12 months, the country has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a ceasefire with Karen rebels and has agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. In December last year, Hilary Clinton became the first U.S. secretary of state to visit the country in 50 years, a trip that included a meeting with Suu Kyi. Clinton said the pro-democracy activist had been instrumental in helping to gauge the U.S. diplomatic approach to Myanmar. ""She is someone who we talk to and rely on about policy advice, and certainly we were very gratified that she encouraged us to engage, encouraged my trip,"" Clinton told reporters at the time. The following month, Suu Kyi registered to run for a parliamentary seat in the April 1 by-election, while her party was formally given approval to enter the contest. She was greeted by huge crowds as she took her campaign across the country, and appealed for ""freedom from fear"" in her first televised campaign speech. With the spotlight on the electoral process after the problems of 2010, Suu Kyi claimed that the April vote would not be ""free and fair"" but that she did not ""at all regret having taken part"" because the election campaign had raised political awareness among Myanmar's population. Suu Kyi said she believed President Thein wished for democratic reform, but that she was uncertain how much support he had, notably from the military. Suu Kyi claimed victory in the constituency where she ran -- Kawhmu, south of the former capital city of Yangon -- while her party was victorious in 43 of the 44 seats it contested. In late May, the newly-elected Parliamentarian left Myanmar on her first foreign trip in 24 years. She received a rapturous welcome in Thailand where she spoke to Burmese migrants who told her of their desire to return home. Addressing delegates at the World Economic Forum, Suu Kyi warned against ""reckless optimism"" over the current pace of reform in Myanmar. ""Optimism is good but it should be cautious optimism. I have come across reckless optimism. A little bit of healthy skepticism is in order,"" she said. In mid-June Suu Kyi embarked on a 16-day trip around Europe that is to include her acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize that she won while under house arrest in 1991.","Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of assassinated Myanmar independence hero General Aung San .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The spread of the flu across the United States appears to have slowed in some areas, but officials won't know for weeks whether the cases have peaked, the CDC director said Friday. Twenty-four states and New York City were reporting high levels of flu activity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flu advisory report for December 30 through January 5. That's down from 29 states the previous week, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC. However, ""The only area of the country that's still relatively unaffected ... is the far West Coast,"" although plenty of cases have been reported there, Dr. Joseph Bresee, chief of the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the CDC's Influenza Division, said Friday. The number of pediatric deaths associated with influenza rose by two, according to the CDC. There have been 20 deaths of people under the age of 18 since the flu outbreak began. While the CDC does not count the number of adult deaths related to the flu, some states do, and that data suggests dozens have died. According to the latest CDC activity map, flu levels dropped in several states, particularly in the Southeast, including Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Arkansas and Kentucky. In the Northeast, levels in some states have also improved, such as New York, but New York City remains among the areas of high activity. The number of states reporting widespread activity, however, increased to 47 from 41, according to the CDC's flu advisory report. The only states without widespread activity are California, Hawaii and Mississippi. ""Widespread"" means that more than 50% of geographic regions in a state -- counties, for example -- are reporting flu activity. It addresses the spread of the flu, not its severity. ""Bottom line: It's flu season,"" Frieden told reporters. Flu activity is ""elevated"" in most of the United States, he said, and ""it may be decreasing in some areas, but that's hard to predict ... influenza activity ebbs and flows."" Officials will know in the next couple of weeks whether the season has peaked, he said. ""The only thing predictable about the flu is, it's unpredictable."" ""... We are into what would classically be described as a flu epidemic,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. ""It's still on the uptick,"" he said. ""Remember, once it peaks, you still have a considerable amount of time where there is a lot of flu activity, and right now it may have peaked in some places, but for the most part, it has not yet peaked,"" Fauci said. Many reports of emergency rooms and clinics being overwhelmed with patients could be linked to other illnesses, too. This is also a prominent season for many other respiratory viruses, Bresee said. Norovirus, which causes diarrhea and vomiting, has also been circulating. Vaccination . Although the flu vaccine is far from perfect, it's the best prevention tool we have, Frieden said. You can still get it -- it's better late than never. The flu vaccine is about 62% effective, Frieden said. ""The 62% -- we'd love it to be better, but it is actually a substantial public health benefit for the population,"" Bresee said. Based on vaccine coverage surveys, 37% of Americans had been vaccinated by mid-November, CDC officials said. That's about on track with what was seen at this time last year. ""We have seen a lot of vaccination happening in the last couple of weeks,"" Bresee said. ""I don't know where we'll end up this year."" Vaccine manufacturers told CNN on Thursday that there is plenty of vaccine for those who want to get a flu shot. However, there are reports of spot shortages of the vaccine, Frieden said, so call your provider ahead of time if you still want to get the vaccine. ""You may have to check in several places to find the vaccine, because most of the more than 130 million doses that were produced by vaccine manufacturers this year have already been given,"" he said. Early flu season . The flu came early this season, and cases are more severe than last year, health officials say. Massachusetts is one state that the CDC had identified as having high activity of influenza-like illness based on the week ending December 29, but downgraded it to ""moderate"" activity in Friday's update. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino had declared a public health emergency in the city Wednesday because of the flu. Since October 1, there have been 700 confirmed influenza cases among Boston residents, according to Menino's office; that's 10 times more than were seen in all of last year's flu season. There have been 18 flu-related deaths this season in Massachusetts, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Hospitalization rates are higher than in the last two years, Kevin Cranston of the state's Bureau of Infectious Diseases told WCVB. Most deaths have been in older patients, he said. Menino is collaborating with the Boston Public Health Commission and community health centers to offer free vaccination clinics this weekend. The mayor urged residents to stay home from work or school if they are sick, and to get flu shots. ""This is the worst flu season we've seen since 2009, and people should take the threat of flu seriously,"" Menino said in a statement. More than 4% of emergency department visits at Boston hospitals are from flu cases, up from 1% during non-flu season. Massachusetts General Hospital has already counted 532 cases of flu among patients, which is more than the Boston hospital saw in any of the previous three flu seasons, spokeswoman Kristen Stanton said Wednesday. Signs posted throughout the hospital discourage anyone from visiting who has a cough or fever, she said, and anyone who does visit with those symptoms must wear a mask and perform hand hygiene. All staff must wear a mask when caring for possible flu patients, and staff members who have not been vaccinated must wear a mask while caring for any patient. As an extra precaution amid flu fears, Bishop Robert P. Deeley of Boston sent a note to all pastors in the Boston Archdiocese suggesting that during the Sign of Peace, ""the faithful, instead of a handshake, may bow to the persons nearby."" Similarly, in Washington, a note from the Archdiocese's communications office says that parishioners don't have to shake hands or receive communion from the chalice. ""Those who are sick may wish to watch the Sunday TV Mass on their television at home and pray in solidarity with their parish community,"" the statement said. Deaths in other states . The CDC only tracks pediatric flu-related deaths, but some individual states release reports of influenza deaths among adults. The Oklahoma Department of Health said Thursday the state has had eight influenza-linked deaths since September 30, while the Minnesota Department of Health has recorded 27 flu-related deaths. ""We are clearly at a high level of influenza activity in the state,"" Minnesota Health Commissioner Dr. Edward Ehlinger said in a statement. ""But it's important to keep this year in perspective: What is occurring has happened before."" The number of flu-related deaths elsewhere, according to state health officials: . -- Pennsylvania has had 22 deaths. Most of the deaths were among people older than 65. -- Indiana has 13 confirmed adult deaths and two pediatric deaths. -- Arkansas has seven confirmed flu fatalities. -- South Carolina has counted 22 deaths. -- In Illinois, there have been six deaths. -- In Michigan, there have been four pediatric deaths. Type of flu . The type of flu that is going around is called H3N2, which is often linked to more serious disease, compared with some other flu varieties, Fauci said. That type of flu matches up well to the vaccine that is being distributed and given out throughout the United States. People may get more complications from this particular strain of H3N2, ""which may make them ill for a longer period of time,"" Dr. Michael Jhung, medical epidemiologist in the influenza division at the CDC, told CNN's Mary Snow. Symptoms typically last up to seven days for a normal infection, he said. If you have the flu, how are you treating it? Send photos of your flu survival kits. CNN's Joe Sutton and Maggie Schneider contributed to this report.","California, Hawaii and Mississippi are the only states without widespread activity .

"(CNN) -- Miranda Lynch believes a vegetable garden has the power to revolutionize a community. It's the idea behind of Isipho, the nonprofit organization Lynch conceived when she was just 12 years old. It all started in 2008 when her father, Tom, won a trip to South Africa at an auction. The father-daughter adventure began with a stay on a wild game reserve in KwaZulu-Natal. Assuming it would be the only time he and his daughter would set foot in South Africa, Tom wanted Miranda to see more than the commercialized landscape of the reserve. ""It was important, as she was turning 13 that year, for her to see that the world that she knew was not the entire world,"" Tom says. So they drove through the foothills of the Drakensberg Mountains, about 10 miles past where the tar road ended and into a remote Zulu village, where they had arranged to stay with local family. Confronting reality in South Africa . On the side of a hill overlooking a sparse but picturesque valley sit a few hundred round mud huts that comprise the village of Inzinga. ""The thatched roofs just looked so pretty up on this hillside but as you get closer and closer you start to see the condition that they're in ... and as you get closer and closer you just see the poverty,"" Tom says. When the Lynches arrived they were greeted by their hosts, the three Zuma sisters, and immediately went to work chopping wood and helping prepare dinner. ""I was completely overwhelmed and I wanted to leave. That night I told my dad I just couldn't take it and I wanted to leave and I was crying,"" Miranda says. But they chose to stay. The next day, while Tom was helping the caregivers from a local crÃ¨che plant potatoes, Miranda stayed inside to play with the children. ""It was exactly like playing with kids here because 2- and 3-year-olds don't speak English well in the first place. They love the same things. They just want to play. They just want to have fun. They want to explore,"" Miranda says. ""I just connected with these 2- and 3-year-old babies."" During their five-day stay, Tom and Miranda attended a wedding, helped in the schools and worked side by side with women in the garden as they tilled the soil with old tree branches and metal scraps. ""When it was time to leave, I cried again, but this time it was because I didn't want to leave. I wanted to be able to come back. I didn't want to leave and not know what happened to my friends and family there,"" Miranda says. While waiting for their flight home, Miranda looked up at her father and with the bold naiveness of a preteen suggested they start a nonprofit to help the village and the children she had grown to love. ""Literally we were sitting in the airport about to come home, and we decided to name the nonprofit Isipho, which was my nickname in the village, which means gift,"" Miranda says. ""And we registered the domain name and called my mom and told her were doing this."" Growing vegetables and hope . The Lynches have returned to Inzinga every year since, working to break the cycle of poverty by planting school and family gardens. ""Poverty starts with the fact that people just aren't healthy because they don't have the right food to eat. Nobody's starving but they're malnourished,"" says Tom. The soil is fertile in Inzinga, but many people can neither afford the supplies nor have the knowledge to cultivate the land. With the help of a local site manager and the South African Department of Environmental Affairs, Isipho provides fencing, seeds, tools and training to families and schools in the community. As of this planting season, Isipho has helped start gardens at every crÃ¨che, primary school and secondary school in Inzinga. The organization has also helped create about 65 family gardens, and it wants to see that keep growing. ""There is a cooperative that is being formed there from people who were early adopters of our family and school gardens and who have had success and have wanted to do more,"" Tom says. The struggle for a sustainable food system in Inzinga is not unique. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the world has the ability to eliminate hunger yet nearly one in seven people suffers from undernourishment. On World Food Day, celebrated each year on October 16, the Food and Agriculture Organization is highlighting the way cooperatives can help small farmers like those in Inzinga, calling them the ""key to feeding the world."" ""This theme was chosen to highlight the many concrete ways in which agricultural cooperatives and producer organizations help to provide food security, generate employment and lift people out of poverty,"" says Food and Agriculture Organization Director-General JosÃ© Graziano da Silva in a statement. Join the fight against hunger . If you want to join the fight against hunger this World Food Day, there are many ways to get involved. Volunteer your time or make a donation to help Isipho provide fencing, seeds and know-how to the people of Inzinga, South Africa. The Lynch family says their hope is that Inzinga will become completely self-sustaining and a model for other villages in South Africa. Give a cow, a camel or a goat to a family in need through Heifer International's Gift Catalog. Heifer International provides animals and training to families and communities worldwide, which gives them a reliable source of food and the potential for extra income. Share a meal and start a conversation. Oxfam says one billion people go hungry not because of lack of food but a broken food system, so the organization is encouraging people to host a World Food Day Dinner and talk about ways to fix it starting at home. Find conversation starters on the Oxfam website. Watch a video and help the World Food Programme feed children around the world.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea has said that Typhoon Bolaven, a powerful tropical cyclone that pounded the Korean Peninsula last week, killed 48 people in the country and left more than 21,000 homeless. The storm also injured more than 50 people and destroyed tens of thousands of hectares of crops, according to a report published Monday evening by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The secretive, militaristic North Korean regime has repeatedly asked for food aid from international aid organizations as it struggles to feed its own people after suffering extensive famines during the 1990s. Employees from humanitarian groups that operate inside North Korea have described severe malnourishment on a large scale. A deal earlier this year for the United States to ship food aid to the country fell apart after the authoritarian regime in Pyongyang went ahead with a controversial rocket launch. North Korea already experienced widespread devastation in late July from heavy rains and flooding. KCNA said the extreme weather resulted in the deaths of at least 169 people and left more than 200,000 homeless. The United Nations World Food Program called it an emergency and organized for emergency food aid to be delivered. North Korea then took the unusual step of releasing footage of the devastated areas, showing houses submerged and farmlands destroyed. The damage caused by Bolaven last week has now added to the woes of the North Korean population. The storm also resulted in at least 15 deaths and widespread disruption in South Korea as it swept up the side of the Korean Peninsula. CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.","The storm destroyed tens of thousands of hectares of crops, North Korea says .

"(CNN) -- North Korea, reeling from a powerful tropical cyclone, will accept aid from South Korean government for the first time in two years, South Korea said Monday. The United Nations World Food Program called for emergency help for North Korea after cyclone Bolaven hit in August, killing at least 48 and leaving 21,000 homeless, according to North Korea's state news agency KCNA. Some media reported that the death toll could be higher. Typhoon tourism: One week in North Korea . The storm followed widespread flooding in late July from heavy rains, which caused the death of at least 169 people, according to KCNA. South Korea offered aid to North Korea through the Korean Red Cross last week. ""We got a reply back from North Korea this morning,"" requesting aid, said Park Soo-jin, deputy spokeswoman of South Korea's Unification Ministry. The two countries are still legally at war and relations between them are tense at the best of times. South Korea halted aid to the North after it shelled Yeongpyeong Island in November 2010, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. Pyongyang claimed it was retaliating for South Korean artillery landing in their waters during a military drill. This is not the first aid proposal by the South. Last year, Seoul offered Pyongyang aid in the form of instant noodles and biscuits, but the offer was rejected after the North called for rice and cement, according to Yonhap News Agency. The aid deal will be discussed via document exchanges through the neutral village of Panmunjom. North Korea agreed to accept food aid from a private agency, the Korea Peace Foundation, in January, South Korea's Unification Ministry said at the time.

"(CNN) -- Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar democratic freedom activist who spent 15 years under house arrest, accepted the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal on Wednesday. Suu Kyi called the ceremony one of the most moving days of her life. ""From the depths of my heart, I thank you, the people of America and you, their representatives,"" she said to the gathered members of Congress, ""for keeping us in your hearts and minds during the dark years when freedom and justice seemed beyond our reach."" Sen. John McCain was overcome with emotion when he, among other political heavyweights in Washington, praised Suu Kyi. McCain called Suu Kyi ""his personal hero."" ""They did all they could to break her,"" the Arizona Republican said of the military junta that detained her. McCain, who was a POW in Vietnam, choked up, his voice breaking. ""Aung San Suu Kyi didn't scare a damn,"" he told the crowd. McCain's comments were met with wild applause. Suu Kyi was kept for the better part of two decades under house arrest for advocating for democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma. The country's former military rulers ordered her detention, and in recent years her case has received an international spotlight. She paid a hefty personal price for standing up for freedom in Myanmar, which suffered under 50 years of autocratic, repressive rule. Suu Kyi, who was awarded the medal in 2008, was freed two years later and elected to the Myanmar parliament this year, a historic moment in the country. ""As I go forward with my countrymen and -women along the difficult path of building a truly democratic society where all our people can live together in peace -- remembering always that Burma is a nation of many ethnic nationalities and peoples -- we believe that we can go forward in unity and in peace, and give our friends the satisfaction of helping us get to ... a place where dreams are realized,"" she said in her acceptance speech. The 67-year-old activist-turned-politician is on a 17-day tour of the United States. Suu Kyi met with President Barack Obama later Wednesday. Obama ""expressed his admiration for her courage, determination and personal sacrifice in championing democracy and human rights over the years,"" the White House said in a statement following the meeting. He told Suu Kyi that the United States will continue to support the efforts of her and her party, in conjunction with the reformist Myanmar president, Thein Sein, to push for political and economic changes and ""to ensure full protection of the fundamental rights of the Burmese people,"" according to the statement. Over the next two weeks, Suu Kyi is scheduled to meet with other high-level American officials, as well as democratic activists. Also Wednesday, she met with U.S. Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, among others. At the start of her visit Tuesday, she met with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and made an address at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, during which she said she supported the further easing of U.S. economic sanctions on Myanmar. ""I do not think we should depend on U.S. sanctions to keep up the momentum of our movement for democracy,"" she said. ""We have got to work at it ourselves."" The U.S. Treasury Department, meanwhile, lifted sanctions Wednesday on Thein Sein and parliament member Thura Shwe Mann, allowing them do do business with Americans again. Also Wednesday, Clinton compared Suu Kyi with another famous political prisoner. She said she was reminded when she visited Suu Kyi during her house arrest that she saw similarities to Nelson Mandela. ""These two political prisoners were separated by great distances, but they were both marked by uncommon grace, generosity of spirit and unshakable will,"" Clinton said Wednesday. ""And they both understood something we all have to grasp. The day they walked out of prison, the day the house arrest was ended, was not the end of the struggle. It was the beginning of a new phase."" Under Thein Sein, the Myanmar government has released hundreds of political prisoners in the past year, part of a series of reforms that have followed decades of repressive military rule. Western governments have responded to the efforts by starting to ease sanctions put in place to pressure the military regime. Myanmar authorities have also engaged in peace talks with rebel ethnic groups and allowed Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, to successfully participate in special elections for the national parliament in April. Suu Kyi and others have nonetheless cautioned that progress toward greater freedoms in Myanmar remains embryonic and fragile. ""I think one of the important reasons for her visit at this time is to remind us of how much more still lies ahead, from strengthening the rule of law in democratic institutions to addressing the challenges in many of the ethnic conflicts and in Rakhine state,"" Clinton said Tuesday in an introduction to Suu Kyi's address. Communal violence between Buddhists and Muslims in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine this summer killed scores of people and displaced thousands of others. Human rights advocates have accused the authorities of cracking down particularly harshly on the Rohingya, a stateless ethnic Muslim minority, during the unrest. Suu Kyi's U.S. trip coincides with a visit to New York by Thein Sein to attend the U.N. General Assembly, where he will meet with Clinton. On Monday, the Myanmar government announced that it was releasing more than 500 prisoners as part of an amnesty. Suu Kyi said Tuesday that her party calculates that there were about 90 political prisoners among those released. Between 200 and 400 political prisoners remain behind bars in Myanmar, according to different estimates. Earlier this year, Suu Kyi visited Thailand, her first trip abroad since her release from house arrest, and then traveled to Europe, where she finally collected the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded in 1991. As part of her U.S. tour, she will visit Fort Wayne, Indiana, home to one of the United States' largest populations of Burmese expatriates. Since the early 1990s, about 5,000 Burmese have carved out a life there.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As potentially hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens prepare to take to the streets in a now-annual display of public disapproval of Beijing's interference in the city's affairs, voices in China's state-run press are warning that the protests are a bad idea. Every year, on the anniversary of the city's return to Chinese rule, pro-democracy protestors take part in huge, peaceful protests against what they see as the heavy-handed influence of the central government. Hong Kong is governed according to China's ""one country, two systems"" model, enjoying a high degree of autonomy in its government, judiciary, and legal systems under a leadership approved by Beijing. Organizers are hoping that this year's march may see a particularly large turnout, following an unofficial referendum -- held by activist group Occupy Central -- that ended on June 29 with a total of nearly 800,000 ballots cast in support of free elections for the city's next leader. The figure represents about 22% of registered voters in Hong Kong, out of a total of 3.5 million registered voters. As well as the march, which begins in the city's Victoria Park and ends in the Central business district, this year will see an overnight sit-in, which has been planned for after the march. The Federation of Students and Scholarism will camp overnight on Chater Road, the city's business heart, as well as outside the government offices in the Admiralty district of downtown Hong Kong, until Wednesday morning. State response . The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council emphasized on Monday that the referendum is ""illegal and invalid."" The following day the Chinese edition of the Global Times, a state-run publication known for its uncompromising op-eds, published an editorial warning that recent pro-democracy activities -- including the referendum, as well as the upcoming rally and sit-in, are polarising Hong Kong society. The article urges Hong Kong people not to be ""kidnapped"" by the radical opposition. Another state mouthpiece, the English-language China Daily, points out in an article that political forces calling for full autonomy in Hong Kong are ignoring economic realities. ""Without the mainland, (Hong Kong) would be left with only half of its trade, one-fourth of its foreign investment and visitors, not to mention only one-tenth of its water and food supply,"" the piece says. The Global Times also reports that it polled 1,434 people in major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai, and found that 77% of respondents think Hong Kong's future should be jointly decided by the entire population of China, and 82% polled said that they would support the government to take strong moves to maintain stability should riots in Hong Kong occur. Microbloggers react . Weibo, China's microblogging platform, showed a more diverse range of opinions on Hong Kong's recent pro-democracy activities, with users in the the mainland, with positions ranging from support to scathing criticism of Hong Kong's political aspirations. ""Hong Kong people know where their interest lies in and they don't need your (Global Times) phony kindness,"" said user @lddldd0000. ""Hong Kong stand up!"" The view was echoed by @Pianyezhiqiu, who posted: ""Residents in Hong Kong have political ideals. They're not like the puppets who only chase after benefits."" However, not all netizens were as tolerant of Hong Kong's political experiments. ""The 'referendum,' 'occupy central,' such and such are against the Basic Law, and therefore, the acts are invalid and illegal,"" said @ htkg2011. User @Mingweizhe was a little more phlegmatic. ""Let's ignore them. Let Hong Kong people handle their own business.""","Hong Kong prepares for a potentially huge protest against Chinese political interference .
