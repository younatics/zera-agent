"Islamic State (IS) has published a shocking guidebook for its fighters on how to rape slave girls – even if they have not reached puberty. The Arabic manual, titled Questions And Answers On Taking Captives And Slaves, instructs IS fighters on how to buy and sell women and girls who have been captured in war as booty. The document, published by the Research and Fatwa Department of IS, gives its fighters the green light to turn captured women into slaves and concubines, and even give them as gifts to one another. Scroll down for video . ISIS fighters have taken thousands of women and children as captives, especially around 2,500 women from the minority Yazidi sect in Iraq (pictured) It was circulated on the Twitter accounts of senior IS leaders and on Friday was distributed by masked IS fighters outside a large mosque in Iraq’s second city Mosul, which is controlled by the group. The document has been obtained by the Washington-based Middle East Media Research Institute and translated into English. British terrorism experts, who have studied the document, have concluded it is genuine. They have condemned the manual – which answers questions dealing with sex with slave girls, their status as the master’s property, and how to beat them – as ‘disgusting’, saying it harks ‘back to the Dark Ages’. In the guide, one question asks: ‘Is it permissible to have intercourse with a female slave who has not reached puberty?’ The response is: ‘It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn’t reached puberty if she is fit for intercourse.’ The Arabic manual (pictured), entitled Questions And Answers On Taking Captives And Slaves, instructs ISIS fighters on how to buy and sell women and girls who have been captured in war as booty . A tweet by one of the group's leaders in answer to the question:  'Is it permissible to have intercourse with a female slave who has not reached puberty?' Another asks: ‘Is it permissible to sell a female captive?’ The response is: ‘It is permissible to buy, sell, or give as a gift female captives and slaves, for they are merely property, which can be disposed of.’ The document says that all ‘unbelieving’ women, including Jews and Christians, can be taken as captives and sold as slaves. However, it prohibits the enslavement of Muslim women, even if they have become apostates. The pamphlet allows masters to beat their female slaves, but only as a disciplinary measure, and not as a source of gratification. The master is also forbidden from beating his slave-girl on the face. Haras Rafiq, an expert at British counter-terrorism think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, said: ‘It is a sick and disgusting document, and it takes the world back to the Dark Ages. 'There is no place for slavery in the modern world. There have been widespread reports of IS fighters raping female captives, which has now become part of the anti-IS propaganda. 'This document may be a way to regulate the behaviours of these fighters.’ IS fighters have taken thousands of women and children as captives, especially around 2,500 women from the minority Yazidi sect in Iraq. A UN report last month said these women were then taken as far as Raqqa in Syria and sold to IS fighters, or given as gifts to their leaders. Some of them, it claims, were then used for sex.","Manual entitled 'Questions And Answers On Taking Captives And Slaves'

"Terrorist organisation Islamic State is now under attack from guerrillas itself, it was revealed today, . Small groups of Syrians are hunting down ISIS fighters in one of their main strongholds in eastern Syria in a new guerrilla campaign that has emerged as a response to the Islamists' growing brutality. The main aim is to generate fear in ISIS’s ranks, said the head of ‘White Shroud’ - a group that says it has killed more than 100 of the militants' fighters in attacks in Deir al-Zor province in recent months. Scroll down for video . Stealth tactics: A guerrilla fighter moves inside a damaged house in the Syrian province of Deir al-Zor. Groups of Syrians are now hunting down ISIS militants in response to the terror group's growing brutality (file image) Warzone: Black smoke rises after airstrikes against ISIS members in Ayn al-Arab (Kobane) northern Syria . As the US advances plans to train and equip the moderate opposition to President Bashar al-Assad as part of its strategy to tackle ISIS, these groups shows how there are new enemies on the ground. White Shroud is a reference to the death shroud it says awaits ISIS fighters responsible for crimes against the Syrian people, according to the group leader, who gives his name as Abu Aboud. Mr Aboud - not his real name - was a commander in an anti-Assad insurgent group crushed by the better armed and financed ISIS as it seized almost full control of Deir al-Zor earlier this year. The small band he now leads is in no position to deal a major blow to ISIS. But it does pose an extra challenge as the U.S. and its allies target the group in air strikes in both Syria and Iraq. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the war, has recorded a rising number of attacks by gunmen on ISIS targets in Deir al-Zor province. Together with Raqqa province further north, Deir al-Zor forms the bedrock of ISIS’s influence in Syria. Turkish soldiers hold their position on a tank as they watch Kobani from near the Mursitpinar border crossing . White Shroud shows no mercy to ISIS: when it manages to abduct one of its members, it is only to ‘liquidate’ him later on, said Mr Abou. It operates in and around the town of Al Bukamal at the Iraqi border, an area of crucial importance to ISIS as the link between the territory it controls in Syria and Iraq. The group currently numbers 300 members, said Mr Aboud. He added: ‘Eighty per cent of the members of White Shroud did not take part in combat before (ISIS) came. We trained them and they joined White Shroud because of the great oppression they felt after Islamic State took control.’ The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says White Shroud is one of several small groups that have taken up arms against ISIS in Deir al-Zor province in recent months and are picking off ISIS fighters whenever they get the chance. They have all taken similarly menacing names. These include the ‘Phantom Brigade’ and ‘The Brigade of the Angel of Death’, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Observatory, which says it gathers information from sources on all sides of the conflict. Smoke rises after a strike in Kobani, Syria, while fighting continues between Syrian Kurds and ISIS militants . One such group killed no fewer than 10 ISIS fighters in a nighttime gun attack on a checkpoint in the town of Al Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province last Thursday, the Observatory reported. In a separate attack, a gunman on a motor bike opened fire on another ISIS checkpoint. ‘There is an increase in their operations against Islamic State,’ Mr Abdulrahman said. ISIS has made plenty of enemies during its conquest of Deir al-Zor, an oil-producing region. It expelled most other insurgent groups from Deir al-Zor in July, emboldened by rapid gains in Iraq where it seized the city of Mosul in June, capturing with it Iraqi army equipment that has been deployed in Syria. Mirroring its approach elsewhere, ISIS has used crucifixions and decapitations to suppress all opposition in Deir al-Zor. It executed 700 members of one rebellious tribe, the Sheitaat, in August, the Observatory reported. Members of anti-Assad armed groups loosely referred to as the ‘Free Syrian Army’ had the choice of fleeing, submitting to ISIS rule, or death. The Turkish military and the fled residents of Kobani, on the Syrian border to Turkey's Suruc, watch the battle . The Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's official affiliate in Deir al-Zor, withdrew from the province. The Syrian government still controls a portion of Deir al-Zor city and its airport. ‘Secrecy is the most important element of White Shroud's work,’ said Mr Aboud. The group comprises four-man ‘cells’ that work independently of each other, he added. One of White Shroud's biggest operations was an attack on an ISIS position in Al Bukamal in which around 11 ISIS fighters were killed, according to the Observatory and Mr Aboud. The U.S.-led air strikes are not making White Shroud's job easier, said Mr Aboud. Where ISIS fighters once used to gather in large numbers, they now move in small groups, often at night, using motor bikes. White Shroud's spokesman said the group is using weapons that formerly belonged to anti-Assad rebel groups. The spokesman, who gave his name as Abu Ali Albukamali, claimed that despite its modest resources, White Shroud had achieved its goal. He said: ‘The aim of this group - spreading fear among Islamic State members - has been realised. Today, you never meet them walking alone. They mostly move in groups, afraid of abduction.’","Small groups of Syrians are hunting down ISIS fighters in Syrian stronghold .

"MI5 and Scotland Yard, aided by GCHQ, have identified Jihadi John, the British man believed to have carried out the beheadings of two American journalists and British aid worker David Haines . David Cameron has signalled he is ready to dispatch Special Forces into Syria if it will bring Islamist executioner ‘Jihadi John’ to justice. The Prime Minister made clear he would not necessarily wait for MPs’ approval before giving the order – if there was a chance of catching the masked killer with the British accent who appears in IS beheading videos. Mr Cameron said: ‘In order to catch Jihadi John, you have to know where he is, right? We know he is in Syria. 'I very clearly reserve the position that if you need to act immediately, either to secure a vital British interest or to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, you would act first and go to the House of Commons afterwards.’ British intelligence and security agencies are working closely with the FBI and CIA to find Jihadi John and his group of kidnappers in what is now a high-profile murder and counter-terrorism investigation. MI5 and Scotland Yard, aided by GCHQ communication monitoring, have identified the British man believed to have carried out the beheadings of two American journalists and British aid worker David Haines. This information has been shared with a team of more than a dozen US investigators from an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, from the US agency’s counter-terrorism command, who are reported to have flown to the UK in the past few weeks. As The Mail on Sunday revealed last week, the jihadi nicknamed ‘John’ by the hostages he was holding – because he and the other British jihadis were known as The Beatles – is understood to come from a suburb of South London. It is believed his family members have been interviewed by Met officers and an FBI agent. Meanwhile, teams from MI6 and CIA have deployed field officers in Northern Syria to help pinpoint the exact location of the group of kidnappers. These teams have picked up valuable intelligence gathered by their agents operating within IS ranks. The US Senate has offered a £6million reward for any information that will lead to the capture of ‘John’. But IS supporters are attempting to impose a social media blackout in a bid to frustrate US and British investigators and bombing missions. Scroll down for video . A message sent by the terrorist group yesterday warned its fighters and supporters from using Twitter, Facebook and other social media over fears they were giving away its forces’ positions. IS fighters are engaged in a number of key battles in Syria and Iraq where they are being targeted by Coalition strike aircraft. The message, distributed on Twitter by IS’s media arm using the hashtag Blackout Campaign, said the blackout was to be imposed immediately and that anyone who breached it will be ‘exposed and disgraced’. David Cameron has said he will send in SAS troops to Syria before asking the permission of Parliament if such a move would secure a vital British interest or prevent a humanitarian catastrophe . Another IS member explained: ‘Do you know that a simple piece of information you type here [can] lead to abort the mission or the Mujahideen killed.’ This week a group of anti IS activists from the IS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria reported a new crackdown on anyone using cameras or social media. The group, called Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, claim that IS police had taken control of the city and ‘look for anyone who takes pictures or videos of the city so they can arrest and execute him’. Throughout the bombing campaign the reign of terror inside the city has continued with crucifixions, beheadings and punishments carried out in the main square. Last night it was reported that a father of two was tortured to death over spying claims.","PM said he would send troops into Syrian without MPs' approval if needed .

"A teenage call girl said to have illegally slept with two of the highest paid stars in European football ‘no longer considers herself a victim’, a criminal court heard today. Zahia Dehar was just 16 when she allegedly started accepting cash from a range of famous players, including Frenchmen Franck Ribery, 30, and Karim Benzema, 26. Both men – whose combined wages amount to some 17 million pounds a year - face up to three years in prison if they are found guilty of having sex with an underage prostitute. Scroll down for video . On trial: French internationals Franck Ribery, 30, and Karim Benzema, 26, deny knowingly paying for sex with Zahia Dehar when she was under 18 . Famous face: Ms Dehar, now 20, has become one of the most famous names in France since the players were first arrested, building up a career as a fashion icon, reality TV star, and the muse of designer Karl Lagerfeld . But, as the opening of their Paris trial, Ribery’s defence lawyer said Dehar had withdrawn her status as a civil plaintiff, and conceded that neither men knew how old she was. Referring to Dehar, barrister Carlo Alberto Brusa said she was ‘no longer the victim and no longer considers herself one, and she is out of the trial.’ He added that even ‘the prosecutor has recommended that the case be dismissed. In consequence, we have a trial without accusations. Ms Dehar, now 20, has become one of the most famous names in France since the players were first arrested, building up a career as a reality TV star, and the muse of fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld.

Neither Dehar, nor the footballers, were in court today, instead leaving the process to their lawyers. Paying for sex is legal in France, but only if all parties involved are more than 18 years old. The age of consent in the country is 15. The maximum sentence for sleeping with an underage prostitute is three years in prison, and a fine of around 40,000 pounds. Both footballers deny the charge.

The 'Birthday Treat': Ms Dehar was 17 when she was paid in 2009 to fly from Paris to Munich, where Ribery plays for European Champions Bayern Munich, to sleep with him as a 26th 'birthday treat' Hoodwinked? Carlo Alberto Brusa, Ribery's lawyer, said his client did not know how old Ms Dehar was at the time. Ribery is pictured holding the FIFA Club World Cup after winning it with German side Bayern Munich . He admits having sex with her, but said the cash he gave her – the equivalent of some 650 pounds – was solely for travel, food and a hotel. Mr Dehar is known to have lied about her age to all the footballers she slept with, including Real Madrid forward Benzema, said Mr Brusa. Benzema is alleged to have paid Ms Dehar just over 400 pounds to sleep with her after the French Union of Professional Footballers' awards in May 2008, when she was 16. Sylvain Cormier, for Benzema, said his client denied this claim, adding: ‘From the outset, Karim Benzema has said that nothing happened.’ Daniel Vaconsin, Ms Dehar’s barrister, confirmed she had withdrawn as a civil plaintiff in the case, so will not be seeking damages. ‘She is not asking for anything,’ he said. Highly paid: Franck Ribery, left, and Karim Benzema earn some £17million a year between them . Ribery's brother-in-law is also charged with soliciting a minor for sex, and five other accused face maximum prison terms of 10 years on charges relating to the case, including ‘aggravated pimping’. Ms Dehar is said to have picked up celebrity sportsmen at the Zaman Cafe off the Champs Elysee in Paris. The nightspot, which has now been shut down, was always full of pimps and prostitutes, according to prosecutors’ files. Ribery and Benzema both helped France qualify for the World Cup finals in Brazil this summer, and are hoping to stay out of jail so they can play in the contest.

"EastEnders actress Linda Henry is due to stand trial over allegations she hurled racially aggravated abuse during a row outside a Jamie Oliver restaurant in London. The 51-year-old, who plays barmaid Shirley Carter in the BBC soap, faces trial after pleading not guilty to a charge of racially aggravated harassment at Bexley Magistrates' Court. The charge is in connection with an incident outside Jamie's Italian in Greenwich on September 14. Scroll down for video . Court case: Actress Linda Henry, 51, denies allegations she hurled racial abuse outside a London restaurant . Alleged dispute: The star is accused of hurling abuse during a row outside Jamie's Italian in Greenwich . She is accused of using threatening or abusive words which was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and the alleged offence was racially aggravated, a court official said. Henry, who has appeared in the BBC One soap since 2006, has vowed to fight 'tooth and nail' to clear her name when the case goes to court next year. She reportedly chose not to attend the court hearing in south London on Wednesday, and instead pleaded not guilty via her lawyer. A spokesman for the star told MailOnline today: 'She will be defending the allegation.' A source added to The Sun: 'Linda is horrified at the accusation and intends to fight it tooth and nail. 'Those close to her know the truth and the type of person she is. 'She has never been in trouble before.' Stunned: The 51-year-old actress is reportedly shocked at the allegation and vows to fight it 'tooth and nail' Henry, whose case is being heard under her married name Virilis, is due to stand trial on February 11 next year. The manager of the restaurant has insisted none of his staff were involved in the alleged dispute. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Linda Valiris, 51, an actress, of south-east London, was summonsed to appear at Bexley Magistrates' Court on November 26 charged with a racially aggravated public order offence. 'The next court appearance is scheduled to take place at the same court on February 11. 'This follows an incident in Greenwich on September 14.' A BBC spokesman said the broadcaster will not be commenting on the allegations faced by Henry. Aside from the court hearing, the actress has had a big month on EastEnders as her alter-ego Shirley returned to screens for the first time since Phil Mitchell's wedding. The Carter family is set to be rocked forever by a series of shock revelations including the news that Shirley is in fact Mick's (Danny Dyer) mother. Shirley had vanished after shooting Phil on his big day, but was eventually discovered hiding in an old family caravan. Big year: Linda's character Shirley was involved in some of the BBC One soap's most dramatic storylines . Brought up in Peckham, south east London, Henry started acting as a teenager and studied at leading London drama school The Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. Before appearing in EastEnders, Henry was best known for her role in ITV prison drama Bad Girls, where she played Yvonne Atkins - G Wing's 'top dog' who was jailed for hiring a hit-man to kill a business rival of her gangster husband. She appeared in the role between 1999 and 2003. She has also appeared in crime dramas The Bill, Touching Evil, Cracker, A Touch Of Frost and Trial & Retribution, as well as comedy series Birds of a Feather. Mother-of-one Henry, who married husband Stavros Virilis in 1992, has been nominated for several awards for her portrayal of Shirley, who the actress has described as a 'strong proud woman'. The BBC is yet to comment on whether Henry will be suspended from the show. However, it is understood that she will continue filming EastEnders until her trial date. Earlier this year Ricky Norwood, who plays was Arthur 'Fatboy' Chubb, was suspended from the soap for two months after an online video emerged of him apparently smoking cannabis. In May it emerged that Khali Best, known to viewers as mechanic Dexter Hartman, had been suspended for three months over a dispute with a London taxi driver, who said he was punched in the face and his vehicle doors kicked. Best accepted a police caution for common assault and criminal damage. It was announced last week that he will be leaving the show in the run up to Christmas.

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria are seeking medical attention to improve their sexual prowess and subjecting their wives to 'brutal, abnormal' sex acts, according to local doctors. In an interview with activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, who are based in the terror group's de facto capital, doctors anonymously revealed details of the jihadis' warped sex drives. Despite their claim to be ultra-conservative Islamic extremists, many of the militants are spending part of their monthly salary on kinky underwear for their wives and for the hundreds of young women and children they kidnapped and now keep or sell as sex slaves. Scroll down for video . 'Abnormal': Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria are seeking medical attention to improve their sexual prowess and subjecting their wives to 'brutal, abnormal' sex acts, according to local doctors . Kinky: Despite their claim to be ultra-conservative Islamic extremists, many of the militants (such as notorious commander Abu Wahib, pictured) are said buying 'strange' underwear for their wives . Details of the Sunni extremists' twisted sexual appetites emerged in a report by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently into the terror group's brutally oppressive treatment of women. 'A large section of ISIS members suffer from sexual anomalies and brutal instinctive desire for sex,' the report reads. It goes on to list the key reasons young women and girls particularly fear the militants' vehement sexual advances, stating that many females are too terrified to leave their homes due to the fighters' threats to subject them to 'sexual practices of a brutal and abnormal manner'. Other so-called 'perversions' detailed in the report include ISIS fighters 'buying strange underwear for their women, desperately searching for 'blue pills in order to increase their strength to have more sex', and medical reports detailing injuries sustained by women due to the fighters' violent sex acts. The activists also claim that the fighters take numerous wives to satisfy their demand for sex, and spend large amounts of time searching for 'sabaya' - kidnapped women and children, some of them as young as nine, who have been sold into sex slavery. The near constant threat of rape and sexual assault has forced many of the women in Raqqa to fear walking the streets. 'The houses became their current tombs, because of fear from falling into the arms of the soldiers of the Caliph,' the report states. Brutal: Local activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently claims ISIS' first act on seizing control of the city last year was to 'crack down on women' and to launch a 'vigorous search by ISIS fighters for wives' Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently's report in to the militants' treatment of women focuses on the terrorists forcing local females into marriage. It claims that the group's first act upon completely seizing control of Raqqa last year was to 'crack down on women' and to launch a 'vigorous search by ISIS fighters for wives'. The reasons for the local marriages are three fold, the report says - firstly to tie the mostly foreign terrorists to local families, and secondly to bind the militants to the local area - giving them familial responsibilities that mean they are unlikely to desert or defect from the Islamic State. The report says the militants have broken local rural customs, which traditionally saw young men and women marrying cousins or other relatives in order retain their family bonds. With ISIS fighters demanding the local women marry them instead, the local women are said to have been left utterly miserable, and in some cases suicidal. The militants are understood to pay a dowry of between £2,000 and £5,000 for each marriage, depending on whether the marriage is to a woman from the city or the surrounding countryside. Oppressed: Details of the Sunni extremists' twisted sexual appetites emerged in a report by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently into the terror group's brutally oppressive treatment of women . As part of their so-called 'crack down' on women after seizing control of Raqqa, ISIS fighters demanded all women completely cover their body in public - including their hands; insisted women only venture outdoors when accompanied by a close relative, and prevented any woman older than 50 leaving the house, except in medical emergencies. They also closed any centres of education catering to women, demanded women are surrounded by close female relatives if they are working, and relentlessly harassed those seen outdoors alone. To force local families to effectively 'sell' their daughters to a jihadi husband, the militants took advantage of the poverty sweeping Raqqa to offer high dowries and welfare payments. They also offered male relatives of the forced brides prominent jobs both within the terror group and the local area, in order to win the albeit reluctant support of the local citizens. According to Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, ISIS even spread rumours that unmarried women were being kidnapped and never seen again - a rumour that encouraged young females into getting married out of fear for their safety if they chose to remain single. The activists say that ISIS' barbaric treatment of the local female population has seen women risking their lives by trying desperately to escape their marriages. If they are later discovered, as many of them are, the women are either stoned to death as apostates or adulterers.","Local physicians claim ISIS militants in Raqqa have 'brutal' sex drives .

"Claims: Cypriot president Nikos Anastasiades 'warned' close friends of the financial crisis about to engulf his country' Cypriot president Nikos Anastasiades 'warned' close friends of the financial crisis about to engulf his country so they could move their money abroad, it was claimed on Friday. The respected Cypriot newspaper Filelftheros made the allegation which was picked up eagerly by German media. Germans are angry at the way their country has been linked to the Nazis and Hitler by Cypriots angry at the defunct rescue deal which called for a levy on all savings. The Cyprus newspaper did not say how much money was moved abroad but quoted sources saying the president 'knew about the possible closure of the banks' and tipped off close friends who were able to move vast sums abroad. Italian media said the 4.5 billion euros left the island in the week before the crisis. Meanwhile sources close to the 'troika' - the IMF, ECB and EU Commission responsible for trying to create a viable rescue deal before Monday - said that attempts to put together a 'plan B' rescue package had failed. 'The coming hours will determine the country's future,' a government spokesman in Nicosia said. Nearly a full week after the European Union agreed to a €10 billion rescue for the island country of one million people the Cypriot parliament still hasn't approved any new deal. Nicosia hoped to raise its €5.8 billion share of the bailout through a fund based on a portfolio of government assets. Early Friday afternoon, Greek TV station Skai-TV and the newspaper Ta Nea reported the troika has rejected the proposal following a meeting with president Anastasiades. Troika officials reportedly told the leader it was unlikely the country could raise the funding shortfull with the plan.

At the same time, she added: 'We want . Cyprus to remain in the euro zone.' She also said that she hopes the . situation in Cyprus doesn't lead to a 'crash'.

Laiki Bank, which has three UK branches is not covered by the FSA . compensation scheme, unlike Bank of Cyprus, meaning their customers . could be hit by the bank restructures. Meanwhile Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras announced that a Greek banking group had begun acquiring the Greek units of Cypriot banks - this would safeguard all the deposits of Greek citizens in Cypriot banks.

Cyprus . has until Monday to secure a deal after the European Central Bank . warned it would stop providing the country's banks with liquidity on . that day if no package is agreed. Russian depositors have huge sums in Cyprus’s banks, which critics say have become a haven for tax evasion and money laundering. A . poll for a Cypriot TV station showed that 67.3 per cent say the country . should leave the euro and tighten relations with Russia, which is . desperate to regain influence in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle . East. As extra police were drafted in to . control angry crowds outside the parliament in Nicosia, protesters . brandished placards reading ‘No to Fourth Reich’ and ‘Better die on your . feet than live on your knees’. The . Bank of Cyprus, the country’s biggest bank, warned the island needed a . ‘liquidity lifeline’ which would make the difference between ‘salvation . or destruction’. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev last night turned on Europe and accused EU countries of deliberately trying to wreck the Cypriot banking system for their own benefit . Cyprus . Popular Bank announced limit on ATM withdrawals of 260 euros per . customer. Banks, which have been shut all week to prevent mass . withdrawals, are to stay closed until Tuesday. Eurozone . finance officials acknowledged being ‘in a mess’, and discussed . imposing capital controls to insulate the region from a possible Cypriot . collapse. One described emotions as running ‘very high’ and referred to . ‘open talk’ of Cyprus leaving the eurozone. In an unprecedented snub, Cyprus decided not to take part in a conference call with EU leaders. ‘If Cyprus does not even feel that they can attend the call it is a big problem for us,’ one French representative said. It . is thought that Cyprus’s ‘Plan B’ to avoid bankruptcy will mean . depositors with account balances in excess of 100,000 euros would be hit . hard. Cyprus Popular Bank and the Bank of Cyprus would be split to . create a ‘bad bank’. Insured . deposits – below the EU ceiling of 100,000 euros, supposedly guaranteed . in the event of a bank collapse – would go into a ‘good bank’ and not . sustain losses, while uninsured deposits would go into the bad bank and . be frozen until assets could be sold. Losses to depositors could reach . 40 per cent. John Cridland, director-general . of the Confederation of British Industry, said last night that the . proposal for a levy on bank deposits in Cyprus had ‘created a real mess’ and ‘undermined the confidence of ordinary depositors’. He . added: ‘The events are a stark reminder that not only has the eurozone . crisis not gone away but also how much Europe and the eurozone countries . in particular, are going through a period of rapid transformation.’ Asked . if the bailout row would sour relations between Moscow and the EU, . Sergei Aleksashenko, a former bank governor and now an economist at .

"When Txiki Begiristain made his way out of the draw hall in Nyon, Manchester City’s director of football wondered out loud why he bothered to make the short hop to Switzerland. For Manuel Pellegrini’s team to go deep into the Champions League, City must overcome one of the most feared forward lines in the history of the game. Again. They were beaten, well beaten as it happens, over two legs by the brilliance of Lionel Messi and his Barcelona team at this stage of the competition last season. Paris Saint-Germain vs Chelsea . Manchester City vs Barcelona . Bayer Leverkusen vs Atletico Madrid . Juventus vs Borussia Dortmund . Schalke 04 vs Real Madrid . Shakhtar Donetsk vs Bayern Munich . Arsenal vs Monaco . Basle vs Porto . First legs to be played on February 17/18 and 24/25. Second legs on March 10/11 and 17/18. The Champions League trophy on display at the last 16 draw in Nyon, Switzerland on Monday . UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino pulls Manchester City out of the pot during the last 16 draw . Lionel Messi flicks the ball past Man City goalkeeper Joe Hart to score for Barcelona in last season's tie . ‘It’s unbelievable,’ admitted Begiristain, who left his position as director of football at the Nou Camp to join City in 2012. ‘We don’t need to come to the draw because it’s the same every time. We faced Bayern Munich and CSKA Moscow in the group phase and now we have to deal with Barcelona again, like last season.’ This time there is an added twist, the first time English football has seen Luis Suarez since the forward quit Liverpool in the summer for £75million. It is dreamy stuff and the presence of Suarez, who scored 31 times for Liverpool in their battle with City for last season’s Barclays Premier League, guarantees an edge to the two fixtures. Suarez has got off to a slow start at the Nou Camp following his ban for sinking his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but had great success in England and he will be a real danger. Yaya Toure and Vincent Kompany look dejected after Barcelona score in last season's first leg at the Etihad . The draw has thrown up some intriguing clashes and Arsenal will fancy their chances of progressing to the next phase after successfully avoiding one of the giants of European football. Monaco is where Arsene Wenger really got going as a coach, winning the French league in 1988 and he will return to the Stade Louis II to face his former club. City are certainly going about it the hard way in Europe after Sergio Aguero’s remarkable hat-trick against Bayern Munich and their dramatic win in Rome. They will play at the Etihad first and then travel to the Nou Camp to face Luis Enrique’s side. That tie is three weeks later as the last-16 draw is so strung out. MANCHESTER CITY VS BARCELONA . February 18, 2014 Last 16, first leg - Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 . March 12, 2014 Last 16, second leg - Barcelona 2 Manchester City 1 . PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN VS CHELSEA .

No previous competitive meetings . A screen in the hall at UEFA headquarters in Nyon shows the results of the last 16 draw . The draw has not been kind to City, but the bigwigs expected as much after finishing runners-up to Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich. Still, they are facing a side which has been beaten twice in La Liga this season and are trailing Real Madrid in the table by four points. Despite the brilliance of Messi and the improving Neymar, they do not have the allure of the 2006, 2009 or 2011 European Cup-winning teams. On a good day, City can beat them. Finishing second in the group makes it a tougher tournament to win, but both of Jose Mourinho’s successes in the Champions League came when he finished as a runner-up. His Chelsea team coasted through their group this season and the reward is another clash with Paris Saint-Germain. It means a return to Stamford Bridge for David Luiz, the man once described by England coach Gary Neville as a ‘PlayStation footballer’. Luiz, a member of Chelsea’s Champions League-winning team under Roberto di Matteo in 2012, was sold by Mourinho in May for a staggering £50m. Demba Ba celebrates after scoring during last season's Chelsea vs PSG match at Stamford Bridge . Although his relationship with Mourinho deteriorated in his final months at Stamford Bridge, the Brazil defender is guaranteed a warm reception when he returns to London. This is the draw Mourinho claimed he wanted when his team finished top of Group G with a comfortable 3-1 victory over Sporting Lisbon last week. PSG were beaten 3-1 in their final group game when the holy trinity — Messi, Neymar and Suarez — scored for Barcelona in the Nou Camp last week. Laurent Blanc’s French champions are struggling to find their rhythm and were beaten 1-0 by lowly Guingamp at the weekend. He will do well to still be in a job when they face Chelsea. Last season Chelsea were well-beaten in Paris, prompting Mourinho to shake hands with the entire PSG bench after Javier Pastore’s injury time goal made it 3-1. 13/5 Bayern Munich . 11/4 Real Madrid . 6/1 Barcelona . 7/1 Chelsea . 14/1 Man City . 18/1 Atletico Madrid . 22/1 Arsenal . 25/1 PSG . 28/1 Borussia Dortmund, Juventus . 50/1 Porto . 100/1 Bayer Leverkusen . 125/1 Monaco, Basle . 200/1 Shakhtar Donetsk . 250/1 Schalke . Six days later, when Chelsea got them back to the Bridge, Mourinho took off on a memorable touchline dash after substitute Demba Ba put them through on away goals with an 87th-minute strike. They were beaten in the semi-final by Atletico Madrid, but the latter stages of this tournament are the target for all three English teams. Arsenal, who finished second in their group behind Borussia Dortmund, have a decent chance of making progress. Monaco rely on the creaking bones of former Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho and then there is the enigma that is the former Manchester United forward Dimitar Berbatov up front. There was a touch of romance and more than a hint of pragmatism when Wenger asked for the Champions League gods to pit his recovering Arsenal side against his former club. He got his wish, but now they have to find a way through. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will come up against his former club Monaco in the round of 16 .

"It is known simply as the ‘Gateway to Jihad’. This is the wide open stretch of rugged Turkish border where an average of seven Britons a week are crossing over to Syria and Iraq. It is the same route used by the Cardiff trio who appeared on a jihad recruitment video, a one-time rapper, a computer hacker and one-time privately educated college boy – all of whom are now at the centre of British investigations as they boast on Twitter of their exploits. As the Mail witnessed, it is an alarmingly easy route to terror where border guards can turn a blind eye for as little as ten US dollars and an estimated 20 foreign recruits are travelling each day. Scroll down for video . The wide open stretch of rugged Turkish border where an average of seven Britons a week are crossing over to Syria and Iraq. The route is now dubbed the 'Jihad Express' or 'Gateway to Jihad' Smugglers and jihadists are able to breach the border seemingly at will with border guards turning a blind eye for 10 US dollars. An estimated 20 foreign recruits are travelling each day . One shopkeeper in Reyhanli, Turkey, said one bearded man walked in waving $50,000 (£30,000) in bundles of cash and bought a thousand 'magazine vests' for carrying spare AK47 rifle ammunition clips . Up to 1,000 Britons and UK residents have now joined the extremists spreading terror across Syria and Iraq – more than double as many as the Government admits, according to security sources. Disturbingly, intelligence agencies believe that the number of UK recruits travelling through this alarmingly open ‘gateway’ to IS strongholds of northern Syria is increasing since the self-proclaimed creation of a caliphate stretching from Syria to Iraq. It is no coincidence that virtually all the young radicalised Britons have joined up by crossing this porous, poorly policed Turkish border of mountain passes and plains without confronting security. The route is now dubbed the ‘Jihad Express’ or ‘Gateway to Jihad’. And crucially, it is from this border that up to 250 battle-hardened fighters are thought to have crossed on their return to the UK, posing a huge threat to those in the UK and a massive headache for the security services and police. The all-too-easy journey taken by home-grown fanatics from the UK to the increasingly barbaric civil war begins with them arriving in Turkey disguised often as British tourists enjoying a holiday. The frontier town Reyhanli, a bombed-out staging post for hundreds of fighters, where shop owner Abu Saleh said European jihadis buy hunting knives, sniper rifle sights, binoculars and desert camouflage fatigues before their journey across the border .

The well used track in the foreground leads to a river crossing and Syria beyond. At sunset, jihadis slip into Syria along the dusty trail, without ever encountering a border official . Like many of their fellow fighters, the three Cardiff school friends – gap-year student Nasser Muthana, 20, his brother Aseel, 17, and their friend Reyaad Khan, 20 – are said to have jetted-in on a tourist fight to Antalya, in southern Turkey, after paying for a one-week stay at a five-star spa resort. They apparently vanished at 7am the day after checking in. An inspection of their room revealed two abandoned suitcases and a discarded beard trimmer. A taxi driver said they had asked the fare to Konya in eastern Turkey, then taken a bus instead. A hotel source said MI6 agents came to take their abandoned belongings. Others simply use gleaming new Hatay airport, built just ten miles from the Syrian border. he masked man who killed American journalist James Foley in a brutal propaganda video spoke with a British accent . Once in eastern Turkey, British jihadis hook up with IS handlers and embark on spending sprees in local army equipment shops. In frontier town Reyhanli, a bombed-out staging post for hundreds of fighters, shop owner Abu Saleh said European jihadis buy hunting knives, sniper rifle sights, binoculars and desert camouflage fatigues. He said one bearded man walked in waving $50,000 (£30,000) in bundles of cash and bought a thousand ‘magazine vests’ for carrying spare AK47 rifle ammunition clips. At the nearby Miray Hotel, a busload of 30 Britons recently stayed on their way to Syria, the manager said. In another town on the tinderbox frontier, Kilis, a smuggler called Ibrahim said he drove five Britons dressed in Afghan garb over the line by simply bribing a border guard with ‘less than ten dollars’. The Mail has witnessed just how easy the crossing is. On a dry, dusty track that is one of the ancient smuggling routes criss-crossing over the hills to Syria, there is nothing but scraps of broken barbed wire marking the border. The path leads down to the Orontes river, which meanders through the valley of olive plantations, and on the other side is Syria. A Turkish army truck full of soldiers drove by. They barely glanced at a gaggle of smugglers from local villages who were busy carting oil drums and boxes of food and medicine down to the riverbank, to be pulled across on makeshift rafts. At sunset, jihadis slip into Syria the same way, without ever encountering a border official. Similar scenes unfold at hundreds of unguarded points along a border that stretches 560 mountainous miles. The Cardiff trio who appeared on a jihad recruitment video - Reyaad Khan, left, Abu Muthana Al Yemeni, centre and Abu Bara' Al Hindi, right - all used the 'Gateway to Jihad' Abu Abdullah al-Britani (left) and Abu Hussain . al-Britani are just two of the British nationals understood to be . fighting in Syria. Up to 1,000 British residents and nationals have now . joined the extremists . Former aspiring rapper Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary from London is among those thought to be fighting in Syria. Up to 250 fighters are thought to have used the 'Jihad Express' on their return route to Britain . ‘When they cross over, they kneel and cry, they weep,’ said one smuggler. ‘They believe this land, Syria, is where God’s judgment will come to pass.’ Among those who have made it across is apparently a ‘blond-haired, blue-eyed, British heart surgeon’ running an IS field hospital and going by the nom de guerre ‘Abu Osama al-Brittani’. Ahmed Al-Kateed, who fled the civil war to live in Turkey, said: ‘I went back to Syria because an Italian mother paid me to retrieve her dead son’s body. Near Aleppo, I met six British fighters and one of them was this white British doctor.’ He said the ‘surgeon’ told him he had abandoned a £120,000-a-year job in the NHS and bought himself a top-of-the-range AK47. Keeping tabs on the fanatics is an uphill struggle for intelligence services. Such is IS’s network of contacts and use of social media that recruits are told how to leave Britain – always travelling to Turkey via other countries to avoid suspicion at UK borders and using a variety of methods of travel – who to contact in Turkey and which hotels and safe houses to use. The Kent Hotel in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli, one of the places British Jihadis stay with their Brothers-in-Arms, before being taken into neighbouring Syria to fight . One of the Turkish regional airports, this one at Gaziantep, one of the places British Jihadis are welcomed before crossing the border into Syria and beyond . The bus station in the Turkish border town of Kilis, one of the places British Jihadis are welcomed - they often travel through other countries before arriving in Turkey to throw security forces off their trail . Once in accommodation they make contact with a telephone number or email address and, usually, within 48 hours they are picked up and taken across the border to IS training camps. In Hatay province, which borders Syria, governor Celalettin Lekesiz dismisses all talk of foreign fighters as ‘urban legends’. But a leaked secret memo he wrote to his superiors, seen by the Mail, reveals the embarrassing truth that hundreds of fighters have been thumbing their noses at his border guards. His memo speaks in tones of panic, and says that, on March 15 this year for example, 150 armed men sneaked across the border, staying en-route at the Kent Hotel in Reyhanli. A people smuggler who claims to have taken British Jihadis across the border from Kilis in Turkey into Syria to fight speaks to reporter Sam Greenhill . Reporter Sam Greenhill, pictured left near the lawless Turkish border, discovered that the Islamic State used meeting points like the one pictured right to ensure recruits were swiftly taken across the border to Syria . The Turkish border town of Reyhanli, where recruits are placed in  in accommodation, where IS fighters make contact with a telephone number or email address . Unofficial operations are on-going to track the militants in the border area, but Turkey has been reluctant to stop anyone from crossing. For months they have allowed weapons and supplies destined for recognised Syrian opposition groups to cross and European governments have been frustrated that little appears to have been done to stop the jihadis. A large force of jihadis is reported to be moving towards the border. Their goal is to provide a guaranteed gateway through the 130-mile frontier. If that happens, it will make the ‘Jihad Express’ even simpler.","The 'Gateway to Jihad' is along an open stretch of rugged Turkish border .

"The number of children being put up for adoption has fallen dramatically because social services are misinterpreting judicial guidance, it has been claimed. Despite recent official figures which showed a record rise in youngsters being successfully adopted, experts fear the numbers being put forward have almost halved over the past year. They blame the decrease - some 47 per cent, according to umbrella group the Adoption Leadership Board (ALB) - on fears over a High Court judgement from last year which highlighted concerns with too speedy adoptions. Recent figures showed a record rise in children being successfully adopted, but experts fear numbers have halved in the past year. File photo . Edward Timpson, the Children and Families Minister, said last night: ‘The last year has seen a record high in the number of adoptions - this means thousands more of our most vulnerable children are finding the loving and permanent homes they need. ‘However, we’ve also seen a decrease in the number of children placed for adoption, because of a misinterpretation of the law following a number of significant judgements by the courts. ‘The new guidance published today by the Adoption Leadership Board will help make clear the law around the correct interpretation of these complex cases and ensure the right decisions are being made each and every time.’ Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said a campaign for more adoption was starting to bear fruit . Official figures published in September showed the number of children completing the adoption process in England had increased by 25 per cent to a record 5,000 in a single year. The news was celebrated by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan as proof that a campaign for more adoption by her predecessor in the role, Michael Gove, who was himself adopted, was starting to bear fruit. But last night, the ALB described what it said was a 47 per cent fall in children being put forward for adoption by local authorities as ‘alarming’. They said they were concerned that gains made in successfully placing children with new families were now at risk of being ‘reversed’. Its chairman, former Barnardo’s boss Sir Martin Narey, now the Government’s adoption tsar, issued emergency guidance to social services insisting that the law on adoptions had not changed despite a High Court judgment issued a year ago which highlighted concerns about the drive to speed up adoption. Figures from the ALB showed the number of local authority decisions that a child should be adopted fell from 1,830 in the three months to September last year to 960 in the three months to June, a drop of 47 per cent. According to the board, the fall is in part an over-reaction to remarks by Sir James Munby, the President of the High Court Family Division, who attacked the ‘anodyne and empty’ arguments for enforced adoption presented at family courts, and accused social workers of paying lip service to the law, which says a child should be separated from its parents only in the most serious cases. He said in September: ‘Sloppy practice must stop. It is simply unacceptable in a forensic context where the issues are so grave and the stakes, for both child and parent, so high.’ He also criticised the ‘recurrent inadequacy of the analysis and reasoning’ used to support adoption and said four appeals in the last ten days of July alone had raised concerns. Applications for court orders allowing a child to be placed for adoption have fallen by more than a third . One ‘lamentable’ case at Brent council in north London failed because of poor social work evidence and weak reasoning by a judge, he said. Sir James, sitting in London’s Court of Appeal, was speaking as he rejected an appeal into the adoption of two children in Essex. He said ‘lurking behind’ the case were ‘serious concerns and misgivings’ about how family courts approach the issue of adoption. Hugh Thornberry, a member of the ALBd and chief executive of the charity Adoption UK, told the Daily Telegraph last night: ‘What we are concerned about [is] that we will see a reversal of the progress that was being made. ‘What we are seeing here… is what we believe to be an over-reaction and a misunderstanding of Appeal Court judgments; we are trying to do everything we can to address that.’","Recent official figures showed record rise in youngsters being adopted .

"Trying to save the dog, the good Samaritan then needed to be saved himself . A good Samaritan had to be pulled from a freezing river after risking his own life to save a stranger's dog. The well-meaning 51-year-old man jumped into the icy water in Northumberland to try save a dog which was in trouble. But things soon took a turn for the worse when the good Samaritan himself began to drown - other park-goers ran to find buoys to throw to him. An unidentified good Samaritan jumped into freezing temperatures to save a stranger's dog from the icy waters of the River Wansbeck in Morpeth, Northumberland on the weekend . People then rushed to drag the man from the River Wansbeck in Morpeth, while others looked on anxiously. He then had to be helped to safety by passers-by, who threw buoys after the freezing conditions in the river took hold .

The man was taken to Wansbeck Hospital to be checked over while the dog emerged safe and sound. Police warned people not to go into icy water in any circumstances. Sergeant Niall Mackel, from Northumberland Area Command, said: ‘Although . this person was trying to help another member of the public by rescuing . their dog, this only serves to highlight the dangers of going into open . water. ‘Particularly with the recent freezing temperatures which can lead to even strong swimmers getting into difficulty. ‘We would always warn people against going into open water and to . contact emergency services so that they aren't endangering their own . lives in attempting a rescue. ‘Fortunately this didn't result in tragic consequences and I extend my . thanks to those people who assisted this gentleman prior to emergency . services arrival.’ John Phillips, from Morpeth, Northumberland, took pictures of the rescue while he was in the park with his son, Cameron, seven.

A cast of extras - in bizarre costumes - dance about in the background in the internet advert for the BBC One show . The concept of the new craze is simple -  the videos are about 30 seconds long and set to Harlem Shake by New York DJ Baauer . Each clip tends to begin with one person dancing alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them. Then, as the bass line drops, everyone goes wild. The BBC video, which has been posted on YouTube, has already attracted 48,594 views on the site. Many of the performers wear facemasks or helmets, strange costumes and fancy dress - there is commonly someone dancing in their underwear. Last year saw huge success for K-pop rapper Psy, thanks to his smash hit Gangnam Style. But unlike Gangnam Style there are no specific dance moves. Most dancers perform crotch thrusts, waves their arms up and down, or stand on their hands. Office workers, university students, friends and firemen have all made their own short video clips and posted them on YouTube. Some performers have even taken to the snow wearing little clothing to perform the famous dance. A version apparently performed by Norwegian soldiers has been one of the most popular. The Harlem Shake phenomenon has been around since the 1980s, but it was this recent meme which has catapulted it into mainstream culture across the world.","EastEnders cast latest in a string of celebrities to do  new viral dance craze .

"They're both famous singers who have lent their powerful voices to James Bond films. And it seems the Oscars' stage wasn't big enough to accommodate larger-and-life divas Adele and Dame Shirley Bassey, at least at the same time.

"The RAF commander who ordered the controversial fire-bombing of Dresden which killed an estimated 25,000 civilians during World War II said he would do it again in a long lost interview filmed 30 years after the end of the conflict. Former marshal of the Royal Air Force, Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, gave the green light for the 1945 bombing which reduced the city in Saxony, Germany, to rubble. The attack was widely criticised because of 'blanket bombing' which hit civilian areas as well as military targets - killing thousands of innocents. But the newly-discovered interview with . Sir Arthur, which was filmed in 1977 and will be aired for the first . time on the BBC tonight, shows the RAF chief defending his decision. Scroll down to watch video . Commander: Air Marshal Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, who planned the majority of the RAF's night raids during World War II, is seen at work in his office . Casualties: Around 25,000 people were killed by Allied bombers over the course of two night raids on the city of Dresden in Saxony, Germany, in February 1945 . Fresh evidence: Footage of Air Arthur Harris being interviewed by Air Vice Marshal Tony Mason has emerged 36 years after it was filmed . And the chief commander of the Bomber Command tells his interviewer, Air Vice Marshal Tony Mason, that he would do it again if he had to. He said: 'If I had to have the same time again I would do the same again, but I hope I wouldn’t have to.' Sir Arthur then adds: 'I hope it’s been of some use, for future generations in keeping them out of these riots. It never does anybody any good.' During the interview, Mason discusses how many felt the Dresden attack was 'a city too far'. However . Harris stood his ground saying: 'The bombers kept over a million fit . Germans out of the German army… Manning the anti-aircraft defences; . making the ammunition, and doing urgent repairs, especially tradesmen.' Interview: Sir Arthur said he would still make the same decision to bomb Dresden if given his time again . Reduced to rubble: The 'blanket bombing' of Dresden was widely criticised as civilian areas were hit as well as military targets . Destruction: The capital of Saxony was left in ruins after the Allied air bombings with the Town Hall, pictured in the background, reduced to a shell of a building . Harris also countered the myth that area bombing was his idea - claiming it was already Government policy. He said: 'I lived in a shower of directives from the day I took over to the last day of war. 'The . directive when I took over was that I wasn't to specifically aim at . anything unless ordered to do so and to blast the German cities as a . whole.' Air Marshall Arthur Harris, Head of the RAF Bomber Command, said it was Government policy not to bomb specific targets . Mason asked . Harris why he was ordered to bomb whole cities rather than specific Nazi . targets. In response, Harris said: 'They came to the conclusion that . they weren’t hitting very much and they didn’t have very much to hit . things with…' Sir Arthur, who died in 1984 aged 91, refused a peerage because his men were denied a campaign medal. The Bomber Command, which suffered the highest casualty rate of any British unit, losing 55,573 of its 125,000 men, eventually got a memorial last year. It was erected despite numerous objections from German politicians. Bomber Command veteran Doug Radcliffe, 89, who is now secretary of the Bomber Command Association, backed his former commander. He . told the Daily Express: 'Our raids meant there were 10,000 88mm . anti-aircraft guns pointing up to the sky instead of at our troops and . the Russians. 'Dresden was a major centre for the manufacture of opticals, such as gun sights and binoculars.' He added: 'After Dresden we lost another 700 bombers, and London was being hit by V2s which nobody could fight against.' It . was initially claimed that up to 250,000 civilians lost their lives in . the Dresden bombings but an official report released after the war . showed the casualty figure was in fact closer to 25,000. Over two days and nights in February 1945 British and American bombers turned the city into a sea of flames and rubble. Air raids: Dresden can be seen in flames following allied bombings in February 1945 . Restoration: Residents can be seen working on the removal of debris from Dresden's Muenzgasse street in 1952 . The victims - mostly women and children - died in savage firestorms whipped up by the intense heat of 2,400 tons of high explosive and 1,500 tons of incendiary bombs. The newly-found footage will shed more light on Dresden and the actions of the RAF during World War Two. Professor Richard Aldrich, University of Warwick, said: 'It’s interesting because it’s not done immediately after the second world war, it’s done at a time when there have already been several waves of interpretation about Bomber Command, about Harris himself and so one not only gets his memories which are still clearly quite fresh, but also is commentary on those different interpretations. 'It’s a multi-layered interview and all the more interesting for it.' Sir Arthur Harris was appointed commander-in-chief of The Bomber Command - the unit responsible for defending Britain from aerial attacks and bombing enemy targets - in 1942. In the early part of the war, the Bomber Command’s raids had little effect. The bombers only flew at night to reduce the danger of being shot down, but with primitive navigation equipment, this made it difficult to identify and hit a small target. In 1941, it was decided that The Bomber Command would target entire industrial cities - known as area or blanket bombing. This policy was endorsed by Churchill and formally adopted in early 1942 as Sir Arthur took the helm of The Bomber Command. Harris said at the start of the bombing campaign that he was unleashing a whirlwind on Germany. Working class housing areas were targeted because they had a higher density and firestorms were more likely. This disrupted the German workforce and the Germans capability of producing more weapons. The plan was highly controversial even before it started, but the Cabinet thought bombing was the only option available to attack Germany directly as a major invasion of the continent was years away. The Soviets were also demanding that the Western Allies do something to relieve the pressure on the Eastern Front. Brave: The Bomber Command, pictured, lost more soldiers than other unit during WWII . Dresden was one of the cities targeted with 'area bombings'. Around 25,000 civilians were killed by allied bombs dropped over the course of two days in February 1945. The tactic has been strongly criticised leading to accusations of war crimes. The Bomber Command suffered the . highest casualty rate of any British unit - losing 55,573 of its 125,000 . men. After opposition from German politicians, a memorial to The Bomber Command was finally unveiled in Green Park, London, last year.

"In 2006, Pluto lost its status as a planet when other bodies in the solar system of similar or greater size were found. The decision to demote it to a ‘dwarf planet’ by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) at the time was highly contentious - and it now seems many still want its planet status reinstated. In a debate where experts presented cases for and against the decision, it was found that most people in the audience still wanted Pluto to be a planet. In a debate held last week at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Massachusetts most people still wanted Pluto to be a planet. Three experts gave their arguments for and against Pluto being a planet and audience members then gave their decision - with most wanting Pluto to still be a planet (shown) The debate was held last week at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During the event three experts explained their own reasoning for thinking Pluto was or wasn’t a planet reports Astrobiology Magazine. And the audience members were then asked to vote on which argument they thought was best. According to the IAU, a cosmic body must satisfy three conditions before it can be classified as a planet. The first is that it must be in orbit around the sun, and not be the satellite of another planet. Second, it must have sufficient mass to form a spherical shape under its own gravity. And finally it must have cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. The latter was the condition that lost Pluto its planet status. This is because it orbits in the Kuiper Belt at the outer edge of the solar system, where many other icy rocks and worlds orbit in its vicinity. Dr Gareth Williams of the Minor Planet Centre defended the original IAU decision in 2006 and said Pluto should not be a planet as it had not cleared the path in its orbit - one of the prerequisites for a planet, as decided in 2006. Science historian Dr Owen Gingerich argued that, for historical and cultural reasons, Pluto should be a planet. And Dr Dimitar Sasselov, director of the Harvard Origins of Life Initiative agreed with Dr Gingerich, but for the reason that any lump of matter large enough to form a sphere around a star should be classified as a planet. When put to the vote, the majority of the audience - which consisted of experts and members of the general public - agreed with Dr Sasselov, who’s definition would also help classify exoplanets. The vote isn't official, although it does highlight the continued public disapproval of Pluto being demoted. However, if Pluto was still a planet it would cause a number of complications. Namely, several other bodies of a similar or greater size such as Ceres and Eris were found, and it is estimated there may be hundreds more Pluto-sized objects in the outer solar system. Reinstating Pluto, therefore, could ultimately lead to our solar system not being a small family of eight easily identifiable planets, but a complicated system of dozens of obscure worlds extending far beyond the orbit of Neptune. In July 2015, New Horizons  will become the first spacecraft ever to visit Pluto (illustration shown). In 2006 Pluto lost its status as a planet when other bodies of a similar size were found in the solar system. Had it remained a planet, the family of planets in the solar system would likely have to be expanded to several dozen . The latest vote isn't official, but highlights the public continued disapproval of Pluto's demotion to 'dwarf planet' status. Shown here is the most detailed view to date of the entire surface of the dwarf planet Pluto as constructed from multiple NASA Hubble Space Telescope photographs taken from 2002 to 2003 .","Pluto lost its status as a planet in 2006 when other bodies of a similar size were found in the solar system .

"Soldiers from Commonwealth countries have been banned from joining Britain’s Armed Forces unless they have lived here for five years. The residency test, which came into force yesterday, will prevent overseas recruits joining immediately as they do now. The Ministry of Defence reinstated the requirement, which was scrapped in 1998, as it attempts to reduce the size of the military by nearly 30,000 troops. Cutbacks: Commonwealth citizens will be require to have lived in Britain for five years before they are eligible to join the Armed Forces . Recruits from Commonwealth countries have a long and distinguished history of serving in the Armed Forces. In the First World War, 1.2million men from the Indian Army fought alongside the Allies with 74,000 losing their lives. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa all lent troops during World War Two. And Britain's Commonwealth companions have proved to be brave in the battlefield. Johnson Beharry, pictured above, originally from Grenada, was awarded the Victoria Cross for his valour while serving in Iraq. Others to have been given the highest military honour include two Australians Keith Payne and Rayene Stewart Simpson for their actions in the Vietnam War. But the controversial move could lead . to accusations of betrayal because Commonwealth troops have shed blood . for the UK on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan – as well as in . previous conflicts such as the two world wars. In the past decade 24 Commonwealth soldiers have been killed in conflict. Dozens more have been wounded. If the rules had been in place when . Sergeant Johnson Beharry arrived in Britain from the Caribbean island of . Grenada in 1999, he would not have been permitted to join the Army in . 2001. And the soldier, who serves with the . 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment, would not have . been on the Iraq battlefield in 2004, when he won the Victoria Cross for . twice saving comrades in ambushes. Typically, 500 Commonwealth soldiers . are among the 7,000 new recruits each year and the residency rule could . leave the Forces perilously overstretched if they failed to recruit . enough British soldiers. Throughout the infantry, about one in . ten soldiers is from outside Britain. Many join units that fail to . recruit their full complement of soldiers  at home. But Armed Forces Minister Mark . Francois said the rule was unavoidable as the military coped with . sweeping cuts. In a written ministerial statement he acknowledged the . contribution of Commonwealth citizens serving in the British Armed . Forces. But he added: ‘In order to deliver . the future structure of the Armed Forces under the requirements of the . Strategic Defence and Security Review, we are already reducing their . size by adjusting our recruit intake and making some redundancies. ‘We are confident that we will still  be able to meet our recruitment targets.’ Change: The ruling had been scrapped in 1998 but is now being reinstated, effective immediately . The changes will not affect Gurkhas or those from the Republic of Ireland, Cyprus and Malta. Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy . said: ‘When rightly recruiting those from the UK, ministers must never . undermine the many sacrifices and commitments made by those from the . Commonwealth who have served on frontlines across the globe in the name . of British national security. ‘The country will want to know this is based on the best possible military advice and nothing else.’ Colonel Richard Kemp, who  commanded British forces in Afghanistan, . praised the long tradition of ‘sterling service’ that Commonwealth . soldiers have provided – ‘and still provide’ – in the Army. He said the Armed Forces had . ‘depended heavily’ on Commonwealth troops to bring units up to strength . and accused the MoD of using ineffective recruiting techniques. But he added: ‘However, at a time . when our Armed Forces are reducing to the lowest levels in more than a . century, it is right that priority should be given to British citizens.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘At a time . when we are having to reduce the  size of our Armed Forces, it is only . right we focus on recruiting  UK personnel.’","Defence Minister Mark Francois makes announcement to MPs .

'We have this image now of Hitler almost . as a buffoon, but he had a lot of charisma and his speeches made people . sincerely believe he would lead them back to greatness.

'These pictures give an important insight . into how he practised. He was a showman and rehearsed his gestures to get a . particular reaction from his audiences. 'He experimented with his own image and . asked Hoffmann to take photographs for him to review. Then he'd look at them . and say ""no, that looks silly"" or ""I'm never doing that again"". 'He used Hoffmann as a sounding board, but . never intended the images to be published. 'He was a very modern politician in that way. He was concerned about how he looked and his public persona.' Hoffmann, who introduced Hitler to his . then-studio assistant Eva Braun, survived the war and spent four years in . prison for Nazi profiteering. He died in 1957, aged 72. The book, Hitler Was My Friend by Heinrich . Hoffmann, can now be purchased from Pen & Sword Books and costs £19.99. The Fuhrer and the power of oratory . Standing on a podium before thousands of Nazi party members, Hitler crossed his arms... and waited a full minute before starting to speak. The audience had already been kept waiting over an hour for his arrival into the hall. When it came to making speeches, the Fuhrer was a master of manipulation and presentation. In the early years of his rise to power, he often spoke in Beer Halls - and tailored his style of talking accordingly as the crowds became more inebriated. He would begin precisely, logically and in a restrained manner. But as his audience warmed to him - and had drunk more - he would launch into a ranting, raving, almost hypnotic speech style. Hitler was fascinated by mesmerism and even hired a voice trainer to hone this talent. By 1932, German production had fallen by half, with 6million unemployed during the depression. So in order to sway the masses, Hitler would speak of his vision of a 'great national revival'. And his largest asset was his oratory. Egon Hanfstaengl, the son of Hitler's foreign press officer, said during a recent documentary, Fatal Attraction Of Hitler: 'He had that ability which is needed to make people stop thinking critically and just emote. 'The ability derived from his readiness to throw himself totally open - to appear bare and naked before his audience, to tear open his heart and display it.' And he displayed well. In his carefully orchestrated public addresses, with its grand ritual and sense of unity, Hitler gave the people what they wanted.","Photos taken by Heinrich Hoffman in the 1920s .

"The widow of an asthmatic man who died after New York City police put him in a chokehold has spoken of her horror at seeing a video of the arrest. Esaw Garner said she was deeply upset by the footage that showed police trying to arrest her husband, Eric, in Staten Island on Thursday. The mother of his six children collapsed in tears at a press conference on Saturday, the day after it was revealed that two of the men involved in the fatal arrest have been put on desk duty. Heartbroken: Esaw Garner, whose husband Eric died during an arrest Thursday, is held by the Rev Al Sharpton, right, and Rev Herbert Daughtry, on Saturday . Grief: Esaw, pictured with Eric, says she struggled to watch the footage of her husband's final moments . Officer Daniel Pantaleo and Officer Justin Damico have been put on desk duty while an investigation is carried out into the arrest. The officer believed to have used the chokehold, who has not yet been identified, may lose his job, a law enforcement source said. 'It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a choke hold,' the unidentified source told the New York Post. It is alleged that the police put Garner in a chokehold - a maneuver barred under their practice code - when they tried to arrest him over claims he was selling bootleg cigarettes. Garner's wife watched footage of the arrest, and her 43-year-old husband's final moments on a sidewalk, on Friday.

They choked him and took him down and I could hear him screaming that he couldn’t breathe,' she told the Daily News, which has an exclusive copy of the film. 'It was so hard to watch. He was a nonviolent gentle giant and they killed him.' The 46-year-old had to be comforted by the Rev Al Sharpton when she appeared at a press conference by the National Action Network on Saturday. She sobbed uncontrollably as Sharpton described the circumstances of her husband's death. 'The issue is not if one was selling [untaxed] cigarettes, the issue is that an unarmed man was subjected to a chokehold and the result is he is no longer with us,' Sharpton said. On Saturday afternoon, Sharpton joined the family on a peaceful demonstration through Staten Island, to protest the circumstances of Garner's death. In the video Garner, who was not armed, is heard denying that he has been involved in illegal activity when a plain clothes police officer stopped him. 'Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. It stops today!' he is heard saying.

"Despite previously claiming that 70 Australians were fighting with the Islamic State and 100 Australians were supporting it, officials have now revealed that as many as 250 Australians could be backing or be in combat with the jihadist group. As the terrorist group grows stronger, they are constantly using methods to attract Australians into their inner circle. And it appears that the number of Australian's joining the jihadists has grown significantly from previous reports. Despite previously claiming that 70 Australians were fighting with the Islamic State, officials have now revealed that as many as 250 Australians could be supporting or be in combat with the jihadist group . According to United Nations counter-terrorism expert, Richard Barrett, Australian Secret Intelligence Service officials announced the shocking new figure in a top secret meeting in April. Speaking to the Hearald Sun, Mr Barrett said the Government had revised its previous  figures. The Australian Government is now concerned about the impact returning fighters will have on the country. As the terrorist group grows stronger, they are constantly using methods to attract Australians into their inner circle . This week, legislation was passed making it a crime for Australians to return from conflict zones in Iraq and Syria without a valid reason. In August, more than 20 fighters had returned from Syria and Iraq, according to the then head of the ASIO, David Irvine. A new counter-terrorism border unit has screened has hauled nearly 50 airline passengers from planes to be questioned since August. Mohammad Ali Baryalei appeared in a video recruiting people on the streets of Sydney into the extremist group . Australian teachers at home and abroad have been warned that there may be an imminent attack in the future . Mr Barrett, who works for New York based think-tank The Soufan Group, told the paper that banning it a crime to return from war-torn areas would not stop the jihadists from coming back to Austrlaia. 'As we have already seen with Australians in Iraq/Syria, the confiscation of passports or the banning of travel is not necessarily enough to deter the most determined,' he said. The news comes after teachers at home and abroad have been warned that jihadists are encouraging attacks on Australian teachers. Teen Adam Dahman joined joined the jihadist group and became a suicide bomber in Iraq . A fighter of the Islamic group holds up a flag. The number of Australians joining the terrorist organisation has grown significantly . DFAT on Friday night updated its terror threat advice to high in light of an online forum post, which urged attacks against teachers at international schools around the world. Speaking to FOX News, Mike Rogers said that spontaneous acts of terrorism should be a concern to Australians. The US congressman provided chilling details about an Islamic State terror plot to kidnap and behead an Australian. He said they received a note from IS which said: 'No, No. What we want you to do, stay in Australia. We want you to randomly kidnap people off the street, behead them, videotape it, send it to us for further propaganda.'

"The body of a notorious criminal who confessed to being 'The Boston Strangler' will be dug up this week so scientists can prove beyond any doubt that he raped and murdered 19-year-old Mary Sullivan in 1964 after an incredible breakthrough in the cold case. It was widely thought Sullivan was the last of 11 women murdered by the Strangler nearly 50 years ago after Albert DeSalvo confessed to the killings, and an additional two murders, in the 1960s. But he was never prosecuted. Authorities . today revealed they believe with 99.9 per cent certainty that DeSalvo, who was stabbed to death in Walpole state prison in November 1973, was the killer after semen found on Sullivan's body and on a blanket discovered nearby was linked to him. While similar DNA evidence is unavailable for the other 10 victims, if found guilty of slaying Sullivan, it strongly suggests DeSalvo was the Boston Strangler, as per his confession, because of the blinding similarities in the murders. Scroll down for video . Boston Strangler: Self-admitted Boston Strangler Albert DeSalvo, pictured left in 1967, has reportedly been charged in the murder of Mary Sullivan, right . New evidence: Albert DeSalvo, pictured in 1968, has reportedly been charged in the slaying of Mary Sullivan, 19, in 1964 . After numerous failed attempts to make . sense of the DNA samples found on Sullivan in the past, scientists were . finally able this year to implicate a suspect - a white male - through . advancements in technology. Detectives with the Boston Police Department . then conducted undercover surveillance of DeSalvo's family members and . retrieved a discarded water bottle from one of the man's nephews. They . tested DNA from fingerprints and it proved a familial similarity to . the DNA found on the victim. DeSalvo's body, which has been buried for some 40 years, will be exhumed this week and his remains will be sent to the chief medical examiner's office where DNA samples will be collected and sent off for testing. Results should prove once and for all whether he murdered Sullivan. Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis and Attorney General . Martha Coakley announced the 'major development' at a press conference . this morning and officials met with relatives of the women murdered by . the Strangler today. Davis said: 'The ability to provide closure to a family after fifty years is just a remarkable thing.' DeSalvo . cannot be charged but the authorities hoped the breakthrough would . bring closure to at least the Sullivan family, some five decades after . their loved one was senselessly murdered. Victims: This picture shows eight of the women strangled to death in the spree. From top left to bottom right: Rachel Lazarus, Helen E. Blake, Ida Irga, Mrs. J. Delaney, Patricia Bissette, Daniela M. Saunders, Mary A. Sullivan, Mrs. Israel Goldberg . Killed: DeSalvo was stabbed to death in prison in 1973, aged 42 . Before his death, DeSalvo, a blue . collar worker and Army veteran who was married with children, admitted . he was the Strangler who terrorized the greater Boston area in the . 1960s, killing 11 women. But he was never prosecuted for the heinous crimes, according to The Boston Globe, because of a deal negotiated with then-Attorney General Edward Brooke and DeSalvo's attorney, F. Lee Bailey. He was brutally murdered in prison, aged 42, while serving a life sentence for armed robbery and sexual assault in a separate series of 'non-fatal' attacks on women. Authorities said today that no DNA . evidence exists for any of the Strangler's 10 other victims. This means . that a similar definitive link is unlikely in those cases. Until now, . DeSalvo's confession was the only evidence in the fascinating case, . allowing room for the community, and even some high up in the police . department, to doubt whether he was in fact responsible. As recently as 2012, Brooke cast doubt over whether DeSalvo was in fact the Boston Strangler. 'Even . to this day, I can't say with certainty that the person who ultimately . was designated as the Boston Strangler was the Boston Strangler,' Brooke . told the Globe last year. DeSalvo's surviving relatives and Casey Sherman, the nephew of Mary Sullivan, organized DNA testing a decade ago on Sullivan's remains but the technology at the time meant it was not possible to get a usable sample. At that point, authorities decided to halt testing, which destroys the evidence, until advancements in technology were strong enough to get a result. Family: In this undated black and white file photo, Diane Dodd, left, and son Casey Sherman hold a photo in Rockland, Massachusetts, of Dodd's sister Mary Sullivan, who was found strangled in January 1964 and is believed to have been the last victim of the Boston Strangler . Those breakthroughs occured last year . and the cold case was reopened with two of six remaining semen samples . sent to two difficent labs. Both came back with the same results. A . sample from Sullivan's body showed the unique genetic profile of two . people - the teen herself and a white male - while a sample from a . blanket showed DNA of the same white male. Police . then searched high and low for anything that would still have DeSalvo's . DNA on it. They attempted to get a sample from a pair of letters he . wrote to the parole board but failed. However, thanks to the new . technology they knew they could use DNA from one of DeSalvo's male . descendents instead as the Y chromosomes among men of the same family . are as good as identical. Anna Slesers, a 55-year-old Latvian seamstress, was the Boston Strangler's first victim. She was found dead in her Gainsborough Street apartment by her son on June 14, 1962. Sullivan was the last. The teen had moved from her Cape Cod home to Boston just three days before her death. DeSalvo was pinpointed as the killer when he confessed to the string of strangling deaths to his cellmate, George Nassar. Confession: Factory worker DeSalvo, who was married and had children, told police he was behind the killings . Nassar told DeSalvo's defense lawyer Bailey, who struck a deal with Brooke which outlined that DeSalvo wouldn't be prosecuted if he admitted he was the Strangler. At his robbery and sexual assault trial in 1967, Bailey said DeSalvo was consumed by 'one of the most crushing sexual drives that psychiatric science has ever encountered. 'Thirteen acts of homicide by a completely uncontrollable vegetable walking around in a human body,' he said in opening his defense, according to The Boston Globe archives. His psychiatrist, Dr. James A. Brussel, testified that he was suffering from 'schizophrenia of the paranoid type.' He said each of DeSalvo's alleged slaying would be preceded by a night during which would be tormented 'with a burning up inside... Like little fires. Like little explosions.' According to the article, Dr. Brussel testified that DeSalvo told him he killed his victims with nylon stockings. 'He tied the victims up usually with scarves or stockings, the stockings being the terminal means by which, though unconsciousness had of course, ensured, the terminal means by which life ended,' he said. He added the victims were tied 'in a frog-like position,' and that DeSalvo had relations with the dead or unconscious body. Jan. 4, 1964 – Mary Sullivan, 19, the last of the 11 victims, found murdered in her apartment in the Beacon Hill section of Boston. 1965 – Albert DeSalvo, a factory worker being held on unrelated charges, confesses to the Strangler's 11 killings and two others. He never is charged with them. 1973 – DeSalvo killed in prison by another inmate. July 1999 – Boston police reopen the Strangler case, hoping to use DNA technology to analyze evidence from the crimes. Sept. 14, 2000 – The DeSalvo and Sullivan families sue local and state authorities in Massachusetts to force investigators to turn over crime scene evidence they say will prove DeSalvo's innocence. Oct. 14, 2000 – Sullivan's remains exhumed for DNA testing. Oct. 20, 2000 – Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly says his office will do new DNA tests on evidence from Sullivan's slaying. Oct. 26, 2001 – DeSalvo's body exhumed for DNA testing. Dec. 6, 2001 – Forensic scientists announce that DNA evidence taken from Sullivan's body does not match DeSalvo's DNA. Dec. 24, 2001 – Judge says state doesn't need to share forensic evidence with the DeSalvo and Sullivan families because the investigation into the killings remains open. July 11, 2013 – Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley says advances in DNA technology have allowed investigators to link DeSalvo to Sullivan's killing. Conley says the DNA produced a ""familial match"" with DeSalvo, and he expects an exact match once DeSalvo's remains are re-exhumed.","Albert DeSalvo confessed to the killings but was never prosecuted .

"An SAS unit ‘snatched’ Woolwich terror suspect Michael Adebolajo in Kenya as he prepared to enter war-torn Somalia, the Daily Mail can reveal. Adebolajo was flown back to the UK but then allowed to roam the streets unchecked for the next two and a half years. The extraordinary revelation that the  28-year-old was deemed so important that Special Forces were ordered to detain him will, in the wake of the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week, raise disturbing new questions as to why he was free to roam the streets of London. Bloodied: Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo was back on the streets two and a half years after being arrested by British Special Forces in Kenya . In other developments: . ■A post-mortem examination on Drummer Rigby confirmed that the soldier died from multiple stab wounds . ■Three firearms officers involved in the shooting of the Woolwich suspects could be back on duty within weeks after undergoing medical and psychological assessments . ■Four men who took part in the English Defence League march on Downing Street on Monday were charged with criminal offences . ■Police were called to a bowling alley in Barnwood, Gloucestershire, after a 17-year-old worker brought a Second World War gun to work, claiming it was for ‘protection against Muslims’. Murdered: The revelation that terror suspect Michael Adebolajo was detained by SAS forces will raise further questions about whether more could have been done to prevent the death of Drummer Lee Rigby . The decision to use the SAS, working closely with MI5, to snatch Adebolajo in a helicopter-borne operation was highly unusual and contradicts earlier claims that he was arrested by local police as he tried to cross into Somalia to join jihadists in November 2010. Sources in Kenya described the operation as ‘highly dramatic’. Heavily armed soldiers arrived from a helicopters in a ‘text book snatch’ in a remote area of the country, following a surveillance operation. Kenyan forces were with the British soldiers at the time and he was quickly handed over to them. Units of the Special Forces regularly . train and operate in Northern Kenya and were involved at the time in . targeting foreign fighters crossing into Somalia to join the Al Shabaab . militia that has ties to Al Qaeda. It . is unclear exactly where Adebolajo was snatched but Kenyan officials . have said he was arrested north-east of the resort of Lamu while . travelling towards Somalia with five other Kenyans. According . to sources in Kenya, a Scotland Yard counter terrorism officer – based . in Africa – was close by as Adebolajo was taken into custody. A source said: ‘The SAS took the lead role. The reason they were involved was because this man was deemed important.’ Adebolajo was deported from Kenya after his arrest in 2010. He was put on a scheduled flight back to the UK and he was not escorted by an armed policeman – although a Scotland Yard detective, travelling undercover, is believed to have been on the flight. A source said: ‘He was brought back to the UK because the security services had a “duty of care” to stop him going into Somalia, where he was likely to have been killed. Before going to Kenya in 2010, he was on the radar of the British security services. MI5 knew he was travelling to Kenya. They launched a joint operation [to detain him] with the Kenyan authorities, but he was intercepted by British Special Forces.’ Detained: Units of the Special Forces regularly train and operate in Northern Kenya and were involved at the time in targeting foreign fighters crossing into Somalia to join the Al Shabaab militia (pictured) that has ties to Al Qaeda . 'On the radar': Michael Adebolajo (centre) among suspected members of the Al-Shabaab Movement who were arrested in Kenya more than two years ago for seeking terror training . According to well-placed sources, a senior defence official – with close links to Downing Street – sent a congratulatory letter to ‘partner agencies’ after Adebolajo was deported back to Britain. But M15, which failed in its efforts to recruit Adebolajo as an informant, put him on a low-level watch. Police and security services are under huge pressure to explain why they did not do more to stop Adebolajo and his accomplice, Michael Adebowale. Despite warnings stretching back ten years, Adebolajo is said to have been considered to be ‘low risk’ by MI5. He was photographed at high-profile protests – even standing next to hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Earlier this week it emerged that Kenya had warned Britain that Adebolajo was a ‘dangerous radical’ intent on waging war on the West. Tragic: A police officer stands guard near some of the thousands of tributes left in honour of murdered 25-year-old British soldier Lee Rigby, near Woolwich Barracks . But sources in Nairobi claim that Adebolajo may have gone on to enter Kenya twice more last year, using false passports. It is claimed that he was arrested with five others in February 2012, as he again tried to reach Somalia. Instead of being taken to court, he would have been put on a flight to the UK, under a new policy which sees all foreigners attempting to cross the border removed from Kenya. It is claimed that Adebolajo entered Kenya a third time, to meet a cleric named Sheikh Hassan Makbul. The pair are understood to have realised their cover had been blown, and fled to Tanzania in November. Court documents seen by the Mail reveal how determined Adebolajo’s gang were to join the Al Qaeda linked Al Shabaab in 2010. When they were arrested police found Al Shabaab flags and uniforms. Last night both the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the involvement of UK Special Forces.

"They have educated and delighted countless children with their colourful renditions of history’s most disgusting moments. But now after more than 60 books in his Horrible Histories series, author Terry Deary has said he has written the final volume. He said yesterday he believed he had reached ‘saturation point’ and his latest instalment – Deadly Days in History – will be his last. Terry Deary is bringing the Horrible Histories series to an end after 20 years, a television series and stage show . Mr Deary wrote his first ‘history’ 20 years ago and the books have been so successful, they have been turned into a TV series and even a stage show. He said: ‘It has naturally come to an end, the way things do. It has had a good run, it’s had a better run than most children’s series. 'Things do have a saturation point after which they become taken for granted. It would a shame if that happened.’ He added that although nothing certain had been decided between him and his publishers Scholastic, ‘there is a general feeling there will be no more’. Over the past two decades Mr Deary has tackled everything from the Savage Stone Age to the Blitzed Brits in an effort to make history accessible. His output has been prolific and at one point he was writing 14 books a year. After more than 60 books in his Horrible Histories series including the Awesome Egyptians and Barmy British Empire, the children's favourite has said he has written the final volume . Mr Deary wrote his first ‘history’ 20 . years ago and the books have been so successful, they have been turned . into a TV series and even a stage show . Famous for their alliterative titles, the series has been an enormous success ever since The Rotten Romans and The Awesome Egyptians. Although Deary, 67, would 'never say never' to a Horrible comeback, he said he wanted the series to be more 'Fawlty Towers than Last of the Summer Wine'. Mr Deary has sold more than 25million books in 40 countries. He . has already signed up to write a four-part history series for adults on . the Roman Empire, the Elizabethans, the Vikings and the Victorians. While he said Horrible Histories had done 'really well', he would not miss writing it. The very first Horrible Histories were published in 1993, and it soon became clear that history books for children would never be the same again. Unlike their predecessors, the series recognised the appeal for children of all the gruesome, wicked and weird detail from history that writers had hitherto spared them. After huge success the series has gone on to become a BAFTA award-winning CBBC show and stage show. Mr Deary . has tackled everything from the Savage Stone Age to the Blitzed Brits in . an effort to make history accessible. His output has been prolific and at one point he was writing 14 books a year. Famous for their alliterative titles, . the series has been an enormous success ever since The Rotten Romans . and The Awesome Egyptians. The book writing process for Horrible, he . said, tended to see his publishers call to ask if he knew anything . about a period or people from history, for example the Georgians, The . Times reports. If he said no, they would ask him if he could write a book in a 'few months' and he would 'immerse himself' in research and 'hope there's something horrible to write about,' he said, before adding: 'There usually is.' Surprisingly, at school Mr Deary  - who  got a C in O-level history and an E at A level - said he learnt to loathe history because lessons were so boring and so badly taught. He said school history books had 'every Bit of humanity sucked from them'. The Horrible Histories, and their focus on what is interesting as well as important, had been his 'revenge'. Despite being taken to the hearts and shelves of a generation of teachers and school librarians, battling to get children to engage with history, he said it was never his intention to be adopted by the Establishment. Instead, all he wanted was to write stories that children loved, an aim which has seen him consistently top the charts as the most borrowed non-fiction author year after year.","Terry Deary says Deadly Days in History will be the last book in the series .
He has written more than 60 Horrible Histories books in 20 years .
Now the 67-year-old will concentrate on a four-part series for adults ."
"From models backstage at London Fashion . Week to grannies in their retirement homes, everybody has been taking . part in the newest internet dance phenomenon - the Harlem Shake. Now, Harry Rodrigues, aka DJ Baauer, the man behind the trap music track, admits that it has developed a life of its own, with the video tributes collectively generating 175million views to date. The 23-year-old, who was born in West Philadelphia but is based in New York, said in a Q & A with Reddit users: 'The viral craze was something totally out of my control. I see it really positively.' Scroll down for videos . Internet dance sensation: Harry Rodrigues, aka DJ Baauer, the man behind trap music track Harlem Shake, admits that it has developed a life of its own, with video tributes collectively generating 175million views . In an interview with The Daily Beast, he elaborated further: 'All I did was make the song so it’s kind of a weird place for me . to be at,' he said. 'I birthed it, it was raised by others, and now it’s like my . weird, f***ed up adopted teenage kid coming back to me.' Baauer, who at one point lived in Harlem, says the name of the track is not intended to be a tribute to the dance of the same name, nor his time in the Uptown neighborhood. Instead, he explained, it references a line in Plastic Little’s Miller Time, 'then do the Harlem Shake', which Baauer's track samples. 'It just got stuck in my head for a while, so I used it,' he said. The Harlem Shake was originally released in May 2012, but the phenomenon . apparently began on January 30th, when one video blogger posted a video . of himself and three others dressed in colorful latex suits dancing to . the song. Is this the new Gagnam Style? In a new video craze, one person - in this case Supermodel Jourdan Dunn - is seen dancing unnoticed to Harlem Shake . Shake with style: When the bass line drops, everyone in the frame forms a wild and chaotic dance party. Here, models Cara Delevingne, Jourdan Dunn and Rosie Tapner whip their hair to the catchy tune . Baauer says he himself noticed that his . track had sparked an internet craze around a week-and-a-half ago, when . fans started posting YouTube links to his Facebook fan page. 'I thought, ""Oh, that’s funny."" But it didn’t strike me as the beginning . of something' In the 30-second videos, one person - who is usually wearing a bizarre  mask or costume - is seen dancing unnoticed to Harlem Shake, a song by DJ Baauer.

Harlem swim: In a unique take on the video, the University of Georgia's swimming and diving team took their camera under water to film their dance routine . Under water dance party: One swimmer wearing a Star Wars storm trooper helmet begins to dance, and then a group of his teammates suddenly joins in . Since then, thousands of people of all ages and walks of life have created their own versions of the popular meme. The Harlem Shake has been compared to Gagnam Style, Korean pop star Psy's 2012 internet dance craze. Of his favorite Harlem Shake tributes, Baauer told Reddit that 'the underwater one is pretty great,' also citing the T-Pain version as another of his top takes on the track. One that was less well-received was one by rapper Azealia Banks, who released - and then forced to retract - a remix of Harlem Shake without the permission of his label, Mad Decent. Nothing out of the ordinary: In one meme, employees at San Antonio Sea World scrub a deck nonchalantly . Animal Kingdom: Suddenly, the crew and animals all begin bopping their heads and shaking their fins to the tune . The debacle sparked a Twitter war between the two artists, a situation Baauer says he is 'not happy about'. 'She had a version that we were . going to release because I’m a big fan of hers... and it was . so/so. Didn’t love it,' he explained. 'That was a little while ago, and since all . this video stuff happened, our plans all changed... So . we told her, ""Please don’t release your version."" And she said, ""Well, . I’m going to put it online anyway.""' Never too old: Residents of an American care home bravely attempt their own version of the dance . Party time: Members of the community look bored, before breaking into the Harlem Shake . Unlike 2012's most popular internet . dance craze, inspired by PSY's Gangnam Style, the Harlem Shake does not . involve any specific . dance moves and is instead more of a free-for-all, often leading . to hilarious results. In one video, a troop of Norwegian soldiers is seen lining up in formation. One . of the soldiers begins dancing, and 20 seconds into the video the other . soldiers - who are suddenly wearing skis, standing on their heads or . wrapped up in sleeping bags on the ground - join in on the dance.

"Nasa's Kepler telescope scans the skies for 'habitable worlds' - but an American chemist has suggested the whole project might be a terrible idea. Ronald Breslow suggests that life-forms based on slightly different amino acids and sugars could take the form of huge, ferocious dinosaurs that have evolved to have human-like intelligence and technologies. 'We would be better off not meeting them,' says Breslow, who claims that it was a stroke of luck that an asteroid wiped out dinosaurs on earth, leaving the field clear for mammals such as humans. A scientist has suggested that other planets could be populated by intelligent dinosaurs . Amino acid tryptophan: A scientists suggests that a tiny 'tweak' to such acids could mean life on other worlds evolved very differently . On other worlds, dinosaurs could have evolved into huge, intelligent warriors armed with hi-tech weaponry - but without losing their hunger for fresh meat. 'Of course,' Breslow says, 'Showing that it could have happened this way . is not the same as showing that it did. An implication from . this work is that elsewhere in the universe there could be life forms . based on D-amino acids and L-sugars. 'Such life forms could well be . advanced versions of dinosaurs, if mammals did not have the good fortune . to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal collision, as on . Earth. 'We would be better off not meeting them.' In the report, noted scientist Ronald Breslow, Ph.D., discusses the century-old mystery of why the building blocks of terrestrial amino acids (which make up proteins), sugars, and the genetic materials DNA and RNA exist mainly in one orientation or shape. There are two possible orientations, left and right, which mirror each other in the same way as hands. In order for life to arise, proteins, for instance, must contain only one chiral form of amino acids, left or right. 'Such life forms could well be advanced versions of dinosaurs, if mammals did not have the good fortune to have the dinosaurs wiped out by an asteroidal collision, as on Earth,' says Breslow . With the exception of a few bacteria, amino acids in all life on Earth have the left-handed orientation. Most sugars have a right-handed orientation. How did that so-called homochirality, the predominance of one chiral form, happen? Breslow describes evidence supporting the idea that the unusual amino acids carried to a lifeless Earth by meteorites about 4 billion years ago set the pattern for normal amino acids with the L-geometry, the kind in terrestial proteins, and how those could lead to D-sugars of the kind in DNA.","Life-forms based on different amino acids could be intelligent dinosaurs .

"Ministers tried to twist to the truth over plans to block online porn so David Cameron can declare 'victory' on the issue . Ministers have secretly urged internet giants to pretend they are blocking online porn – so that David Cameron can declare a ‘victory’ on the issue. A leaked letter from the Department for Education asks the main internet service providers (ISPs) to rebrand their anti-porn filters as being ‘default-on’, giving the impression that adult material is automatically blocked. The letter, from an official at the DfE, and leaked by industry insiders, tells providers: ‘Without changing what you will be offering, the Prime Minister would like to be able to refer to your solutions as “default-on”. ‘Would you be able to commit to include “default-on” or similar language, both in the set-up screen and public messaging?’ The extraordinary demand appears to encourage internet firms to exaggerate the level  of protection they are giving families. Shadow Culture Minister Helen Goodman condemned the move, and warned that it could lead parents to assume wrongly that their children were protected from online porn. ‘It is disgraceful that instead of trying  to get the ISPs to switch their filters to a default-on position, they are trying to persuade them to just say they are doing it,’ she said. ‘It is a deliberate attempt to mislead parents. That is dangerous because it means that people won’t be taking the precautions they need to be taking. 'If people think filters are switched on when they are not there is obviously a risk that they won’t be on their guard in the way they should be.’ Internet giants have successfully lobbied ministers against campaigns seeking an automatic block on website filth. Instead they have agreed to introduce a system called ‘active choice plus’, which encourages parents to keep anti-porn filters switched on. Industry sources said they were unhappy about the political bid to make them misrepresent the safeguards they are offering. ‘What this is about is allowing the Government to declare a victory,’ said one. A leaked letter from the Department for Education asks the main internet service providers (ISPs) to rebrand their anti-porn filters as being ‘default-on’, giving the impression that adult material is automatically blocked . The leaked letter will reinforce concerns that the DfE and Education Secretary Michael Gove are resisting a block on online porn within government. Last year another leaked email said DfE ministers opposed  an automatic block on porn, adding: ‘The only reason they are  consulting on this is because No10 told the Daily Mail that they  would consult and listen to all views.’ A source at the Department  for Culture, Media and Sport, which is now in charge of dealing with the issue, insisted that the email did not represent government policy, adding: ‘The Department for Education is part of the problem.’ The latest letter also asks ISPs to fund an unspecified awareness campaign for parents, which will be announced by Mr Cameron. It says: ‘I know that it will be challenging for you to commit to an unknown campaign but please can you indicate what sum you will pledge to this work that the PM can announce.’ Internet giants, which benefit from the lucrative online porn market, insist that an automatic block would not work and would make parents complacent. Campaigners say it is a vital step in protecting children from the harmful effects of material that is freely available. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Government continues to work with ISPs to help keep children safe online.’ The DfE declined to comment.","Leaked letter asked web firms to rebrand anti-porn filters as 'default-on'

"A woman  went in search of her long-lost mother - and discovered she has unknowingly married her own brother. Adriana, 39, and her husband Leandro, 37, have been together for seven years and have a six-year-old daughter. The Brazilian couple - who didn't want to reveal their surnames - spent their lives trying to find their respective mothers, who were both called Maria, and had both abandoned their children when they were still babies. Related: Married couple Leandro and Adriana discovered they are brother and sister - but vow to stay together . But neither ever imagined - until this week - that the women they had both been searching for could have been the same person. Adriana, a cosmetics saleswoman, hadn't seen her mother since she was just one, when she left home leaving her to be raised by the girl's father. Meanwhile, truck driver Leandro found out aged eight that his own mother had also abandoned him, and that the woman he knew as his mum was actually his step-mother. While Leandro stayed in the same town where he was born in the state of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil, Adriana moved away to work as a housemaid, was married for 15 years and had three children. The pair met for the first time ten years ago after Adriana's marriage broke down and she moved back to her home town, and they soon fell in love and moved in together. Discovery: They were both abandoned as infants and spent their lives searching for their mothers called Maria . Still unable . to forget the give up the search for her mother, last month Adriana . decided to contact a a radio station in their town to ask for help - and . this week the two were reunited live on air. But . at the end of the interview on Radio Globo's 'The Time Is Now' programme, which specialises in finding lost relatives, the mother . revealed she also had a son who didn't know her, Leandro. A phenomenon called genetic sexual attraction can occur when estranged relatives meet for the first time as adults. Feelings of intense intimacy can be confused as the brain struggles to associate each other as family. When families grow up together, an inherent taboo is created which desensitises them to sexual attraction. It is known as the Westermarck effect but is missing from relatives who do not know each other. As . it becomes clear that it is the same Leandro that she was married to, . Adriana is heard weeping uncontrollably: 'I don't believe that you're . telling me this. Leandro is my husband,' she sobs. At the end of the interview she says: 'Now I'm scared to go home and find out that Leandro doesn't want me any more. I love him so much.' Adriana and Leandro - who never married legally - yesterday told Radio Globo that they would stay together, despite the bombshell that they are actually brother and sister. Adriana said: 'Only death is going to separate us. All this happened because God wanted it to happen. 'Of course it would have been different if we had known all this before, but we didn't and we fell in love. 'We thought it was funny that both our mothers had the same name, but it is a common name so we just thought it was a coincidence. 'At first we were really knocked by it all. But we had a family meeting and told everyone that we are going to stay husband and wife, whatever anyone might think. 'We have so many plans together, nothing's going to break us up, nothing.' The couple said they don't blame their mother for leaving them, have spoken with her a number of times since and plan to meet up soon.","Adriana, 39, and husband Leandro, 37, both abandoned as infants in Brazil .

"The second teenager accused of brutally killing a 16-year-old West Virginia girl because she no longer wanted to be her friend will be tried as an adult. Sheila Eddy, 16, was identified Wednesday by prosecutors as the second teen that lured Skylar Neese to a remote wooded area to stab her to death July 6, 2012 to avoid being her friend. Investigators found Ms Eddy's body six months after the horrific slaying, but only after Ms Shoaf confessed to the brutal murder. She has since pleaded guilty as part of a deal with prosecutors and is awaiting sentencing. Cold blooded? Shelia Eddy, 16, pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and will be tried as an adult . Friends: Rachel Shoaf (on the right in both pictures) has confessed to stabbing Skylar Neese (left) to death last summer . Tragic: Police chased numerous leads in trying to find Neese with no luck. Until Shoaf came forward . Ms Eddy will likely plead not guilty and head to trial, according to prosecutors, much to the disappointment of the slain girl's father. 'I don't want to hear the grisly details of how Skylar was murdered,' Dave Neese said. 'I don't want to hear how she screamed and cried. But I do want these girls to get what they deserve.' Proceedings will be held in open court going forward, prosecutors announced this week. She even helped in the search: Ms Eddy acted like she was sad the girl she allegedly killed was missing, even helping to look for her . Prosecutors have said they will recommend Ms Shoaf receive a 20-year sentence, but the confessed killer faces as much as 40 years behind bars. Court documents offer no insight into the motive for the crime. On May 1, Skylar's father said the only reason he could think of was that they 'didn't like her any more.' WDTV reported that Dave Neese stated: 'They didn't like her anymore. That's the only response I got. 'I want a reason, I want some kind of reason (for this to) happen. There is no reason I don't care if you have the best reason in the world, but there's no reason (for this to happen).' What went wrong?: The three girls were said to be inseparable friends before Neese was stabbed to death because the two teens allegedly no longer liked her . Neese added of Rachel Shoaf: 'I feel bad for your parents and I hope you rot in hell.' The victim was last seen on surveillance video leaving her family's apartment voluntarily and getting into a car on July 6, 2012. She was initially considered a runaway, but her parents soon suspected she was abducted. Police chased numerous leads with no luck. The break finally came when Shoaf admitted plotting with another girl to kill her – shocking even the investigators working the case. Skylar Neese disappeared in July 2012 and was initially thought to be a runaway but her parents soon suspected she had been abducted . The two girls were charged with . luring the straight-A student at University High School out of her . family's apartment in the middle of the night, stabbing her to death at . an agreed-upon moment and hiding her body under branches in a . Pennsylvania township about 30 miles away from her house, according to . court documents. The pair had spent time with Neese's mother after the slaying and even helped with the search. The cold calculation and brutality of . the plot shocked a community already frustrated by the slow pace and . secrecy surrounding the case. Charged: Rachel Shoaf, of Morgantown, pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Skylar Neese and she awaits sentencing in a juvenile detention center . Investigators have said little since announcing the charges three weeks ago. People sit in the chairs at John's . Barber Shop, gaze at Neese's photo on a bulletin board and wonder: How . could anyone so young plot to kill a classmate and friend? 'They look as normal as any other kid . that you could ever see,' said barber BJ McClead. 'Not kids you would . think would have anything to do with anything like this.' The other girl's identity is, for now, shrouded by the confidentiality of juvenile court. Though McClead says most people in town have figured out who it is, it's unclear how long the three girls had been friends or just how close they were. It's also unclear whether prosecutors will try to have the second suspect charged as an adult, as Shoaf was. 'People are confused. They're like, ""What is taking so long?""' said McClead, whose daughter Hayden had been friends with Neese since junior high. 'It's ridiculous. Who's protecting these girls?' said the barber, who still hands out red-and-yellow bracelets bearing the victim's name. 'Three families' lives are now ruined because of this heinous crime that these girls committed.' Monongalia County Prosecutor Marcia Ashdown has refused to return repeated calls seeking comment. The mystery began last July when Neese climbed out of her bedroom window. Surveillance video showed her getting . into a car at the end of her street in a quiet residential neighborhood . near West Virginia University. With no sign of fear, no money and no contact lenses, she apparently expected to return. Shock: In Star City, West Virginia, the community was shaken. Barber BJ McClead (pictured) said of the accused: 'They look as normal as any other kid that you could ever see.' When . she didn't, Dave and Mary Neese worried. Police initially suspected . their daughter was a runaway, but they knew better. They walked up and . down Crawford Street with Neese's photo, then plastered fliers . everywhere. 'You couldn't go 5 feet without seeing her,' said 24-year-old Brittany Crouse, who moved in around the time of the disappearance. 'Everybody really, really wanted her to come home.' For months, police chased down tips to no avail. The transcript from Shoaf's hearing shows the break came January 3, when she finally told investigators the truth - and where to find the body. But it wasn't until March that authorities confirmed it was Neese, and silence followed until the day of the plea hearing. Accused killers: Eddy (right) makes faces with confessed killer Rachel Shoaf (left) while tweeting a picture that describes their friendship . 'I think police who were involved in the front lines of that interview and that part of the investigation were stunned at Rachel Shoaf's confession,' Ashdown told Judge Russell Clawges that day. 'She confessed to a plan and conspiracy with another juvenile to kill Skylar Neese. A plan carried out.' The three girls drove to Wayne Township, Pa., got out of the car and the suspects pretended to socialize with Neese. 'And, at a planned and agreed upon moment,' Ashdown said, the girls 'attacked and stabbed Skylar to death, and they left her there.' They tried to bury Neese, she said, but covered her with branches when they couldn't. In . the five-page court file on Shoaf, prosecutors say they plan to . recommend a 20-year prison sentence. But she could get as many as 40 . years under the law. Mystery: People in the small West Virginia town had wondered for months about Skylar Neese. She vanished after slipping out the bedroom of her Star City home in July 2012 . Shoaf's family issued a public apology through a lawyer but has made no further statements. 'There is no way to describe the pain that we, too, are feeling,' they said. 'We are truly sorry for the pain that she has caused the Neese family, and we know her actions are unforgivable and inexcusable. 'Our daughter has admitted her involvement and she has accepted responsibility for her actions. 'Our hearts are broken for your loss,' they told the Neese family, 'and we are still trying to come to terms with this event.' Mary Neese has declined interview requests. But the family has tried to spare others their agony, persuading legislators to pass 'Skylar's Law' earlier this year. Tribute: A Facebook image created by Skylar Neese's friends as they all prayed she would show up . Under the law, Amber Alerts are no longer limited to kidnappings in West Virginia. Even when authorities suspect a child is a runaway, information is turned over to Amber Alert officials. The transcript of Shoaf's hearing shows other students also had suspicions, chattering on social media about all three girls. A few overheard a conversation between the suspects about the plot but waited to report it. The teenagers thought it was a joke, Ashdown told the judge, 'but only later decided and believed it was all too true and all too prophetic.' McClead marvels that two teenage girls could maintain their deception from July to January. 'Some of the criminals that are locked up for life aren't that hard.'","Sheila Eddy, 16, was publicly identified Wednesday by prosecutors and will be tried as an adult .

"An Israeli Iron Dome operator is claiming that he witnessed 'the hand of God' diverting an incoming Hamas rocket into the sea. The commander claims that the divine intervention stopped the death of hundreds of Israeli citizens. Israel's Iron Dome system allows it to shoot down incoming rockets or mortars headed toward major population centres in Israel. Scroll down for video . An Israeli Iron Dome operator is claiming he witnessed the hand of God' diverting an incoming Hamas rocket into the sea . Israel Today translated a report from a Hebrew-language news site, which carried the man's report after about an incoming rocket headed toward Tel Aviv last week. The commander recalled: 'A missile was fired from Gaza. Iron Dome precisely calculated [its trajectory]. 'We know where these missiles are going to land down to a radius of 200 meters. This particular missile was going to hit either the Azrieli Towers, the Kirya (Israel's equivalent of the Pentagon) or [a central Tel Aviv railway station]. Hundreds could have died. The defence system has emerged as a game-changer in the current round of violence with Israeli officials citing a success rate as high as 90 per cent . 'We fired the first [interceptor]. It missed. Second [interceptor]. It missed. This is very rare. I was in shock. The defence system has been highly effective in the current round of violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip - Israeli officials say it has a success rate as high as 90 percent. The commander explains that with 'just four seconds' until the missile landed the military warned emergency services to be on standby. 'Suddenly, Iron Dome (which calculates wind speeds, among other things) shows a major wind coming from the east, a strong wind that … sends the missile into the sea. We were all stunned. I stood up and shouted, 'There is a God!,' he said. 'I witnessed this miracle with my own eyes. It was not told or reported to me. I saw the hand of God send that missile into the sea.' On Monday President Barack Obama signed a bill granting an additional $225 million in U.S. taxpayer dollars for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system . Iron Dome uses radar, advanced tracking technology and anti-missile batteries to follow the trajectory of an incoming rocket or mortar and determine if it is headed for a major population center. If an urban area is threatened, interceptors are fired to detonate in the air in close proximity to the missile. Projectiles not posing a threat are allowed to fall in empty fields. The system targets short-range rockets with a range between two miles and 45 miles; interceptors cost as much $100,000 apiece. Created by Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Iron Dome has enjoyed strong U.S. technological and financial support. On Monday President Barack Obama signed a bill granting an additional $225 million in U.S. taxpayer dollars for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. The U.S. has provided hundreds of millions of dollars for Iron Dome in the past. The new package is intended to replenish Israel's capabilities. Congress approved the money last week before lawmakers left for their annual summer break. Obama signed the bill in the late afternoon in the Oval Office with a handful of photographers present.","The commander claims that the divine intervention stopped the missile .

"Teen detective: Connor Kendall managed to track down the thief who burgled his family home in just one hour . It was a bit of detective work that even Sherlock Holmes would be proud of after a teenager tracked down a thief who burgled his family home - in just one hour. Connor Kendall, 16, was told by police that there was little hope of ever finding the burglar who got away with a £1,000 haul - including a digital camera, camcorder, a laptop, and wristwatch - from his family home in Cornwall. But he decided to take matters into his own hands and incredibly the amateur sleuth had things wrapped up in no time when he managed to track down the culprits himself. Connor and three friends went into Bodmin near where he lives and began talking to local youngsters, friends and neighbours to find out if anyone knew anything. After just 60 minutes of investigating the burglary, they discovered that someone was trying to sell his watch on a Facebook page. Connor showed the page to police who arrested 22-year-old Jamie Fisher, from Roche, Cornwall - who has now been jailed for 28 months. Connor said: 'I contacted some of my mates and we found out that someone was trying to sell a laptop and cameras to people. 'We decided to go out and try to find the person who was selling them because they sounded like the things stolen from my house. 'We found some boys who said it was Jamie Fisher and the watch was on his Facebook. The whole thing took an hour.' Truro Crown Court heard Connor decided to take his own action after returning to his house and discovering the burglary on October 16. The kitchen window of the home was ajar and the back door unlocked. Connor rounded up three friends Zak . Landert, Jake Campbell, and Alex Long and began asking around until . someone showed them the Facebook page. Team effort: Connor Kendall, pictured far left, was helped by three friends, pictured from left to right, Jake Campbell, Alex Long and Zak Landert . Police gathered the information from their young helper and arrested Fisher, who admitted the burglary. Connor’s father, water technician Kevin Kendall, 51, said: 'They went into town and asked people around their age if they knew whether the items were being sold somewhere. 'The name of Jamie Fisher came up and that was the case solved. The laptop is still missing but, thanks to Connor and his friends, everything else was found. 'It’s a bit of a worry thinking about him talking to people who might know criminals but they all did an excellent job and I’m very proud.' Justice: Burglar Jamie Fisher, 22, was  jailed for 28 months at Truro Crown Court . Fisher told the court he entered the property because he had no money and was not in receipt of benefits. The court heard Fisher sold the laptop for £30 to buy cannabis but the other items were recovered. The total value of the laptop, two digital cameras and the wristwatch Fisher stole was £960 - of which £330 worth was returned. Sentencing Fisher to 28 months in prison, Judge John Neligan said: 'You may have got away with it but for the young man’s detective work.'","Burglar stole £1,000 haul - including digital camera, camcorder, laptop, and wristwatch - from Connor Kendall's family home in Cornwall .

"President Christian Wulff is though to be about to leave his office amid an escalating scandal . He is alleged to have accepted free holidays from wealthy friends, upgrades on airlines and discounted cars . Germany's president resigned in disgrace yesterday after failing to gag newspapers investigating him over political favours. The resignation of Christian Wulff – a victory for Press freedom – is an embarrassing blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had hand-picked her political ally as president. In a curt statement at the presidential palace in Berlin, Mr Wulff said he had lost the trust of the German people, making it impossible to continue in a role meant to serve as a moral compass for the nation. Close: Christian Wulff, pictured with  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been forced to resign after trying to gag newspapers investigating political favours . He was forced to resign after trying to stop German newspapers investigating a home loan scandal involving more than £430,000 received from a businessman friend’s wife – allegations taken up by prosecutors. Mr Wulff, 52, whose role was mainly ceremonial, admitted making a ‘grave mistake’ by leaving a message on the answering machine of the editor of Germany’s best-selling Bild newspaper threatening ‘war’ if the daily published a story about his private finance dealings. He was later criticised for accepting free upgrades on holiday flights for himself and his family as well as staying free of charge at the villas of wealthy businessmen. The media continued to delve into his dealings and on Thursday state prosecutors in Hanover – his former power base as governor of Lower Saxony – asked parliament to end Mr Wulff’s legal immunity over accusations he accepted favours. Problems: Ms Merkel's Germany is leading the fight to save the Euro and this news will come as a bitter blow . The move was a prelude to opening an investigation into him. It is the first time prosecutors have sought to investigate a German president and the decision triggered opposition calls for him to go. Mrs Merkel, who postponed a trip to Rome yesterday, said she regretted Mr Wulff’s departure. He is the second president to step down in two years. His predecessor, Horst Koehler, resigned unexpectedly in 2010 after coming under fire for comments he made about the German mission in Afghanistan. Der Spiegel, the prestigious news magazine, had taken up the gauntlet laid down by the popular Bild, saying: ‘All of the revelations come together to form . . . a picture of a character that revolves around three concepts: perks, upgrades and self-abasement. These concepts run counter to what is expected of a politician in a democracy. ‘Wulff . . . doesn’t want to pay the prices a normal citizen would have to pay for his lifestyle, for such expenses as his house, his car and his vacations. Wulff uses his public offices to secure discounts . . . They give him the privilege to accept perks from rich friends or companies – who hope to get something in return.’ Mr Wulff’s resignation reflects badly on Mrs Merkel’s judgment  as she pushed for his election in June 2010 against an opposition candidate backed by most Germans. She said she would talk to the opposition this time to find a consensus candidate.","President Christian Wulff is though to be about to leave his office amid an escalating scandal .

"A heavily pregnant mother drowned her three small children in the bath and scrawled ‘I love you x’ on their bodies before leaping to her death, an inquest heard yesterday. Police who went to Fiona Anderson’s home after finding her body at the bottom of a multi-storey car park discovered the children tucked up in their mother’s bed with their teddies. All three had lipstick kisses on their forehead, and messages written on the wall included: ‘I love them and I’m going to keep them safe.’ Tragedy: Fiona Anderson pictured on CCTV  at the house where her ex-boyfriend was staying two hours before she killed herself. Unknown to anyone else her three children were already dead . Siblings: Levina, three, Addy, two, and 11-month-old Kyden were two months from having another sister . Anderson, 23, killed the two boys and a girl aged between 11 months and three after her former partner, the children’s father, said he was in a new relationship. The tragic deaths left social services in the dock yesterday as the inquest heard the family were known to child protection officers. Social workers visited them more than 50 times between 2009 and last year and were aware the two older children had been sleeping in a double buggy and fed on biscuits. A serious case review by independent expert Ron Lock for Suffolk Local Safeguarding Children Board said the family were considered ‘hard to reach’ because of Anderson’s ‘unwavering and determined’ refusal to engage with staff. Inquest: The hearing today heard 'Fiona Anderson loved her children but that she was extremely emotionally disturbed' when she killed them . Captured: Fiona Anderson clutching a teddy bear minutes before she fell to her death in Lowestoft . Child protection plans were allowed to ‘drift’ and while legal intervention was considered, no court action was taken. Anderson’s refusal to co-operate also meant her mental health was never assessed. Mr Lock said the deaths were not foreseeable but concluded: ‘If the children had been placed into care this could have avoided this tragic outcome.’ Anderson was seen wandering around Lowestoft in Suffolk clutching a teddy bear for 90 minutes on April 15 last year before jumping to her death. Her unborn baby, who was due two months later, died with her. When police went to her flat in the town they found the bodies of Levina, three, Addy, two, and 11-month-old Kyden. She had written ‘I love you x’ with a small heart on their stomachs and they all had lipstick kisses on their foreheads. Scrawled on the walls were messages including: ‘I put them to bed with their bears – they loved their bears.’ Another said: ‘They’re cuddled up together sleeping. They look so peaceful.’ Tragedy: Levina, three, Addy, two, and 11-month-old Kyden, all died at their home in Lowestoft, Suffolk, having been drowned by their mother . Loss: Fiona Anderson was heavily pregnant when she died and her death led police to her home where the bodies of her three children were found. She had split from ex Craig McLelland, pictured today . Officers discovered evidence they had been drowned in the bath. A post-mortem examination found nothing to suggest they had been restrained or assaulted. Anderson had the names of each of her children written on her body, along with the name Eve for her unborn daughter. Chief Inspector Andy Smith told the hearing in Bury St Edmunds that Anderson had argued the night before with the children’s father, Craig McClellan, after he told her he was in a new relationship. She told him, ‘Say goodnight to the children as it’s the last time you’ll see them’, before stabbing him, the inquest heard. Mr McClellan, who also lives in Lowestoft, was treated at a hospital but told police he had been attacked in the street by a stranger. ‘He later told us he lied to protect Fiona and stop the children being taken into care,’ Mr Smith said. The officer added that a torn-up letter found in a bin provided a ‘harrowing insight’ into Anderson’s state of mind. ‘She felt unable to cope with the situation and apologetically outlined her intention to take the children with her,’ he said. ‘In her words: “A mother never abandons her children”.’ Coroner Dr Peter Dean said: ‘It seems there were missed opportunities to engage with a non-engaging family. ‘It was perhaps wise, instead of doing the same thing for 18 months, to stop what you’re doing and see if there is a different way.’ Dr Dean said he didn’t want to ‘imply liability’, but ‘the required steps were not approached to psychologically assess’ Anderson. Bereft: Father Craig McLellan pictured with his children (left to right) Addy Kyden and Levina and arriving with his mother to lay flowers after their deaths . Investigation: Police found the children in their mother's double bed and she had also written messages all over the walls . Police: Chief detective Inspector Andy Smith (left) and Bob Cook, chairman of the Suffolk safeguarding panel . Recording a verdict of unlawful killing for the three children and suicide for their mother, he added: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that Fiona dearly loved her children. ‘It’s clear – through her abnormal perception of her circumstances and her subsequent actions of what she thought was in their best interests at the time – the need to help these families and spot psychological and behaviour problems. She was clearly a social and psychological risk and what she did was extreme.’ The coroner said he would write to Health Minister Norman Lamb about the case because it highlighted the need for more awareness of parents with mental health issues and how to provide support for them. Mr Smith, speaking on behalf of Mr McClellan, said: ‘He loves his children dearly and always will. He hopes that following today’s proceedings he can try to move forward and rebuild his life.’ Sue Cook, Suffolk County Council’s director for children and young people’s services, said: ‘Some families can be harder to engage with than others which can make the task of protecting children even more complex.’ The council had introduced changes following recommendations in the serious case review, she added.

"Every school child in Los Angeles is to be given an iPad following a $30million deal with Apple. The Los Angeles Unified School District announced on Tuesday the decision after teachers voted iPads the cheapest product and the best quality in the market. iPads will now be handed out in 47 schools to give students from low-income households a better chance in the classroom as new national and state tests are to be taken on the devices. Core issue: Each school student in Los Angeles is to get an iPad to use in class . Supt. John Deasy said that the tablet project would be paid for using school construction bonds that are repaid over decades, according to the LA Times. By only using Apple devices, the school district will pay out millions of dollars to the California-based company over the next two years. Mr Deasy and another board member did not take part in the vote on the iPads because each has stock in Apple. Each iPad will cost $678 which is more than the retail price because it comes with special educational software. Students will be allowed to take the devices home and although there will be blocks put in place for damaging material like pornography, children will be able to access social media. However there were critics of the scheme including board member Richard Vladovic. He admitted that he had already dropped and broken two iPads and there was a danger students could do the same. Big investment: Apple Inc. is set to make millions of dollars from the deal with the LA school district .",iPads will be handed out in 47 schools across the California city .
"The Jordanian air force pilot filmed being burned to death by Islamic State extremists was heavily sedated and unaware of what was about to happen, it has been claimed. A report in Saudi Arabia's burnews.com claims ISIS militants admitted giving Moaz al-Kasasbeh drugs so that he did not scream as flames consumed his body during his grotesque execution. Jordan has struck back hard following the circulation of the video last week, hitting the militant group's territory with 56 air strikes in three days and executing two ISIS-linked prisoners. Drugged? A report in Saudi media claims Islamic State militants drugged Jordanian fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh before filming the video that shows him being locked in a cage and burned alive . Little pain: The report also cites unspecified observers who said that Kasasbeh's 'sensory centres' burned away quickly, sparing him the agony of the inferno as it consumed him . Brutal: Titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film posted last week showed the captured airman locked in a cage before a trail of petrol leading up to its bars is set alight by masked Islamic State militants . Burnews.com reports that Kasasbeh's apparent resignation to his fate, as well as his apparently heroic stoicism as his petrol-soaked jumpsuit burst into flames, was due to heavy sedation. The report also cites  unspecified 'observers' it says conducted a detailed study of the video, who concluded that that Kasasbeh's 'sensory centres' burned quickly, leaving him unable to feel the pain of the inferno. 'It is important to note that [Kasasbeh] seemed unconscious and unaware of what awaits him and not, as some have said, that he is not afraid,' the site quotes these observers as saying. Titled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film posted last week showed the captured airman locked in a cage before a trail of petrol leading up to its bars is set alight. Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the captured pilot. Martyr: Kasasbeh was downed over Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria, and held for almost a month. Right, his wife Anwar Tarawneh, holds a photo of him before his grotesque execution was confirmed . Nation in mourning: Queen Rania of Jordan consoles Miss Tarawneh after the video showing her husband being burned to death was released by militants from Islamic State last week . After the footage was released, Jordanian officials promised to retaliate harshly and quickly executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS. This included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. King Abdullah II later said Jordan's response would 'be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.' In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'. The United States and several Arab allies, including Jordan, have been striking ISIS in Syria since September 23, after the militant group seized control of large areas of Iraq and Syria last year and declared a 'caliphate'. Warplanes from the U.S. and other countries have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer.","Saudi news site claims ISIS militants admitted drugging Moaz al-Kasasbeh .

"Apple iPhone 4S: The smartphone's Safari browser is the most popular mobile web browser - Google is alleged to have bypassed privacy features built into the browser . Google and Facebook may have used a computer 'trick' that allows them to . monitor web browsing via Apple's Safari browser to build up advertising 'profiles' - circumventing Apple's . safety measures. The search giant bypassed privacy settings built into Apple's Safari web browser on iPhones,  PCs and Macs, according to a recent report. Other advertising companies, and Facebook, reportedly used a similar method. Safari is the most popular mobile web browser, used in all models of Apple's iPhone and iPad. Google allegedly circumvented the protection to build up profiles of web users, using a 'cookie' that collected advertising information. The move has caused outcry among privacy advocates. It comes shortly after EU privacy groups wrote to the search giant to ask it to 'halt' a new privacy policy that would allow it to 'share' customer data between services such as Search, Gmail and YouTube. Google allegedly used a 'trick' which sends a blank message to the browser to make it accept unauthorised 'cookies'. Apple says it is 'working to put a stop' to the practice. The code was uncovered by a Stanford University researcher Jonathan Mayer and was reported in the Wall Street Journal. Google has since disabled the code, and claims that the report is in error, and that its cookies only collected anonymous information. The revelation caused outcry among online privacy advocates. San Francisco's Electronic Frontier Foundation says, 'Coming on the heels of Google's controversial decision to tear down the privacy-protective walls between some of its other services, this is bad news for the company. 'It's time for Google to acknowledge that it can do a better job of respecting the privacy of Web users.' Google says that the report was in error. 'The Journal mischaracterizes what happened and why,' says a spokesperson. 'We used known Safari functionality to provide features that signed-in Google users had enabled. It’s important to stress that these advertising cookies do not collect personal information.' Under fire: Google is accused of 'bypassing' Apple's privacy protection to gather advertising information . 'Unlike other major browsers, Apple’s Safari browser blocks third-party cookies by default,' says the spokesperson. 'However, Safari enables many web features for its users that rely on third parties and third-party cookies, such as 'Like' buttons.  Last year, we began using this functionality to enable features for signed-in Google users on Safari.'To enable these features, we created a temporary communication link between Safari browsers and Google’s servers, so that we could ascertain whether Safari users were also signed into Google, and had opted for this type of personalization.''However, the Safari browser contained functionality that then enabled other Google advertising cookies to be set on the browser.  We didn’t anticipate that this would happen, and we have now started removing these advertising cookies from Safari browsers.

Prince Harry, pictured above in Las Vegas in 2012, was said to have invited 10 women to party with him at his VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel, including Miss Reichert . Dressed in raunchy bondage gear, Reichert likes to belittle and humiliate her clients – earning up to $5,000 a time. In the video she wears a black PVC basque, knee-high boots and circles a bound, naked, masked man as he pants and cowers on the floor. She tells the whimpering man, 'You're so pathetic' before spanking him with a black paddle whip. Reichert claims she kissed a naked Prince Harry in a 20-minute 'drunken fumble' at his penthouse hotel room during the famous Las Vegas party in August 2012. She said in a newspaper interview at the time: 'We kissed, he was naked at the time, and pretty open. It was a drunken fumble. It wasn't romantic, just fun. 'He was a gentleman, but he was so wasted. The alcohol affected him. I was there for 15 to 20 minutes.' Now it can be revealed that the blonde charges $5,000 to $10,000 dollars for private BDSM sessions in her New Orleans apartment. A source said: 'Carrie [who also uses the code name Ms X] has a dungeon in a room at her place with big bed restraints and a St Andrew's cross which she ties men to and whips them. 'She also has Christian Grey-style racks with all her instruments and sex toys laid out on them - like paddles, nipple clamps and cat-of-nine-tail whips. Busted: The bedraggled 'party girl' Carrie Reichert posing for a jail booking photo. The 40-year-old, was arrested on check fraud charges and jailed in Mississippi earlier this year . 'She charges $1,000 for appearances at parties and for private sessions she can earn as much as $5,000 depending on how extreme the client wants to go. 'Recently she filmed a series of X-rated DVDs for her private clients. 'Rarely does she have sex with clients - she's had some really strange people so far but she enjoys it.' Earlier this year, Reichert performed a striptease show in which she used underpants she claimed belonged to Prince Harry. The routine – which she performed at the Harry Mohney Erotic Heritage Museum in Las Vegas in January – involved her taking off the outfit she wore on the night she allegedly met the young royal before twirling the underpants she claims he gifted to her. Reichert, who lied that she was 32 when she spoke about the royal party in 2012, claims she has now donated the underpants, along with a string bikini she wore, to the museum. Kensington Palace has previously denied Reichert was one of 10 women invited back to the Prince's VIP suite at the Encore at Wynn hotel and dismissed her story as 'untrue'. Reichert is the only woman to have ever spoken out about the prince's wild night. She claims she was hand picked by a member of the royal entourage as she hung out by the pool at the Encore and invited to the Prince's penthouse suite. British-born Reichert, 40, says she performed a routine involving her taking off the outfit she wore on the night she met the prince and will twirl his undergarments . The dominatrix previously told how Prince Harry was already naked when she entered the room and was playing air guitar with a pool cue and giving 'random naked hugs'. Among other shocking claims she made at the time, the pole dancer said that high-spirited Harry pressed his naked body up against the giant window of his suite and declared: 'Look at me, Vegas, these are the royal jewels.' Later, the prince was photographed on a cell phone wearing nothing but a necklace while a naked female guest hid behind him during a game of strip pool. Another photo showed him giving the same topless woman a naked bear hug. The photos - which have since been seen by tens of millions across the world – caused acute embarrassment for the royal family as well as raising security fears about how well the prince was protected on his Vegas trip. Just weeks after the party, Reichert spent a month in Harrison County Jail in Mississippi after being arrested for a $22,000 check fraud.","Carrie Reichert claimed to have partied with the prince in his hotel in 2012 .

"Menace: The Tineola bisselliella moth  has infected the Olympic village . They came in the dead of night, attracted by a blaze of light so vast it could be seen from miles away. To an inquisitive moth, the Olympic village must have looked like paradise - 9,000 brand new wardrobes, each containing enough clothing to see athletes through two weeks of the Games. Or, to put it another way, a fortnight of prime packed lunches for Tineola bisselliella and its pesky cousin pellionella. For the Olympic park is at the centre of an area infested with fabric-chomping moths - and Stratford was pinpointed yesterday as one of the worst hit areas in the UK. Don't even dare to imagine what might happen should they chance to munch on the women's beach volleyball bikinis. Perish the thought that British athletes will parade proudly in uniforms that invite critics to describe our opening ceremony as moth-eaten. And forget the fact that so much unpalatable Lycra and man-made 'performance fibres' will deter the larvae of the common clothes moth (bisselliella) or the case-bearing clothes moth (pellionella). With this many people concentrated into such a small area, there is enough grub here for a plague of biblical proportions. The revelation that the Olympic stadium's recently assigned E20 postcode is a hot-spot for moth invasion came from anti-moth and homecare company Caraselledirect. It monitors pest control sales daily . to determine which areas are most affected. On a moth map of the UK, . Stratford is plotted at the epicentre of what it described as an . escalating 'epidemic'. Figures . suggest the problem is 40 times bigger than in Newcastle upon Tyne, for . example; nearly 400 times worse than in Belfast; and greater than in . the whole of Scotland. On the menu? Members of Team GB model their  Olympic kit as they arrive at the Olympic Village yesterday . Rich pickings: The Olympic village has  9,000 brand new wardrobes, each containing enough clothing to see athletes through two weeks of the Games . 'They show no respect for Savile Row suits, Primark jumpers or athletes' outfits,' said the firms moth expert, Jonathan Beriland. 'Anything they can get their teeth into - jackets, trousers, underpants - will become a casualty.' London and the south east saw a big increase in moth populations recently because of unseasonal or prolonged spells of cold, wet weather. That meant homes, offices (and flats in the Olympic village) kept windows closed and heat on - perfect conditions for moths to lay eggs that turn into cloth-eating larvae. Females can lay 40 eggs in three weeks, producing larvae which may carry on chomping for up to a year before pupating. No doubt granny would simply have shaken out the clothes and stocked up on pongy mothballs. Don't even think about it! Members of the Australian beach volleyball team during a training session at Horse Guards Parade yesterday . By . the time athletes notice any adult moths flying out of their wardrobes, . however, the seeds of sartorial disaster will already have been sown. Ironically, the Stratford stadium . boats that 'sustainable development' has provided new habitats for a . host of species, including the toadflax brocade moth, whose larvae spurn . athletics gear in favour of the plant from which it takes its name. But . even recently revamped security measures, plus surface to air missiles, . appear to not to have stopped the airborne cloth-destroyers . infiltrating. Olympic . officials said yesterday they had 'not been overwhelmed' by complaints . about masticated clothing, or by reports of munching sounds from inside . athletes' wardrobes (which, it is understood, have no moth protection). But one did report that an American athlete spent an uncomfortable night swatting moths after leaving his balcony doors open and dozing off with the light on. Finally, a terrifying thought. Just where did those big holes in the Olympic rings come from?","London and south east have seen a big .

"The mother of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects is set to travel to the U.S. today with her ex-husband, nearly a week after one of their reign of terror came to an end. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, who now lives in Dagestan, Russia, said in an emotional telephone interview that she believes her sons, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, have been framed for the bombings. The suspects' father, Anzor Tsarnaev, has already been interviewed by Russian and American authorities there - and will also travel to the U.S. to be interviewed by investigators. Speaking out on Wednesday, Mrs Tsarnaeva launched into a bizarre rant in . which she claims she does not care if she or her youngest son are killed . by U.S. authorities. Scroll down for video . Rant: Zubeirat Tsarnaena, the Boston bombers' mother, has said she does not care if her surviving son is killed . Their eldest son, Tamerlan, 26, died . after a shootout with police in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday, . while her youngest, Dzhokhar, 19, is in hospital recovering from a bullet wound . to the neck. 'If they are going to kill him, I don't . care,' she told CNN of Dzhokhar. 'My oldest one is killed, so I don't care. I don't care is my . youngest one is going to be killed today. I want the world to hear this. And I don't care if I am going to get killed too. And I will say . Allahu akbar!' While Dzhokhar was reportedly injured from a self-inflicted gun shot wound as he sought to hide from police in a boat parked in a backyard, his mother said she does not believe this account. 'You know what I think? I think now they . will try to make my Dzhokhar guilty because they took away his voice, . his ability to talk to the world... They did not want the truth to come . out,' she said. She added that the only reason her sons were targeted was because they were Muslim, adding that she saw footage of Tamerlan being killed 'really cruelly.' U.S. authorities are on their way to speak with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva in the aftermath of the bombings. Suspects: Dzhokhar, right, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are accused of planting the Boston bombs at the historic race on April 15 . Investigators traveled to southern Russia on Tuesday to speak to Mrs Tsarnaeva and her husband Anzor, an American Embassy official said. But if she returns to the U.S. to see . her son - as she reportedly intends to as early as Thursday - she could . be arrested, thanks to an outstanding shoplifting charge. Busted: Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, was arrested last year after she allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothing from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store . ABC News reported on Tuesday that Mrs Tsarnaeva failed to show up at a court hearing stemming from a July 2012 arrest. So if she returns to the U.S. to visit her hospitalized son or make burial arrangements for the other, she . could be arrested on an outstanding warrant. Mrs Tsarnaeva, 45, allegedly stole $1,600 worth of clothes from a Massachusetts Lord & Taylor store. She was charged with two . counts of malicious/wanton damage and defacement to property after . allegedly swiping the merchandise from the retailer's Natick, . Massachusetts location in June 2012. She was due in court on October 25 for a hearing in the case, but never showed up. The Lord & Taylor location is . not the same as the one on Boyleston Street in Boston, where a . surveillance camera captured what police say is her younger son . dropping a pressure cooker bomb that was hidden inside a backpack. The family's lawyer Heda Saratova, asked for the family to be left alone and said that the parents had just seen . pictures of the body of their elder son and were not up to . speaking with anyone. Questioning: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, mother of Boston bombing suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, leaves her home for the first time on Tuesday in Dagestan with an unidentified man . Grief: Zubeidat Tsarnaeva is pictured outside her home in Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim province in Russia's Caucasus . 'The mother is in very bad shape,' Saratova said. 'She watches the video and cries.' The images, taken by a resident of Watertown, Massachusetts and posted on his blog, appear to show the Tsarnaev . brothers sheltering behind a vehicle and taking aim at police . officers. They are reportedly seen running to a car for more supplies before . hauling out a pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the . street with smoke. The photographs, taken on the . eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom overlooking the . scene, are the first images giving insight into the fraught battle that . left one brother dead. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev then jumped in the car . and barreled towards the police barricade, making a narrow escape. Authorities said that he ran over his brother Tamerlan. Dad: U.S. investigators traveled to southern Russia on Tuesday to speak to Mrs Tsarnaeva and the brothers' father Anzor, pictured, an American Embassy official said . Their mother told Channel 4 on Tuesday that her sons had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks. She said: 'What happened is a terrible thing but I know my kids have nothing to do with this. I know it, I am mother.' She added to CNN that she had spoken . to Tamerlan after the bombings and he told her he missed her and loved . her, and she said her 'loving' son even inquired about the cat. The trip by the U.S. team was made . possible because of Russian government cooperation with the FBI . investigation into the bombing at the Boston Marathon. Also on Tuesday, the bombers' sister, . Ailena and Bella Tsarnaev, released a statement to the media, saying . that they 'don't have the answers' about their brothers' alleged crimes. Battle: The eyewitness said the men ran to the green sedan, left, for more supplies such as explosives . Threat: In another image, a red circle shows what the eyewitness believed to be a pressure cooker bomb . Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening . The statement read: 'Our heart goes . out the victims of last week's bombing. It saddens us to see so many . innocent people hurt after such a callous act. 'As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused. 'We . don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation . and hope to learn more. We ask the media to respect our privacy during . this difficult time.' The mother is from Dagestan, while the suspects' father is from neighboring Chechnya. Their . sons had spent little time in either place before the family moved to . the U.S. a decade ago, but the elder son was in Russia for six months . last year. Shielded: Katherine Russell, the widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, leaves her lawyer's office on Tuesday .

"An NHS clinic is treating transgender children as young as 12 with drug therapies to prepare them for a sex change, it has been revealed. More than 20 youngsters with 'gender dysphoria' are being prescribed hormone blockers by doctors at the Tavistock Clinic in north London. The treatment halts the onset of puberty - preventing children from developing the sexual characteristics of the gender they were born. Controversial: The Tavistock Clinic in north London is prescribing hormone blockers to children as young as 12 . The clinic started offering the medication in 2011 as part of a study to determine whether transgender children could benefit from starting treatment earlier than in the past, according to The Sunday Times. It was initially deemed controversial due to the patients' ages - with critics arguing that the youngsters lacked the ability to consent to the therapies. However, since then, the clinic has received a staggering 142 referrals of children aged 11 to 15 from parents and carers. Dr Polly Carmichael, director of the Tavistock Clinic's gender identity service, said she plans to continue offering the treatment to youngsters after the study culminates in April. Fight: Transgender Leo Waddell, 12,  was born as a girl called Lily, right. Last month, he vowed to fight a doctor's decision to ban him from taking hormone blockers, which halt the onset of puberty . 'Thirty-five [children] so far have been accepted into the early intervention study, about half of these born as girls and half as boys, of whom 23 are already being treated with hormone blockers,' she told The Sunday Times. 'Another 12 have gone forward but are not yet in treatment, perhaps because they are still too early in puberty.' Once they have reached 16 years old, children are given two options: To halt the hormone blockers - causing them to stay the same gender - or to take 'cross-sex' hormones, which change their body to the opposite gender. At the age of 18, the Tavistock Clinic is able to refer them for a sex change operation. Upset: Speaking on This Morning last month, Leo  - pictured with his mother, Hayley, 48 - said he started to cry when he was told he couldn't undergo hormone therapy . The clinic's approach is a sharp . contrast to most doctors' surgeries in the UK, where children under 16 . years old are generally refused hormone blockers. However, pro-treatment campaigners argue that, by their 16th birthday, most youngsters have experienced the onset of puberty - making it harder for them to change gender.. Dr Carmichael said it was 'better' for children not to have gone through puberty before 'transitioning'. But she added: 'You are asking someone aged as young as 11 to make big decisions about their adult life and identity. We have to be very careful to keep options open.' Beauty Queen: Miss England finalist Jackie Green became the youngest person in the world to undergo transgender surgery . Last month, 12-year-old transgender Leo Waddell vowed to fight a doctor's decision to ban him from taking hormone blockers. Leo,  from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was born as a girl called Lily but has lived as a boy since the age of five. He plans to take testosterone at the age of 16, before undergoing gender reassignment surgery at the age of 18. In the meantime, he wants to take hormone . blockers to prevent the onset of puberty and the release of female . hormones in his body. However, despite undergoing numerous psychological and hormone tests, his GP has refused to prescribe them because . she was unsure of the long-term effects - adding: 'Any clinical decision I make always gives consideration to every aspect of the patient's wellbeing'. Speaking on This Morning with his mother, Hayley, 48, Leo said: 'I didn't like it, I started to cry when she told me.' Mrs Waddell added: 'What so many people don't understand is that I feel it's far more dangerous for Leo to not have these hormone blockers. 'The things he has to go though, the emotions and the torment is slowly bringing him down and down.' Leo is one of a growing number of British children with gender dysphoria, a . condition whereby you feel have been physically assigned the wrong . gender at birth. In 2009, aged 16, Jackie Green became the youngest person in the world to undergo transgender surgery - having travelled to America aged 12 to receive hormone blockers. Last year, as a 19-year-old woman, Jackie made history once again by becoming . the first transgender Miss England finalist. She later claimed she 'would have killed' herself if she hadn't been prescribed the blockers by a doctor in Boston.","Transgender children as young as 12 are being given hormone blockers .

"Bali Nine drug kingpin Andrew Chan, who is facing death by firing squad in Indonesia, masterminded another international heroin smuggling attempt out of Hong Kong - but the operation failed, resulting in three young Australians being jailed. Daily Mail Australia can reveal for the first time that Chan enlisted Sydney teenager Rachel Diaz, 17, and Chris Vo, 15, both from western Sydney, as drug couriers to smuggle $1 million worth of heroin in condoms, which they were to swallow in Hong Kong and bring back to Australia. The Hong Kong deal was to run at the same time as the Bali Nine operation - when Chan, Myuran Sumurakan and seven Australian mules were arrested, some with the drugs strapped to their bodies. It can also be revealed that after his own arrest, Chan wrote a letter to Diaz in Hong Kong, ordering her to keep her mouth shut. Scroll down for video . The Godfather: Andrew Chan was involved in three international drug smuggling operations when he was arrested in Bali . Drug mule: Rachel Diaz was hired by Bali Nine mastermind Andrew Chan who, following her arrest and incarceration in a Hong Kong prison, wrote her a letter ordering her to keep her mouth shut . Hard to swallow: The 114 heroin-filled condoms which Rachel Diaz, 17, was supposed to  swallow when the trainee Sydney hairdresser was arrested in a seedy Hong Kong hotel room . Drug kings: One-time mail room worker Myuran Sukumaran (left, with Andrew Chan) says he became involved in the 8.3kg Bali importation to satisfy his lust for fast cars, glamorous women and and a life of nightclubbing . Chan and syndicate partner Sumurakan are on death row and were told this week by new Indonesian President Joko Widodo that he would not grant them pardons, despite their attempts to rehabilitate themselves behind bars. They could face death by firing squad in coming months. Chan, who Indonesian police called 'The Godfather'  when they arrested him, was a key organiser of the Australian end of the smuggling and distribution network, which was detailed in the Hong Kong court during Diaz's trial and described as a 'predatory crime syndicate'. In just two weeks in April 2005, the syndicate was responsible for the arrest, and later the incarceration, of 17 young Australians for heroin trafficking in three countries. The hotel room in a seedy Hong Kong district where Rachel Diaz, 17, and Chris Vo, 15, were preparing to swallow 114 heroin-filled condoms and make the eight-hour flight back to Sydney . Frantic father: Coca Cola representative Ferdinand Diaz, pictured in Hong Kong, made several attempts to get his daughter (pictured during her school days) freed from prison . Diaz, Vo and their minder Hutchinson Tran, 22, were arrested in a low budget Hong Kong hotel room on April 12, 2005. They were found with 114 condoms filled with up to 1kg of heroin - but Diaz had had second thoughts about taking part in the operation, for which they were to be paid $200 for each 5cm-long condom they ingested. Diaz's father Ferdinand failed to get his daughter released on bail and 12 months after her arrest, she was sentenced to 10 years and eight months. Vo, by then 16, received nine years, and Tran got 13 years and four months. All have since been released, with Diaz serving out the majority of her sentence in a NSW women's prison after being transferred in February 2009 under the International Transfer of Prisoners' Act. Five days after her arrest, Bali police arrested Chan, Sukumaran and their mules Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens, Scott Rush, Si Yi Chen, Matthew Norman, Michael Czugaj and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen. The seven couriers recruited by Chan and Sukumaran have all received sentences ranging from 18 years to life.

No way back: Scott Rush, aged 19, at Denpasar Airport on April 17, 2005, as Bali police remove packages of heroin strapped to his body . Several trips: Panel beater turned drug mule Renae Lawrence made two successful trips for Chan from Bali with heroin strapped to her body but was caught on the third, in April 2005, and sentenced to 20 years . Young dupes: Former Wollongong bartender, Martin Stephens (left) and Sydney catering worker Matthew Norman (right), pictured at Kerobokan Jail, Bali, in 2007, two years after they were duped by Chan who had promised them quick riches by acting as heroin mules in Bali . Behind closed doors: Lured to this hotel  in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui district by a drug gang which preyed on young Australians, Diaz, 17, and Vo, 15, were arrested with 1kg of heroin in condoms . Both the Bali Nine and the Hong Kong drug smuggling deals were connected with a third, lesser-known attempted heroin importation in which Chan and Sukumaran conspired with four young Brisbane people. Daily Mail Australia can also reveal that in the lead up to the Bali Nine and the Hong Kong operations Chan and Sukumaran visited a young Korean-Australian who was later arrested and charged over the Hong Kong conspiracy following the arrest of Diaz, Vo and Tran. A Korean-Australian and a co-conspirator were charged with plotting to import the packages of heroin that Diaz and 15-year-old Vo were meant to swallow. The Bali Nine are a group of nine Australians who attempted to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia on August 17, 2005. Drug mastermind Andrew Chan and his cohort, Myuran Sukumaran, recruited six men and one woman aged between 19 and 30 years old and strapped heroin to their bodies. Renae Lawrence, Martin Stephens, Scott Rush, Si Yi Chen, Matthew Norman Michael Czugaj and Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen were arrested in a hotel and at Denapasar airport and taken to Bali's Kerobokan prison. Lawrence was sentenced to 20 years, Rush's sentence has been redeuced to 18 years and the other five mules are serving life sentences. Chan and Sukumaran were given the death penalty and in early December 2014, Indonesia's new President Joko Widodo said the men would face execution by firing squad. With prison remission, Lawrence's current earliest possible release date is February 2026. Chan visited the Korean-Australian at least three times in different NSW prisons and once with Sukumaran in late 2004, just before the two made two 'practice' runs to Indonesia with several of the future Bali Nine couriers, including Renae Lawrence, and successfully returned to Australia with heroin strapped to their bodies. Chan, who was a manager at a Sydney catering company, duped three of his staff - Lawrence, Norman and Stephens - into becoming mules, promising them thousands of dollars in return. Following the arrests in Hong Kong and Bali within days of each other - and a series of other arrests in Sydney and Brisbane just days later - police said the Bali Nine had no connection with the Diaz case. However, detectives have exclusively revealed that Chan was in contact with Diaz for months and all three trafficking deals were connected to a Sydney-based Chinese drug smuggling syndicate which had links to Myanmar. Chan, who has found God in prison, was regularly visiting another convicted drug dealer in prison as he was conspiring to commit the Bali Nine deal. Diaz and Vo were recruited to go to Hong Kong as drug mules, police say, on the promise of $6000 or $7000 for a single trip. Diaz, a trainee hairdresser with churchgoing Filipino migrant parents, and Vo, a McDonald's worker and son of a single mother of Vietnamese origin, came from modest income families in western Sydney. Neither had previously known connections with drug syndicates, nor had they met before they flew out from Sydney to Hong Kong in April 2005. Diaz's parents, Ferdinand and Maria, believed she was having a sleep-over at a friend's house and then reported her missing when she failed to return. Squalor and misery: Australian inmates Si Yi Chen, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen and Matthew Norman in a holding cell before a court appearance at Denpasar . Greedy fool: Myuran Sukumaran (pictured arriving at court to appeal his death sentence) admits his role in the Bali Nine drug deal just because he wanted an easy life with cars, money and women . On the day she and Vo were due home, April 13, police believe the Korean-Australian went to Sydney Airport to collect them, armed with three packets of laxatives. Diaz and Vo were in a room at the Imperial Hotel, in Hong Long's Tsim Sha Tsui backpacker district, with the 114 heroin-filled condoms, supplied by Hutchinson Tran, when police burst in. Vo was prepared to swallow 30 packages but Diaz had apparently reconsidered, realising they could burst inside her stomach during the eight-hour flight back to Sydney. Fearful place: Hong Kong's notorious Tai Lam correctional facility where Diaz was incarcerated before being  transferred to a Sydney prison . Firing squad: After a series of court appeals, Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan are the sole remaining members of the Bali Nine who still face death by an Indonesian firing squad . Earliest possible release: With prison governor's remissions, Bali Nine drug smuggler Renae Lawrence  will be the first of the group to gain freedom, in February 2026 at the earliest . Meanwhile, four Australians from Brisbane - aged 24, 22, 18, and 19, had been arrested in Brisbane and charged with conspiring with Chan and Sukumaran of conspiring to import heroin to Australia. A fifth, Khanh Thanh Ly, 24, was arrested in Sydney. Ly subsequently pleaded guilty, but said he was only a 'runaround' in the gang whose members included Sukumaran, and was never paid but did it for the 'glamour' and entries to parties and clubs. The Bali Nine incident was linked to one of the world's biggest drug syndicates, Crescent Moon, which has smuggled large quantities of heroin from Myanmar (Burma) to Western countries. Chan has admitted he saw the Bali Nine deal as a 'quick pay day'. He has never spoken about his involvement in the Hong Kong deal. In an interview with ABC TV he pleaded for clemency, saying if his death sentence was commuted and he was released from prison, he wanted to help the community and become a minister of religion.","Bali Nine kingpin Andrew Chan masterminded another overseas heroin deal that went wrong .

"A woman has been sentenced to five years’ probation after being found guilty of first sexually assaulting and then having intercourse with her best friend's teenage son over a two year period starting when he was just aged 13. Karen Lee Carstens, 43, was convicted of sexual assault of a child by a jury in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday and was then sentenced on Thursday morning. Police said she began sexual assaulting the teen in 2007 when he was 13 years old and eventually ended up having a sex with him on numerous occasion at her home. Karen Lee Carstens, 43, has been sentenced to five years probation after being found guilty having sex with her best friend's teenage son . ‘I feel like she deserved everything that she got,’ the unnamed victim, now 19 years old, told KHOU. The improper relations had begun when Carstens volunteered to help babysit the teen while her friend, the boy's mother, was hospitalized. The boy described a couple of the encounters to investigators, particularly those which happened over a three-month period when his mother was in and out of the hospital due to a gallbladder infection. He said on May 15, 2009, he and Carstens were lying on a sofa bed and watching television when they started to have sex. The unnamed victim, now 19, told local TV news that he believed that Carstens had gotten what she deserved . According to court documents the boy 'cried believing he had impregnated [Carstens] but she assured him not to worry because her menstrual cycle was due soon.' The boy told investigators that when the relationship began it involved just touching her breasts and genitals, but progressed to oral sex. In the court documents, the boy described one encounter where he suggested anal sex as a way for them to avoid pregnancy. She at first refused but then allowed the teen to do it. The affair ended shortly after when Carstens moved to Riva, Maryland. The improper relations had begun when Carstens, pictured in court, had volunteered to help babysit the teen while her friend, the boy's mother, was hospitalized . Police say the victim said Carstens told him not to tell anyone about their sexual relationship because she could get into trouble. Authorities investigated and found enough evidence to file charges against Carstens. Her bail was set at $30,000.","Karen Lee Carstens, 43,has been sentenced to five years probation after being found guilty of having sex with her best friend's son .

"Exhausted, covered in mud and desperately hungry, a team of Swedish athletes sat down for a meal as they prepared to take on a dangerous 20-mile trek through the Ecuadorian rainforest. As they opened their canned meat, a tired Mikael Lindnord noticed a scruffy, miserable stray dog staring at him out of the corner of his eye. Feeling sorry for him, he fed the dog a meatball and thought nothing of it, but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them - and he didn't stop. As the group of four navigated the final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship, the dog befriended them and was eventually given the name Arthur. Every grueling task the team face, Arthur would do the same. He swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers, dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee-deep mud during treks. Even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety - he refused to leave. Scroll down for video . The fifth member: Team Peak Performance walk with stray dog Arthur during a stage of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship. He followed the group of four during the grueling race . All terrains: Despite numerous attempts by the team to get rid of the dog, primarily for his own safety, he refused to go. It meant when he got stuck in the knee-deep mud they helped get him out and when he was exhausted, they stopped to take a break . Encounter: Mikael Lindnord first noticed the scruffy dog when he was sitting down to eat canned meatballs. He fed Arthur one thinking nothing on it, but ended up creating a bond with the dog . This meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out. After six days the team finished the race, and the dog had suffered. They therefore decided to take him to a vet while still in South America to have him checked out. During that time Lindord thought to himself that after their experience, they could not leave Arthur, so he decided to adopt him and take him back to Sweden. He applied to the Jordbruksverket (the Swedish Board of Agriculture) and was made to wait to see if his application was successful. After a tense few days, the team arrived at the airport with Arthur and boarded the plane with him back home. Adventure Racing is a form of extreme sport that combines continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking over a successive number of days. The world championships held in Ecuador covered three diverse geographical regions - the Andes, the Pacific and the Amazon rainforest. Lindord told Swedish news site Aftonbladet: 'I had just opened a food pack when I saw a scruffy miserable dog in the corner of my eye. For more from Team Peak Performance click here . Determined: Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. But Arthur swam alongside the boat and ended up being pulled in by Lindord . Grueling: The race takes teams of four around ten days, and involves continuous hiking, trekking, mountain biking and kayaking . Resting: When the team slept Arthur would also curl up and take a nap alongside them . Video Source Team Peak Performance . 'I thought he was hungry and gave him a meatball. Then I thought no more of it. He added: 'At one stage we had to take a break and the dog was totally wrecked. We opened two cans of food and let him eat, because he could find no food at all in the jungle.' Before one of the segments of the race - a 36 mile kayak around the coast - organizers warned the team that taking Arthur along posed a risk to his and their safety. They tried to set off without him, but as they left he jumped into the water beside them and started desperately paddling. Lindord, heartbroken by the site of Arthur struggling in the water, picked him up, put him in the kayak and let him stay for the rest of the journey. The gesture prompted a standing ovation and cheers from spectators watching from the banks. The ordeal to get him back to Sweden was documented on the team's Facebook page. In one post Lindord wrote: 'I almost cried in front of the computer, when receiving the decision from Jordbruksverket (Board of Agriculture) in Sweden!' 'The team is overwhelmed and happy knowing that Jordbruksverket has approved Mikaels application to bring Arthur to Sweden. A big important piece in the work to get Arhur on the plane, is done. So far so good. But, There are [sic] still one paper to go. The team are now working hard for the very last piece in this puzzel [sic]. Lindord ended by saying: 'I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship. Instead, I got a new friend.' Support: At one point the dog was not able to find any food in the jungle, so the team stopped and gave him some of their canned food . Challenge: As the team neared the finished the tasks began to take their toll on Arthur and he ended up with some injuries . Health checks: When the team finished the race, they took Arthur to Ecuador to see a vet in order to prepare him for the trip back to Sweden . Donations: Team Peak Performance set up a PayPal account while they were still in South America to garner funds for Arthur's care . Spotlight: Team member Staffan Bjorklund takes Arthur for a walk outside the clinic. Their story had already grabbed the attention of the media . Greeting: Arthur offers out his paw to one of the vets as the team wait in the clinic for him to be checked over . Aftermath: After the procedures were complete he was forced to wear a cone on his head. It was then that Lindord decided to adopt him and take him back to his family in Sweden . Emotional: When Lindord received news that the Board of Agriculture had approved his request for Arthur to be brought back to Sweden, he said he cried while looking at the computer . Happy: Despite his injuries and the toll the final two stages of the race had taken on him, Arthur began to look healthy as he prepared to fly to Sweden and settle into his new home . Attention: The team let passengers stroke Arthur as he wondered around the airport terminal before their flight back to Sweden . Pose: Members of the team stand alongside with flight attendants and a pilot as they prepare to take Arthur home to his new family .","Team Peak Performance were sat down for a meal before a 20 mile trek in Ecuador when they saw a stray dog .

"Bashar Al-Assad launched the chemical attack which killed hundreds of people because he 'lost his nerve' in a moment of panic and worried that Damascus would fall to rebel troops, according to new intelligence. In a telephone call which was tapped by German spy chiefs, a senior Hezbollah commander told the Iranian embassy in Lebanon that Syria's president intended to tilt the balance of power towards the regime in the battle for control of the country's capital. However, it appears that the chemical attack backfired, as it looks set to prompt a major intervention from American and French troops aimed at crippling Assad's military capabilities. Barack Obama today spoke out to demand that the world take action against Syria, saying that the international community 'cannot be silent' over the use of chemical weapons. Scroll down for video . Attack: Bashar Al-Assad is said to have launched a barrage of chemical weapons after he 'lost his nerve' Promise: Barack Obama said that the 'credibility' of the West was in question if it did not intervene . The German intelligence came as Vladimir Putin warned the West not to take unilateral action against Syria, and repeated his claim that the regime was not responsible for the chemical weapons strike in the suburbs of Damascus two weeks ago. Russia today announced that it is sending a missile cruiser to the eastern Mediterranean to enforce the country's interests in the volatile region. Pope Francis also entered the fray, attempting to slow the march to war by summoning ambassadors from all over the world. The call from a Hezbollah leader about the chemical attack, in which he described the move as 'a big mistake', was intercepted by Germany's BNC intelligence service and reported by Der Spiegel magazine. The revelation has led the country's top spies to agree with the U.S. intelligence assessment that Assad was indeed responsible for using chemical weapons in the attack on August 21. BND president Gerhard Schindler said that following a 'thorough analysis', the regime must have been the perpetrator, and the government is the only actor which possesses chemical agents such as sarin. Vote: Mr Obama, pictured with Sweden's prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, is facing a debate in Congress . Meeting: Mr Obama with his national security team at a breakfast summit with Swedish officials . The BND believes that the use of . sarin may have been meant as a deterrent against rebel forces, but that . the military used too much of it by mistake. 'The . new information from the BND could become important in the coming . days,' Der Spiegel said. 'Thus far the U.S. has only noted that after . the attack, intelligence agencies had intercepted internal government . communications indicating concern about a possible UN inspection of the . site. 'The telephone . conversation intercepted by the BND could be an important piece in the . puzzle currently being assembled by Western intelligence experts.' Despite . the findings, Germany is unlikely to join any military action by the . West after both Angela Merkel and her main election rival ruled out an . attack. Britain also . seems certain to stay away from the front line of any conflict after . David Cameron's Government was defeated in a vote in the House of . Commons last week. War: Children stand around in the rubble of a building apparently destroyed by Assad's forces . Strike: The West is expected to launch military attacks on Syria within the next few days . By contrast, Mr Obama is expected to win the support of the U.S. Congress after leading figures from both the Democratic and Republican parties came out in support of intervention. Speaking in Stockholm as he travelled to the G20 summit in St Petersburg, Mr Obama insisted that it was essential to strike against Assad over the chemical attacks. 'In the face of such barbarism the international community cannot be silent,' he said at a press conference. 'Failing to respond to this attack would only increase the risk of more attacks and that possibility that other countries would use these weapons, as well.' The President defended his decision to intervene once Assad crossed the 'red line' of using chemical weapons, saying that it was vital to uphold 'international norms'. Defiant: Vladimir Putin has warned the West against intervening in Syria and igniting a regional conflagration . 'That wasn't something I made up,' he said. 'I didn't pluck it out of thin air. There's a reason for it. 'The . international community's credibility is on the line. America and . Congress' credibility is on the line, because we give lip service to the . notion that these international norms are important.' He also suggested that Putin might be persuaded to change his mind on supporting Assad's government. 'I'm . always hopeful, and I will continue to engage him,' Mr Obama said. 'Ultimately, we can end deaths much more rapidly if Russia takes a . different approach to these problems.' Speaking . alongside Swedish prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, he concluded: 'The . moral thing to do is not to stand by and do nothing.' Summit: World leader will soon be meeting at the Constantine Palace in St Petersburg, pictured . Banquet: The leaders will dine tomorrow at the Grand Palace Peterhof State Museum . The French parliament is today set to debate a possible military response, although the vote is considered much less important than in Britain or the U.S. because of president Francois Hollande's large majority and relative freedom of action. 'If you want a political solution you have to move the situation,' foreign minister Lauren Fabius said this morning. 'If there's no sanction, Bashar Assad will say, ""That's fine, I'll continue what I'm doing.""' Adding to the tension in the eastern Mediterranean, where Israel and the U.S. test-fired a missile yesterday, Russia today ordered a missile cruiser to take over its operations in the region. The ship, named Moskva, will be joined by a destroyer from Russia's Baltic Fleet and a frigate from the Black Sea Fleet. 'The Cruiser Moskva is heading to the Gibraltar Straits,' a military source told the state news agency. 'In approximately 10 days it will enter the east Mediterranean, where it will take over as the flagship of the naval task force.' Russia is Assad's most powerful global ally, and has consistently opposed Western intervention in Syria's long-running civil war, calling instead for negotiations to reach a diplomatic solution. Attack: A boy who survived the chemical attack on the eastern suburbs of Damascus two weeks ago . Mr Putin suggested in an interview yesterday that Russia would support a UN resolution on military strikes if Assad is proven to have carried out the chemical attack. However, he insisted that it would have been 'ludicrous' for the regime to draw the opposition of the international community by using banned substances such as sarin. 'From our viewpoint, it seems absolutely absurd that the armed forces, which are on the offensive today and in some areas have encircled the so-called rebels and are finishing them off, that in these conditions they would start using forbidden chemical weapons while realising quite well that it could serve as a pretext for applying sanctions against them,' he said. 'If there are data that the chemical weapons have been used, and used specifically by the regular army, this evidence should be submitted to the UN Security Council. 'And it ought to be convincing. It shouldn't be based on some rumours and information obtained by special services through some kind of eavesdropping, some conversations and things like that.' Votes: Presidents Barack Obama and Francois Hollande have both submitted to lawmakers' debates on Syria . The Russian president said he was sorry that Mr Obama had cancelled a one-on-one meeting which was due to precede the G20 summit. 'President Obama hasn't been elected by the American people in order to be pleasant to Russia,' he said. 'And your humble servant hasn't been elected by the people of Russia to be pleasant to someone either. 'We work, we argue about some issues. We are human. Sometimes one of us gets vexed. But I would like to repeat once again that global mutual interests form a good basis for finding a joint solution to our problems.' One country which is likely to support any Western action is Turkey, one of the leading regional powers, whose prime minister said today that he would join an international coalition designed at reining in Assad. Authorities at the Vatican, which has been outspoken about attempting to avoid war in Syria, have asked all ambassadors in the city-state to attend an audience with the Secretary of State tomorrow. It is the first time that the whole diplomatic corps has been summoned since 2003, when John Paul II attempted to prevent the invasion of Iraq. Vatican spokesman Padre Federico Lombardi said the Secretariat of State would put the Pope's position on Syria clearly. The summons was 'a very infrequent and significant even', he added. Francis has already announced a day of peace for Syria on Saturday, 'the meanings and purpose' of which will be explained at the conference of ambassadors, the official Vatican newspaper the Osservatore Romano explained. In an impassioned plea for peace during his Angelus prayer on Sunday Francis said his heart was 'deeply wounded by what is happening in Syria and anguished by the dramatic developments which are looming'. Syria's civil war has been raging for two and a half years, since Assad started cracking down on protests inspired by the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt, and has killed more than 100,000 people. It was revealed this week that more than 2million Syrians had been forced out of their homeland by the fighting, with the vast majority ending up in Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan.","Claim by Hezbollah commander intercepted by German intelligence agency .

"A businessman fearing he had cancer after discovering blood in his urine has been left stunned after doctors discovered he has a fully functioning womb - and the blood was from his period. The 37-year-old man, who MailOnine is not identifying, said he has experienced strange symptoms for years, such as a dull ache after sex, but his concerns were always brushed aside by medics. Specialists have since discovered that, as well has having typical exterior male genitalia, he also has an interior uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries. A 37-year-old businessman has been shocked to learn he has a fully functioning womb in addition to the typical male genitalia after suffering from a rare genetic disorder . They say he has been having periods since his teens, has experienced PMT, and may even be able to get pregnant. The man, from Lancashire, is now preparing for surgery to remove the womb having lived his whole life as a 'red blooded' male, according to The Sun. Doctors say this is the best way to treat the condition, but have warned him that he could start the menopause once the operation is complete. Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome (PMDS) is a rare genetic disorder which occurs when the body fails to produce or respond to certain hormones while developing during pregnancy. Every foetus contains the beginnings of a womb, known as the Mullerian duct, but if the baby is male then it will produce hormones meaning this reduces and then disappears all together. However in those with PMDS the body either does not produce these hormones, or does not react to them properly, meaning the duct develops into a functioning womb. Because these hormones do not affect the growth of the penis, it means the child will also develop typical exterior male genitals. Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome is a genetic condition which means that both sets of genitals will form. Symptoms include one or both testicles failing to descend, and fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen . The syndrome is believed to be extremely rare, although the exact number of cases each year is largely unknown. The condition is usually spotted in early childhood or around puberty. Symptoms include one or both testes failing to descend properly or fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen. The condition is usually discovered during surgery to treat these problems. All foetuses develop with the beginnings of a womb, known as the Mullerian duct. In the male foetus hormones will be produced causing this to shrink and eventually disappear. But in those with PMDS these hormones will not be produced, or the body will not react to them. This means the Mullerian duct will develop into female sexual organs, including cervix, ovaries and uterus. Because different hormones are responsible for growing a penis, the male reproductive organs will also develop. Symptoms include one or both testicles failing to descend, and fleshy hernias in the lower abdomen. If the condition goes undiscovered into puberty, blood may also occur in the semen or urine after periods start. However in very exceptional cases the problem is not picked up by medics until  adulthood, during which time the patient may have experienced blood in the semen or urine after starting periods, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. The businessman, who is in a relationship with a woman who knows about his condition, says the first sign something was wrong came at six months old, when he had an operation on an undescended testicle. He told Alison Smith-Squire: 'As a child I didn't have any other problems and went through puberty normally, developing a deep voice and body hair. 'But as I reached my teen and 20s I began experiencing a dull ache, during and after sex.' When he was 18 blood first appeared in his urine, leading doctors to suspect he had bladder cancer, but a biopsy came back negative. Eventually he was sent for an MRI, and the images  revealed he has a uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and even a cervix. A consultant has now told him that the ache after sex was caused by PMT, and the blood in his urine came from his periods. As well as surgery to remove the female organs, he will also take part in genetic screening to find out how his gender balances out. He added: 'It's possible tests will show I'm both male and female, but I feel completely right living life as a guy. Even if tests showed I was mostly a woman, I would still continue living as a man.' The 37-year-old is being sent for a hysterectomy at Manchester University Hospital - and has been told the operation may start the menopause (file image)","Man, 37, experienced dull ache after sex and found blood in his urine .

"Kelly Osbourne has quit Fashion Police - just days after her co-star Giuliana Rancic was forced to apologize over a joke about Disney star Zendaya Coleman. The lilac-haired star, 30, has been a fixture on the show since 2011. E! confirmed Kelly's departure on Friday with a statement: 'Kelly Osbourne is departing E!'s Fashion Police to pursue other opportunities, and we would like to thank her for her many contributions to the series over the past five years, during which time the show became a hit with viewers.' Scroll down for video . 'Kelly threw her under the bus': Access Hollywood host Billy Bush said he 'doubts' things are OK between Kelly Osbourne and Giuliana Rancic. However, a source insisted Kelly's possible departure has nothing to do with the Zendaya row . 'Fashion Police will return, as scheduled, on Friday, March 30th at 9:00 p.m. and no decisions have been made on her replacement,' the statement went on to explain. Earlier that day a source told Daily Mail Online: 'Kelly stayed on the show after the beloved Joan Rivers passed away, but nothing has been the same since. 'The chemistry has not been the same between the hosts since the show came back on air and Kelly knows it's time to move on.' Apology: Giuliana Rancic was forced to apologize after joking that Zendaya's dreadlocks at the Oscars would 'smell of patchouli' or 'weed' Kelly fired back on Twitter after her co-star Giuliana said Zendaya's Oscar dreadlocks looked like they would 'smell of patchouli' or 'weed' on the Academy Awards Fashion Police special on Monday night. She raged: 'I DO NOT CONDONE RACISM SO AS A RSULT OF THIS IM SERIOUSLY QUESTIONING STAYING ON THE SHOW[sic].' However, the source insisted: 'This has nothing to do Giuliana. Zendaya accepted Giuliana's apology and she's already moved on to a new hair style! 'Even Kelly tweeted 'this too shall pass' and was over it. 'Joan was the mama bear, she stopped all the quarrels and held the show together, even when Kelly was being testy.' When Fashion Police returned on air following Joan's death, Kathy Griffin was at the helm, with stylist Brad Goreski brought on board. E! execs are now keen to revamp the show before it returns in March. Kelly's bid to leave comes as her dad, rocker Ozzy Osbourne, waded into the argument with some words of warning for Billy Bush. After the Access Hollywood host slammed his daughter Kelly and stood up for pal Giuliana, the star fired back on Twitter. '@BillyBush stop acting like a b****. Act like a man,' Ozzy wrote on Thursday night. 'Lay off Kelly or we'll be going to hospital to get my foot out of your a**. God Bless.' Billy did not respond directly to the Black Sabbath star's message, but joked about it a few hours later while discussing the viral photo of a dress that some see as white and gold and others see as blue and black. 'Need to book an opthomologist AND a proctologist on @AHLive tomorrow. For #TheDress and Ozzy's foot,' he tweeted. Contrary to reports, Billy blasted the suggestion that Kelly tried to stop Giuliana from making the comment about Zendaya's hair - and that the segment was taped three times. As Daily Mail Online has revealed, the joke was actually scripted by Fashion Police writers - and was not off the cuff from Giuliana. Words of warning: Ozzy Osbourne told Billy Bush to 'lay off' his daughter Kelly on Thursday. The rock star is pictured with his daughter in November . Team Giuliana: The Access Hollywood host, seen in November, slammed Kelly over the Zendaya Fashion Police controversy . 'We'll be going to hospital': Ozzy took to Twitter to fire back at Billy . Seeing the funny side: Billy did not respond directly, but joked about the Black Sabbath frontman's comment a few hours later . The 43-year-old said he spoke to Giuliana directly and that she denied claims it was filmed more than once - as did the show's network E!. 'And the Kelly Osbourne part... that never occurred,' Billy went on, adding that he 'doubts' the two hosts have made amends. 'How could it be good? Kelly Osbourne threw her under the bus, in my opinion,' he said. Billy also added: 'Giuliana is taking the hit for this. That joke that Giuliana delivered, it was a written joke. Which means there were a lot of people involved - and nobody saw racism.' MailOnline revealed that the joke about Zendaya's dreadlocks was scripted, and that Kelly did not speak out against it during filming. The following day, she added: 'Im giving everyone involved 24 hours to make it right or the world will hear how I really feel. contactually [sic] Im not allowed to speak!' 'I DID NOT MAKE THE WEED COMENT. I DO NOT CONDONE RACISM SO AS A RSULT OF THIS IM SEREIOULSY QUESTIONONIG [sic] STAYING ON THE SHOW!' Shortly afterwards, Giuliana apologised on E! News. 'I want to apologise for a comment that I made on last night's Fashion Police about Zendaya's hair,' she said. 'As you know, Fashion Police is a show that pokes fun at celebrities in good spirit, but I do realise that something I said last night did cross the line.' Sorry: Giuliana issued an apology on E! News on Tuesday, which Zendaya graciously accepted . Threatening to leave: Earlier this week Kelly suggested she would quit the show if Giuliana didn't 'make it right' 'I just want everyone to know that I didn't intend to hurt anybody, but I learned it's not my intent that matters, it's the result. And the result is people are offended, including Zendaya. And that is not OK.' Zendaya graciously accepted the apology, saying that she 'appreciates' it and adding that she is 'glad it was a learning experience'. Kelly then tweeted: 'It takes a strong women to apologize & makes a forgiving women even stronger! #ThisTooShallPass.' Khloe Kardashian - who reported for E! from the Oscars - is now in talks to join the show, according to Radar. Fashion Police, now fronted by Kathy Griffin, is not back on air until March, and  Giuliana is expeted back.

"Vanilla Ice is free on bond after being charged with burglary of a $1million mansion and grand theft. The rapper-turned-home improvement show host, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was arrested in Lantana, Florida, on Wednesday amid allegations he broke into a vacant home and stole furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items. The burglarized residence, which is in foreclosure, is near a home that Van Winkle, 47, was working on for his show on DIY Network, The Vanilla Ice Project, and some of the stolen property was later found at Van Winkle's home, police say. This as it have been reported he told his work crew he owned the home and sent them over twice to burgle the property. Scroll down for video . Vanilla Ice, whose real name is Robert Van Winkle, was  charged with burglary of a residence and grand theft . Police say Van Winkle stole items from this house in Lantana, Florida, while he was filming his reality show . Van Winkle (center) was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond last night . According to the New York Daily News; 'Cops later interviewed Ice's construction foreman, who said Ice told him he'd bought the property and ordered him to fetch stuff from it, including the pool heater and two bikes, worth about $400.In the show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip houses.' Then, earlier this month, a mirrored coffee table and some glass knick-knacks were reported missing from the property. The real estate broker of the burglarized $1million home, Jim Lovely, called the situation a 'hassle', according to NBC Miami. Lovely said: 'Why would you jeopardize going to jail for basically junk? 'It was just worthless furniture and some items so it doesn't make much sense. 'The house wasn't full of Picassos, so it wasn't a high-dollar heist.' The former pop star, who rose to fame with the 1990s hit 'Ice Ice Baby,' was released from the Palm Beach County Jail on a $6,000 bond, according to WPBF. Van Winkle called the situation a 'misunderstanding' that 'was blown out of proportion'. He said: 'It's sad that good news doesn't travel this fast. 'It's just out of proportion and I wish you guys would focus on all the good things I've done. 'It'll all get cleared up, you'll see.' Authorities believe Van Winkle stole furniture, a pool heater (above), bicycles and other items . The broker for the property said the house, which did contain some furniture (above), 'wasn't full of Picassos' Police took Van Winkle into custody after they obtained a search warrant and recovered some of the stolen items at his home in Palm Beach County. The Lantana Police Department said: 'During the investigation, it was determined Robert Matthew Van Winkle played a role in the burglary and theft. 'A search warrant was obtained and executed in unincorporated Palm Beach County in which several of the stolen items were recovered at a residence under the care and control of Robert Van Winkle.' The items have been returned to their owner. In his DIY Network show, Van Winkle and a crew renovate and flip homes. DIY is 'aware' of the situation . The items which Van Winkle allegedly took from the home (pictured) have been returned to their owner . Van Winkle in a 2001 mugshot (left) after he allegedly threatened a man and in a 2008 mugshot (right) after an assault charge . According to Van Winkle, the incident was not related to his television show. He said: 'I wish it was. There's nothing fun about this. 'I wish everybody all the best, and maybe some of the good news will travel this fast in the future.' DIY Network is 'aware' of the situation and 'looking into the matter'. The cable star is still scheduled to appear at the Columbus Dispatch Home and Garden Show on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio. Tommy Quon of TQ Management Agency told the Columbus Dispatch that Van Winkle will be speaking about home renovation. He said: 'Rob will be available to make the home show in Columbus. 'I still don’t know what exactly happened but will get all the facts together and decide a course of action.' Van Winkle has been married to wife Laura since 1997 and they have two daughters together. This is not his first brush with the law; in 1991, he was arrested and pleaded no contest for threatening a homeless man with a gun. A decade later, he was arrested by Florida police and spent a night in jail for assaulting his wife as they argued while driving. He admitted that he had pulled her hair, but said it was to stop her from jumping out of their truck, and was sentenced to probation and attended family therapy sessions. In 2008, Van Winkle was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife again - but was released the following day after she said he had only pushed her. The case was dropped two weeks later.","Vanilla Ice - real name Robert Van Winkle - was arrested in Lantana, Florida .

"He was best known for battling the Daleks as one of the best-loved Doctor Whos. But now it has been revealed that Jon Pertwee was a real-life secret agent years before he donned the Time Lord’s cape. The actor, who died in 1996 aged 76, was a senior intelligence agent during the Second World War and reported directly to Winston Churchill. He was also recommended for another role by James Bond creator Ian Fleming – and proved to be an expert in using a range of 007-like gadgets, including a smoking pipe that fired bullets and handkerchiefs containing secret maps. Actor Jon Pertwee, pictured left in the Navy, was a senior secret intelligence agent during World War II before he became well-known for playing Doctor Who, pictured right . The revelations – in a long-lost tape-recorded interview – confirm that Pertwee’s wartime activities were as remarkable as his acting career, which saw him play the third incarnation of the Doctor between 1970 and 1974. Pertwee said he kept silent about the nature of his covert role with the Naval Intelligence Division for decades for fear of breaching the Official Secrets Act. On the tape he says: ‘The team I worked with, the brothers in intelligence, were an amazing  collection of characters. TV favourite: Jon Pertwee battled Daleks and aliens as Doctor Who for four years . ‘There was a huge range of talents all being used to better protect the security of the nation, often in very surprising ways. ‘I did all sorts. Teaching commandos how to use escapology equipment, compasses in brass buttons, secret maps in white cotton handkerchiefs, pipes you could smoke that also fired a .22 bullet. All sorts of incredible things. It suited me perfectly as  I have always loved gadgets. ‘I used to attend meetings where Churchill would be at the end of the table and he would be smoking his cigars. At the end of the meeting, I used to collect the butts and sell them on to the Americans for a few dollars. ‘I don’t remember much of  my first meeting with Churchill except he gave me some priceless advice. He told me to always watch people, that there was a lot you could learn about someone’s character from the little actions they make – which was great advice for an actor.’ Pertwee also worked alongside Ian Fleming during his spell with Naval Intelligence. He recalled: ‘One day Fleming sent me for an interview for a job. They wanted a good French speaker. ‘I thought the job was going to be liaison with the Free French. I did not fancy that at all, so I deliberately messed up the interview, pretending I could not understand what they were saying at times and throwing in the most  inappropriate answers. ‘Afterwards, when Fleming got the report back, he said they did not want me and how badly I had done. I confessed I had done it on purpose because I did not want to work with de Gaulle’s mob. ‘He told me I was a blithering idiot because the interview was a chance to be our man in Tahiti.’ Before taking up his clandestine role, Pertwee narrowly avoided death on the battlecruiser Hood, sunk by the Bismarck in 1941. Jon Pertwee, pictured as Doctor Who with Nicholas Courtney who played Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, made the revelations in a long-lost interview . He recalled: ‘I was on HMS Hood and I got called to the  captain’s cabin. I was told I had passed the captain’s test and I was now a fully fledged officer cadet. I had 20 minutes to pack before being transferred back to Pompey barracks for training. ‘It saved my life. Of the 1,418 crew, only three survived.’ Pertwee’s many obituaries all referred to his wartime service in the Navy, but made no mention of his top-secret role. He gave the interview in 1994 to two young reporters, Matt Adams and David Southwell. They are lifelong Doctor Who fans – and decided this year’s 50th anniversary of the show was the ideal time to publish his revelations in Doctor Who Magazine. Mr Southwell, now an author, said: ‘Eighteen years ago the opportunity arose to exploit our positions with a local paper to wangle an interview at the home of one of our childhood heroes. ‘We have gone on to quiz Oscar-winners and meet Prime Ministers, but no interview was ever more demanding than coming face-to-face with our Doctor.’ Jon Pertwee, pictured as the Doctor with Elisabeth Sladen, said he got to use all sorts of 'incredible equipment'","Actor was .

"A father has been hailed as 'SpiderDad' after he donned a superhero costume to surprise his terminally ill son on his birthday. Mike Wilson leapt from a roof at his family home in Basingstoke, Hampshire as part of the birthday stunt for five-year-old Jayden, who has a grade four brain tumour. The heart-warming video of him surprising his son - a huge Spiderman fan - has since been viewed around the world. Scroll down for video . Mike Wilson leapt from a roof above the family's front door in Basingstoke, Hampshire to surprise his son, Jayden, on his fifth birthday . Jayden has been diagnosed with a brain tumour and doctors gave him just a year to live . Jayden was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) brain stem tumour 15 months ago after his parents took him to hospital following a fall. Mr Wilson told MailOnline: 'We couldn't believe it at first. You never expect something this bad to happen to any of your close family members. 'He was given an average of 12 months to live, and today he's still fighting it like a champ.' Doctors have said Jayden's speech, movement and coordination will continue to deteriorate as he  receives treatment. He is currently finding it . difficult to walk and has weakness in his left arm. As Jayden's fifth birthday approached, Mr Wilson was determined to do something to make his son's day especially memorable. Mr Wilson ordered a special suit to be made in the US before carrying out the stunt for Jayden's birthday . He is an expert in free-running and parkour so was able to pull off the jump without injuring himself . A video of the stunt shows Jayden rushing to hug his favourite superhero after he lands outside their home . Mr Wilson then took the birthday boy inside and played with him while still in character as Spiderman . With his son's bedroom covered in Spiderman posters, Mr Wilson decided there was only one character he would want to wish him happy birthday. Mr Wilson, who is an expert in parkour and free-running, said: 'I've always been a big Spiderman fan myself and, out of no influence, Jayden also absolutely loves him. 'I wanted to surprise him so much with one of his favourite heroes, so I found two costume designers local to me in Basingstoke, who were up for the challenge. 'We had the costume printed in America and then got to work putting it together. It was finished about three weeks before Jayden's birthday so perfect timing to work out how to surprise him.' Jayden got a big hug from his favourite superhero after disguised Mr Wilson became a guest at the party . Family and friends were delighted to see the joy his father's entrance brought to the youngster's face . The family took photos of the occasion so Jayden can remember the day Spiderman came to his house . Mr Wilson added: 'Being a Spiderman fan, I hate it when people pretend to be Spiderman but can't do the right poses, I'm not perfect but I like to try doing my best.' Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most common and aggressive  brain tumours. Unlike other cancers, which are more likely to strike as patients get older, GBM is just as prevalent in young patients and kills more people under 40 than any other cancer. Common symptoms include seizure, nausea, vomiting and headaches, although the most prevalent is a progressive neurological deterioration because of its location near the temporal and frontal lobes. The average sufferer will only survive for 14 months after diagnosis and 2,500 die from their tumours annually. Glioblastoma is extremely difficult to treat for a number of reasons because the tumour cells are very resistant to conventional therapies. Mr Wilson, who is a professional freerunner and has featured in films including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Pirates of the Caribbean, spent half an hour playing with his son in character, leaving the youngster star-struck. A video of the surprise stunt shows birthday boy Jayden venturing onto his front doorstep after it appears nobody is there. But he is shocked to see Mr Wilson, concealed by his Spiderman outfit, fly down from the roof and wish him happy birthday. Jayden was given the CT scan in August last year after a fall and, following the discovery of a mass on his brain, he was transferred to a hospital specialising in brain surgery. After an MRI scan and biopsy, doctors told his parents that he has cancer. After what they described as 'the worst weeks of our lives', the couple launched a fundraising to make the rest of Jayden’s life full of special days. The 'SpiderDad' video has been viewed more than 20,000 times on YouTube since it was posted this weekend. Mr Wilson has also been inundated with messages of support on the family's Facebook and gofundme pages. The tumour only came to light when Jayden (pictured with his parents, Lou and Mike, and his sister, Ella) was taken to hospital after banging his head last year .

"Two new species of spider, nicknamed Skeletorus and Sparklemuffin, have been discovered by researchers. Discovered in Queenstown, Australia, the creatures are new species of peacock spider. The spiders are given the moniker ‘peacock’ for their bright colours and also the bizarre dancing rituals that they use to attract mates. Two new species of spider have been discovered in Queenstown, Australia. They have been nicknamed Skeletorus and Sparklemuffin (pictured) for their odd looks. The former has a multi-coloured 'fan' that it uses to attract females, and both have a bizarre dancing ritual . The discovery was made in southeast Queensland by graduate student Madeline Girard from the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists have suggested that golden orb-web spiders may be able to ‘count’. The arachnids create ‘prey larders’ of victims trapped in their webs and it appears that they are able to keep track of how many meals they have left. Scientists observed that the spiders search for missing prey when it is taken from their webs. Golden orb-web spiders (Nephila clavipes) wait for prey to fly into their webs, but dead insects are sometimes stolen from their sticky nets by other spiders. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee controlled the number of prey items in the spiders’ ‘larders’ by giving them mealworm larvae and taking them away again. They discovered that the arachnids search for them if they are removed from their web. The scientific names of Sparklemuffin and Skeletorus are Maratus jactatus and Maratus sceletus respectively, but they were given the nicknames for their colourful appearances. Sparklemuffin has blue and red stripes on its abdomen, while Skeletorus has white stripes across its whole body - making it look a bit like a skeleton. Jürgen Otto, an entomologist who specialises in photographing the arachnids and who co-authored the report, told Live Science that Skeletorus looked ‘dramatically different [from] all other peacock spiders known to date, making me think that this group is perhaps much more diverse than we had thought’. At just 0.1 to 0.3 inches (three to seven millimetres) in length, the spiders are very small. Aside from their colour, though, the most intriguing thing about them is the odd mating dance they perform. The males display a flap-like body part called a fan, which is patterned with the stripes, while performing a routine to attract a mate. They also move from one leg to the other, to make themselves more prominent. Jürgen Otto, an entomologist who specialises in photographing the arachnids and who co-authored the report, told Live Science that Skeletorus (pictured) looked ‘dramatically different [from] all other peacock spiders known to date, making me think that this group is perhaps much more diverse than we had thought’ At just 0.1 to 0.3 inches (three to seven millimetres) in length, the spiders are very small. Aside from their colour, though, the most intriguing thing about them is the odd mating dance they perform. The male Sparklemuffin is pictured part-way through the dance . ‘Positions may be switched 10 times in a 20 second interval, with only about one second or less of display in a single position,’ the researchers explain about Skeletorus in their report. ‘The fan is prominently elevated and often waggled from side to side during this display, but the greatest and most rapid movement is that of the extended spinnerets, separately twitched from side to side. ‘During display, the pedipalps are often moved up and down in front of the clypeus and chelicerae. ‘One leg is elevated but also flexed, displaying a prominent black stripe with little significant movement.’ The scientific names of Sparklemuffin and Skeletorus are Maratus jactatus (female pictured) and Maratus sceletus respectively, but they were given the nicknames for their colourful appearances .","Two new species of spider have been discovered in Australia .

"Israel funding dissident People's Mujahedin of Iran, say officials in Tehran . U.S. officials confirmed today that Israel has been funding and training Iranian dissidents to assassinate nuclear scientists involved in Iran's nuclear program. The claim has already been levelled by the Iranian government who believed that Mossad, Israel's secret service, have been arming dissidents with the terrorist organisation the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK). Last month Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, 32, a chemistry expert, was killed in a brazen daylight . assassination when two assailants on a motorcycle attached a magnetic . bomb to his car in Tehran. Scroll down for video . Thousands of mourners chanted 'Death to Israel' and 'Death to America' as the coffin of chemical engineer Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, 32, was carried through the streets of Tehran . Washington insiders confirmed there is a close relationship between Mossad and MEK, according to NBC, but said the U.S. was not involved. Mohammad Javad Larijani, a senior aide to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told NBC: 'Israel does not have direct access to our society. Mujahedin, being Iranian and being part of Iranian society, they have… places to get into the touch with people. 'So I think they are working hand-to-hand very close. And we do have very concrete documents.' At one point, Mr Larijani claimed Mossad had built a replica home of an Iranian scientist so assassins could get to know the layout before they carried out an assassination. MEK denied involvement while the Israel Foreign Ministry declined to comment. A spokesperson for The National Council of Resistance of Iran, of which MEK is the largest member, also denied the claim, saying: 'The claim that the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK) had any role in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and the claim of the PMOI/MEK cooperation with Mossad is a total lie and there is not event a scintilla of truth in it. 'The National Council of Resistance of Iran has repeatedly denied the baseless allegation of playing a role in the assassination of nuclear scientists, whose primary source has been the propaganda organs of the clerical regime and the regime's officials.' In an address yesterday, Israeli president Shimon Peres referred to the Iranian nuclear issue. Assassinated: Ahmadi-Roshan's car is taken away for examination after he was killed . He addressed the Iranian people, . saying: 'We were not born enemies and there is no need for us to live as . enemies. Do not allow the flags of hostility to cast a dark shadow on . your heritage. 'You are a sensitive people that aspire to friendship and . peace, not conflict and wars.' However there have been suggestions that Israel's focus on Iran might really be a cover for destabilising President Obama's administration in Washington. Target: Chemistry expert Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan was allegedly killed by Iranian dissidents sponsored by Israel . Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said publicly last month that he believed that an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities might be welcomed by the people of the country. President Obama reiterated his view in an interview earlier this week that the increasing tension with Iran over the country's nuclear program could be resolved peacefully through talks. However he did also say that a range of options were available. According to salon.com, Netanyahu's statements were to paint Obama as 'weak' on Middle Eastern issues and undermine the President's second run for the White House. Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan's death was the latest in a string of attacks on Iranian scientists. Mr Roshan, who was a . chemical engineer and reportedly worked on procurement for the uranium . enrichment plant at Natanz, was killed with his driver by a motorcycle . assassin in rush-hour traffic. The killing of Mr Roshan in January bore a strong . resemblance to earlier killings of scientists working on the Iranian . nuclear programme. His funeral in Tehran several days later saw the ruling clergy stir the crowd of thousands of mourners who had gathered into a frenzy, urging the public to face down Western and Israeli threats against Iran's nuclear programme. They chanted 'Death to . Israel' and 'Death to America' as the coffin was hoisted high and carried through the streets. Several scientists have been killed or injured in the past two years and others have also been attacked or allegedly kidnapped - with Iran blaming the west. In June 2009, Shahram Amiri claimed to have been kidnapped while on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia and transferred to the U.S. where he said he was offered $50million to 'spread lies' about Iran's nuclear work. He returned to Iran in July 2010. War of words: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left) has made veiled threats over Iran's nuclear program while Obama (right) has repeatedly said the issue can be resolved peacefully . In January 2010, nuclear scientist Massoud Ali Mohammadi was killed by remote-controlled bomb in Tehran while in November, two car bomb blasts killed a nuclear scientist and wounded another in the capital. Physicist Darioush Rezai, 35, was shot dead by gunmen in eastern Tehran last July after being linked to the nuclear program. The People's Mujahedin, also known as MEK, MKO and PMI, has been named a terror organisation both by the U.S. and Iran. It was accused of being responsible for the deaths of American servicemen and citizens in the 1970s and 80s. Israel, . thought to hold the Middle East's only atomic weapons, has warned Iran . in the past against pursuing its nuclear research and development. Explosion: A cloth covers a blood stain on the road as onlookers watch police on Iran's state-run Al-Alam TV . Iran has accused Israel’s Mossad, the . CIA and Britain’s spy agencies of engaging in an underground . 'terrorism' campaign against nuclear-related targets, including at least . three killings since early 2010 and the release of a malicious computer . virus that temporarily disrupted controls of some centrifuges - a key . component in nuclear fuel production. All three countries have denied the Iranian accusations. The U.S. and its allies are . pressuring Iran to halt uranium enrichment, a key element of the nuclear . programme that the West suspects is aimed at producing atomic weapons. Uranium . enriched to low levels can be used as nuclear fuel but at higher . levels, it can be used as material for a nuclear warhead. Iran denies it is trying to make nuclear weapons, saying its programme is for peaceful purposes only. Claims: Mohammad Javad Larijani, a senior aide to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed the assassination of an Iranian scientist on a 'dirty plot' by Israel .","Israel funding dissident People's Mujahedin of Iran, say officials in Tehran ."
"A Florida nurse is suing Cesar Millan after she was viciously attacked by a pit bull that had left the Dog Whisperer's training center just six days before. Alison Bitney was visiting a friend in California in September 2014 when the dog named Gus--which had a documented history of aggressive behavior--savagely bit her left arm, which has left her hand with no feeling or function. Bitney filed suit in California against her friend John Vazzoler, the Dog Psychology Center in Santa Clarita, Millan and a rescuer who'd previously saved the dog from being euthanized following an attack in Katy, Texas in February 2013. Scroll down for video . Sued: Florida nurse Alison Bitney is suing Cesar Milan after a pit bull (not the one pictured) that was trained at his California Dog Psychology center savagely attacked her in September . According to the suit, the dog inflicted 'disfiguring open wounds, deep muscle and tendon lacerations' on Bitney, who's now seeking punitive damages, reports the LA Times. The dog had previously been sentenced to die by a Texas judge in February 2014 after he attacked a trainer named Amber Rickles. The canine was in her care after its owner surrendered him for being 'nervous, growling and doesn't like children,' according to Bitney's suit. 'With the pit bull still attached to her left breast, Ms. Rickles backed into a laundry room where the dog released his grip, enabling Ms. Rickles to close the door. The pit bull then broke through the door and attacked Ms. Rickles a third time, latching onto her left arm and breaking it in two places,' reads the suit as obtained by Courthouse News. Despite the horrific nature of the attack and the grueling surgeries and rehabilitation the suit says Rickles had to endure, Gus was rescued by the woman who'd originally brought him to Rickles, Jennifer L. Romano. Bitney says Romano appealed to the judge, who allowed Gus to live so long as Milan's Dog Psychology Center then agreed to take the pit bull and rehabilitate it at Millan's center, according to the 27-page lawsuit. The Dog Whisperer, as he's known, did not have contact with the animal in question, his lawyers say. However, Bitney's suit claims his facility released the dog, which had a history of attacking people and other dogs, while knowing it was a danger . 'Thereafter, Cesar Millan and his Dog Psychology Center, agreed to take over custody and control of the pit bull and not to release it until it was ""fully deemed a safe member of society,""' reads complaint. However, Rickles claims the dog owner fell behind in payments to the center and was 'entrusted it to someone with no training or experience' on September 17, according to the suit. Days later, Bitney was attacked. However, the Dog Psychology Center tells the LA Times that Gus left the facility 'against the strong advice and objection of his trainer.' What's more, Cesar Millan, who is named in the suit, was never in contact with the animal, they say. Bitney is suing for an unknown sum. A call to her attorneys at Scolinos, Sheldon & Nevell was not immediately returned.","Alison Bitney was visiting a friend in Santa Clarita, California when she says the dog Gus viciously attacked her .

"Cissy has never run away from home before. But on Saturday the miniature schnauzer from Iowa did, in order to find the person that is home. Cissy disappeared from her yard in Cedar Rapids, only to show up about 20 blocks away at Mercy Medical Center.

"United States-based airlines reported 17 animal fatalities and 26 injuries in 2014. Of all the carriers, United Airlines reported the most deaths and injuries, while SkyWest boasted a record zero animal fatalities. The data was released by the Department of Transportation, as part of a larger compilation of operating information, in its Consumer Air Travel Report. In 2014, 17 animal fatalities and 26 pet injuries were reported by several U.S. airlines . Most of the injuries reported involved dogs and cats that had been hurt as they attempted to escape from their cages. Alaska - 3 deaths . American - 3 deaths . Delta - 4 deaths . Hawaiian - 2 deaths . SkyWest - 0 deaths . United - 5 deaths . Source: Department of Transportation . Many of the deaths were a result of the animals actually escaping from their transport cages and being hit by other vehicles at the airport. Another major cause of death was underlying health conditions, such as dogs with short or snub noses, which were then aggravated by the stress of travelling. Several airlines are currently reviewing their policies for those types of animals, such as pugs and English bulldogs. These brachycephalic breeds, more frequently than others, experience breathing problems when faced with stressful conditions. Thus, they have a particularly high risk of suffocating in-flight. Whenever possible, it is advised to purchase your pet a spot in the passenger cabin instead of cargo hold . Despite friendly staff and smooth air, animals travelling in the cargo hold of a commercial jet do face their fair share of environmental stresses, such as varying temperatures, loud noises and air pressure drops. However, since two million animals travel on commercial flights each year, the number of those injured, lost or killed is still extremely low. And the total number of animal deaths seems to be declining. In 2011, 35 pets died while travelling on U.S. airlines and in 2012, 29 pets died. Between 2010 and 2013, it was Delta reported the greatest number of animal incidents and was held responsible for 41 of the 97 reported deaths. However, Delta maintains that the reason for their higher numbers is simply because they carry more pets than any other competing airline. Delta is also very open about the lengthy precautions that taken to ensure animal safety on board, which includes not allowing pets to travel between May 15 and September 15 when temperatures my get too hot. They also reserve the right not to carry pets in the cargo hold during periods of extreme cold weather.

"Carmen the 9-year-old boxer that has been praised for her heroism during a deadly house fire in Ohio is showing signs of improvement. The pooch who was found covering her owner Ben Ledford's face as his home in Goshen Township burned last Thursday, today was taken off the ventilator and was breathing on her own. Ledford, 33, did not survive despite his dog's efforts. He was laid to rest Tuesday. Scroll down for video . On the mend: Carmen, a 9-year-old boxer, was taken off the ventilator and was breathing on her own six days after her owner was killed in a house fire . Tragic: Owner Ben Ledford died after the fire despite his dog's brave efforts to save him by shielding his face from the smoke with her body . Carmen was rushed in critical condition to CARE Center veterinary clinic in Cincinnati last week suffering from severe damage to her lungs cause by smoke inhalation. 'A lot of dogs instinctively know when there’s a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go try to protect their owners,' said veterinarian Dr. Marlo Anderson. After a weekend spent in an oxygen chamber being fed fluids intravenously, the hulking canine began to turn the corner Monday. On Tuesday morning, the team at CARE Center posted an update on their Facebook page sharing the good news that Carman was taken off the ventilator and her vital signs were holding steady. The 9-year-old dog is currently getting oxygen through a nasal tube and is starting to wake up from the sedative drugs. The critical care staff were expecting to see Carman up fully awake and moving around by Wednesday. ‘She's doing very well. We're very happy with where her progress is at this point,’ Dr. Marlo Anderson, the critical care specialist, told WCPO. Once Carmen recovers, her owner's brother, Philip Ledford, plans to adopt her. Emily Leford, Ben and Philip’s sister, said her late brother had a very special relationship with his pet. Good news: Staff at CARE Center veterinary clinic said Carmen's vital signs and oxygen levels were holding steady . Outpouring of support: Good Samaritans from all over the country have been sending notes to the clinic in support of the ailing pooch . Getting better: The 9-year-old dog is currently getting oxygen through a nasal tube and is starting to wake up from the sedative drugs . ‘There was nothing in this world that Ben loved more than Carmen and there was nothing that Carmen loved more than Ben,’ she told the site. Mr Ledford has set up a donations page to help with Carmen’s medical bills. As of late Tuesday night, the campaign has drawn more than $19,000in donations, inching towards the $25,000 goal. ‘While we're not out of the woods yet and there is still significant care that she needs, her chances of survival have increased,’ the Ledford family wrote on the fundraiser page. ‘We're hopeful that we will actually be able to take her home one day.’ At least one person, Ron Mitchell, attempted to get Ben Ledford to safety before firefighters arrived but the fire and smoke were too much for him. Best buddies: Ledford's sister said her late brother and Carmen loved one another very much . Kept in the family: Once Carmen recovers, her owner's brother plans to adopt her . 'I tried to climb through the front door. I got about a bodies length in and the smoke was so thick that I had to come back out and then I went around the back of the door in back of the house and saw that the dryer vent that was on the back that window to the basement was on fire,' he said. Ledford was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Bethesda North Hospital, though he displayed signs of life when medics first reached him in the basement.

It will be at least 24 hours before they can determine Carmen's chances of recovery. At least one person, Ron Mitchell, attempted to get Ledford to safety before firefighters arrived but the fire and smoke were too much for him. 'I tried to climb through the front door. I got about a bodies length in and the smoke was so thick that I had to come back out and then I went around the back of the door in back of the house and saw that the dryer vent that was on the back that window to the basement was on fire,' he said. Ledford was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Bethesda North Hospital, though he displayed signs of life when medics first reached him. Authorities are focusing their investigation on the basement to find the fire's cause.

"Charles Manson's fiancee has spoken out for the first time about her engagement to tell the world: 'I think he's the most handsome man in the world.' Afton Elaine Burton, who goes by the mononym 'Star', tells Inside Edition on Monday that she still plans to marry the 80-year-old convicted murderer despite the fact that their marriage license expired earlier this month. She insists Manson did not brutally murder Sharon Tate and six others and adds that she wants to 'take very good care of him'. Her words come amid claims she tricked her murderous beau into an engagement so that she could put his corpse on display after his death. Vow: Afton Elaine Burton, 27, insists she will marry Charles Manson although their marriage license expired . Side-stepping the allegation, Burton reminds the interviewer that she moved to California nine years ago to care for Manson, who is not eligible for parole until 2027 - when he will be 92. 'Yes, I'm going to marry Charles Manson,' Burton declares. Manson has been in prison in Corcoran, California, since 1969, when he was convicted of murdering Roman Polanski's wife, the actress Sharon Tate, and six others. He was aided by three women - his 'followers'. Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel, remain encarcerated. A third, Susan Atkins, died of cancer in prison. According to the New York Post, Burton tried to get the rights to Manson's remains without marrying him, but was turned down. The paper claimed that she offered herself up as a his bride after being rebuffed, because Californian law allows spouses to choose what happens to their husbands' and wives' bodies after they die. The claims come from Daniel Simone, a journalist who has spoken extensively with Manson and is planning to write a book on him. He claimed that Manson is now wise to the plot - and thinks it is ridiculous because he believes that he's immortal. Simone told the Post: 'He's finally realized that he's been played for a fool.' 'He feels he will never die... Therefore, he feels it's a stupid idea to begin with.' Simone also said that Manson never had any intention of marrying Star - but he kept up the pretense because they would bring presents to his prison cell in Corcoran, California. The prospect of Star becoming Mrs Manson diminished this week after it emerged the couple's 90-day marriage license had expired. Killer: Manson was convicted of killing Sharon Tate and six others with his 'followers'. He is pictured left during his trial in March, 1971, and of right in a mugshot taken on March 18, 2009 at California State Prison, Corcoran . Prison rules mean the two could only marry during visiting hours on a weekend - and they had their final shot two weeks ago before the license expired on February 5. Simone said that Manson has been unable to receive visitors lately because he is being treated for an infection. In a statement, Star has said she an Manson will still marry - but that an 'interruption in logistics' got in the way. Manson has been in prison for more than four decades after being put away for a series of murders in 1969 killings. His victims included the brutal murder of director Roman Polanski's actress wife, Sharon Tate, who was eight-and-a-half months pregnant. Star insisted last year that she and Manson were madly in love and already consider themselves married. 'I'm completely with him, and he's completely with me. It's what I was born for, you know. I don't know what else to say,' she told CNN in August of the now gray-haired killer, who has a swastika tattooed on his forehead. She said she had been following Manson's 'philosophy' since she was a teenager and moved to Corcoran, where the convicted murderer is detained, to be closer to him. Manson was married twice before he was jailed, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958, and later to Candy Stevens between 1959 and 1963. He was sentenced to death in 1969 along with four of his disciples for having led the killing of seven people, but their sentences were later commuted to life in prison. Manson applied for parole in 2012 but was denied release and is not eligible to apply again until 2027. Manson headed an apocalyptic cult that committed murders in upscale, mostly white neighborhoods of Los Angeles in order to blame the crimes on African Americans, in the hope of sparking what he termed a 'Helter Skelter' race war.","Afton Eliane Burton, 27, got marriage license with Manson, 80, last year .

"A former Power Ranger has been arrested for allegedly murdering his roommate with a sword. Ricardo Medina Jr, the Red Ranger, has been charged with killing Joshua Sutter by stabbing him in the abdomen with the sharp weapon on Saturday afternoon. The 37-year-old, who reportedly called 911 himself, was taken into custody in Palmdale, California, shortly after, reports claim. Sutter was taken to hospital and pronounced dead. Murder accusation: TMZ reported that Ricardo Medina Jr stabbed his roommate in the abdomen and was arrested. He is pictured left at a fan convention and right in Power Rangers Samurai . According to TMZ, the roommates started fighting at around 3.30pm. Medina went into his room with his girlfriend but Sutter tried to follow them, the report states. It was then that Medina allegedly dealt the fatal blow. He has been charged and detained, with his bail set at $1 million. Medina starred in the 2002 TV series Power Rangers Wild Force before playing Deker in the 2011 series Power Rangers Samurai. He also voiced Deker in the video game Power Rangers Samurai, and in the movie Power Rangers Samurai: A New Enemy, which hit theaters in 2012. Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, Medina was also pursuing a singing career and had stints in ER and CSI, according to his IMDb profile. 'Attack': The actor allegedly speared his roommate during an argument then called 911 himself . 'He is a great friend and a great client. It's something I can't even conceive. I don't see that in him. He was a very helpful guy and great with his dog. It's such a shock,' said Gar Lester, Medina's former agent who has known the actor for 12 years, told ABC7. Medina's neighbor, Justin Adamson, said the actor had moved into the block about two months ago. He told ABC7: 'We brought him some bread and just tried to interact a little bit with him, but he was more of the, you know, the type of guy that didn't really want to communicate.'","Ricardo Medina Jr, 37, allegedly stabbed roommate in abdomen on Saturday .

"Apple fans may need to wait a little longer to get their hands, or wrists, on the tech giant's upcoming smartwatch. A 'source close to Apple' told The Information that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the watch] before Valentine's Day'. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year. Scroll down for video . A 'source close to Apple' told The Information that the firm 'would be lucky to ship [the Apple Watch] before Valentine's Day'. Apple is said to be unhappy with the watch's battery life, and the long lead time before the $349 (£216) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released early next year . And The Information also reported that Apple partners and employees expected the watch to launch this year. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook unveiled the watch at a launch event earlier this month. But despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Mr Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission, suggests the watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it sold in early 2015. Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch. During an interview in Bloomberg Business Week, Apple's senior vice president of operations Jeff WIlliams said: 'We want to make the best product in the world. 'One of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt, but nobody is wearing them.' The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said that Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’ Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) unveiled the watch at a launch event earlier this month. Although he didn't reveal battery life details, Mr Cook did spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging . The watch has a completely new user interface (left), different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown' (right) presented by chief executive Tim Cook . The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. The product costs $349 (£216) and is now not expected to launch until at least February next year . A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple’s other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is the launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a vibrations users feel on their wrist . It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone . Companies like Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will ‘motivate people to be more active and more healthy.’ Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging. The long lead time before the product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released, since app developers have more time to create apps specifically for the watch. Apple’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature. The success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time.","The Apple Watch was unveiled at an event in California earlier this month .

"A wire-tapping lawsuit in San Francisco against Google could cost the internet giant billions of dollars or nothing, depending on the result of a search of two hard company hard drives. 22 plaintiffs accuse the search engine company of vacuuming personal data off their Wi-Fi networks with its roving Street View cars between 2008 and 2010. If successful the lawsuit would be a landmark judgement, as online corporations have faced criticism but rarely judgments for their handling of users' privacy. Snooped: Google is accused of indiscriminately gathering data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks with Street View cars . The Street View cars were deployed with 360-degree camera systems to capture images for Google Street View and Google Earth. When the Street View cars were announced, Google did not reveal they were also loaded with wireless analyzers, tools designed to 'sample, collect, decode, and analyze' data sent over accessible Wi-Fi networks. That led to Street View cars vacuuming up huge amounts of 'payload' data, which includes passwords, email and multimedia like videos and photos. Even data from Voice Over Internet Protocols, such as the Internet phone service Skype, may have been collected. Bloomberg reports that the case stalled while Google fought to appeal the wiretapping accusation, claiming that  data on unsecured wireless networks was equivalent to that on AM/FM transmissions. The Supreme Court declined to hear Google's case in June. Mapping: Street View cars were intended to map the globe and capture photos for Google Street View and Google Earth . Rogue: Marius Milner added code that turned Street View cars into vacuums of personal data, which Google alleges he did on his own . Even as the lawsuit goes forward, proof will need to be found that personal data was collected by searching two hard drives held as evidence in San Francisco. Both sides have been ordered to settle on a neutral expert to comb through the hard drives to find traces of data being picked up. Once over that hurdle, the plaintiffs will have an easier time winning what would be a watershed online privacy lawsuit, as they do not have to prove they suffered damage from Google's actions or that Google initiated the project maliciously. In the past, Google claimed that the wireless analyzer program was the work of a 'rogue' programmer, which the corporation only found out about after it was initiated. The employee, first referred to as 'Engineer Doe,' was later outed as Marius Milner, a respected British expert on wireless networks, according to the New York Times. Street View cars throughout the United States, Canada and Europe collected data, triggering various investigations. In 2013, the search engine company said it would pay $7million to settle with over 30 states and the District of Columbia over its data collection practices. The ongoing lawsuit, which has yet to move to the class action phase, would net up to $10,000 in damages for each affected user, leading a windfall judgement.","22 plaintiffs will need to find evidence of their personal data on two Google servers held in evidence .

"After a two year battle with stage four colon cancer that included, rapper Ahmad Givens died. The VH1 reality star, who also went by the name Real, was 33-years-old when he passed away on Friday night, according to TMZ. He had been bedridden since January after being diagnosed with  cancer in 2013 following three misdiagnoses. Scroll down for video . After a two year battle with  cancer, Ahmad Givens died on Saturday. The reality star and rapper, who also went by the name Real, was 33-years-old . Mr Givens (center, with his mother, left, and grandma, right) said he had not felt well since an event in January 2013 . Doctors originally diagnosed him with hepatitis A, mono and the Norovirus after he felt sick in at an event January 2013, he told UrbanDaily in April. Mr Givens said that he hadn't felt fully better since, with his condition worsening after he fell in January. The star, who first became known on I Love New York in 2007, said that he checked himself into the hospital in March 2013 after a medicine from the last doctor he saw made him lose thirty pounds from diarrhea. He said the doctor came in crying and I knew something was seriously wrong. Mr Givens's cancer eventually spread to his brain, and he had a procedure (pictured) to remove nerve damage caused by the disease . He posted this picture of his surgery scar two months ago and said that he was choosing between clinical trials after his chemotherapy stopped working . 'She said, “I have bad news to tell you. You have cancer. You have stage four colon cancer.”' Another doctor told him that he likely had two weeks left to live. Mr Givens had an operation to remove cancerous growths from his colon in December 2013. While in surgery, doctors removed most of his liver after they found that the cancer had spread and created seven tumors. He later found out that the tumors had also spread to his brain and he was partially paralyzed on his right side. Two months ago he posted on Instagram that he was being taken off of chemotherapy because 'none of it works anymore'. He said that he was choosing between different clinical trials to try new medicines.

"Campaigners for survivors of child sexual abuse have savaged David Cameron after he called claims of a Home Office paedophile cover-up a 'conspiracy theory'. Referring to the findings of a review into allegations of a VIP paedophile ring, the Prime Minister said on the campaign trail in Rochester that ‘conspiracy theorists’ would have to ‘look elsewhere’. Last night the author of that review flatly called Mr Cameron's comments 'wrong', while the National Association for People Abused in Childhood said his intervention was 'appalling'. David Cameron teaches politics at Strood Academy in Rochester: He sparked outrage among victims of child sexual abuse after he called claims of an Establishment paedophile cover-up a 'conspiracy theory' It seemed to directly contradict an extraordinary admission by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, that there 'might have been a cover-up' of an Establishment paedophile ring by her department in the 1980s. The comments by Mrs May and Mr Cameron came after the publication of a report into how her department handled papers relating to alleged child abusers at Westminster. NSPCC boss Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC had tried to track down 114 files that went missing in the Home Office. Just one was found; another was shredded by the Ministry of Justice, which took possession of the dossier, just three years ago. Mr Cameron seemed to directly contradict an extraordinary admission by Theresa May, the Home Secretary, that there 'might have been a cover-up' The men concluded: ‘It is ... not possible to say whether files were ever removed or destroyed to cover up or hide allegations of organised or systematic child abuse by particular individuals because of the systems then in place. We cannot say that no file was removed or destroyed for that reason.’ Their report also revealed the list of names which officials were asked to search under when looking for the missing files – suggesting possible links to the so-called Dickens dossier. It included known paedophiles such as Cyril Smith and members of the Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise sex with children. It also featured senior political figures such as former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, Labour peer Lord Janner, and two Tory grandees, Sir Peter Morrison and Sir Peter Hayman, who are both now dead. Police have questioned Lord Brittan and searched Lord Janner’s home in recent months, but neither has been charged. In a statement to MPs, Mrs May said of the latest findings: ‘It doesn’t prove or disprove the Home Office acted appropriately in the 1980s.’ She added: ‘There might have been a cover-up.’ But Mr Cameron, speaking in Rochester where he is desperately trying to head off another possible by-election win for Ukip, contradicted both his Home Secretary and the findings of the report. 'There will be lessons from the report and people should study it closely. But I think it is important that it says that there wasn't a cover-up,' he said. 'Some of the people who've been looking for conspiracy theories will have to look elsewhere'. Last night, Mr Wanless said his comments were ‘wrong’. The National Association for People Abused in Childhood told The Sun: 'It's an appalling thing for the Prime Minister to say.' 'Wrong': The response of NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless to Mr Cameron's comments. He carried out the review into Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse that the PM was referring to . The new report centred on the work of late Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens, who wrote to Lord Brittan in 1983 to say he would expose eight public figures suspected of child abuse unless action was taken. Lord Brittan has said in a statement that he ‘told Mr Dickens that I would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the Home Office and acted on as necessary’. The files were never published. Earlier this year, amid revelations in the Mail about Smith and the PIE, it emerged that the Dickens dossier had gone missing, along with a string of other documents. After an initial review by the Home Office found they could not be traced, Mrs May appointed Mr Wanless and Mr Whittam to conduct a full trawl across Whitehall. Former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens (left), who died in 1995, said he gave details of Establishment paedophiles – known as 'Dickens dossier' – to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan (right) in 1983 . Yesterday, the two men said one file had come to light as a result of ‘heightened awareness’ of the subject in the Home Office – but none of Dickens’ were found. The report also failed to rule out a whistleblower’s claims that the Home Office directly awarded tens of thousands of pounds of public money to the PIE. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who has raised the issue of historic child abuse, branded the review a ‘whitewash’. He said: ‘We [cannot] just gloss over the past and hope it all goes away.’ And campaigning journalist Don Hale, who was given a dossier naming VIP paedophiles in the 1980s, said the review was a 'complete waste of time', telling The Sun's Stephen Hawkes: 'It was always going to fail.'","NSPCC boss Peter Wanless calls the Prime Minister's comments 'wrong'

In following years, he produced a number of popular shows, including ABC’s It Takes a Thief, which starred his fellow Hollywood High School alum Robert Wagner as a burglar for the U.S. Government. He also took it upon himself to rewrite the original pilot for The Six Million Dollar Man - based on the 1972 novel, Cyborg - after ABC initially spurned it. The pilot, alongside scripts for a pair of 90-minute telefilms, convinced then-network executive Barry Diller to greenlight the action series, starring Lee Majors as a former astronaut  with bionic implants. During his long-running career, Larson also created NBC's McCloud, Alias Smith & Jones, B.J. and The Bear, Switch (another series starring Wagner), Manimal and The Misadventures of Sheriff Lobo.

When asked how he kept up with such a huge workload in 2009, Larson, who  left Universal for Fox following his production of Knight Rider, said he attempted to keep every show under control. 'I tried to stay with things until I thought they were on their feet and they learned to walk and talk,' he told the Archive of American Television. 'If you believe if something, you must will it through, because everything gets in the way. Everyone tries to steer the ship off course.' But despite his incredible career, Larson never won an Emmy; earning just three nominations, two for his work on McCloud and one for Quincy. However, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1985. '[Our shows] were enjoyable, they had a pretty decent dose of humor. All struck a chord in the mainstream. What we weren’t going to do was win a shelf full of Emmys,' he told the news station. Hit: Meanwhile CBS's Magnum P.I. (with Tom Selleck, pictured) aired for eight seasons from 1980 to 1988 . 'We got plenty of nominations for things, but ours were not the kind of shows that were doing anything more than reaching a core audience.' Larson is survived by his wife Jannie, brother Kenneth, five daughters and four sons (including his son, James) from his former wives, Carol Gourley and Janet Curtis. A memorial service will be held in the near future, James told The Hollywood Reporter.","Glen Larson, 77, died from esophageal cancer at hospital on Friday night .

"Extraordinary new drugs have cleared tumours that have spread throughout lung cancer patients’ whole bodies, scientists say. Some are even talking of the new immunotherapy drugs effectively curing patients of the disease, which has a grim survival record. After lung cancer has spread to other organs – and by the time it’s spotted, it usually has – most patients die within months. Dr Mick Peake: The doctor saw one man in his 40s who had lung cancer which had spread to his liver, brain, bones and adrenal glands - but the disease disappeared . Of all cancers it is by far the biggest killer in Britain, claiming 35,000 lives a year, more than bowel and breast cancer combined. But now scientists are reporting incredible success treating advanced lung cancer with drugs such as nivolumab. Next week ‘stellar’ trial results for the antibody drug will be presented at the world’s biggest cancer conference, for the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in Chicago. Doctors will reveal that a quarter of 129 US patients with advanced lung cancer have survived at least two years after starting nivolumab. Dr Mick Peake of Glenfield Hospital in Leicester said: ‘You would expect patients in that group to survive a few months, if you’re lucky. So to get 24 per cent living two years is extraordinary.’ He saw one man in his 40s had lung cancer which had spread to his liver, brain, bones and adrenal glands, he said. ‘By the time it’s spread that far, you don’t expect patients to last more than a couple of months. But in a recent scan, his doctor could not find any evidence of residual disease.’ Dr Peake said it was also remarkable that so many were responding to this treatment. Of those treated with the optimum dose, 45 per cent were alive after two years. He said: ‘In any trial you get the odd patient who does very well, but this is an order of magnitude above that.’ Glenfield Hospital: Dr Mick Peake of Glenfield Hospital in Leicester said in any trial you get the odd patient who does very well, but this is an order of magnitude above that . Last September, The Mail on Sunday revealed these drugs were being used to treat skin cancer with great success. Now they are having a similar effect on lung cancer, which is 15 times more deadly. Nivolumab is one of a new class of drug, called anti-PD1s and anti-PDL1s, which help the immune system ‘see’ that tumours are deadly foes. Explaining how the drugs work Dr Peake said: ‘Tumours develop a ‘cloak’, like a Star Wars force field, around themselves. This stops the immune system attacking them. ‘These drugs take that force field away and allow the body’s immune response to fight the tumour. The beauty is we do not have the adverse side effects of conventional treatment.’ Professor Dean Fennell, who has been treating British patients with a similar drug, MK3475, said: ‘This is an enormous deal. There are patients on treatment who’ve been going an incredibly long time.’ He added it was ‘not inconceivable’ that they could be an ‘effective cure’ for some – allowing patients to live virtually disease-free for years. Dr Julie Brahmer. of John Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Baltimore, who has helped spearhead US nivolumab trials, said it was ‘a little early’ to call it a cure. But she added: ‘That’s what our hope is.’ She has also witnessed patients whose tumours have shrunk to almost nothing, with some people still well three years after treatment began. One is still well a year after treatment stopped – suggesting the immune system ‘learns’ from the intravenous therapy. However, Dr Brahmer, a supporter of US charity Uniting Against Lung Cancer, warned these new drugs were no ‘magic bullet’ for lung cancer. ‘The next step is to make the drugs even better – combining them with standard treatments, other antibodies, and by priming the tumours. We have to figure out how to make them work for everyone.’","Scientists are reporting success treating advanced lung cancer with drugs such as nivolumab .

"It is the episode of Fawlty Towers best remembered for the line ‘Don’t mention the war’ and John Cleese’s silly walk when impersonating Hitler. The references have proved controversial before, but when The Germans was repeated on BBC2 on Sunday evening it wasn’t our European neighbours that the corporation was worried about offending. Instead, the episode was edited to omit racist language – only for some viewers to then complain that the BBC was ‘airbrushing history’. Scroll down to see the clips . 'Don't mention the war': John Cleese as Basil Fawlty giving an Adolf Hitler impression to German guests, with Polly in the background played by Connie Booth . The Germans episode of Fawlty Towers was voted number 11 in Channel 4¿s One Hundred Greatest TV Moments in 1999 . In one scene one of the hotel’s permanent residents, Major Gowen, uses derogatory terms to describe black people. It was included in the episode’s first airing in October 1975, but this time around the major’s words were edited out. The scene involves Basil Fawlty and the major, played by actor Ballard Berkeley, exchanging their normal pleasantries before the conversation moves on to Basil’s wife Sybil and women in general. The major tells Fawlty about the time he took a woman to see India play cricket  at the Oval. He then says: ‘The strange thing was, throughout the morning she kept referring to the Indians as niggers. “No, no, no,” I said, “the niggers are the West Indians. These people are wogs”.’ Several years ago there were concerns that the episode would never be shown again because of the offensive words. However, recent editions of The Complete Fawlty Towers DVD, distributed by BBC Worldwide, have not been edited and included the segment that was cut by the BBC on Sunday. Some fans took to the BBC’s Points Of View message board yesterday to say they ‘despaired’ at the ‘unnecessary’ editing. One . wrote: ‘You can’t airbrush history away and I doubt if anyone but the . terminally thin-skinned could be offended by the major, a character . we’re clearly supposed to laugh at rather than with.’ Ballard Berkeley  as the Major Gowen, who makes the offensive remark. Viewers said that the 'bigoted character' was meant to be laughed at - not with . Another posted: ‘The point is that the major is a racist old bigot, incongruous with modern society – even in the Seventies. The audience isn’t supposed to agree with him, they’re supposed to laugh at him. The whole episode is about xenophobia in various forms – it’s social satire. I instinctively dislike the airbrushing of history.’ A third viewer wrote: ‘So how sad BBC you have finally succumbed and lost the guts to transmit the episode of Fawlty Towers “The Germans” in its original form. The major’s speech of his experience of going out with a woman to the Oval is one of the funniest things ever. ‘You edited it because it includes the W-word and the N-word. Let’s face it, the whole episode and much of Fawlty Towers is racist by today’s standards and misogynistic, but above all it is hilarious. ‘We are all grown up, you know. We, the vast majority of us, can laugh at this without being racists. ‘It’s about time you grew up BBC, and trusted your audience. We know what is acceptable and what is not and what is funny and why, and the fact it is of a time which is now long past. We understand context, the major is a figure of fun, he doesn’t whip up hatred.’ Fawlty Towers was written by and starred Cleese and his then wife Connie Booth. The Germans was the sixth episode of the 12 that were made and was voted number 11 in Channel 4’s One Hundred Greatest TV Moments in 1999. The series has continued to entertain families since being made in the 1970s and was in 2000 voted by industry professionals to be the best British series of all time. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are very proud of Fawlty Towers and its contribution to British television comedy. ‘But public attitudes have changed significantly since it was made and it was decided to make some minor changes, with the consent of John Cleese’s management, to allow the episode to transmit to a family audience at 7.30pm on BBC2.’ CENSORED Cleeses's 'Hitler Walk' was previously deemed one of greatest moments of TV .","Viewers complain that only the 'terminally thin-skinned' could be offended by the character .

"A 35-year-old Detroit mother accused of killing two of her chidlren and stuffing their bodies inside a deep freezer said through her attorney Thursday that she loves her two surviving kids and wants to see them. Prosecutors charged Mitchelle Blair Thursday with felony murder, premeditated murder and torture. Court officers carrying out a March 24 eviction at the family's apartment found the frozen corpses of 13-year-old Stoni Ann Blair and 9-year-old Stephen Gage Berry. Impassive: Mitchelle Blair, pictured left and right in court Thursday, appeared stone-faced during her arraignment on murder and abuse charges . Laundry list of counts: Prosecutors charged Mitchelle Blair Wednesday with felony murder, premeditated murder and torture. Inked: The tattooed names of her four children, including Stoni and Stephen, are visible on her right forearm below the crossed out name of an ex . Blair initially was charged with child abuse, but more charges had been expected after autopsies revealed the siblings were beaten to death. Investigators believe Stephen died in August 2012 and Stoni died the following May. Blair's two surviving children — ages 8 and 17 — have been placed into a relative's care. Appearing in court Thursday for a probable-cause hearing, with the names of her four children inked on her forearm, Blair was arraigned on two counts of felony murder, first-degree premeditated murder and torture. The 35-year-old woman previously had been charged with four counts of first-degree child abuse and one count of committing first-degree child abuse in the presence of another child. Responding to a reporter's question about the woman’s two surviving children, Blair’s defense attorney, Wyatt Harris, said his client 'loves her children very much.' He then added he is sure Blair 'wants to see her children,' reported The Detroit Free Press. Blair's daughter, Stoni (left) and son Stephen (right). Stoni's sister claimed Blair killed Stoni by strangling her with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag . 'Violent': The 35-year-old woman previously had been charged with four counts of first-degree child abuse and one count of committing first-degree child abuse in the presence of another child . confession: According to police, during her arrest March 24, Blair admitted to killing the two children, saying: ‘They’re both dead! I did it!’ Attorney Wyatt Harris (right) told reporters his client loves her surviving children and wants to see them . Harris entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Blair, who appeared impassive as she stood by his side with her tattooed arms crossed and wearing blank expression on her face. The attorney made a motion for an independent mental health evaluation for his client, which Judge Kenneth King granted. Experts will assess Blair’s mental competency to waive her Miranda rights, to be held criminally responsible for her actions and to stand trial. Judge King also gave the defense attorney permission to review two videotaped interviews conducted with Blair's surviving children by child advocates working with law enforcement. At the request of the prosecution, the lawyer was ordered not to share the recordings with anyone other than doctors or members of Blair’s family. Mitchelle Blair was ordered held without bail pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 19. According to police, during her arrest March 24, Blair admitted to killing the two children, saying: ‘They’re both dead! I did it!’ She also allegedly stated that she was not evil, ‘It was just an evil act.’ A medical examiner has determined that the exact cause of death was blunt force trauma and ruled it a homicide. A joint funeral for Stoni and Stephen will be held April 13 in Detroit. At Harris' (left) request, a judge ordered a mental health evaluation for Blair to determine if she was cempetent enough to waive her Miranda rights and stand trial . Details of death and extreme abuse emerged Thursday as Mitchelle Blair appeared in court, two days after the bodies of her 9-year-old son, Stephen Berry, and 13-year-old daughter, Stoni Blair, were discovered . Child welfare officials revealed last week that Blair's two surviving children had been terribly abused in a house of horrors. The Michigan Department of Human Services is taking steps to end Blair's rights to her two other children, a 17-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son, who are currently with a relative. In a court filing, the state said her daughter described a home where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood and hit and burned with a hot curling iron. Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the surviving children. Twenty-five scars were found on the boy's back that were consistent with being hit by an extension cord, according to a petition obtained by the Detroit News. Blair's teenage daughter also described how her siblings were killed, according to court papers. 'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old. Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home (pictured) opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter Stoni Ann Blair and her son Stephen Gage Berry . In a court filing, the state said the teen described a house of horrors, where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood, hit with a hot curling iron and burned with a clothing iron . Stephen was 'unresponsive' on Aug 30, 2012, and Blair wrapped his body in bed linen and put him in the freezer, the state said. Nine months later, Blair became 'enraged' when Stoni said she didn't like her surviving siblings and strangled the girl with a T-shirt and suffocated her with a plastic bag, the department said. Blair then made the teen 'put Stoni in the deep freezer following her death,' the agency said. The bodies of the children were discovered on Tuesday while court officers were serving an eviction notice. The apartment was reportedly filled with food and trash and rendered almost 'unlivable', according to the report. Blair's 8-year-old boy also was aware that his sister and brother were killed and subsequently placed in the freezer, the department said. While being questioned, Blair told investigators she placed Stephen 'in a boiling hot tub of water until his feet blistered' because she found out Stephen was allegedly sexually assaulting a relative, according to the Detroit News. Blair also told police that when he died, she wrapped him 'in his favorite blanket' and put him in the freezer, the police report states. The surviving children did not mention sexual abuse when they were interviewed by counselors, according to a juvenile court petition. A woman walks past notes left on the door at at the family's home on Wednesday. The teenager said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years . Blair's teenage daughter said neither she nor her siblings have attended school for two years. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago. Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house. 'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.' Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food. She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'. 'This is just wrong,' she said in tears. Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home on Tuesday. 'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.' Earlier Thursday, Blair appeared in court on child abuse charges via a video feed from a police lockup. Magistrate Renee McDuffee entered a not-guilty plea on her behalf. The state said it investigated allegations of abuse in 2002 and 2005. Blair was referred to counseling and allowed to keep custody of her children. Toni Williams, 28, left, and Natasha Bell, 30, leave balloons at the house on Wednesday . The two fathers of Blair's surviving children are unfit to care for them, according to the state. Together they owe $50,000 in child support and haven't seen the kids in two to three years. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex. 'While we all understand the desire to know what happened in that home is strong, I will ask you to be mindful of the two children who were also in that home and are still living,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters Wednesday. 'They've been through a lot, a tremendous trauma.'","Mitchelle Blair, 35, was arraigned Thursday on charges of felony murder, premeditated murder and torture.

"Theresa May has asked advisers to examine whether files alleging abuse by senior figures in the 1980s were ever passed to the security services . Theresa May made the extraordinary admission that there ‘might have been a cover-up’ of an Establishment paedophile ring by the Home Office in the 1980s. The Home Secretary’s comments came after the publication of a report into how her department handled papers relating to alleged Westminster child abusers. NSPCC boss Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC had tried to track down 114 files that went missing in the Home Office. Just one was found; another was shredded by the Ministry of Justice, which took possession of the dossier, just three years ago. The men concluded: ‘It is ... not possible to say whether files were ever removed or destroyed to cover up or hide allegations of organised or systematic child abuse by particular individuals because of the systems then in place. 'We cannot say that no file was removed or destroyed for that reason.’ Their report also revealed the list of names which officials were asked to search under when looking for the missing files – suggesting possible links to the so-called Dickens dossier. It included known paedophiles such as Cyril Smith and members of the Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise sex with children. It also featured senior political figures such as former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, Labour peer Lord Janner, and two Tory grandees, Sir Peter Morrison and Sir Peter Hayman, who are both now dead. Police have questioned Lord Brittan and searched Lord Janner’s home in recent months, but neither has been charged. In a statement to MPs, Mrs May said of the latest findings: ‘It doesn’t prove or disprove the Home Office acted appropriately in the 1980s.’ She added: ‘There might have been a cover-up.’ However, contradicting the Home Secretary and the findings of the report, David Cameron said on the campaign trail in Rochester that ‘conspiracy theorists’ would have to ‘look elsewhere’. He added: ‘I think it is important that [the report] says there was not a cover-up.’ Last night, Mr Wanless said his comments were ‘wrong’. The new report centred on the work of late Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens, who wrote to Lord Brittan in 1983 to say he would expose eight public figures suspected of child abuse unless action was taken. Lord Brittan has said in a statement that he ‘told Mr Dickens that I would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the Home Office and acted on as necessary’. The files were never published. Earlier this year, amid revelations in the Mail about Smith and the PIE, it emerged that the Dickens dossier had gone missing, along with a string of other documents. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless has carried out a review into Home Office handling of historic allegations of child abuse . Former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens (left), who died in 1995, said he gave details of Establishment paedophiles – known as 'Dickens dossier' – to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan (right) in 1983 . After an initial review by the Home Office found they could not be traced, Mrs May appointed Mr Wanless and Mr Whittam to conduct a full trawl across Whitehall. Yesterday, the two men said one file had come to light as a result of ‘heightened awareness’ of the subject in the Home Office – but none of Dickens’ were found. The report also failed to rule out a whistleblower’s claims that the Home Office directly awarded tens of thousands of pounds of public money to the PIE. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who has raised the issue of historic child abuse, branded the review a ‘whitewash’. He said: ‘We [cannot] just gloss over the past and hope it all goes away.’","NSPCC's Peter Wanless found no evidence of Home Office cover-up .

"Scientists are poised implement decades of study to give vision to the blind if a new bionic eye is approved by the FDA. In January, the Food Drug Administration was supposed to approve the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System by California developer Second Sight, now those in the U.S. who would qualify for the device wait with bated breath as February roars on. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A new vision: A California company hopes to soon get approval for its retinal implant that could give sight back to thousands . A first of its kind technology, the Argus II was already approved for use in Europe in 2011 and is the culmination of 20 years of scientific research into the delicate and deeply complex sight organ. The implant and eyewear duo will most benefit patients with an inherited form of degenerative blindness that destroys the retina called retinitis pigmentosa, which affects about 3,000 people in the U.S. New eyes, new life: One day Elias Konstantopoulos (left, with grandson Anthony) hopes to see his families faces again with the help of the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (on Konstantopoulos, right) Sufferers of the disease experience a gradual retinal generation and an accompanying loss of vision that eventually leads to blindness. By implanting a series of electrodes inside the eye, the Argus II prosthesis will make up for the failing retina by itself transmitting information about lightness and darkness, for instance, to the brain. A second aspect of the Argus II is the eyeglass headset. Patients wear eyeglasses mounted with cameras that then transmit data about what is in front of them to a small wearable computer. Cyborg eye: a tiny set of electrodes become an electronic retina, as seen in this close-up . Form there, the information is . transmitted wirelessly to the implant and the brain is sent a series of . electrical impulses the patient . eventually learns to interpret as light, dark, and shapes. ‘No . one really thought it would be possible because the tissue around the . eye is so soft and delicate,’ Dr. Mark Humayun, of the Keck School of . Medicine at USC told the Wall Street Journal. ‘If . we continue to develop this type of technology and begin to understand . the new electrical language of pulses to the brain, to the eye, we can . apply it to other parts of the body and we can change our world and how . we relate to it,’ continued Dr. Humayun, who has been working on the . technology for 25 years and is co-creator the Argus II. Seeing the future: Lead reseachers believe the device will once day allow the blind to see color and even have their vision zoon, like like an iPhone . One early patient, Elias Konstantopoulos of Glen Burnie, Maryland, had . lost his sight completely to retinitis pigmentosa and sought help from . the Argus II researchers. After undergoing the implantation in 2011, Konstantopoulos was able to distinguish between dark and light and used that ability to help him maneuver through space. His hope is to one day see the face of his grandson, Anthony. Neither Konstantopoulos nor any of the other recipients of the Argus II in the U.S. and Europe thus far are able to see completely normally. However, researchers say some of the Argus II recipients are able to identify letters just a few inches tall. Dr. Humayun says the device's reliance on an external computer is key to its future success and usefulness. ‘Software upgrades will allow us to do more for people – because the implants don’t need to change, the glasses can be enhanced with software upgrades.’ Humayun sees a future where thanks to his device, once-blind patients will see in various colors and even, he says, in digital zoom, just like ‘your iPhone.'","First bionic human eye now awaiting approval from FDA .

"One of Michael Jackson's friends who testified that he was not molested by the pop superstar has now changed his story as he fights for money from Jackson's estate. Wade Robson, one of the top music choreographers who has worked with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, got to know Michael Jackson decades ago when he began going for sleepovers at the Neverland Ranch. The now-30-year-old Robson is changing his tune, however, as he filed legal requests for financial compensation from the singer's estate for 'childhood sexual abuse'. Scroll down for video . Fanboy: Wade Robson, seen here at age 7, grew close to Jackson when he was a child and frequently slept over the star's infamous Neverland Ranch . The legal motion, which has been filed under seal so it is not available to the public, comes years after Robson made repeated public statements defending Jackson and denying any wrongdoing. New story: Wade Robson, seen here in 2008, reportedly filed legal papers on May 1 claiming that Jackson's estate should pay him money for childhood sexual abuse . The two met when Robson was five years old and Jackson was in his late 20s or early 30s. They bonded over a love of music and he repeatedly slept over his house and spent nights in the same bed as the much-older singer. Robson played a pivotal role in the 2005 trial, when Jackson faced 14 counts relating to child molestation and conspiracy to molest minors. He was found not guilty on all of the charges, and Robson was one of the star witnesses who defended Jackson, saying that he was never inappropriately touched or molested. A similar defense was given by their mutual friend Macaulay Culkin, who also slept over the singer's ranch over a long period of time. In the past eight years, Robson has made a name for himself in the entertainment world, becoming one of the most sought-after choreographers. He has worked with Usher, Britney Spears, and NSYNC. His name hit the gossip columns in 2002 when Britney Spears' relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after she allegedly cheated on the NSYNC star with the choreographer. Since then, Robson has worked on the show So You Think You Can Dance, and is currently in charge of Demi Lovato's choreography. Synched stories: Though Robson testified at Jackson's 2005 trial that he was never molested by the singer (both seen outside of the courtroom), the papers his legal team just filed suggest otherwise . New gig: Robson has made frequent appearances on So You Think You Can Dance as a guest judge . But now, TMZ is . reporting that they heard from unidentified legal sources that Robson's . legal team filed papers asking for an undisclosed sum from the Jackson . estate on May 1. No other details about the filing have been released, . but they reportedly give an explicit detail of the alleged assault. News of the filing comes the same day as the late singer's autopsy report revealed that Michael Jackson tattooed his lips pink, permanently inked his eyebrows and relied on a dark tattoo to blend his hairline into his wig. As the high profile trial of the singer's tour promoter, AEG, continues, a disturbing photograph of the fallen pop star's corpse was shown to the court on Monday by Dr Christopher Rogers.

"Volte face: Sue Marsh campaigned against cuts before taking a £75,000-a-year job with the firm used by the Government to reform disability benefits . A leading campaigner against welfare cuts who claimed to be too sick to work has taken a £75,000-a-year job with the firm used by the Government to reform disability benefits. Sue Marsh, a darling of the Left who has railed against Iain Duncan Smith’s reforms for the last five years, has been recruited by Maximus, the US company that has taken over a controversial ‘fitness for work’ test for benefit claimants. Her extraordinary volte face has shocked and infuriated supporters, who have branded her a ‘Judas’ and a ‘sell-out’. Mrs Marsh said she had undergone an ‘enormous - almost cosmic - mindset shift’ that had led her to accept a job as the company’s new ‘head of customer experience’. She had previously claimed that in Maximus, the Department for Work and Pensions had sought out the ‘worst provider they could find’ to assess claimants of disability benefits. Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, welcomed Mrs Marsh’s decision to jump ship and take a lucrative position with the firm. ‘I would be the first person to congratulate anyone who gets a job. I'm sure there will be some whose negative attitudes to our reforms mean they will criticise her move. They should be ignored,’ the minister told the Daily Mail last night. Mrs Marsh ran a blog which she called the ‘Diary of a Benefits Scrounger’, detailing her own efforts to be declared unfit for work because of Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel condition. She was eventually placed into the ‘support group’ for employment and support allowance, the main sickness benefit, which is for people judged e unable to work or even to attend interviews. She was an architect of the Spartacus campaign, which produced a series of reports accusing the Government of cruelty and incompetence in its efforts to cut the welfare bill and was championed on Twitter by supporters including Lord Prescott, Alastair Campbell, Stephen Fry and Billy Bragg. Mrs Marsh appeared at the Labour Party’s annual conference in 2013 and wrote regularly for the Guardian. Announcing her new job, she admitted she had ‘agonised’ about how to tell her supporters of her decision. Late last year, Maximus was awarded a three-and-a-half year contract to take over delivery of the ‘work capability assessment’ – the test of claimants’ ability to work -- from the much-criticised Atos Healthcare. Mrs Marsh insisted said she was motivated only by a desire to improve the system. ‘Those who doubt my intentions and goals and those with different goals to mine will almost certainly be critical, and, in a sense, I understand that response. If I didn't know me I might be sceptical too,’ she added. Mrs Marsh said her own, successful application to be declared eligible for sickness benefits had been ‘threatening and scary’. But she insisted: ‘It is not inherently a good thing for support group numbers to be high. If some of those people who qualify would actually rather like to work, but are terrified of an intimidating and farcical system of support, that actually leads to a life of fear of change,’ she said. ‘We are coming up to an election period. There will be a hiatus and a time to breathe and take stock. There is a new provider, Maximus… If there was ever a time to get significant and valuable changes to what now seems universally accepted to be a system that is in serious need of better delivery, it is now.’ Fans: Mrs Marsh was championed on Twitter by supporters including Alastair Campbell (L) and Stephen Fry . She said Maximus had given her ‘fairly free rein to devise a strategy to bring about a wide range of improvements to the service from a customer perspective’. ‘Of course there are considerable benefits to both myself and Maximus in this development. I will be giving the same 300 per cent passion and commitment to them that I have been giving to campaigning. ‘Crucially, it's a campaigner's job to change things, not just to make a lot of noise. Whilst I have to make an enormous - almost cosmic - mindset shift to take this direction, Maximus also have to bring me into their trust and with very little to go on. ‘Someone is going to do it. I can do it, with all of my knowledge and personal experience of what is wrong with the system at the moment.’ One correspondent on Mrs Marsh’s website wrote: ‘I am so sorry to say this but I feel betrayed so much I can only now call you Judas.’ Sue Marsh is a darling of the Left who railed against Iain Duncan Smith’s (above) reforms for the last five years . Another former supporter, Peter Farrington, said: ‘Sorry, I have to add my name to the list sickened by this decision. So sickened in fact I don't even want to try to explain why I find this a betrayal of the trust so many of us placed in you in recent years, Sue.’ Tony Cyphus branded Mrs Marsh a ‘sell-out, just like all the MPs who go on to work for the multinationals’. ‘So what happened to ""I'm in so much pain I can't work, please give me DLA [Disability Living Allowance]”? I can't wait to see how much of a hypocrite you turn out to be. And be aware you have just marked yourself for a life of hate from people who really are true victims of this and future governments,’ he added. Another activist wrote: ‘You've proudly displayed photos of yourself bed and hospital bound, yet it seems an offer of [reportedly] £75k per annum plus benefits has healed you. You've gone straight from the support group to full time employment - you truly are a modern day miracle. IDS's prayers have been answered.’ A spokesman for Maximus said: 'We believe, given her experience, that Sue will be able to contribute a great deal in making the customer experience of work capability assessments a better one.'","Sue Marsh campaigned against welfare cuts claiming to be too sick to work .

"As the financial crisis hit in 2008, she spoke for the nation when she asked a group of economists: ‘Why did nobody notice?’ Four years on, the Queen finally got her answer – although it didn’t seem much to her liking. The monarch was visiting the Bank of England in Threadneedle Street yesterday when she was buttonholed by one of its financial policy experts. Scroll down to watch . Golden look: Her Majesty examines the stacks of gold bars stored in the Bank's vaults . Royal inspection: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were shown the vaults at the Bank of England where thousands of gold bars are kept . Sujit Kapadia said he wanted to put . her mind at rest after she famously described the credit crunch as . ‘awful’ during a visit to the London School of Economics in 2008. At the time, she asked academics how the onset of the crisis could have been missed when it was so enormous. Yesterday Mr Kadapia told her that it . was partly because financial crises, like flu pandemics and earthquakes, . are hard to predict. People, she was also informed, got complacent because they thought the risk was being managed better than before. The Queen grimaced at this and said: ‘But people had got a bit...lax, had they?’ Usually, she is notoriously discreet about her views on international events. But, remarkably, the Queen went on to . suggest that the Financial Services Authority may not have been . aggressive enough in its policing. She said: ‘The Financial Services – . what do they call themselves, the regulators – Authority, which was . really quite new … it didn’t have any teeth.’ Hands-on: The Queen thoroughly inspects the gold vaults during her visit to the Bank of England . Value: The vaults contain thousands of bars of gold worth billions of pounds . The Duke of Edinburgh didn’t help matters much, asking: ‘There’s not another one coming, is there? He then fixed Mr Kapadia and his group with a typically gimlet eye and barked: ‘Don’t do it again!’ Afterwards Mr Kapadia was optimistic . as he assessed the encounter, saying: ‘It was a real pleasure to be able . to offer some explanation. I think she recognised that these things are . very difficult and it’s not a straightforward exercise. ‘The strongest thing I got [from the Queen] is what are we trying to do so it doesn’t happen again.’ The FSA, which is being disbanded . after failing to spot the financial crisis which engulfed Britain, later . issued a stiff response to the Queen’s remarks. It said: ‘We’ve widely acknowledged . that the regulatory approach before the financial crisis in 2008 was . flawed and has since been completely changed.’ It was the Queen’s ninth visit to the . Bank. On her first, as the 11-year-old Princess Elizabeth, she signed a . thousand pound note. Interesting discussion: The Queen was taken with the discussion on how another downturn could be prevented, while the Duke joked with the Bank's staff . Reason why: The Queen spoke to Sujit Kapadia who explained why the financial crisis wasn't foreseen . During yesterday’s visit, she and . Prince Philip were each given the honour of each signing a £1million . banknote, known as a ‘giant’ by staff. As she scribbled her signature next to the 1937 note, she muttered: ‘It hasn’t improved, really.’ On their tour, the Queen must have . been a little over-awed by the £27billion worth that glittered in the . Bank of England’s basement vault. Visit: A large crowd had gathered outside the Bank as the Royal couple toured inside, which included an inspection of bank notes . It’s one of nine vaults dotted around London, in which the Bank stores around £200billion of gold. This one contains 63,000 gold bars stacked in eight rows. Each four-tonne stack is four pallets high, and each pallet carries 80 bars. While, at 13kg – around 2st – a gold . bar is a little heavy to steal, the Duke of Edinburgh did seem tempted . by the £1million banknote he was asked to sign. He joked ‘is this just lying about?’, adding ‘you won’t miss it, will you?’. Signature: The Queen and the Duke each signed a £1 million bank note to go into the guest book . Afterwards the Governor of the Bank, . Sir Mervyn King, thanked the Queen for her visit, describing the Bank’s . staff as ‘unsung heroes’ who had kept the economy going ‘in the most . difficult circumstances’. And he asked the Queen for two early . Christmas presents. One was her signature on the banknote, and the other . was the Royal Assent on the Financial Services Bill. ‘When is the Bill due?’ The Queen . asked. ‘It has gone through Parliament and should be with you before . Christmas,’ Sir Mervyn replied.

"Google has . denied it ever deleted - and then reinstated - a MailOnline story about a . notorious child killer under the controversial ‘right to be forgotten’ European . Court ruling. The search . giant had informed MailOnline earlier this month that a story about killer . Ronald Castree, which appeared on the website in November 2007, had been . removed from European search results. The father . of Castree's 11-year-old victim Lesley Molseed had described the removal of the . article as 'appalling'. Father . Fred Anderson said: 'He hasn’t got the right to be forgotten - it’s terrible. 'He’s . locked up in prison for life and he keeps coming up with things. We’ll never . get peace, this has been going on for 40 years.' Scroll down for video . Killer: The story Google has denied ever deleting relates to the 2007 conviction of paedophile Ronald Castree, 61, (left), for the murder of Lesley Molseed, 11 (right) in 1975 . Lesley's father Fred Anderson (pictured) said: 'He hasn’t got the right to be forgotten - it’s terrible' Lesley had walked to the shop from her home in Delamere Road, Rochdale, pictured, when she was abducted . The ruling by European judges gives . people the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about . them wiped from the web, which led to the search engine being bombarded . with requests. The article about the conviction of Castree, 61, is just one of thousands Google has removed from search results and just one of numerous MailOnline articles affected by the ruling. A story about a millionaire banker blamed for helping cause the global financial crisis was among the first to be hidden as was an airline accused of racism by a Muslim job applicant. However, a spokesman from Google early Saturday said that while the article HAD been removed from some search results it was NOT at the request of Ronald Castree. And he said the request had been granted to someone else mentioned in the article but that the story would still appear if Castree was used at the search term. Under the right to be forgotten rule, stories are not entirely deleted by Google, rather they simply will no longer appear if a certain search name is used. The spokesman refused to say who had asked for the article to be removed and thus granted the right to be forgotten. The body of Lesley Molseed being removed from the windswept moor where Castree left it in October 1975 . Castree, a book dealer and married father of one, snatched Lesley off the street near her home in Rochdale as she went to buy bread for her mother in October 1975. He had been on the way to visit his wife and her new baby in hospital. Castree killed Lesley in a frenzied attack, stabbing her 12 times, once through the heart, before leaving her body on a lonely moor in West Yorkshire. He then kept quiet when an innocent man, Stefan Kiszko, was tried, convicted, sentenced and served 16 years for a crime he did not commit. The real killer was only captured in 2006 when a DNA sample Castree had given in relation to an attack on a prostitute in 2005 was found to be an exact match for sperm found on Lesley's underwear. In 2007, he was found guilty of murder at Bradford Crown Court and told he would not be considered for parole until 2037, by which time he will be 84. He attempted to appeal his conviction in 2008, but was rejected. Jim Killock, Executive Director of Open Rights Group, said: 'It is deeply problematic that a private company can make decisions about things that get censored, as they will end up making mistakes.' The BBC's economics editor, Robert Peston, was affected by the ruling when he had a 2007 blogpost about the former Merrill Lynch boss Stan O'Neal excluded from some search results. He said today of the MailOnline's story: 'It does not seem to be in the public interest for the ""right to be forgotten"" to be applied to stories such as this one.' Paedophile convicted of Lesley Molseed murder - after evading justice for 32 years . Original article that was published by MailOnline on 16 November 2007. Lesley Molseed was abducted and stabbed to death by Ronald Castree in October 1975 . Ronald Castree, 54, will serve a minimum of 30 years for what the judge called 'a truly dreadful crime', adding that he accepted the killer would probably die in jail. Lesley Molseed, from Rochdale, was abducted and killed in 1975, in a case which resulted in one of Britain's most notorious miscarriages of justice. Her body was found on Rishworth Moor in West Yorkshire and Stefan Kiszko, a lonely misfit, confessed to the crime under duress. He was jailed and served 16 years before he was cleared in 1991 when it emerged that sperm samples taken from her clothes could not have been his, as he was infertile. He died the following year. Forensic scientists used new techniques to produce a DNA profile in 2000. And last year they found that Castree, who had given a sample after being arrested in 2005 on another matter, was a one-in-a-billion match. Court records also showed that days before Mr Kiszko stood trial, Castree had abducted a nine-year-old and subjected her to an indecent assault which led to a conviction. At the murder trial, Castree tried to have this conviction kept from the jury. He also argued that the sample from Lesley's clothes must have innocently become contaminated with his DNA. But the jury at Bradford Crown Court was not taken in. Mr Justice Openshaw told Castree, a trader in comic books: 'You kept quiet whilst an entirely innocent man was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced for this murder.' Lesley's mother April Garrett, left, said justice had been done when Castree was convicted of her daughter's murder - not before innocent man Stefan Kiszko, right, spent 16 years in jail for a crime he did not commit . Afterwards Lesley's mother, who has reverted to her maiden name, April Garrett, said: 'We are relieved that after so long our quest for justice for Lesley is now over.' He appeared to all the world as a caring father - and a hard-working, self-made man. But for 32 years, Ron Castree lived with a terrible secret. Behind his respectable facade, he was a paedophile and serial sex attacker who eventually progressed to child murder. While his wife and her baby were in hospital in 1975, Castree snatched Lesley Molseed off a street in Rochdale as she went to buy bread for her mother. He drove the 11-year-old, who had learning difficulties, to a windswept moor, sexually assaulted her and stabbed her to death in a 'frenzied' attack. To read the full story click here . The EU's ‘right to be forgotten’ legislation allows European citizens to request that links to ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant’ information be removed from Google search results. In short, Google must remove articles if the impact on the individual’s privacy is greater than the public’s right to find it, the European Union Court of Justice found. The landmark case that led to the new legislation was brought by a Spanish man who complained that an auction notice of his repossessed home on Google's search results infringed his privacy. Since the legislation was introduced in May, Google has said it has received more than 120,000 requests from across Europe ranging from serious criminal records, embarrassing photos and negative press stories. An online form was launched to allow EU citizens to ask for personal data to be taken down. The form requires links to the material the person wants removed, their country of origin, and a reason for their request. Individuals also have to attach a valid photo identity. Google then assesses each request individually, before deciding whether to remove information from search results. Since May, MailOnline has had several articles taken down. Among the most high profile articles removed was one from May 2009 describing the captivity in which Josef Fritzl kept his family. It has also included a September 2010 article about multi-millionaire Tory MP Jonathan Djanogly, who admitted hiring private eyes to spy on his local party members.

"Created: . 17:51 GMT, 16 May 2014 . A New York man has been sentenced to life in prison without parole Friday for raping a girl and killing her mother after cutting off his ankle monitor last year. David Renz learned his fate in Onondaga County Court after a judge said he hoped the penalty would comfort the victims' family. The 30-year-old had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, admitting that he carjacked Liverpool librarian Lori Ann Bresnahan and her 10-year-old daughter March 14, 2013. Justice served: David Renz, 30, pictured entering Judge Thomas Miller's courtroom Friday, was sentenced to life in prison without parole for raping a girl and killing her mother . Divine judgement: Judge Thomas Miller warned Renz that one day he will face 'another judge' who will impose a much harsher sentence . Renz stabbed and strangled the mother as she tried to stop him from raping her daughter. He had been under federal monitoring on child pornography charges but cut off his ankle GPS. Renz was sentenced earlier this year to 30 years in federal prison for possessing more than 11,000 images and 1,100 videos of child pornography. On Friday, Renz remained motionless and wore a blank expression on his face as his sentence was being read. Innocent victim: Lori Ann Bresnahan, a school librarian from Liverpool, New York, was kidnapped along with her daughter by Renz last March and stabbed to death while trying to prevent her attacker from raping the 10-year-old . Judge Thomas Miller had some harsh words for the defendant, whose behavior last March he characterized as 'despicable,' Syracuse.com reported. ‘One day, you will face another judge. One day when you pass from this earth, another judge will impose a harsher sentence for the absolute evil you committed,’ he said. Some of the slain librarian’s family members read their impact statements from the stand before the sentencing as Renz's relatives sat in the audience. ‘Nothing, absolutely nothing, prepares you for such a tragedy in your own family,’ Bresnahan's cousin Jim O'Hara said. O'Hara, a former reporter with The Post-Standard, vividly described in his six-page handwritten statement the moment he found out that his relative had been brutally murdered, saying that he felt as cold 'as the most brutal of winter days.' Kathleen Renz, the convicted killer’s mother, spoke to reporters after her son's sentencing, saying that she prays every day for Lori Bresnahan and her daughter. Mrs Renz added that she was relieved to learn that federal prosecutors will not seek capital punishment for her son. 'It's a great burden lifted,' the mother said. The victim’s family pleaded with officials not to hold a death penalty trial to spare Bresnahan’s daughter additional trauma. Spared: Renz, pictured here in 2013, will not face the death penalty because the victim's family said they do not want Bresnahan's daughter to testify against him in court . The shocking murder of Lori Breshnahan - and . the rape of her young daughter - occurred while Renz was awaiting trial . for the child pornography charges, and was confined to his home and . required to wear a monitoring device. On March 14, 2013 - just six weeks . after he'd been arrested for possessing child pornography - Renz removed . his required electronic monitoring device and drove to the Great . Northern Mann in Clay, New York, a suburb of Syracuse. Heartless: Renz, seen here in a mugshot, remained expressionless as his sentence was being read . Once at the mall, Renz parked his car . and walked around the parking lot, where he found Breshnahan - a school . librarian - and her daughter getting into their vehicle. Renz then forced his way into Breshahan's car using an air pistol he claimed was a real gun and forced her to drive to a remote area of the mall's parking lot where he bound both of his victims and - using a knife to cut a hole in her clothes - raped the young girl. Prosecutors said Renz was trying to . use cable ties to bind the woman to a headrest in her car when she . fought back and shouted for the girl to bolt from the vehicle. As the girl ran off and was rescued . by a passing motorist, her mother was strangled and repeatedly stabbed . in the head and chest, officials said. Renz was captured by police . shortly after. Weeks after the attack, a report by a . federal judge found that the officers failed to do monthly checks on . Renz that would have included inspection of the bracelet. Federal . probation officers in Syracuse who were monitoring Renz were fired or . demoted. Renz pleaded guilty to the murder and rape charges last year. Authorities say that several of the . child pornography videos found in Renz's possession depicted acts . similar to the rape and murder for which Renz pleaded guilty. 'Let . the defendant's other victims not . be forgotten,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Fletcher said during Renz's . child pornography sentencing hearing in March, according to Syracuse.com. 'Each and every child in each and every one of . the defendant's 11,000 images and 1,100 videos for which he stands . convicted, every single one of those children was used by David Renz to . fuel his twisted interest in the exploitation of children. Every one of . them is also his victim.' Fletcher . asked for a sentence of 30 to 70 years, and asked that any sentence the . judge imposed would run consecutively with whatever sentence Renz gets . for Breshahan's murder. Perp walk: The attack happened two or three weeks after Renz acquired cable ties and an air pistol they said was used to threaten the woman into stopping in a suburban Syracuse mall parking lot . Monster: David Renz, 30, pleaded guilty to charges of murder, rape and kidnapping in connection to a deadly carjacking of a woman and her daughter . Crime scene: New York State Police investigate a car involved in a fatal carjacking on Verplank Road, Clay, N.Y . Renz's attorney, Assistant Federal . Public Defender Randi Bianco, asked for a sentence within the sentencing . guidelines of 19 to 24 years, citing the difficult life Renz has . suffered as the result of a facial deformity. Renz was born without the lower half of his left jaw and part of his cheekbone - a hereditary condition that would come to dominate his and his family's lives. The man's father, brother and sister all had the facial deformity but it was more pronoucnded in him, requiring multiple jaw-lengthening surgeries that drained his parents' already limited resources. In school, his friends recalled that Renz had to cover the hole in his neck from a tracheotomy so he could be heard, drawing bewildered stares from his classmates. Those who knew him as a child described Renz as a bright kid who loved computers and was good at math, science and social studies, but he was also a loner who was always picked last for athletic  activities and group work.

"Graphic photographs have emerged of the victims of an massacre allegedly committed by gangs of Syrian militia loyal to President Bashar Assad. The images - pixelated because they are so horrific - show shot, stabbed and burned bodies piled in the streets of the village of Baniyas. Among the victims are a number of children, some no more than toddlers. Scroll down for video .

Bodies lying inside lying inside a house in Bayda were shown in a YouTube video after two days of slaughter in May . Some were lying in pools of blood, and one toddler was covered in burns, her clothes singed and her legs charred. Some of the women victims were mutilated. April 2011: More than 70 protesters killed as security forces fire on crowds in Deraa and Damascus. December 2011: Activists say more than 100 army defectors killed over two days in Idlib province. May 2012: Some 108 killed in Houla, near Homs - UN later blames Syrian troops and militia. August 2012: Witnesses and activists say at least 300 killed as government forces storm Darayya, a Damascus suburb. January 2013: At least 100 people killed and burned in their homes in Haswiya, near Homs. At least 77 people - 20 from the same family - were killed, a day after 72 died in nearby Bayda after it was overrun by government forces. Assad's regime claimed it had fought back against 'terrorist' groups' and restored peace and security to the area. But activists have posted harrowing video . clips online to back up their claims that pro-regime militia known as . the Shabbiha are involved in the operation. The BBC's correspondent Jim Muir claims there is a strong sectarian dimension to the killings. Baniyas is a Sunni Muslim pocket in the middle of a large Alawite enclave on Syria's Mediterranean coast, and activists in the area accuse militias loyal to Assad of ethnic cleansing. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights documented the names of at least 50 dead in Bayda. There were reports of men's bodies, some blindfolded, lying in the street. The Observatory, which relies on a . network of activists on the ground, cited witnesses as saying that some . of the victims were killed with knives or blunt objects and that dozens . of villagers were missing. The massacre began following clashes with Assad forces who had earlier arrested villagers and killed them in prison after torture. A survivor named as Abu Abdullah told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Security and Shabbiha militia entered the village with knives and guns and started to kill everybody they met. 'Almost 60 per cent of the women and children of the village were killed.' Lifeless: Lying sprawled on the ground, the body of a man killed when Syrian regime forces overran the village of Bayda.

"David Cameron’s authority in Parliament and on the world stage was dealt an unprecedented blow last night as he faced a breathtaking Commons defeat  over plans for missile strikes on Syria. In an extraordinary assault on the Prime Minister’s authority, 50 coalition MPs joined Labour in voting against a watered-down Government motion supporting the ‘principle’ of military action. There were shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked House of Commons. Scroll down for video . Chastened: British MPs voted by 272 votes to 285 to reject Prime Minister David Cameron's motion backing British intervention in principle . The last time a Prime Minister was defeated over an issue of war and peace was in 1782. A . Downing Street source said Mr Cameron had no intention of resigning, . adding: ‘His colleagues support him on most things, but on this issue . they disagreed.’ Education . Secretary Michael Gove was said to have shouted at Tory rebels outside . the  chamber: ‘You’re a disgrace, you’re a disgrace.’ Chancellor George Osborne today raised concern that the UK's place in the world would be undermined by the vote. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think there will be a national soul-searching about our role in the world and whether Britain wants to play a big part in upholding the international system, be that big open and trading nation that I'd like us to be or whether we turn our back on that. 'I understand the deep scepticism that my colleagues in Parliament many members of the public have about British involvement in Syria. 'I hope this doesn’t become the moment where we turn our back on the world’s problems.' Blast: People inspect the damage at a site hit by what activists say was a car bomb in Raqqa province, Syria .

Cameron, who had made a passionate plea for support over proposals for . targeted strikes on Damascus after a chemical weapons attack last week, . was forced to issue a humiliating climbdown. ‘It . is clear to me the British Parliament does not want to see British . military action. I get that and the Government will act accordingly,’ he . told MPs. His decision to . pledge to stand shoulder to shoulder with the US in a planned attack on . Syria, and to recall Parliament from its summer recess for an emergency . debate, backfired spectacularly. Mr Cameron had been counting on . Labour’s support to ensure he could win a Commons vote authorising . strikes, despite the doubts of scores of Tory MPs. Labour, . however, refused to back the Government, prompting the angriest foreign . policy row between the main parties since Suez in 1956. The Tories . accused Ed Miliband of giving ‘succour’ to President Bashar Assad’s . regime. Defence Secretary . Philip Hammond said: ‘I’m disappointed with Ed Miliband’s behaviour, . frankly. Anything that stops this from giving a clear, united view of . the British Parliament will give some succour to the regime.’ After . the vote, Mr Hammond said: ‘I hope Britain isn’t going to retreat into . being the sort of nation that isn’t going to act to uphold international . norms.’ Sir Gerald . Howarth, a former defence minister who voted ‘reluctantly’ with the . Government, accused Mr Cameron of rushing into the vote. Reza Afshar, head of the Syria team at the Foreign Office, tweeted simply: ‘Disaster.’ Senior US officials said President Obama was prepared to move ahead with a limited military strike despite last night’s vote. Two . Tory ministers, International Development Secretary Justine Greening . and Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds, apparently missed the vote . after not hearing a division bell. Debate: A chastened Mr Cameron was forced by Labour leader Ed Miliband to pledge not to deploy any UK military forces without first staging another Commons vote . Dusty landscape: Free Syrian Army fighters drive a military tank that belonged to forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad after they seized it, in Aleppo's town of Khanasir . An . earlier Labour motion, demanding further conditions before Britain . could be involved in any military action, was defeated by 332 votes to . 220. In other developments: . Moment: MPs last night dramatically voted against David Cameron's plea to take military action against Syria . Recall: Mr Cameron told a packed House of Commons that Britain had to decide how to respond to 'one of the most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century' Demonstrate: Protesters speaking out against military action in Syria stand outside the Houses of Parliament . Last . night’s vote is a grave humiliation for Mr Cameron and will also raise . doubts about the future of the ‘Special Relationship’ between Britain . and the US. One Whitehall source said Britain was ‘handing back its . deputy sheriff’s badge’ to Washington. The shadow of Tony Blair loomed . large over yesterday’s proceedings, with speaker after speaker referring . to the mistakes and misinformation of the Iraq War. The . Prime Minister acknowledged that Iraq had ‘truly poisoned the well of . public opinion’ on military intervention. Prudent: An RAF Typhoon jet comes in to land at Akrotiri in Cyprus yesterday as a 'prudent and precautionary measure', the Ministry of Defence said . Target: Syria's President Bashar al-Assad (centre left) pictured yesterday during a meeting with a Yemeni delegation in Damascus . He admitted there was not ‘one . smoking piece of intelligence’ but insisted it was ‘beyond doubt’ that . Assad’s regime was responsible for a chemical attack that killed at . least 350 civilians. Mr . Miliband insisted he was not ruling out backing military strikes at some . point, but presented his own ‘sequential roadmap’ before he thought . Britain should take such a step. Asked if Mr Miliband was giving comfort . to Assad, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Yes. The fact is that a lot . of the arguments over this could give succour to the regime.’ No . 10 also accused Mr Miliband of ‘flipping and flopping’ and having . privately indicated his party would back military intervention before . moving the goalposts at the last minute. Making their point: Protesters demonstrating against military action in Syria stand outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, central London . Placards: A protester demonstrating against military action in Syria outside the Houses of Parliament in London . Opposition: As MPs debated the UK response to the Syria crisis, protestors gathered outside the Commons . Anger: Anti-war protesters have staged a number of demonstrations in Westminster this week . Labour said the suggestion it . was giving succour to Assad was ‘frankly insulting’. Mr . Cameron acknowledged voters were sceptical about getting into ‘another . war in the Middle East’ but insisted he was not proposing a long-running . campaign to dislodge Assad – rather a strike on ‘command and control’ assets to try to reduce the chances of another chemical weapons attack. A . string of senior Conservatives, however, expressed doubts about the . wisdom of intervention and Mr Cameron’s rush to join the US. Former Tory . leadership contender David Davis said: ‘It’s very simple – when you are . going to do things which will lead to the death of people, civilians in . particular, you should get your facts right first.’ Campaign: UKIP leader Nigel Farage (left) and his deputy Paul Nuttall launched this poster opposing Britain intervention in Syria . Condemnation: Mr Farage said David Cameron's policy on Syria was his 'gravest misjudgment yet' Lord Dannatt, former head of the British Army, said he did not support military intervention in Syria in any shape. He said: ‘The drums of war were banging very loudly two or three days ago. The people didn’t like it.’ But . Dr Liam Fox, former Conservative defence secretary, said: ‘Appeasement . has never worked to further the cause of peace. It will not now and it . will not in the future.’ Lord .

"Sir Elton John, who has generously donated funds raised from his single Candle In The Wind to charity, with Princess Diana in 1993 . Sales of Candle In The Wind, the song performed by Sir Elton John at the Princess of Wales’s funeral, raised an incredible £38 million for charity. The star’s performance moved mourners and millions watching the service on TV and became the fastest-selling single in history. The recording sold more than 33 million copies. Sir Elton generously donated his royalties to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. It will close on New Year’s Eve having raised a total of £138 million, money that has been used to fund more than 400 projects close to Diana’s heart. The Princess was famed for her charity work, particularly raising the plight of AIDS victims. She also campaigned for a ban on landmines during a high-profile visit to Angola. John Bechard, the memorial fund’s accountant, said: ‘When Diana died there were thousands of donations pouring in, but they were mostly around the £5 and £10 mark. 'The proceeds from Candle In The Wind gave us a remarkable chunk of money which massively raised the fund’s profile, triggering a snowball effect. We are indebted to Sir Elton for his generosity.’ Ownership of the fund will now pass to the charitable foundation set up for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge  and Prince Harry.

"Revolution: Gene therapies can change a person's DNA . Regulators yesterday approved the first therapy in the western world that can correct errors in a person’s genetic code. Europe has approved Glybera to be used against a rare inherited disorder which disrupts fat production in the body. The treatment uses a virus to counteract LPLD, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, which can led to acute inflammation of the pancreas. The illness affects around one or two people per million and sufferers have damaged copies of a gene which is essential for breaking down fats. The virus infects muscle cells with a copy of a healthy gene and a one-off treatment is effective. The treatment was backed by an advisory panel to the  European Commission in July and full approval was granted  yesterday. The medicine should be available next year. Professor John Kastelein, of the University of Amsterdam, said the therapy would have a  ‘dramatic impact’ on patients. Only two other gene therapies have previously been approved for sale, both in China. It will cost around £1 million ($1.6 million) per patient, a new record for pricey modern medicines. Joern Aldag, chief executive of Amsterdam-based uniQure, said more such treatments would follow and argued a high price was justified because gene therapy restored natural body function and was not just a short-term fix. 'This provides higher benefit to patients than the classical protein replacement strategy and this is why we think we should be fairly and adequately compensated,' he said in a telephone interview on Friday . Patients with LPLD, which affects no more than one or two people per million, are unable to handle fat particles in their blood and are at risk of acute and potentially fatal inflammation of the pancreas. The approval follows a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in July. Glybera treats the genetic disorder lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) by altering sufferers' DNA. LPLD affects about one in a million people, leaving them without a vital gene that breaks down fat particles in their blood. It means fat builds up in the blood leading to abdominal pain and life-threatening inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). The only other way to manage the disease is by having a very low-fat diet. The therapy uses a virus (pictured) to infect muscle cells with a working copy of the gene. The privately owned firm is now working with governments on potential pricing strategies, which are likely to vary from country to country, ahead of the commercial roll-out from the second half of 2013. Aldag said some countries preferred the idea of a one-off payment at the time of treatment but others were interested in an annuity system, which would probably involve charging around £200,000 a year for five years. That kind of annual charge would put Glybera in a similar price range to expensive enzyme replacement therapies for other rare diseases, such as Cerezyme for Gaucher disease from Sanofi's Genzyme unit. UniQure is also preparing to apply for regulatory approval for Glybera in the United States, Canada and other markets. The idea of treating disease by replacing a defective gene with a working copy gained credence in 1990 with the success of the world's first gene therapy clinical tests against a rare condition called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). People with SCID - also known as 'bubble boy disease' - cannot cope with infections and usually die in childhood. The field then suffered a major setback when an Arizona teenager died in a gene therapy experiment in 1999 and two French boys with SCID developed leukaemia in 2002. In China, Shenzhen SiBiono GeneTech won approval for a gene therapy drug for head and neck cancer in 2003 but no products have been approved until now in Europe or the United States. More recently, some large pharmaceutical companies have also been exploring gene therapy. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, signed a deal in 2010 with Italian researchers to develop a SCID therapy.","Gene therapy drug given green light for rare disease .

"A video showing what is thought to be first ever 3D-printed bullet being fired has appeared on YouTube. In the video, from user Taofledermaus, three bullets of different weights and shapes are fired at various targets using a Mossberg 590 shotgun. According to the video, each plastic pellet has been 3D-printed. A small lead shot was then added to give the bullet weight. In the YouTube video, uploaded by Taofledermaus, three different 3D-printed bullets are fired at various targets. The first bullet, pictured, weighed four tenths of an ounce. A small lead shot was added to each bullet to give it weight as it travels through the air . Each of the three 3D-printed bullets were loaded into shotgun casing and fired using a Mossberg 590 gun. In this screenshot, the shooter - YouTube user JackIsMyCopilot - is shown loading the bullets into the gun . Earlier this week a working plastic gun, printed using a self-assembled 3D printer, a nail and some household screws, successfully fired nine shots. The gun, based on blueprints made available online by Defense Distributed last month, cost just $25 (£16) to make and fired the .38 caliber shots by the Wisconsin engineer who built it. Up until now, the blueprints for the 'Liberator' gun have been mainly printed using industrial-grade 3D printers that cost around £5,250 ($8,000). This latest gun is one of the first to be 3D printed using the much cheaper Lulzbot A0-101 3D printer - a printer that can be bought online, assembled at home and costs £1,136 ($1,725). Because the gun is made entirely from plastic it makes it possible to carry the gun through airport security metal detectors, for example, without being found out. Earlier this month, the Mail On Sunday tested this theory by smuggling a version of the Liberator gun onto a Eurostar train. In the video, Taofledermaus is heard saying: 'You've heard of a 3D-printed gun? How about 3D-printed bullets.' He goes on to explain that YouTube user ArtisanTony printed a 'couple of shotgun pellets' with the first weighing about four tenths of an ounce. Taofledermaus adds that a small piece of lead shot is added to the casing to give the bullet enough weight to travel and pierce the target. Each pellet took an hour to print and is fitted into a traditional shotgun case. In the video, YouTube user JackIsMyCopilot is shown firing the first bullet using a Mossberg 590 shotgun aimed at a dartboard, perched above a wooden table in a field. The bullet goes through the dartboard, and through the plastic cans its resting on. In . a second experiment the pair are shown firing another bullet, this time . weighing five tenths of an ounce, at a block of wood with a target on . it. The second bullet fired in the YouTube video weighed five tenths of an ounce. It also had a small lead shot added and was fitted to a shotgun casing. This bullet was nicknamed the Red Rocket . The Red Rocket 3D-printed bullet was fired at a target attached to a plank of wood. The wood was rested up against a wooden table. The bullet appeared to bounce off the plank, yet when the Taofledermaus inspected the wood he discovered it not only pierced the plank, (pictured) it also pierced the wooden table behind it . This second bullet, nicknamed in the video as the Red Rocket, had a honeycomb-design with strips of plastic. In the video, the bullet hits the target but doesn't appear to pierce it, instead it looks as if the bullet bounces off. Taofledermaus goes on to explain the reason the Red Rocket . didn't pierce the wood is because of the 'stability problem that's . common with a bullet not shot through a rifle barrel.' Adding 'It goes on the path of least resistance, and this path is usually sideways' and this is known . However, when Taofledermaus examines . the piece of wood he finds that the bullet not only pierced the plank of . wood, but it also pierced the wooden table holding the plank of wood . upright. He's heard saying: 'That's amazing. I didn't expect that. That was pretty awesome. 'Even though it hit sideways, it still went through.' A third bullet with three points on the end, nicknamed the 'Tri-Factor round', is then shown being fired at a polystyrene mannequin head on the wooden table. The bullet hits the top of the head, knocking it off the table, but then ricochets off behind. The third 3D-printed bullet, nicknamed the Tri-Factor because it has three points on the end, was fired in the YouTube video at a polystyrene mannequin head . The Tri-Factor bullet performed the weakest of the three 3D-printed bullets. It hit the polystyrene mannequin target before bouncing off sideways. This may have been because the head was knocked off the table, due to its light weight, before the bullet could penetrate . Earlier this week a working plastic . gun, printed using a self-assembled 3D printer, a nail and some . household screws, successfully fired nine shots. The gun, based on blueprints made . available online by Defense Distributed last month, cost just $25 (£16) to make and fired the .38 caliber shots by the Wisconsin engineer who . built it.

"He was hundreds of miles from civilisation, lost in the burning heat of the desert. Second World War Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping took what little he could from the RAF Kittyhawk he had just crash-landed, then wandered into the emptiness. From that day in June 1942 the mystery of what happened to  the dentist’s son from Southend was lost, in every sense, in the sands of time. Shifting sands: The final resting place of the Kittyhawk P-40 has been discovered in the Sahara 70 years after it crashed there . Time capsule: Aside from the damage it sustained during impact, the aircraft appears to have been almost perfectly preserved in the sands of the Sahara . Chance discovery: The single-seater aircraft was found by a Polish oil company worker exploring a remote region of the western desert in Egypt . But 70 years later, the ghostly remains of his battered but almost perfectly preserved plane has been discovered. Like a time capsule that could provide . the key to his disappearance, it had lain intact alongside a makeshift . shelter Dennis appears to have made as he waited, hopelessly, for . rescue. Now a search is to begin for the . airman’s remains – as aviation experts and historians begin an operation . to recover and display the P-40 aircraft in his memory. The chance find was made by an oil . worker exploring a remote region of the Western Desert in Egypt. It is . more than 200 miles from the nearest town in a vast expanse of largely . featureless terrain. Flight Sergeant Copping, part of a . fighter unit based in Egypt during the North Africa campaign against . Rommel, is believed to have lost his bearings while flying the damaged . Kittyhawk to another airbase for repair. All that is known is that he . went off course and was never seen again. At the controls: The plane's cockpit, but there are fears over what will be left of it after locals began stripping parts and instruments for souvenirs and scrap . Unseen and untouched: Equipment and controls from the plane were found scattered around the craft at the crash site. The plane is still in very good condition . Intact: Most of the plane's cockpit instruments were untouched and it still had it guns and ammunition before they were seized by the Egyptian military for safety reasons . Remarkably, the plane remained almost . untouched for the next seven decades – right down to the guns and . ammunition found with it. Most of the cockpit instruments are intact, . and the twisted propeller lies a few feet from the fuselage. Crucially, the P-40’s identification plates are untouched – allowing researchers to track its provenance and service history. There is flak damage in the fuselage, . which is consistent with documents on the aircraft. Historian Andy . Saunders said: ‘It is a quite incredible time capsule. It’s the . aviation equivalent of Tutankhamun’s tomb. ‘This plane has been lying in the same spot where it crashed 70 years ago. ‘It hasn’t been hidden in the sand, it has just sat there. ‘He must have survived the crash . because one photo shows a parachute around the frame of the plane and my . guess is the poor bloke used it to shelter from the sun. The radio and . batteries were out of the plane and it looks like he tried to get it . working. Second World War weaponry: The machine gun on the wing of the crashed plane. It appears the pilot got into trouble and brought it down in the middle of the desert . Bullet holes: The Kittyhawk appears to have been shot at (left), while its broken propeller lays nearby (right). Historians have described the find as the 'aviation equivalent of Tutankhamun's Tomb' Well-preserved: The Kittyhawk's magazine of bullets were also found in the wreckage. The radio and batteries were discovered out of the plane . ‘If he died at the side of the plane . his remains would have been found. Once he had crashed there, nobody was . going to come and get him. It is more likely he tried to walk out of . the desert but ended up walking to his death. It is too hideous to . contemplate.’ The RAF Museum in Hendon, North . London, has been made aware of the find and plans are already under way . to recover it before anyone tries to strip it for scrap or souvenirs. Efforts have also been made to trace any immediate members of Flight . Sergeant Copping’s family in the UK, but it is believed that none . survives. Captain Paul Collins, British defence . attaché to Egypt, confirmed a search would be mounted for the airman’s . remains but admitted it was ‘extremely unlikely’ it would be successful. The spot could be marked as a war grave after the aircraft is . recovered. Heading home: The RAF Museum at Hendon, north London, has been made aware of the discovery and plans are underway to recover the aircraft for exhibition in the future . Sign of the time: The Kittyhawk's factory stamp (left) and gun loading instruction panel (right). However, some locals see the aircraft as a piece of junk . Signs of survival: Flight Sergeant Dennis Copping's parachute was part of what is believed to be a makeshift camp alongside the fuselage . Remote: The crash site is about 200 miles from the nearest town. No human remains have been found but it is thought the pilot's decomposed body may lay anywhere in a 20 mile radius of the plane . Captain Collins added: ‘The scene is close to a smuggling line from Sudan and Libya. ‘We will need to go there with the Egyptian army because it is a dangerous area.’ Ian Thirsk, of the RAF Museum, confirmed staff are working with the MoD to recover the plane. The P-40 was a US-made fighter and . ground attack aircraft. It was outclassed by later German fighters and . saw little combat in Europe but performed a key role in North Africa . and Asia where high-altitude performance was less critical.

"In his youth: Sydney Swift (pictured as a Lance Sergeant), who helped bury Rifleman Horace Savage, wants his fallen comrade exhumed and re-buried . For seven decades Sydney Swift believed the soldier he buried in a battlefield after his death in front of him was given a proper military funeral and headstone in a cemetery. But when the 95-year-old British Lance Sergeant’s friends visited the Catania War Cemetery in Sicily, Italy, they could not find any memorial for Rifleman Horace Savage. The soldier was first buried in unmarked graves along with Rifleman Edwin Pearton and Lance Corporal John Biggs, close to where the three men fell during World War Two in July 1943. After the war, the bodies of Rfn Pearton and LCpl Biggs were exhumed and they were given a military funeral and headstone at the Sicily cemetery. It had been presumed that Rfn Savage was also re-buried there after a funeral following his death at Primosole Bridge in Catania, which preceded the mainland Allied Invasion of Italy. So when friends told Mr Swift they were visiting the cemetery, the great-grandfather asked them to leave flowers on the grave of Rfn Savage. But they found no headstone for the soldier. This prompted an investigation by Mr Swift, who found his fallen comrade’s name on the Cassino Memorial at the Cassino War Cemetery in Frosinone. This site is 370 miles from Sicily on mainland Italy and lists more than 4,000 Commonwealth soldiers who took part in the Italian campaign but whose graves are not known. Fallen: After the war, the bodies of Rifleman Edwin Pearton (grave left) and Lance Corporal John Biggs (right) were exhumed and they were given a military funeral and headstone at the Catania War Cemetery in Sicily, Italy . Now, despite the passing of seven decades, Mr Swift said he can pinpoint to within a few yards the location of the grave he placed the serviceman in with the help of a stretcher bearer. With the London Irish Rifles Regimental Association’s backing, he is urging Italian authorities and the Commonwealth War Grave Commission to now bury Rfn Savage with full military honours. They also want to trace the family of Rfn Savage, who was in the 1st battalion London Irish Rifles. Mr Swift, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said: ‘Last year friends of mine were going to Sicily and asked them to look up the three men killed in action at Primisole Bridge in Catania. ‘They came back and said they had only found two graves. We researched his name and realised it was on the Cassino Memorial as “no known grave”. Nowhere to be seen: When the friends of British Lance Sergeant Sydney Swift visited the Catania War Cemetery in Sicily, Italy, they could not find any headstone for Rifleman Horace Savage . Site: It had been presumed that Rfn Savage was also re-buried at the Catania War Cemetery after a funeral following his death at Primisole Bridge in Catania, before the Allied Invasion of Italy, but his grave is not there . ‘Well, I know where his grave is . because I buried him in a ditch that we were holding as a position. It . was the only time I have buried somebody in my life. I am hardly likely . to forget it. The successful push into Italy began in Sicily in July 1943, which led to the collapse of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's government. The Sicily invasion, which faced relatively little resistance, was the beginning of the Allied invasion of Axis-controlled Europe. Allied forces made it into mainland Italy by September that year, landing in the south, and the Italians agreed to surrender. But the Germans set up huge defensive lines to block any push north, and the Allied attack proved to be long-running and costly. However the Allies managed to break through and captured Rome in June 1944, two days before D-Day in Normandy, France. Germany's forces in Italy surrendered on May 1945, six days before the whole country did so. ‘I put a . marker on the grave. He must still be there. The Commonwealth War Graves . Commission have told me that if a body is discovered they can arrange . for a proper burial and a headstone. ‘Somebody needs to go and find him for that to happen. He needs a proper burial and proper grave.’ The . three men were killed when a 16-man patrol was sent out towards high . ground in Catania to make contact with the Germans. As they neared the . enemy line German machine guns opened up. Mr .

Mr Swift said: ‘The men had been mown . down by machine gun fire and Savage had been shot.

"Private Lewis Curtis has finally been buried in the Netherlands almost 70 years after he was killed in action in WWII . A British soldier has finally been buried in the Netherlands almost 70 years after he was killed in action in the Second World War, and nine years after his remains were found. Private Lewis Curtis, from Liskeard, Cornwall, who served with 5th Battalion The Wiltshire Regiment, was laid to rest at the Arnhem-Oosterbeek War Cemetery in a funeral with full military honours today. Pte Curtis’s remains were found in an unmarked field grave by builders clearing the way for a new housing estate, but it took five years to identify him using forensics. His family, including his great nephew Rifleman Richard Edwards, 20, who has just returned from Afghanistan with 5th Battalion the Rifles - the Wiltshire Regiment’s successors - were at the funeral. Pte Curtis, who survived the Normandy landings, was killed aged 19 in the Netherlands in an artillery barrage during Operation Market Garden on October 2, 1944. He was buried in a shallow grave where he fell, but the markers for the plot at De Laar Farm were washed away when German military engineers flooded the area. His burial site was lost, and his family believed he had died in Belgium. Six decades after his death, in 2003, his remains were unearthed by builders excavating the old Dutch battlefield to make way for a new housing estate. Since then, a Dutch forensic team has been using scientific tests including DNA analysis to try to discover who he was. Pte Curtis, who served with 5th Battalion The Wiltshire Regiment, was laid to rest at the Arnhem-Oosterbeek War Cemetery in a funeral with full military honours today . His family, including his great nephew Rifleman Richard Edwards (pictured), 20, who has just returned from Afghanistan with 5th Battalion the Rifles - the Wiltshire Regiment's successors - were at the funeral . It was only after old dental records were uncovered in 2008 that Pte Curtis’s identity was revealed. Warrant Officer Class 1 Geert Jonker, the head of Recovery and Identification Unit for the Royal Netherlands Army, said the lengthy process to confirm remains is not unusual. 'It can take anything from three days to seven years to be able to identify remains because it’s important to get it right for the next of kin,' he said. 'So when we can make a positive identification, it makes all those years of research worthwhile. It’s the ultimate reward, but sometimes it is about luck. 'In this case it was only because we went for a second opinion on the age of the soldier that told us he was a lot younger than we originally thought. 'Lewis had an undiscovered growth defect that would not have caused him any problems but made his remains seem older than his 19 years. Pte Curtis was laid to rest in Oosterbeek today close to where he was killed in action nearly 70 years ago . Pte Curtis, who survived the Normandy landings (above), was killed aged 19 in the Netherlands in an artillery barrage during Operation Market Garden on October 2, 1944 . Members of Pte Curtis's family lay a wreath at his funeral . The young soldier was buried in a shallow grave where he fell, but the markers for the plot at De Laar Farm were washed away when German military engineers flooded the area . 'Based on that information, we had seven new names we were considering - three of whom had dental records. One of which was Lewis, who was a perfect match.' Pte Curtis’s sister Alice died 20 years ago but her children, Susan Wilbourne and Robert Cole, who are in their 50s and still live in Liskeard, grew up with tales of their Uncle Lewis, and flew to the Netherlands for the burial. 'Mum was always talking about Lewis, so it’s unbelievable to be here now to finally lay him to rest after so long of not knowing,' said Mrs Wilbourne. 'It’s been quite an emotional rollercoaster since we found out. A horn is sounded at the cemetery. It was only after old dental records were uncovered in 2008 that Pte Curtis's identity was revealed . Allied paratroopers touch down in the Netherlands during 1944's Operation Market Garden . 'It is just such a pity that Mum couldn’t be here to bury her little brother, but I can feel her here. She was always very close with Lewis.' The pair buried their uncle with a glass marble - one of the few keepsakes their mother had of her young brother. 'It feels right to return it to him,' Mr Cole added. To this day, 18 soldiers of the old Wiltshire Regiment are still unaccounted for, an Army spokeswoman said, and some lie buried in unnamed graves marked 'Known unto God' in Allied War Cemeteries in Oosterbeek and Nijmegen. Mr Jonker and his identification team continue to try to trace their identity to help their families.

"Pop singer Selena Gomez went to rehab last month, Star Magazine has revealed. The 21-year-old star - who has an on/off relationship with Justin Bieber - was admitted to Dawn at The Meadows recovery centre in Arizona on January 5, and spent two weeks at the facility, which treats people aged 18 to 26 years old who are 'struggling with emotional trauma, addiction or dual diagnosis concerns.' Her representative tells MailOnline:  'Selena voluntarily spent time at Meadows but NOT for substance abuse.' Scroll down for video . Shock revelation: Selena Gomez,  21, was admitted to Dawn at The Meadows recovery centre in Arizona on January 5, and spent two weeks at the facility, her rep has confirmed . Although her reps have denied this, Star claims that the Come And Get It singer was 'heavily into the drug Molly (which contain MDMA)’ and was using prescription drugs like Xanax and Ambien. The former Disney child star was urged to seek help by those close to her amid concerns her partying was getting out of control. Meanwhile, TMZ have claimed that Selena blames her ex Justin for her 'predicament'. Another source has told Radar: 'Her friends and family became increasingly worried that there might be a serious problem with Selena. 'Particularly, her parents. The partying was, at times, wild. They wanted to help her -- and they very much encouraged her to go to rehab. Others very close to her also urged her to seek professional help.' Was her relationship to blame? Selena with her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber at the 2011 Teen Choice Awards in happier times . Another added: 'It's important to remember that Selena had worked in Hollywood non-stop for six years. She was exhausted. Selena was smart enough to understand that she needed to take control of her life. 'It just got to a point where she needed to get out of Los Angeles, get away from 'the scene' and the pressures of Hollywood, to also get away from those who had, admittedly, become a bad influence on her.

"Finally found: The body of Derek Allen, pictured aged 20, has been discovered in an unmarked grave 71 years after his death . He took to the skies above northern France as the Nazi Blitzkrieg was unleashed across Europe. It was May 10, 1940, and at the controls of his Hurricane aircraft, young Flying Officer Derek Allen’s brief but heroic war had begun. Eight days later, the 22-year-old Second World War fighter pilot was dead. But in his short blaze of glory, the RAF ace was awarded a gallantry medal, shot down twice and credited with four outright and three shared enemy kills. He died after his plane was shot down over farmland, but because his body was never officially recovered, he was listed as missing in action, presumed dead, for seven decades until historian Andy Saunders began researching his case. He discovered the young pilot had been removed from his wrecked plane on May 18 by locals and buried in the village of Poix-du-Nord, near Cambrai. Now his younger brother Richard Allen is preparing to lead family members at a dedication service later this year when a new headstone with FO Allen’s name on it will replace an anonymous one erected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Mr Allen, an 81-year-old retired stockbroker from Great Shefford, near Hungerford, Berkshire, said yesterday: ‘It is a great relief to know what did happen to Derek and where he ended up after all these years. ‘We are grateful to Andy for finding this out and it means an awful lot that the family have at last a grave to visit so we can pay our respects.’ Flying squad: Derek Allen's squadren sits for an official photograph in a hanger in Essex, before being sent to France . Rest in peace: Fighting Officer Allen's younger brother Richard Allen, 84, can finally pay his respects at his brother's grave . FO Allen, one of three brothers from Leicester, signed up with the RAF in 1937, aged 18, and joined No 85 Squadron a year later. At the outbreak of war, the squadron . moved to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force, and the . young airman’s first action came on May 10, 1940, as Germany launched . its Blitzkrieg across France and the Low Countries. Unmarked grave: Derek Allen's war grave in the village of Poix-du-nord near Cambrai, Northern France, will soon be replaced with a headstone with his name engraved on it . During his first airborne skirmish, . he shot down a Henschel reconnaissance plane and was credited with . playing a part in bringing down a Junkers 88 warplane. The next day he shared two kills – . both Dornier bombers – and on May 13 he single-handedly shot down two of . the Luftwaffe’s Heinkel fighters. He was posthumously awarded the . Distinguished Flying Cross for bringing down a Junkers 87 dive bomber on . May 15 that had been wreaking havoc on British armour during the Battle . of France, which was to lead to the Dunkirk evacuation later that . month. In the same action, FO Allen’s Hurricane was hit by anti-aircraft fire, forcing him to bail out. His citation for the DFC read: ‘After . his aircraft had been severely damaged by anti-aircraft fire he didn’t . hesitate to attack a Junkers 87 over enemy territory and shot it down.’ After spending 24 hours walking . through enemy territory to get back to his base, the exhausted airman . was spotted falling asleep while sitting eating his dinner. On May 17 he took off for the final time and his war ended when he was shot down and killed. With France being overrun by the Germans, local records detailing the discovery of his body were not meticulously maintained. It was only after historian Mr . Saunders began his investigation five years ago that he found a witness . account of a Hurricane crashing near Cambrai on the same day FO Allen . went missing. Lost at war: The telegram sent to Derek Allen's family with the message that Derek was missing after a battleon May 17th, 1940 . Happier times: Derek Allen, aged 17, holds his younger brother Richard's hand, aged three, while on a family holiday before the war . With the approval of the French . authorities and the Allen family, he began excavating the crash site and . found parts from the downed Hurricane. He presented his findings to the . RAF Air Historical Branch, which, after delving into FO Allen’s old . records, was able to confirm it was his body in a grave three miles from . the excavation site. Mr Saunders, of Hastings, East . Sussex, who wrote a book entitled Finding the Fallen about his research, said: ‘The Ministry of Defence had the information for 70 years . but it had just been overlooked. ‘You have to remember there were 40,000 RAF casualties who were unaccounted for by the end of the war. ‘A lot of cases were left pending and Derek Allen’s was one of those. ‘It was just after we did our examination that they pulled out his file and there was this information all along. ‘Had he survived, going at the pace . he did, Derek Allen would have become one of the leading fighter aces of . the Second World War. ‘He would have been up there with Douglas Bader and Robert Stanford Tuck, yet history records record him as an unknown airman.’ Fighter pilots: Derek Allen, aged 20, with his fellow flying aces at an RAF base in Essex before being sent to France .

"Many saluted, some cried and a few held signs. But for 70 miles, hundreds of people paid their respects to a Second World War airman who died in combat in the South Pacific almost 70 years ago and was finally returned to his upstate home on Friday. Funeral director Vincent Locovozzi, who escorted Sergeant Dominick Licari's remains from the Albany airport to the small town of Frankfort, said there was 'only one word that describes this: unbelievable'. 'He's a man who has been dead longer than most people have been alive, but he's a hero coming home,' Mr Locovozzi said. Homecoming: A flag-draped coffin, containing the remains of Sergeant Dominick Licari, arrives in Albany . Veterans groups, businesses and residents lined a 10-mile stretch of the Mohawk Valley to pay tribute to Licari as his remains made the journey home. Honor guards from Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion chapters were posted along Route 5 as the vehicle procession carrying his casket left the New York State Thruway at Little Falls and traveled to Frankfort, west of Albany. A commercial flight carrying Licari's casket arrived at the Albany airport, and military pallbearers carried the casket from the plane to the hearse on Friday evening, Mr Locovozzi, a distant relative of the fallen airman, said. Licari's brother and sister, and several nieces and nephews, were at the airport to accompany his casket home, with the Patriot Guard motorcycle riders providing an escort. 'It's great to bring him back after all these years because you never leave anyone behind,' Fred Schultz, the post commander, told Times Union. War hero: Licari, pictured right with other airman, died after his plane crashed as he returned from a bombing mission in Japan . Guard of honor: As the coffin was carried from the plane those greeting it saluted . At Melrose Market, the windows facing the street were decorated with American flags and a sign that read: 'Thank you and Welcome Home Sgt. Dominick Licari'. Organizations and business owners along Route 5 also posted signs in Licari's honor. Lost: Licari's remains were only identified this year, after his fatal crash in 1944 . 'We just thought it would be a nice . tribute for him for giving his life for our country,' grocery store . owner Linda LaValla said. 'It's good to know that they take the time years later to find our servicemen and bring them home. It's closure for everybody.' Clint Whittemore, of Chatham, was among those who gathered inside the airport to watch Licari's homecoming. He said he came to support Licari's family, just as others had turned out when his uncle, airman Ken Scripter, was shot down and killed over Germany in 1943. Mr Whittemore said found closure after his family tracked down the uncle's grave  ten years ago. 'To be able to identify the remains means a lot. I know it meant a lot to my mom,' he said. Licari was a 31-year-old gunner on board . a two-man Army Air Force A-20 Havoc bomber that crashed into a . jungle-covered mountain in Papua New Guinea on March 13, 1944, while . returning from a bombing raid on a Japanese airfield. The pilot, 2nd Lieutenant Valorie Pollard, of Monterey in California, also was killed, along with four airmen in two of the mission's other A-20s, which slammed into the mountain in bad weather. Licari, one of nine children, was officially declared dead in 1946. Last month, U.S. military officials notified his two surviving siblings that his remains and those of Pollard had been found and identified. Pride: Ex-servicemen and residents lined the route from the airport as Licari was finally returned home . Licari's funeral and burial, with full military honors, is expected to be held in Frankfort on Tuesday. Governor Andrew Cuomo directed flags on state government buildings to be flown at half-staff on Tuesday to honor Licari. Pollard's burial arrangements are pending, a Pentagon official said.","Second World War hero died in crash after 1944 bombing mission in Japan .

"A mother who began sprouting thick facial hair after the birth of her son 28 years ago says she's feeling sexier and more confident than ever before, having finally stopped trying to get rid of her beard. The German-born woman, identified only as Mariam, appeared on ITV's This Morning to discuss why she stopped tweezing the hair on her face which she had been plucking every day for almost two decades. Mariam, 49, also explained to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield that she is happy with the way she looks and would not change her situation, despite being criticised for her behaviour by her own mother. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dating turn-off: Facial hair may be a no-no for single American guys, but German woman Mariam, 49, who has been growing a beard since 2008, insists that it is sexy . She also said she is able to look past the comments of internet trolls who target her bearded woman blog to tell her 'people like me should be sent to Russia... or shot'. Mariam - who has had tests to rule out serious medical problems more associated with excessive hair growth in women - told Phil and Holly, along with expert Dr Carol Cooper, that she had never had any facial hair before the birth of her son, after which it gradually began growing. Ten years on, the hair was growing thick enough for a full beard, and Mariam would laboriously tweeze out each hair every morning. 'I asked my mother what to do and she told me to tweeze them, never to shave or wax. And then I visited my gynaecologist who said it happened to lots of other women so I shouldn't worry. But they didn't really give me a reason. Now I know it must be inherited . 'My chin got really red and inflamed from all the plucking, and some of the hairs were ingrown, so it always looked like I'd fallen on my chin. But when people asked what had happened and I told them they couldn't believe it.' In 2008, when she was living alone and unemployed, Mariam decided to give her beard a chance to grow. She said: 'I had no job so I had free time to give it a chance and see what happened, so I started a blog to inform other women about it, and to see what was happening every day and how I felt. Mariam explained to Holly and Phil that prior to her 'experiment' plucking her beard had become an obsession, and that her son, who has not been named, used to remember it taking her hours to leave the house. She added: 'I thought about it all the . time. I had to double check before leaving the house that it was OK, . and take a mirror in my pocket. That was life. 'When . I decided to let it grow it didn't feel brave, it was more like a . curiosity. I wanted to see hwat would happen to me. There was a big fear . that everyone would turn away and nobody would talk to me anymore.' Mariam, 49, appeared alongside Dr Carol Cooper on ITV's This Morning to explain her situation to Holly and Phil . And Mariam did meet some resistance - from her family. 'My . mum said ""do you have to shock people like this"". Then she got used to . it and thought that one day I'd finish it, and was patient, but now . she's getting nervous and wants me to stop and become ""normal"".' She received negative reactions from . other people, too, especially on the internet: 'People can be cruel . depending on where you go. 'Some people say people like me should be sent . to Russia or shot, but that's just one person on the internet writing . horrible stuff. Other people say it's courageous and inspiring. So there . are both sides.' Mariam now travels with a circus as the bearded lady act, which she says she enjoys since she has studied acting in the past and also likes educating people about the issue. She said: 'I want to give people the opportunity to talk to a bearded lady, because usually they are too scared in the street.' Mariam, who has been single for a decade, also says she is looking for a relationship now that she is feeling sexy and more confident. She told Holly that even if she could she would not change her situation. Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield asked Mariam how she felt about having a beard . 'I know myself more now,' she said. 'There are always people with a fetish who might only be attracted by the beard, but that is the same with lots of things, even if I were a blonde woman. 'I tried electrolysis three times but it just grew back -  and now I'm happy with it. It is sometimes annoying when I go shopping but otherwise it has given me other opportunities. Dr Cooper explained that it is fairly common for women to have facial hair they do not want, but if it comes on suddenly - especially if accompanied by other symptoms such as weight gain and irregular periods - you should see your GP since it could be to do with excessive of androgen hormones. What causes excess facial hair? It's estimated that one in ten women suffers from excess facial and body hair. But what causes it? 'Sometimes race or just a family tendency to be more hairy is to blame, rather than any medical problem,' explains Dr Rina Davison, an endocrinologist from Whipps Cross University Hospital, London, with a special interest in excess hair. 'People of South Asian or Mediterranean descent tend to have more hair than Caucasians or those with black skin, for example. It's also possible to be quite a “hairy” family regardless of race.' But there are other factors that could be to blame. Women normally produce low levels of male hormones called androgens, but an excess can trigger unwanted hair growth known as hirsutism. A common cause of hirsutism is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which has accompanying symptoms of acne, weight gain and irregular periods. Other, rarer, causes include a tumour on the ovary or adrenal gland as well as certain medicines including steroids. Rarely, a woman will have normal androgen levels and the cause of the unwanted hair growth will not be identified.","German-born Mariam, 49, has been letting beard grow since August 2008 .

"A 5-year-old Kansas girl died on Friday after her mother's boyfriend allegedly kidnapped her and engaged in a shootout with police officers. The sequence of events began about 7:30 pm on Friday when Cadence Harris of Leavenworth was reported kidnapped, police said. Police said there was some relationship between the child and her abductor but would not provide details. The suspect, however, has been identified by local news stations as 30-year-old Marcus McGowan. He was reportedly dating the girl's mother, Christie Harris. Victim: Cadence Harris, 5, died on Friday after her mother's boyfriend allegedly kidnapped her and engaged in a shootout with police officers . Suspect: Marcus McGowan, pictured, allegedly kidnapped Cadence on Friday night. He was reportedly in a relationship with her mother, Christie Harris . Scene: At some point the suspect got out of his vehicle and pointed a gun at officers and they exchanged fire, police said . 'The matter unfolded quite rapidly,' said Leavenworth Police Chief Patrick Kitchens, calling the girl's death tragic. 'We are still trying to sort out specifically what happened.' Police in both Missouri and Kansas were involved in a chase as the suspect crossed the state line before the incident ended in the northeast Kansas town of Leavenworth. At some point the suspect got out of his vehicle and pointed a gun at officers and they exchanged fire, Kitchens said. 'Anytime we have the loss of a small child it is devastating,' Kitchens told a news conference, adding that officers on the scene had tried to revive the girl. He said it was not clear if the child was shot by her abductor, who was seriously wounded and is hospitalized in Kansas City. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) was called in to help investigate. Stressing that the probe only just getting under way, KBI Special Agent in Charge Mark Malick said it did not appear the girl was hit by bullets fired by police officers. Mother: Christie Harris, Cadence's mother, said that McGowan has previously abused her . Brother: McGowan's brother Andree McGowan has said he is 'up and down like a roller coaster' because of his brother's alleged behavior . 'Evidence we have at the scene at this time does not support any indication that gunfire struck the car or the victim, and specifically gunfire coming from law enforcement,' Malick said. An autopsy was being carried out and would not be completed on Saturday, he told reporters. Christie Harris, Cadence's mother, said McGowan has a history of domestic violence in an interview with 41 Action News. She also told the station that McGowan was under the influence of drugs. 'He's hurt me before lots of times, but he's never hurt her,' she told the affiliate station. 'He's never even spanked her. 'She was perfect, she was beautiful, she was smart, she was perfect,' Harris also said. McGowan choked Harris in 2009 and was convicted twice in 2011 for domestic battery, the Atchison Globe reported. McGowan's brother Andree McGowan told KCTV5 he is 'having emotions' and is 'up and down like a roller coaster' because of his brother's alleged behavior. 'It's testing our [family's] togetherness,' he also told the station. 'It's testing our will to stay together. Is it going to break us up or make us stronger?'","Cadence Harris, 5, was reported kidnapped on Friday evening at about 7:30pm .

"Deaths from cuts and grazes, diarrhoea and flu will soon be common as antibiotics lose their power to fight minor infections, experts have warned. The World Health Organisation says the problem has been caused by antibiotics being so widely prescribed that bacteria have begun to evolve and develop resistance. It claims the crisis is worse than the Aids epidemic – which has caused 25million deaths worldwide – and threatens to turn the clock back on modern medicine. Antibiotic resistance needs to be taken as seriously as AIDS was in the 1980s, experts say . The WHO warns that the public should . ‘anticipate many more deaths’ as it may become routine for children to . develop lethal infections from minor grazes, while hospital operations . become deadly as patients are at risk of developing infections that were . previously treatable. Doctors . are increasingly finding that antibiotics no longer work against . urinary and skin infections, tuberculosis and gonorrhoea. The . WHO is urging the public to take simple precautions, such as washing . hands to prevent bacteria from spreading in the first place. Doctors . are also being told to prescribe antibiotics sparingly and ensure . patients finish the full course, as if they stop mid-way the bacteria . may become resistant. In England last year some 41.7million . prescriptions were written out, up from 37.2million in 2006. MRSA - Patients infected with MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are 64 per cent more likely to die than those with a non-resistant form of S. aureus. People infected by resistant superbugs are also likely to stay longer in hospital and may need intensive care, pushing up costs.C. difficile - This bacteria produces spores that are resistant to high temperatures and are very difficult to eliminate. It is spread through contaminated food and objects and can cause blood poisoning and tears in the large intestine. E. coli - this now accounts for one . in three cases of bacterial infections in the blood in the UK and a new . strain is resistant to most antibiotics. It is highly contagious and . could cause more than 3,000 deaths a year. Acinetobacter Baumannii - a common bacteria which is resistant to most antibiotics and which can easily infect patients in a hospital. It can cause meningitis and is fatal in about 80 per cent of patients.CRKP - this is a bacterium that is associated with extremely difficult to treat blood infections and meningitis. It is resistant to nearly all antibiotics and is fatal in 50 per cent of cases.Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is estimated to kill 150,000 people globally each year. NDM-1 - a bacteria detected in India of which some strains are resistant to all antibiotics. Dr . Keiji Fukuda, the WHO’s assistant director for health security, said: . ‘Without urgent, co-ordinated action, the world is headed for a . post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries which . have been treatable for decades can once again kill. ‘Effective . antibiotics have been one of the pillars allowing us to live longer, . live healthier, and benefit from modern medicine. ‘Unless . we take significant actions to improve efforts to prevent infections, . and also change how we produce, prescribe and use antibiotics, the world . will lose more and more of these global public health goods and the . implications will be devastating. ‘We should anticipate to see many more deaths. ‘We are going to see people who have untreatable infections.’ Only . last month, Britain’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies . criticised GPs for needlessly ‘dishing out’ antibiotics to patients. In . the largest study of its kind, the WHO looked at data from 114 . countries on seven major types of bacteria. Experts are particularly . concerned about bacteria responsible for pneumonia, urinary tract . infections, skin infections, diarrhoea and gonorrhoea. They are also . worried that antiviral medicines are becoming increasingly less . effective against flu. Dr . Danilo Lo Fo Wong, a senior adviser at the WHO, said: ‘A child falling . off their bike and developing a fatal infection would be a freak . occurrence in the UK, but that is where we are heading.’ British . experts likened the problem to the Aids epidemic of the 1980s. Professor Laura Piddock, who specialises in microbiology at the . University of Birmingham, said: ‘The world needs to respond as it did to . the Aids crisis. ‘We . still need a better understanding of all aspects of resistance as well . as new discovery, research and development of new antibiotics.’ The . first antibiotic, penicillin, was developed by Sir Alexander Fleming in . 1929. But their use has soared since the 1960s, and in 1998 the . Government issued guidelines to doctors urging them to curb . prescriptions. Nonetheless, surveys suggest they are still prescribed . for 80 per cent of coughs, colds and sore throats. The spread of deadly superbugs that evade even the most powerful antibiotics is happening across the world, United Nations officials have confirmed. Image shows the superbug MRSA which already kills almost 20,000 people a year in Europe . Jenna and Andrew Hannon, pictured,  were distraught after losing their son Oliver to a superbug . The human cost of the rising number of superbugs is becoming all too familiar. Distraught young couple Jenna and Andrew Hannon lost their second son to an infection at a hospital neo-natal unit in Bristol. Little Oliver was born early at 24 weeks and although he had seemed well enough to go home with his parents, he soon fell dangerously ill. He was taken to Southmead Hospital but the infection had taken hold and the youngster passed away. Tragically the couple had lost another prematurely born son, Travis, to infection in 2010, just five-and-a-half hours after his birth at 26 weeks. An inquest into Oliver's death later found he had been killed by the pseudomonas bacteria. He was one of three babies in the hospital to be hit by the killer bacteria, which was later linked to baby deaths around the country. An investigation took place at the hospital into Oliver's death, but it could not find what caused his infection. The inquest was told that Oliver was being given two types of antibiotics before he died as a precaution, but neither specifically fought pseudomonas. As a result of the investigation the hospital also now uses antibiotics which more specifically target the bacteria. Jennifer Cohn of the international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières agreed with the WHO's assessment and confirmed the problem had spread to many corners of the world. 'We see horrendous rates of antibiotic resistance wherever we look in our field operations, including children admitted to nutritional centres in Niger, and people in our surgical and trauma units in Syria,' she said. Earlier this month, Government body NICE said that one in 16 patients are developing infections on NHS wards because of poor hygiene among staff. NICE said 800 patients a day, the equivalent of 300,000 a year, are infected by a member of staff or by dirty equipment. It is estimated the infections cause 5,000 deaths annually and contribute to another 15,000. Antibiotics are substances that kill or interfere with the growth of microorganisms, especially bacteria. But not all microorganisms are susceptible to all antibiotics, according to Public Health England. Microorganisms which are not killed or inhibited by an antibiotic are called 'antibiotic resistant'. They continue to grow and multiply in the presence of that antibiotics. There are several ways in which bacteria can be resistant. Some destroy the antibiotic, for example by producing enzymes against it; some prevent the antibiotic getting into their cells; others get the antibiotic out of their cells before it can harm them. HOW DOES RESISTANCE DEVELOP? Some bacteria are naturally resistant; new resistances also arise spontaneously by chance mutations and these resistant strains then multiply. Some resistances can be passed from one bacterium to another, spreading resistance between species. Loops of DNA (called plasmids) carry the resistance genes from one bacterium to another. When an antibiotic is given, it kills the sensitive bacteria, but any resistant ones can survive and multiply. The more antibiotics are used (in animals and agriculture as well as in man) the greater will be the ""selective pressure"", favouring resistant strains - i.e. survival of the fittest. Antibiotics don't 'cause' resistance; rather, they create an environment which favours the growth of resistant varians which already exist in nature or arise by chance.","Spread of deadly superbugs that evade antibiotics is happening globally .

"Excavation: Guido Lewandowski, a member of VBGO, digs out the remains of a German soldier at a former army headquarter in Klessin, Germany . The remains of a German soldier killed during the Second World War have been unearthed during an excavation by volunteers dedicated to giving dignified burials to the war dead. Bones and personal belongings were dug up during the excavation near the eastern German town of Klessin, which lies about 50 miles east of Berlin. The area around the small town which lies close to the Polish border was the place of a . battle between German and Soviet forces between February and March . 1945 - part of the final push into Germany known as the Battle of Berlin. As many as 200 of the soldiers who were part of the conflict are still missing . today - instigating the dig. The excavation was carried out by members of The Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe who have been carrying out digs to help identify those killed in both the First and Second World Wars. Known in Germany as Vereins zur . Bergung Gefallener in Osteuropa or VBGO, the group is made up entirely . of volunteers, many of whom are from Russia, Poland, Czech Republic, . Slovakia, Ukraine and the US. Since they were founded in 1992 the group has recovered more than 7,000 sets of remains all over Europe. But due to the level of decomposition they are only able to identify around 25 per cent of those discovered. Discovery: An old German 'Wehrmacht' helmet lays on a pile of soil as members of the Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe dig in Klessin . Findings: Personal belongings including glasses were also discovered during the groups most recent dig . The group have dug up the remains of a number of nationalities and they state: 'We are not looking for soldiers of the Wehrmacht, not for U.S. GI's, . Marines, soldiers of the red army or Polish Military- not for infantry . soldiers, sailors or airmen- not for good or bad. 'We are looking for people - sons, fathers, brothers.' The not-for-profit association has now carried out 100 searches since they were formed 20 years ago and now has more than 200 members. The dig in Klessin, . which belonged to a defence line during the Battle of Seelöw Heights, . was the seventh carried out this year, following excavations in Poland . and Russia. The area was defended by 800 German soldiers, against three Soviet-divisions during the war. The overall offensive saw the Germans outnumbers by almost ten to one, as a million soviet soldiers took part in the final push that hastened the end of the Second World War. Fire power: Soviet artillery bombard German positions during the battle for the Seelow Heights . It is thought there are more than 200 soldiers in unmarked graves around the small town, which was the scene of battle during the Second World War . Klessin lies around 50miles east of Berlin. when the German defences fell, it left a clear path to the capital for the Soviets . A statue in Eastern Germany that commemorates Battle of Seelow Heights . The Battle of the Seelöw Heights (fought over three days, from April 16 to 19, 1945) was a part of the one of the last assaults on large entrenched defensive positions of the Second World War, . Known as  Seelow-Berlin Offensive Operation (which lasted until May 2, 1945), this battle is often incorporated into . the Battle of the Oder-Neisse - only the . opening phase of the Battle of Berlin, which was the name given to the final push of the Soviet forces into the German capital at the end of the war. Seelow Heights was where the most bitter . fighting in the overall battle took place, but it was only one of . several crossing points along the Oder and Neisse rivers where the . Soviets attacked. Close to one million Soviet soldiers, commanded by Marshal Georgi Zhukov, attacked the position known as the 'Gates of Berlin'. They were opposed by about 110,000 soldiers of the German 9th Army, commanded by General Theodor Busse. By the end of 19 April, the German Eastern Front line had ceased to exist. All that remained were pockets of resistance, and the road to Berlin was wide open for the final assault. Four days later the capital Berlin was encircled and the Battle of Berlin entered its last stage. Within two weeks, Adolf Hitler was dead and the war in Europe was effectively over.","Search aims to give as many as 200 missing soldiers proper funerals .

"It roamed the countryside spreading death and terror – a giant, ferocious hell-hound with flaming eyes and savage claws. For centuries, the beast that came to be known as Black Shuck struck fear into the hearts of all who crossed its path. Just a single glimpse was enough to impart a fatal curse; the briefest encounter sufficient to suck the life from any hapless victim. Discovery: These remains of a giant dog were found during a dig among the ruins of Leiston Abbey in Suffolk . Is it him? The bones are believed to date back to the 16th century, when the legendary hell hound Black Shuck (pictured in an artist's impression) was rumoured to roam East Anglia. They show the dog was a 'large male' One thing, however, has always been . absent from the many tales of the dog-like entity and its sinister . appearances in the East of England flatlands: A single fact. Now that may be about to change with an answer to the question: Did it exist only in folklore ... or was it flesh and blood? Yesterday, . 500 years after Black Shuck first went on the prowl, archaeologists . were examining the skeleton of a 7ft long dog unearthed in the remains . of an ancient abbey. It was . discovered a few miles from two churches where Black Shuck is said to . have killed worshippers during an almighty thunderstorm in August 1577. What’s . more, it appears to have been buried in a shallow grave at precisely . the same time as Shuck is said to have been on the loose, primarily . around Suffolk and the East Anglia region. Site: The bones were uncovered in a 20-inch deep unmarked grave among the ruins of Leiston Abbey (pictured) Experts will subject the bones and surrounding material to 21st century dating techniques. But . first, the legend. The beast’s most celebrated attack began at Holy . Trinity church, Blythburgh. A clap of thunder burst open the church . doors and a hairy black ‘devil dog’ came snarling in. It . ran through the congregation, killing a man and boy and causing the . church steeple to fall through the roof. Scorch marks still visible on . the church doors are purported to have come from Shuck’s claws as it . fled. Local verse records . the event thus: ‘All down the church in the midst of fire, the hellish . monster flew, and, passing onward to the quire, he many people slew.’ Next . stop was 12 miles away in Bungay, where two worshippers were killed at . St Mary’s church. One was left shrivelled ‘like a drawn purse’ as he . prayed. Brendon Wilkins, projects director of Dig Ventures, which organised the dig, pictured, said he believed the dog could have lived around 1577 because it was buried alongside pottery fragments from the period . Ruins: Dig Ventures projects director, Brendon Wilkins, said the grave was dug partly over the foundations of what appeared to have been a kitchen area - indicating it had been created after the abbey fell into disrepair . In his 1577 pamphlet . A Straunge And Terrible Wunder, the Rev Abraham Fleming told how the . Satan-like beast came ‘running all along down the body of the church . with great swiftnesse and incredible haste, among the  people, in a . visible fourm and shape’, wringing the necks of two parishioners as they . knelt. Spookily, a later work reveals: ‘Although his howling makes the hearer’s blood run cold, his footfalls make no sound.’ Subsequent . appearances of Shuck – a name believed to derive either from an old . English word for demon, or from local dialect meaning ‘shaggy’ – have . immortalised it. An image of Black Shuck is incorporated in Bungay’s . coat of arms, and the nickname for equally legendary Bungay Town FC is . the Black Dogs. The bones of the giant dog were found during a dig among the ruins of Leiston Abbey in Suffolk . The bones . uncovered in the ruins of Leiston Abbey, Suffolk, were first found by . archaeological group Dig Ventures in a project last year. Painstaking . work revealed the skeleton of an extremely large dog. Estimates suggest . it would have weighed more than 14 stone and stood 7ft tall on its hind . legs. The grave was less than 20 inches deep and unmarked. Pottery . fragments found at the same level date from the height of Shuck’s . alleged reign. Radio carbon . dating tests will now give an exact age for the bones, results that will . serve either to enhance the shaggy dog stories – or perhaps to support . the far less entertaining theory that here lies a 16th century abbot’s . beloved old hunting dog. Folklore: The legend of Black Shuck is now so popular that images of the dog have been put up across Bungay. Above, a weather vane in the town . According to folklore, Black Shuck appeared during a storm on August 4, 1577, at Holy Trinity Church in Blythburgh, about seven miles from Leiston in Suffolk. Villagers were reportedly sheltering inside the church when a huge clap of thunder caused the doors to burst open and the snarling dog crashed in. It ran through the congregation, killing a man and a boy, before the steeple crashed through the roof. The dog then fled, leaving scorch marks from its claws on the church door which are still visible today. Later the same day, Black Shuck is said to have struck again 12 miles away, killing two worshippers during a service at St Mary’s Church, Bungay, while the storm was still raging. Clergyman, . the Rev Abraham Fleming, is believed to have described the appearance of the legendary hell hound in a pamphlet written in 1577, entitled ‘A Straunge and . Terrible Wunder’. He wrote: 'This black dog, or the divel in such a . linenesse (God hee knoweth al who worketh all,) running all along down . the body of the church with great swiftnesse, and incredible haste, . among the people, in a visible fourm and shape, passed between two . persons, as they were kneeling uppon their knees, and occupied in prayer . as it seemed, wrung the necks of them bothe at one instant clene . backward, in somuch that even at a moment where they kneeled, they . strangely dyed.' Historian W. A. Dutt also wrote about Black Shuck in his 1901 book, Highways and Byways, set in East Anglia. 'He takes the form of a huge black dog, and prowls along dark . lanes and lonesome field footpaths, where, although his howling makes . the hearer’s blood run cold, his footfalls make no sound,' he wrote. The legend of Black Shuck is now so popular that images of the dog have been put up in buildings across the town - and the animal is even being . incorporated into Bungay’s coat of arms. There is also a Black Dog Running . Club and a Black Dog antiques shop, while the nickname for the town's football club is 'The Black Dogs'. And the legend has even infiltrated popular culture - with British rock band The Darkness featuring a track inspired by the devil dog on their debut album, Permission To Land. The track, named 'Black Shuck', includes the lyrics: 'In a town in the east, the parishioners were visited upon by a curious beast. 'And his eyes numbered but one and shone like the sun, and a glance beckoned the immediate loss of a cherished one.'","According to folklore, Black Shuck terrorised East Anglia in 16th century .

"A sketch of the bizarre creature that terrorized Van Meter in 1903 based on eyewitness accounts . A bizarre legend and unsolved mystery which has haunted a small Iowa town for more than 100 years is the subject of a new book called The Van Meter Visitor. For several nights in 1903, the small town of Van Meter, Iowa was terrorized by a giant bat-like creature that emerged from an old abandoned mine. The identity of this mysterious monster has never been discovered, but over 100 years later a new book is retelling the amazing tale and hoping to shed some light on what happened all those years ago. The legend dates back to the fall of 1903, when several of Van Meter’s most well . respected citizens reported a half human, half animal with enormous, . smooth bat wings flying about. The . creature is described as moving at speeds the townsfolk had never witnessed before, plus it let off a powerful stench and shot a blinding light . from its horned head. Each . time the townsfolk encountered the creature they fired their guns . at it, but this appeared to have no impact on the creature. On the first night it . was first spotted flying across . the building tops. The next evening it was spotted by both the town doctor and bank cashier . Peter Dunn who took a plaster cast of its 'great three-toed tracks.' On the third night, a man spotted it perched atop a telephone pole. Another resident who saw it, described the monster as hopping like a kangaroo, while the local high . school teacher likened it to a devil. Scared and angered by what they had witnessed, the townsfolk followed the creature to an abandoned coal mine near an old brickyard where they heard a noise from the mine. ‘Presently the noise opened up again, as . though Satan and a regiment of imps were coming forth for battle,’ reads an article in the Des Moines Daily News from Oct. 3, 1903. The unsolved mystery of the strange creature has haunted the Iowa town of Van Meter for more than 100 years . A photo of the '1901 Bachelors of Van Meter,' including several men who claimed to have seen the mysterious monster . The monster appeared together with a smaller version. In a flash of bright light they sailed away, but returned in the morning when the town's men had gathered with weapons ‘to rid the earth of them’. ‘The reception they received would have sunk the Spanish fleet, but aside from unearthly noise and peculiar odor they did not seem to mind it, but slowly descended the shaft of the old mine.’ The creature was never seen again. This amazing tale has survived and been retold for several generations now and a written version even exists in the town’s centennial book. The new book is the work of Chad Lewis, who has written over 15 books about the supernatural, plus co-authors Noah Voss and Kevin Lee Nelson and help from local librarian Jolena Walker. Author Chad Lewis visited Van Meter to speak to local residents about the creature and visit several historic locations including the mine . A historic portrait of Van Meter, Iowa near the time of the unexplained sightings in 1903 . The myth of the strange creature has survived and been retold for several generations and a written version even exists in the town’s centennial book . The authors visited the quiet town and spoke to local residents who told them the stories about the creature which passed been down and they visited several historic locations including the mine. Lewis says he has found no evidence to suggest the monster was a hoax, . although be believes the facts of the story may have been embellished over the years. Lewis told the Des Moines Register that even though he said he’s unsure . what happened those fall nights in 1903 in Van Meter, seeking the . answer was more important than finding it. 'It was an era when anything was possible. Science was starting to gain momentum. In fact, they had just discovered the mountain gorilla. So the beast in the jungle was real,' he told. 'People were open to the fact that anything could happen.'

"It was once the place to buy panthers, tigers and camels and even caught the fancy of Ronald Reagan, who rang up to pay for a baby elephant. But the Harrods Pet Kingdom will soon be no more - to be replaced with a womenswear section. The London department store's pet section opened in 1917, and rivalled London zoo with a vast array of animals which it sold for more than 50 years until most were outlawed by the 1976 Endangered Species Act. Barmy: John Rendall paid £3,000 in today's money for Christian the lion cub, which he kept in his Chelsea flat . The playwright Noël Coward was one of its more famous customers, having an alligator bought for him for Christmas in 1951 by the Canadian actress Beatrice Lillie. And in 1969, Australian backpackers John Rendall and Anthony Bourke bought Christian the lion cub for 250 guineas, or £3,000 in today's money. Who's a clever boy? Mohammed Al Fayed, the store's former owner, visited the pet department . Sadly he outlived their flat in nearby Chelsea, and had to be released into the wild in Kenya. But the most famous purchase from the pet store came in 1967, when future American president Ronald Reagan, then the governor of California, rang up to buy a baby elephant called Gertie. Legend has it the shop worker on the other end of the phone said: 'Would that be African or Indian, sir?' Less than a decade later, the Endangered Species Act would put a halt to most of the department's more exotic sales. However, it maintained a good trade in hamsters, rabbits, cats and pedigree dogs until recently. Mr Rendall told the Evening Standard: 'It was a completely different time and the world has moved on. 'After the Endangered Species Act they couldn’t have a zoo, and the pet shop was no longer a big draw so I understand they have to think of something more profitable but it’s certainly the passing of an era.' A Harrods spokesman said: 'The Pet Kingdom department will close to make way for further exciting planned developments in our womenswear offering. 'Employees have been informed and Harrods is working with them to find alternative positions in the store where possible.' The world-famous store was once owned by the outspoken billionaire Mohammed Al Fayed, but was bought out by the Qatari royal family's fund Qatar Holding in 2010 - becoming only the fifth owner since it was founded.

"Goldfinger's infamous 'No Mr Bond, I expect you to die' quote has been voted the best moment from the 007 movies. The laser-charged confrontation between Goldfinger and Sean Connery's Bond was named the nation's favourite Bond moment in a new poll from Sky Movies HD to celebrate the return of its dedicated Bond channel Sky Movies 007/HD. After 50 years and 23 films to date, Sky Movies asked more than 2,500 people to name their favourite Bond scenes as part of a special programme, Bond's Greatest Moments. Iconic: The 'No Mr Bond, I expect you to die' quote from villainous Auric Goldfinger (played by Gert Frobe, centre) has been voted to number one James Bond moment in a poll . Hosted by Sky Movies presenter Alex Zane, the programme includes contributions from Bond stars including Daniel Craig and Judi Dench, Bond directors, producers and celebrity fans including Andrew Garfield and Hugh Jackman. When informed of the winning moment, which received 10.3 per cent of the votes, current Bond star Daniel Craig said: 'Yes, that would take some beating.' Second in the poll was the breath-taking pre-title moment in The Spy Who Loved Me which showed Roger Moore skiing off the edge of an Austrian mountain to open a Union Jack parachute (7.6 per cent), pipping the first ever, now definitive 'Bond...James Bond' statement from Sean Connery in 1962's Dr. No, which completed the top three with 5.7 per cent of the votes. 'Bond... James Bond': Sean Connery's legendary introduction came in at number three in the poll. Daniel Craig's pulse-pounding chase at the start of Casino Royale came in at fourth . Thrill ride: The opening car chase in Quantum of Solace made the top ten, despite the film dividing critics . Daniel Craig's chase across a building site in Casino Royale came fourth (5.3 per cent) ahead of The Man With The Golden Gun's barrel roll car sequence, which saw Roger Moore's Bond perform a daring car jump across a Bangkok river (4.5 per cent). Pierce Brosnan made his entry into the poll in sixth place with 3.3 per cent for his tank chase through St. Petersburg in Goldeneye, beating Roger Moore's crocodile 'stepping stone' escape in Live And Let Die. The eighth most popular Bond scene was back to four wheels for Daniel Craig's Quantum Of Solace Aston Martin DBS race through the banks of Lake Garda (2.2 per cent). (Others = 54.6%) Explosive: Pierce Brosnan's tank chase in 1995's Goldeneye came in at six . Following at nine is Desmond Llewellyn's final scene as Q in The World Is Not Enough where viewers saw him advise Pierce Brosnan to 'pay attention 007' for the very last time. A sombre moment rounds off the top 10, courtesy of On Her Majesty's Secret Service and George Lazenby's only turn as 007. Following a tumultuous relationship and just moments after marrying his bride Tracy (played by Diana Rigg), celebrations were cut short when Blofeld carried out a drive-by-shooting that killed her and left Bond grief-stricken (1.7 per cent). Grief: The shocking murder of Bond's wife, played by Diana Rigg, in'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' was a sombre entry in the countdown .","Poll ranks top ten James Bond moments from 23 films over 50 years .

"It lurks just inches below the surface coiled and ready to strike - and yet you wouldn't know it was there. These remarkable images show the enormous 26-foot (eight metre) anacondas of Mato Grosso in Brazil searching for prey in the murky depths. They were captured by brave diver and snake enthusiast Franco Banfi, 53, who joined the beasts in their natural habitat armed only with a camera. Ready to strike: Brave diver and snake enthusiast Franco Banfi captured this image of an enormous anaconda snake lurking beneath the surface of a river in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil .

Swiss diver Franco Banfi captured the photographs on a ten-day visit to the Mato Grosso do Sul region in Brazil . In another shot, Banfi gets up close to a huge anaconda that is lying on the riverbank and glistening in the ferocious tropical heat. Thankfully for the photographer, it had just gobbled up a capybara rodent and wasn't interested in devouring him as a second course. Banfi, a father-of-two from Switzerland, said: 'As the snake had just eaten it didn't take much interest in us. 'Everything is possible but I don't think it would have eaten us. I was very close, I could have touched it if I wanted to.' Time for your close-up: Banfi was able to reach out and touch this massive anaconda sunbathing on the riverbank having devoured a capybara rodent . He saw six different female anaconda snakes on his ten-day trip to the Mato Grosso do Sul region, right in the heart of South America. The region is known for its diverse natural beauty and attracts thousands of visitors every year. The name literally means 'Thick Forest of the South' and it's easy to see why. Banfi added: 'At the first moment it's scary because you don't know the animal and everybody says it's dangerous. 'But after a while you understand that nothing happens if you respect the snake. 'I have never been so close to a snake like this before. But I think a small poisonous snake is more scary than a big one. At least you can see the anacondas clearly and know what they're doing.' Say cheese! Banfi, 53, goes up close to take an underwater shot of one of the anacondas. He saw six huge female snakes during his time in Brazil .

"Their bodies had lay in shallow graves in the dense Malaysian jungle for almost 60 years. However, the crew and passengers of a Royal Air Force plane which crashed during ferocious conflict in 1950 have finally been laid to rest, four years after their bodies were excavated in 2008. All 12 victims - including eight British servicemen - were given a full burial today following a painstaking search inspired by the brother of one of the dead airmen. Crash site: The wreckage of RAF Dakota KN630 which crashed deep in the Malaysian jungle on August, 1950, during a target marking mission near Kempong Jendera, killing all 12 crew and passengers on board . Remains: The bodies were discovered in 2008, excavated from shallow graves close to the plane's wreckage . Paying their respects: Members of the 150-strong expedition team laying a poppy wreath at the crash site . Military honour: Members of the Queen's Colour Squadron and the 47th Squadron of the British Royal Air Force carry a casket of a British soldier for the reburial ceremony at the Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery . The RAF Dakota aircraft suffered catastrophic engine failure and went down during a mission in 1950. UK forces were dispatched to the country to fight against Communist insurgents in a conflict known as the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1960. The plane from 52 Squadron had been dropping smoke markers near Kempong Jendera to help Lincoln bombers pinpoint Communist camps, but it lost power during its second run and plummeted into a ravine. RAF pilot Edward Talbot, 27, from Dorchester, Dorset; navigator Geoffrey Carpenter, 23, from West Norwood, Greater London and signaller Thomas O'Toole, 34, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, were the crew. They left their base at RAF Changi, Singapore, on the morning of August 25, 1950, with four Royal Army Service Corps Despatchers - Corporal Phillip Bryant, 25, from Southend-on-Sea, Essex; Driver Peter Taylor, 20, from Bournemouth, Dorset; Driver Roy Wilson, 21, from Birkenhead, Merseyside and Driver Oliver Goldsmith, 21, from Neston, Cheshire.

Tragic: Signaller Thomas O'Toole (left) and Navigator Geoff Carpenter (right) were among those who perished . The RAF Dakota aircraft - like this one - suffered catastrophic engine failure and went down during a mission in 1950 . Described as a guerilla war, the . Malayan Emergency was a conflict fought between the UK, Commonwealth and . other security forces against Communist insurgents in . Malaysia. It lasted from 1948 to 1960 and began after a period of sustained civil unrest in the region. The Malayan economy was left in turmoil following the withdrawal of Japan at the end of the Second World War. Attempts were made by the British . administration to repair the country's economy, as revenue from Malaya's . tin and rubber industries were important to Britain's own post-war . recovery. However, food was scarce and . expensive, wages were low and unemployment was high. Significant labour . unrest resulted in a large number of strikes between 1946 and 1948. Protestors were dealt with harshly . during the strikes, with many being arrested and deported. This resulted . in protesters becoming more and more militant. The Malayan Emergency was sparked on . June 16, 1948, by the first overt act of war; three European plantation . managers were killed at Sungai Siput, Perak, and retaliation against Communist insurgents was swift. Passengers Major John Procter, a . British Army Officer; Anker Rentse, a civilian lands development . officer; Pc Mohammed Bin Abdul Lalil; Sakiak guide Saiap Alais Sherda . and civilian Yaacob Mat were picked up later at Kota Bahu airfield. A rescue party reached the crash site in early September 1950 after nine days journey on foot to discover all 12 had died. The bodies were buried near the crash . site in a shallow grave because the difficult terrain and prevailing . security situation placed the rescue party at severe risk of attack. However, decades later, the brother of Flight Navigator Geoffrey Carpenter - 82-year-old Dennis - wrote to the Malaysian tourist office in . Britain asking for a map of the remote mountainous region around . Kampung Penchong where they died. In . a remarkable stroke of luck, his request landed on the desk of a . military officer at the Malaysian High Commission in London. Colonel . Tajri Alwi ordered a full-scale expedition to be carried out to recover . the remains of the warplane, and incredibly, the Malaysian Army’s 8th . Brigade located the wreckage. In November 2008 a 150-strong team of Malaysian military, police and specialist forensic archaeologists recovered the men's remains. Father of three Mr Carpenter, who is married to . Jean, 82, said: ‘He left home so young I never knew him fully but we were always . determined to see him properly buried. ‘We could have gone out before now but we had . nowhere to visit. It is comforting that we now have a proper grave with a . headstone.’ Excavation: Members of the 150 strong expedition team search for remains at the crash site. The dead were found in 2008 . Laid to rest: Relatives of the British soldiers killed during the Malayan Emergency in 1950 lay wreaths during the reburial ceremony at the Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur .

"Scientists believe they may have found evidence to show that big cats really are roaming the British countryside, by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their 'victims'. From the Beast of Trowbridge, to the Wildcat of Woodchester, big cat sightings have sparked the imaginations of many people over the years, although bar a few fuzzy photographs there has been little to prove their existence. Now expert Dr Andrew Hemmings believes he has found proof that big cats have been stalking Gloucestershire and neighbouring counties by analysing the remains of wild animals, which appear to have been eaten by beasts larger than any knows British carnivores. Beastly goings on: Scientists believe they may have found evidence to show that big cats, such as the 'Beast of Trowbridge', spotted earlier this year, really are roaming the British countryside, by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their 'victims' Dr Hemmings, a senior lecturer in animal science at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, has spent the last year examining 20 animal skeletons which all bore unusual teethmarks. Some of the livestock and deer remains, found by farmers, landowners and volunteers, had been found in unusual circumstances which suggested that they may have been killed by a big cat. Dr Hemmings studied the bones in order to figure out which animals had eaten them, and in a quarter of his samples found that the 'tooth pit' markings made by canine teeth had been inflicted by an animal larger than those living in the British countryside, such as badgers and foxes. Dogs' teeth can leave behind similar markings, so Dr Hemmings also examined the bones to look for markings made by the carnassial teeth - used for cutting flesh. These teeth are wider apart in a big cat than a dog, which would enable Dr Hemmings to eliminate dogs as being behind the attacks, according to the Daily Telegraph. He was unable to reach a firm conclusion in 17 of the cases, but said that in the remaining three there were clear indications to show that big cats were responsible. One of the bones came from a wild boar found in Gloucestershire, while the others were from sika deer discovered in Dorset. Some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers, leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets by the Dangerous Wild Animals act . The scientist is now hoping to uncover more evidence, including fresh carcasses which may show traces of feline DNA, before his research is publish in the Journal of Archaeological Science. 'All three are certainly wider than you would expect to find in a dog imprint', he told the Daily Telegraph. 'But we need to let the sample size build up before we have anything approaching a statistical basis.' Dr Hemmings said that his research was . not the most conclusive proof of big cats, but added to the growing . weight of evidence to suggest that big cats were living in Britain. 'We are excited as we are finding some tooth pits in many of the . bones that suggest the animals could have been killed by a large-sized . feline, but at the moment it is impossible to tell whether they have . been caused by a domestic dog or big cat,' he told local newspaper the Gloucester Citizen last month. Big cat sightings have been a regualr . feature of country life, going back decades, such as in the case of the . Beast of Bodmin, said to live in Cornwall. More than 60 sightings of a large black cat have occurred in the area over the years and in 2005, a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the River Fowey close to the moor. In 2005 a large cat scull was found in the river Fowey, on the edge of Bodmin Moor, however, it was later found to have come from a leopard-skin rug . The skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain. In fact, the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. Some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers, leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets by the Dangerous Wild Animals act. In August, pensioners Herbert and Doreen Smith told how they had spotted a big cat, dubbed the 'Beast of Trowbridge', prowling through Murhill Woods, near Trowbridge, Wiltshire, eating its prey. There was a flurry of reported sightings of the creature in 2009, with members of the public claiming they had seen a big cat lurking by the side of the road. In January last year DNA tests were carried out on the carcasses . of three roe deer found dead at Woodchester National Park, near Stroud, . in a bid to establish how they were killed. One of the deer had its vital organs missing and had had its snout severed - the hallmarks of a panther-like kill - but the tests found no evidence of a wild cat, which many had called the Wildcat of Woodchester, being involved. In February 2012, grainy film footage emerged online showing what . appears to be a 6ft-long beast slinking across a field just three miles . from Woodchester Park. Teaching assistant Coryn Memory, who lives . in the area, said she had spotted the large black animal - dubbed the . 'Wildcat of Woodchester', five times before shooting the video. She . said her first sighting came in July 2009, when she saw the . panther-like creature crossing a field near her house in Thrupp, near . Stroud. Also in February 2012, a gigantic paw print was discovered in the Mendip hills near Bristol, this size of which correlated with the paw of a big cat, according to wildlife experts, and were unlikely to be those of a fox - unless it was an extremely large one. The Mendips have been the site of several reported big cat sightings in recent years, and savaged carcasses discovered in the West Country added weight to claims that at least one giant beast is living there. In July last year, Sir Benjamin Slade claimed a beast had been on his land and that animals had been killed at the 98-acre Maunsel House. A major hunt for a creature nicknamed 'The Essex Lion' was underway in August 2012, when photographs of what appeared to be a lion spotted near a caravan park at Clacton were handed to police. Police and zoo workers armed with tranquilliser guns were scrambled to hunt for the Essex Lion, only for the creature to be exposed as a domestic cat . Following reports of a wild animal on the loose, armed officers and two police helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to run, were scrambled. Workers from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre. However, the creature was later revealed to be a domestic cat, named Teddy. The . Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food  conducted an official . investigation into the 'beast' and other unknown animals reported to be . roaming Britain in 1995. It concluded there was no 'verifiable evidence' of exotic felines loose in Britain. However, it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were 'not present'.","Bones of wild animals found dead analysed for unusual teeth marks .

"Borussia Dortmund eased past Galatasaray to continue their 100% record in this season's Champions League group stages. A brace from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, followed by goals from Marco Reus and Adrian Ramos, secured the points and took Dortmund three clear of Arsenal in Group D. The Gunners came from behind in Brussels to steal a late, vital 2-1 win against Anderlecht, with goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski. Their victory means they stay relatively close to Dortmund, but it is the Germans who look the most fearful in this group.

Goals: Aubameyang 6, 18, Reus 41, Ramos 83 . Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz . In Turkey, Dortmund did not have to wait long to take the lead, when Aubameyang tucked away a Marco Reus cross with ease to put the away side ahead after just six minutes. The German's have struggled in their Bundesliga campaign, winning just two of their first eight matches, but they are having no such trouble on the European stage. To compound Galatasaray's misery early on, Aubameyang doubled both his tally and his side's lead with Dortmund's second after 16 minutes. Latching onto Lukasz Piszczek's inch-perfect cross, the Gabon international finished with relative ease to take the game further from the home side's reach. Marco Reus continued the rout four minutes before the break, when he hammered home a wonderful strike from 25 yards out. The goalkeeping was questionable from Galatasaray stopper Fernando Muslera, but to take anything away from Reus' effort would be an injustice. In the second-half, Dortmund continued their impressive performance, albeit at a slower pace than the first. Shinji Kagawa was injured with 10 minutes to play, and was replaced by Adrian Ramos. The Columbian scored twice in Dortmund's 3-0 win over Anderlecht, and took less than a minute to get on the scoresheet again.

"A university lecturer is claiming to have photographed fairies flying through the air in the British countryside. John Hyatt, 53, says his series of photos which were taken over the past two years prove the tiny winged creatures do exist in the Rossendale Valley, Lancashire. Mr Hyatt, Director of Manchester Institute for Research and Innovation in Art and Design (MIRIAD) at Manchester Metropolitan University insists his photos are genuine and have not been altered in any way. A university lecturer is claiming to have photographed these 'fairies' flying through the air in the British countryside . John Hyatt, 53, says his series of photos which were taken over the past two years prove that they do exist in the Rossendale Valley, Lancashire . And he has now put his photographs on display at a special exhibition. Mr Hyatt, who was a member of the Three Johns punk band in the 1980s and 1990s, says adults that have seen his photos have started to harbour ideas that they may indeed be real. He said: 'It was a bit of a shock when I blew them up, I did a double take. Mr Hyatt insists his photos are genuine and have not been altered in any way . 'From my experience they were just enjoying themselves and there was a little dance in the sunlight going on' said Mr Hyatt . 'I went out afterwards and took pictures of flies and gnats and they just don’t look the same. 'People can decide for themselves what they are. 'The message to people is to approach them with an open mind. 'I think it’s one of those situations where you need to believe to see. 'A lot of people who have seen them say they have brought a little bit of magic into their lives and there’s not enough of that around.' Mr Hyatt, who lives Rawtenstall, has posted some of his images on social media and says they have attracted much debate. The existence of fairies has long been resigned to the realm of children’s books and Disney films, such as Tinkerbell in Peter Pan, right, but Mr Hyatt, left, wants to get more adults to bring 'magic into their lives' The exhibition, called Rossendale Fairies, will be on show at The Whitaker Museum in Whitaker Park in Rossendale, throughout the spring. Mr Hyatt said the name is a nod to the famous story of the Cottingley fairies where two schoolgirls in Bradford claimed to have photographed fairies in their garden, which they confirmed 60 years later had been faked with cardboard cut-outs. However he admits the creatures he snapped are a long way from the characters depicted in children’s stories and hopes his pictures will change people’s perceptions of them. 'Everything gets stereotyped, whatever it is. 'But there are stranger things in life than fairies, and life grows everywhere. Experts and the simply sceptical will no doubt point to explanations involving reflections, flashes or technical glitches or that the tiny shapes could be a flea, left or a fly, right . In 2009, Phyllis Bacon, 55, believed she took a photo of a fairy at the bottom of her garden in New Addington, near Croydon in South London . 'I don’t believe they are just smaller versions of us and go home and have a cup of tea at the end of the day. 'And one is suggesting they have any special powers. 'From my experience they were just enjoying themselves and there was a little dance in the sunlight going on. 'They are just beautiful pictures and beauty can make people believe.' In 2009, Phyllis Bacon, 55, believed she took a photo of a fairy at the bottom of her garden in New Addington, near Croydon in South London. Cottingley, a village outside Bradford in Yorkshire, would have remained in much deserved obscurity had 16-year-old Elsie Wright not taken a remarkable photograph of her ten-year-old cousin, Frances Griffiths, playing with 'fairies' on the banks of a stream which ran behind the garden of Elsie's house. A few days earlier, in the summer of 1917, Frances had slipped and gone into the stream, later telling her mother she had fallen into the water while she was 'playing with the fairies'. Her mother, unamused, sent her up to the attic bedroom she shared with Elsie where, later that afternoon, the two girls hatched a childish prank that would make headlines around the world, severely damage the reputations of eminent public figures and generate a controversy that endured for generations. Elsie suggested they should take a photograph of the 'fairies' to prove to Frances' mother that she had been telling the truth. The girls drew some fairies, cut them out and pasted them on to cardboard. With a few long hatpins on which to mount their 'fairies' and a roll of zinc oxide bandage tape. Arthur Wright willingly agreed to lend his daughter his camera and girls set off, blissfully unaware that they were about to create one of the most reproduced photographs in history. They arranged the four fairies - three with wings and one playing a piped instrument - in front of Frances, who put flowers in her hair, cupped her chin in her hand and, curiously, stared intently at the camera rather than the fairies when Elsie took the picture. Wright developed the exposed plate a darkroom he asked Elsie what they were, and she told him they were the fairies that she and Frances played with by the stream - they took another photo a month later. Polly Wright, Elsie's mother, and her sister, Annie Griffiths, Frances' mother took the  photographs to a meeting of the . Theosophical Society in Harrogate. Knowledge of photography was not . widespread at this time and few understood that the 'spirit' could be . introduced by a simple double exposure on the same photographic plate. As . a result, many Spiritualists were encouraged to believe that the camera . could 'see' what the naked eye could not, a belief which helped . legitimise the Cottingley fairy photographs. Soon the word spread and it was only many decades later did they admit that the photographs were faked and involved cut-out drawings of fairy figures that were fastened to foliage with hatpins. Elsie and Frances stuck doggedly to their story for years. Not until March 1983, when she was 76 years old, did Frances finally confess. 'I'm fed up with all these stories,' she complained. 'I hated those photographs and cringe every time I see them. I thought it was a joke, but everyone else kept it going. It should have died a natural death 60 years ago.' Elsie at first refused to comment, but later confirmed her cousin's story: 'I do not want to die and leave my grandchildren with a loony grandmother to remember.' Frances continued to claim, contrarily, that she had seen fairies and that the fifth photograph - the fairy bower - was authentic. She died in 1986; Elsie died two years later. 'The joke was only meant to last two hours,' said Elsie towards the end of her life. 'It lasted 70 years.'","University lecturer John Hyatt claims he has proof the creatures are real .

"A former Colorado jail officer has been arrested and charged with murdering his wife, three years after local detectives allegedly covered up evidence of his crime and ruled her death a suicide - even though she was shot in the back of the head. Ashley Fallis' family never believed the 28-year-old mother of three had killed herself and they campaigned for three years for police in Evans, Colorado, to reopen the case and investigate whether her husband, Tom Fallis, was responsible for the New Years Day 2012 shooting. Tom Fallis, 34, was arrested today in Bloomington, Indiana, where he had been living with the couple's three young children after fleeing Colorado. He will be extradited back to Colorado to stand trial. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Ashley Fallis, 28, was shot in the back of the head after a New Year's party in 2012. Her death was ruled a suicide after minimal investigation by local police . In cuffs: Three years after his was was killed, Tom Fallis was arrested in Bloomington, Indiana, for Ashley's murder. He will be extradited back to Colorado to stand trial . Didn't give up: Ashley's parents Joel Raguindin (left) and Jenna Fox (right) campaigned to have their daughter's case re-opened after claiming the police covered up evidence of a crime . Ashley's parents, Jenna Fox and Joel Raguindin, are flying to Indiana to take custody of their grandchildren and raise them as their own. A grand jury indicted Tom Fallis for murder after police agreed to reopen the investigation following a series of damning reports by KDVR-TV reporter Justin Joseph. Ashley was found shot in the back of the head after a booze-fueled New Year's Eve party at the Fallis home turned sour when Tom Fallis learned someone had brought marijuana to the party and became enraged. Fallis, who was working as a Weld County corrections officer, called 911 in screaming hysterics to say his wife had committed suicide. He angrily denied that he had anything to do with his wife's death and Evans police quickly ruled that Ashley had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Mr Joseph uncovered shocking evidence that was either ignored or left out of a police report by Evans police officer Michael Yates. Yates was later cleared of criminal charges by an independent investigation, but still faces an internal review, according to the Denver Fox affiliate. Tom Fallis became irate in a police interview when an interrogator suggested his wife could not have shot herself in the back of the head . Ashley Fallis could be heard screaming for her husband to get off of her before the gunshot that took her life . The bedroom where Ashley was found was a mess and showed signs of a struggle - despite Tom Fallis' claims that he and his wife had never had a fight . Among the details that KDVR uncovered: A friend at the party who said he overheard Ashley crying for her husband to get off of her; a neighbor who said he heard outside his window as Tom Fallis confess to killing his wife; scratches and defensive wounds on Tom Fallis' chest that indicated there had been a struggle; reports from Ashley's parents that he had been violently angry before Ashley's death; clear evidence of a struggle in the bedroom where Ashley's body was found - including . Most shockingly, one of the the Fallis' young children, age six, told police that she saw 'daddy getting the gun ready' and 'saw daddy shoot mommy.' 'He was irate and explosive. He was abusive with his words and he was telling us he hated us, and to ‘F everybody’ and then he went into the room and slammed the door,' Ashley's mother, Ms Fox, told KDVR. Ms Fox and Mr Raguindin never gave up their search for justice. They rallied friends and supporters to picket outside the police station when Ashley's death was ruled a suicide. They have targeted Officer Yates and called for him to be criminally indicted. They raised money for lawyers fees to win visitation rights for their grandchildren and set up a memorial for their Ashley. A Facebook page that they set up for Ashley, which has nearly 500 followers, states unequivocally: 'Ashley Fallis was murdered by Tom Fallis the night of, 1/1/12.

'I was being told that everyone who was working on the campaign was fashion royalty; the world's top stylists, hairdressers and photographers were all there! 'It was all a bit surreal to be honest. The set and location were unbelievable; I've done photo shoots for West Ham and England before but nothing like this, there were so many different people running around with cameras and TV screens everywhere, it was seriously impressive.'

"The woman killed in a horror crash involving reality TV star Bruce Jenner once appeared in a music video alongside Elvis Presley, it has been revealed. Kim Howe, 69, died after her car was hit head-on by a Hummer earlier this month, with investigators looking into whether Jenner rear-ended her vehicle, causing it to cross into the oncoming lane. Now it has been revealed that widow Ms Howe made a short appearance in 1967 movie Double Trouble, starring Elvis Presley, when she danced with The King himself. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Kim Howe, the 69-year-old who died in a multi-car pileup earlier this month involving Bruce Jenner, once appeared in a film alongside Elvis Presley (pictured left) Ms Howe was killed while driving along Pacific Coast Highway on February 7. During a pile-up her white Lexus (pictured) was forced into oncoming traffic and hit by a Hummer, killing her . In her early 20s, Ms Howe is seen dressed as a traditional German frauline holding a stein of beer with her long blonde hair tied up in a bun. She features on screen a few moments into the song I Love Only One Girl, as Elvis walks down the steps of a bandstand and into a dancing crowd before walking up to her. The King takes her hand, they raise their glasses and then perform a short dance, during which time Ms Howe can be seen beaming at the music star. Elivs grabs a bouquet of flowers from a passing seller, hands them to Ms Howe, and then walks off while continuing the song. According to gossip site TMZ this was one of the highlights of Ms Howe's life, as she does not appear to have starred in any other film or TV projects. Ms Howe lived alone in a $2.5million house in Calabsas, Los Angeles, following the death of her husband Robert in 2003. The pair had no children, but Ms Howe was reported to own a dog. More details of Ms Howe's past emerged as police revealed they have not yet determined who started the car accident which lead to her death. Law enforcement officials have revealed they have not yet determined who started that chain-reaction crash involving Bruce Jenner that resulted in a woman's death on a Malibu highway earlier this month . Jenner's SUV rear-ended two cars, pushing a white Lexus into oncoming traffic, the official said. The driver, Kim Howe, 69, was killed when it was struck head-on by a Hummer . It was initially thought that Ms Howe may have hit a Prius which was stopped at lights in front of her, causing Jenner to hit her from behind, forcing her into oncoming traffic where she was hit again. New reports have suggested that Jenner could have caused the accident by rear-ending both Ms Howe's white Lexus, and the black Prius in front of her. Jenner was hauling an off-road vehicle on a trailer behind his Cadillac Escalade on February 7 when he steered to avoid cars slowing for a traffic light in front of him on Pacific Coast Highway. The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is investigating the cause of the wreck and will consider whether to issue a citation that could result in criminal charges - possibly vehicular manslaughter. The official said the video taken by cameras on an MTA bus in the area showed Jenner's vehicle continued forward and rear-ended a Toyota Prius. Officials initially said the victim's white Lexus had struck the Prius. Most significantly  the video shows that the Lexus driver didn’t make contact with the Prius involved, reports TMZ. A video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by Integral Media Works. Investigators have sought cellphone records to see if any drivers were distracted, but the video appears to show that Jenner was not using his phone. His publicist, Alan Nierob, has said Jenner was not texting and is cooperating with investigators. A video showing a possible recreation of the accident has been created by Integral Media Works . The video shows Jenner rear-end the Lexus and when the Lexus clears his lane, his SUV keeps moving and crashes into the Prius . The MTA video is alleged to show that Jenner hits the Lexus, propelling it into a Hummer coming the other way. Jenner then continues on and hits the Prius . According to earlier reports, the Lexus had been in Jenner's path after coming to a halt when it hit a Prius travelling ahead. The Lexus was then pushed into the path of a Hummer coming the other way, leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant, 69-year-old Kim Howe, dead. The Kardashian family patriarch, who escaped the crash unscathed, took a roadside sobriety test in front of officers in the wake of the collision, which he passed. This latest evidence suggests that rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim's Lexus hitting the Prius in front of her, Jenner may have hit both cars, claims TMZ. Law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the Prius had been stopped behind cars and, as a traffic light turned green, vehicles began moving. It was at this point, sources say, that Jenner rear-ended the Lexus and when the Lexus cleared his lane, his car kept moving and crashed into the Prius. TMZ reported that police say when Jenner hit the Lexus, it veered left while his Escalade moved to the right. Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation. If any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. Jenner's Cadillac Escalade hit the back of the victim's white Lexus on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, California, which caused a chain reaction that resulted in the luxury sedan veering into oncoming traffic . An aerial view of the crash scene on February 7 shows the damaged cars, and police markings as they work to investigate the cause . If it is determined that Jenner's Escalade struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely, it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction, TMZ claims. Investigations will determine if Jenner, or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision, were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision. It is illegal to text while driving in California. The star's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel. Breaking his silence on the crash the following day, Jenner said in a statement: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident.' 'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.' But three days after the crash, Jenner was seen talking on his phone while driving in Los Angeles. The reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in Thousand Oaks, California.

"Social media should be monitored by police and security services, a former intelligence chief has said, to prevent paedophiles and terrorists from communicating unhindered. Sir David Omand, former Permanent Secretary and Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator in the Cabinet Office, says criminals are increasingly making use of online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate. He added that those responsible for protecting society need to use the technology to keep suspects under surveillance. Challenge: Sir David Omand says that without the monitoring and . collection of social media intelligence the sites could become 'secret . spaces' where those carrying out illegal activities could communicate . unhindered . He said that without the monitoring and . collection of social media intelligence, known as Socmint, websites . could become ‘secret spaces’ where those carrying out illegal activities . could communicate freely. However, the former Whitehall Intelligence officer made it clear that an individual’s account should only be ‘hacked’ into under certain circumstances. The soon to be published Communications Capabilities Development Programme is expected to force internet service providers to store details of when and where emails are sent and by whom. Mr Omand wants a Green Paper to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the Government to develop analytical tools to monitor developments. There have been reports to suggest that Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden are using social media to communicate with one another and Mr Omand said that in such circumstances the authorities need to be able to gain access to private accounts. Monitoring: Mr Omand said criminals are increasingly making use . of online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to communicate . He added: ‘I don’t know anybody who thinks that it should be ring-fenced and allowed to become a secret space.’ A new report by the think-tank Demos indicates that Twitter and Facebook accounts could be legally accessed by using the Regulatory and Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). The act states that warrants are not necessary for ‘directed surveillance’ of a suspect – for example when monitoring a person’s movements – and that the principle could be extended to the internet where investigators were using publicly available information. However, the former director of GCHQ said it was essential that monitoring was put on a legal footing so that where individuals have put up privacy settings on their social network accounts any monitoring which involves the interception of communications should require a warrant. Networking: Mr Omand wants a Green Paper to be published on monitoring social media sites and for private industry to link up with the public sector to develop analytical surveillance tools . The report states: ‘Democratic legitimacy demands that where new methods of intelligence gathering and use are to be introduced, they should be on a firm legal basis and rest on parliamentary and public understanding of what is involved, even if the operational details of the sources and methods used must sometimes remain secret. ‘People now share vastly more . personal information about themselves, their friends and their networks . in new a varied ways: what is ‘public’ and what is ‘private’ is not . always obvious and differs greatly across social media platforms and . even within social media platforms.’ The . report’s publication comes against the background of intense . controversy over the Government’s plans to extend the monitoring of all . texts, telephone calls, emails and internet traffic in the UK. Sir David said that proper regulation was essential to ensure public trust in the system. ‘The . problem with social media is that it doesn’t really fit the 19th and . 20th century structures we have for how you go about regulating these . matters,’ he said. ‘After Iraq, we must be sure that if people are engaged in this kind of monitoring, they are doing it for the reasons set out in the authorisation (and that) it has not been politicised.’ A Home Office spokesman said communications data has played a role in every major security service counter-terrorism operation over the past decade and in 95 per cent of all serious organised crime investigations. However, Google says that when it comes to accessing pornography online laws will not protect children - only parents can keep their children safe from such adult material.","Sir David Omand says monitoring of social media must be put on proper legal footing .

"The seaside town might be famed for its oysters, but this incredible image could soon have visitors flocking to Whistable in the hope of catching Britain's biggest crab. The photograph, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft-wide lurking in shallow water. While some insist it is proof of 'Crabzilla', others argue that the shadowy figure is nothing more than an unusually-shaped sandbank - or is simply a playful hoax. Crabzilla: The photograph, above, which has been shared online, appears to show a crustacean that is at least 50ft wide lurking in the shallow water. It dwarfs the fishing boasts resting on the nearby pier . The image shows the outline of a crab in the mouth of the Kent harbour - dwarfing the fishing boats resting on the nearby pier. It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water and grows to an average of five inches. The photograph was posted on a website called Weird Whitstable - an online collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town. Its curator, Quinton Winter, said that at first he thought the image - sent to him by a follower - showed an unusual sand formation, but that he is now convinced it is a monster of the deep. Speaking to the Daily Express, he claimed that he saw the giant creature close to the shore when he took his son crabbing last summer. He said: 'At first all I could see was some faint movement, then as it rose from the water I thought, ""that’s a funny looking bit of driftwood"". Hoax? It is shaped like an edible crab, a species that is commonly found in British water but normally grows to no more than 10 inches. Some claim that the incredible image is simply a playful hoax . 'It had glazed blank eyes on stalks, swivelling wildly and it clearly was a massive crab with crushing claws. 'Before this incident I thought the aerial photo showed an odd-shaped sand bank.

"Margaret Rowe, 65, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job and objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife in a 'chauvinistic culture' A city lawyer who was sacked after she voiced objections to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife around the office was described by her manager as having 'the maturity of an eight year old.' Margaret Rowe, 65, of North London, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job at 'chauvinistic' Fidelity Worldwide Investment because she refused to act like a woman who 'knows her place'. But Philip Warland, head of public policy and Miss Rowe's manager, said she constantly made aggressive and false accusations that she was being treated differently because she was a woman. He said her comments were made with 'startling vehemence and ferocity' and had a 'machine gun delivery.' He recalled he was physically sick after one 'abusive' encounter. Miss Rowe had objected when Fidelity's head of portfolio management James Bateman showed junior women colleagues photographs of the full-frontal painting of his wife, Cambridge don Dr Victoria Bateman. She said many women in the office found the picture awkward. She also claimed she was constantly seen as aggressive because she was assertive and forthright in a man's culture. The Central London tribunal previously heard she had claimed victimisation when she was overlooked for promotion at the firm. But she was sacked after an independent investigation found no evidence of sex discrimination or bullying. Ms Rowe is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination against Fidelity. She said after she was dismissed it was the end of her career because at 65 she had been planning to work until she was 70. She joined the firm in 2007 and took a post as Director of Public Policy under Mr Warland in 2013. He told the tribunal that claims he treated her differently because she was a woman were 'without foundation.' 'I have been a manager in the City for 50 years and one of my leitmotifs has been to value people for themselves,' he said. 'Partly this is based on Christian principle.' Mr Warland, who was a trustee of the charity Oasis which rescues women from prostitution and trafficking, said he had become frustrated with Miss Rowe's constant attempts to undermine him. Philip Warland claims Miss Rowe was aggressive in her dealings with him and spoke with ferocity . He admitted describing her as having 'the maturity of an eight-year-old' in an email to  his boss, Peter Yandle after another frustrated interaction. He said he tried hard to include Miss Rowe in discussions and meetings, only excluding her from those she was not qualified to attend, but her unwillingness to compromise made her hard to work with. 'It felt like she was jumping from the fact she was not happy with the way she was being treated to allege the treatment was based on her being a woman,' he added. 'That was completely groundless.' In March 2014 Miss Rowe challenged him after the job of Director of Public Policy was given to a man. She had told his boss, Mr Yandle, that the decision 'makes clear I am a lackey', so Mr Warland claims he tried to speak to her and explain her sex was not a factor in the decision. Mr Warland said: 'What was frightening was not the content of what she said but the startling vehemence and ferocity and the machine gun delivery of the personalised invective. 'I found it offensive and abusive and was physically sick when I left the office. 'In my 47 years working in the City I have never encountered this sort of abusive behaviour.' By May Mr Warland said it became increasingly difficult for him to work with Ms Rowe. He added: 'By the time it came to the investigation, I would have found it difficult to get over the aggressiveness with which she treated me on March 31 and I would not want to work in an environment where there was a risk I might be subjected to that again.' The asset management firm says there was nothing prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, Dr Victoria Bateman (left) by Anthony Connolly which was featured in an exhibition . He said he believed that by December 2013 Miss Rowe had decided she would undermine his authority in any way possible. He added: 'I treated Margaret fairly thoroughout investing a considerable amount of time trying to manage her and work though our issues and her gender never had any part to play in any of my dealings with her and others.' Miss Rowe previously told the tribunal the culture of the asset management firm was chauvinistic. James Bateman is said to have shown junior women colleagues photographs of thepainting of his wife . Other members of staff had told the court they felt her emails were aggressive and she would often overstep the mark from professional interaction to personal attack. The tribunal previously heard that the firm denied there was anything prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, which was featured in an exhibition. Fidelity insisted the almost life-size painting – which received publicity when it was shown at London's Mall Galleries last year – was meant as a 'challenge against the objectification of women'. Miss Rowe joined Fidelity in 2007 as head of the investments legal team and within four years was earning £135,000 a year and picking up annual bonuses of £49,000. Speaking of her dismissal she previously said: 'It hurt me very deeply I was dismissed when I had gone out of my way to treat people with respect and dignity.' Some bosses accused her of playing the 'woman card' when she did not like a decision that had been made. The tribunal continues.","Margaret Rowe lost £184,000 a year job at Fidelity Worldwide Investment .

"A British rapper who joined rebels fighting the Syrian regime has claimed he was kidnapped, tortured and robbed by members of rival Islamic terror groups. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, walked out of his family's £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, last year to join militant groups, telling them he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'. Now Bary - whose music has featured on BBC Radio 1 - has posted on Twitter that he and another Briton were abducted and robbed, with their money, phones and guns stolen by other jihadists. 'Hip-hop jihadist': Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, walked out of his family's £1million home in Maida Vale, west London, last year to join militant groups, telling them he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah' Bary walked out of the family home last year in order to join rebels fighting in Syria. Since then he has been tweeting under the names 'Terrorist' and 'Abu Klasnikov' though his account in now suspended . Bary, who posts under the name 'Terrorist', said: 'Me & Abu Hussein al britani got kidnapped /tortured by FSA/IF scum they stole our 4 ak's and a 7mm, my vechile & our phones and cash.' The tweet was posted last month. A Foreign Office spokesman said he had no details on the claims. Friends said Bary - an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene - grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary. He has posted a series of photographs online, including shots of him masked and posing with g guns under the title 'soldier of Allah'. In other messages he called on Allah to 'grant us martyrdom', and praised Osama Bin Laden. Bary, whose music has featured on Radio 1, is one of six children of Adel Abdul Bary, 53. Bary launched a twitter rant against anti-terror police who raided his family home in west London calling them 'kuffar' (non-believers) and pagans . Bary Snr was extradited from Britain to the US in 2011 after an eight-year legal battle that made him a cause celebre of the Left as lawyers took his publicly funded case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. 'Me & Abu Hussein al britani got kidnapped /tortured by FSA/IF scum they stole our 4 ak's and a 7mm, my vechile & our phones and cash' Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary . Investigators believe Bary Snr was one of Bin Laden's closest lieutenants in the infancy of Al Qaeda and ran a London cell of the terror network. He faces life in prison if convicted of involvement in the bombings of US embassies in East Africa in 1998. His son's appearance among the ranks of UK jihadists in Syria, where several Britons fighting for the militants have already been killed, will add to concerns about their potential threat to the West. Video courtesy of SBTV . 'Tortured': It has been claimed that Bary - whose music has featured on BBC Radio One - and another Briton were abducted and robbed, with their money, phones and guns stolen by other jihadists . Bary lived with his mother Ragaa for more than a decade in a home in Maida Vale, owned by Westminster Council. If it were sold on the open market it would be worth £1million. She travelled to Britain from Egypt in 1990 after her husband was granted refugee status. Friends said Bary's conversion to radical Islam happened as he grew increasingly frustrated with the British authorities over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it came despite his fledgling success on the underground grime music scene, where he rapped under the names Lyricist Jinn and L Jinny Bary appeared in dozens of videos, including one in which he posed outside the Bank of England and declared his allegiance to the global hacking group Anonymous. Connection: Friends said Bary - an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene - grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured) On July 1 last year, he announced that he was turning his back on music as 'I have left everything for the sake of Allah'. It is understood that soon afterwards he travelled to Syria, where one of his oldest friends had already joined the fighting. He changed his Twitter name to Soldier of Allah and posed for pictures wearing a mask and military fatigues while carrying an AK-47 and other large assault rifles. Last November he said, 'Oh Allah, grant us martyrdom' and praised Bin Laden, calling him a 'lion'. Referring to conditions in Syria, he said it is the 'real jungle out here'.","Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary left Maida Vale home last year to go to Syria .

"What are the chances of this happening? You set up a time-lapse camera in the hope of getting some minute-by-minute shots of the ever-changing beauty of autumnal Windermere. Instead, you capture the clearest snap ever taken of a giant, Loch Ness Monster-style beastie, so close you can almost see it smiling. Scroll down for video . This picture, apparently captured by an amateur photographer, appears to show a creature not unlike the Loch Ness Monster . The photo is said to have been taken by a man who left his camera at the side of the lake to automatically capture images throughout the day, but questions were raised over the suspicious timing of the snap . So the question must be asked: could this be a glimpse of a legendary monster that has been teasing, attracting and eluding sightseers for decades? Or is someone trying to lift Britain’s gloom by suggesting Nessie has fled South in advance of the Scottish independence vote. Add to that the fact the photograph was taken and tweeted by the firm that makes the clever automatic camera responsible for the shot, and it becomes a matter on which even a partial Scottish jury surely would not be able to agree. Yet there are some intriguing elements to this, the alleged first picture of Bownessie, the Sassenach version of the famed Loch Ness Monster. It was taken on an Autographer camera on a tripod at the Cumbrian lake shore at Brockhole. Ellie Williams, who provides photographs for the company, claims she wanted to get a sequence of nature and wildlife shots taken throughout the day. When the camera content was examined on Wednesday, it appeared she might have got more wildlife than she bargained for. The dinosaur-like creature was apparently captured swimming or paddling into the distance before disappearing. ‘At first I thought it might have been a swan or a goose, as I was looking at the image quite small on my smartphone,’ said Ellie, 24. ‘I’m open to suggestions as to what the creature could be – I’m just glad I put the camera in the right place at the right time.’ Yesterday the company said it had examined the images and insisted they had not been altered. A famous photo allegedly showing the Loch Ness Monster was taken in 1934, but was later said to be a fake . The legend of the creature attracts millions of tourists to Loch Ness, Scotland's second largest body of water . Lake Windermere - the largest natural lake in England - is situated about 40 miles from the Scottish border . With tongue firmly in cheek, marketing executive James Ebdon said: ‘At first, we thought it was a swan or goose, or on closer look, a larger animal like a horse with a saddle pack or something. ‘Whatever it is we will leave it to the experts.’ A spokesman for the firm insisted: ‘It certainly looks real. It’s ridiculous, but we can’t offer any logical explanation.’ He said the camera took shots every few minutes, so all the images were scrutinised to see if they revealed anyone putting something in the water or taking it out afterwards. But there was nothing – not even a sighting of Alex Salmond trying to lead Nessie home.","Referendum campaign has seen banks tell of plans to leave Scotland .

"Growing threat: Infections like C. difficile are becoming increasingly difficult to treat as bugs become more resistant to antibiotics, leaving millions vulnerable . The rise of drug-resistant superbugs will drag the health service back ‘to the early 19th century’, Britain’s most senior medical adviser has warned. Unless urgent action is taken, the ‘ticking timebomb’ of growing antibiotic resistance could leave millions vulnerable to untreatable bugs within a generation. This could make even routine operations such as hip surgery deadly, said Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies. In an attempt to tackle the problem, GPs will be ordered to prescribe fewer antibiotics. While infections are becoming increasingly difficult to beat, no new class of antibiotic has been discovered since 1987. In contrast, a new infection emerges on an almost yearly basis. Dame Sally said the ‘catastrophic threat’ from infections resistant to frontline antibiotics is so serious that she has asked the Government to put antibiotic resistance on the national risk register – ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist attack or flu pandemic. ‘That is one way of getting central and cross-government action internationally,’ she said. ‘It should be [on the register] because this is a growing problem. And if we don’t get it right, we will find ourselves in a health system not dissimilar to the early 19th century at some point. ‘If we don’t act now, any one of us could go into hospital in 20 years for minor surgery and die because of an ordinary infection that can’t be treated by antibiotics. And routine operations like hip replacements or organ transplants could be deadly because of the risk of infection.’ Acknowledging that ‘global action’ must be taken, she said: ‘This is an international threat.’ In the past five years, the number of cases of blood poisoning from antimicrobial resistant (AMR) forms of E. coli – which is twice as fatal as the normal bug – has gone up 60 per cent. The drug-resistant gut bug alone, which is picked up in hospital in half of cases, could be responsible for up to 2,500 deaths in 2011 – more than MRSA and C. difficile combined. And a deadly strain of tuberculosis which cannot be dealt with by most treatments has trebled in Britain in little over a decade. Figures from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) show that instances of ‘multidrug resistant’ tuberculosis were 81 in 2011, up from just 28 in 2000, with around half of the patients dying. Warning: Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies has said that even routine operations such as hip surgery could become deadly due to growing antibiotic resistance . Cases of extensively-resistant TB, which resists almost all types of drugs, have also emerged in the UK, with 12 in the past two years – as many as in the previous 15 years. Another worrying trend is the rise in infections resistant to powerful antibiotics called carbapenems, the last line of treatment to tackle the most serious infections. Figures from the HPA show samples testing positive for resistance to the drug have gone up more than 250-fold in the past decade, from three in 2003 to 800 in 2012. Warning that ‘widespread’ AMR would be an ‘apocalyptic scenario’, Dame Sally has called for improved protection of our current stock of antibiotics, better incentives for the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs, and improved hygiene in hospitals. But with antibiotics liberally used in agriculture, and available over the counter in many countries, these efforts will be undermined without a united global effort. In 2010, infectious diseases accounted for 7 per cent of all deaths and 4 per cent of all potential years of life lost in England. They also lose the economy a staggering £30billion a year in direct costs to the NHS and indirect costs to industry in terms of lost work hours. Emeritus Professor Richard James, former director of the centre for healthcare associated infections at the University of Nottingham, called for ‘effective antibiotic stewardship to prevent the overuse/misuse of antibiotics’.","Dame Sally Davies warns over timebomb over antibiotic resistance .

"From a dainty pair of stiletto shoes to an electric guitar and even an innocuous jar of pickled cucumbers - these seemingly innocent objects are in fact the world's weirdest murder weapons. Photographer Ed James has compiled a striking collection of photos featuring 10 seemingly ordinary items that were all used in real-life murders. The 43-year-old says that the images are meant to unsettle and provoke and should make people uneasy yet curious. Well heeled: A 44-year-old Texas woman stabbed her boyfriend to death with a five-and-a-half-inch stiletto heel . He explained: 'This set of ten images show the strange and sometimes bizarre items that people have used to kill with. 'I wanted each item to be unusually lit and out of context to mirror the way that the killers used them. The work should make people uneasy yet intrigued.' Mr James says that although the subject is a dark one, he would like to think that the final images reflect the opposite of what the object was used for. He said he found an array of horrifying cases, but chose not to identify the names of the perpetrators. Instrument of death: A 33-year-old man used an electric guitar  to murder a 53-year-old Texas pastor in 2012 . Snack attack: A 16-year-old Ohio male murdered a 55-year-old man by smashing him over the head with a jar of pickled cucumbers . 'I did not want to use names as these were all real crimes I thought that a brief description of place, age & sex would be appropriate.' 'The objects are not the actual murder weapons that were used, I wanted to just use clean everyday objects & thought that this would best illustrate there bizarre use.

I just wanted to think of something that was not so commercial. So starting with the fact that most of what I do is still life based I thought of objects, then alternative ways to use objects whilst online I found some articles on murders that had been committed with 'strange' weapons. 'As I researched it I found more so decided to shoot a series on these bizarre murder weapons. I then photographed them in the studio. I wanted each object to be unusually lit and out of context to mirror the way that the killers used them.' Spoon: A 31-year-old man killed a 38-year-old man with a teaspoon in St Albans, England .

"The wife of a respected county judge claims her husband beat her unconscious - but no attorney in the Florida district would hear her case. Hillsborough Circuit Judge Eric Myers, who was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2000, was arrested at 2am on Saturday January 17 on suspicion of punching his wife Shirley Myers until she passed out in front of their five-year-old daughter at home in Tampa. But Mrs Myers said she couldn't get anybody to take on the domestic violence case against her 'well-respected' husband, who regularly hears abuse cases. Problem: Shirley Myers said nobody would take on the domestic violence case against her 'well-respected' husband after he allegedly beat her unconscious in their home in Tampa, Florida . Charged: Hillsborough Circuit Judge Eric Myers, appointed by Jeb Bush, was charged with domestic abuse . 'Some people had told me they didn't want to ruin their reputation of their firm, that they knew him, worked with him or they were scared,' Mrs Myers told a hearing in Tampa. 'No one from Hillsborough County was going to help me because Eric is part of Hillsborough County and they stick together.' Mrs Myers claims she was slapped and punched in the face with an open and closed fist on Friday January 16. She says her hair was pulled and she eventually passed out before waking to hear her daughter shout: 'Daddy stop hitting mommy.' Police reponded to a call early on Saturday January 17 and detained Judge Myers, who was released after posting $500 bail, The Tampa Bay Tribune reported. According to Chief Judge Ron Ficarrotta, Judge Myers, who was re-elected without opposition in 2014, was a former assistant state attorney with an 'outstanding reputation'. Mrs Myers claims her husband (pictured) slapped and punched her in the face with an open and closed fist . Arrested: Police responded to the call on January 17 and detained Judge Myers in the parking lot (pictured) But according to Mrs Myers, the first attorney she approached, Julia Chase, spent 40 minutes on the phone trying to dissuade her. Chase is now representing Judge Myers. Trying to get Chase pulled from the case, Mrs Myers told a court on Friday: '[Chase said] just think about it, [that] she knows Eric, that everybody has a moment. 'She told me she would hold it until Sunday so I could take some time.' Chase rebutted: 'She testified to things that never came out of my mouth, which makes me think that either she's confused or she's trying to eliminate attorneys as a pre-emptive strike.' A judge dismissed Mrs Myers' motion. Mrs Myers' attorney Alberto Ayo told Fox 13: 'This courage that our client had to come out and talk about these very private facts should be an example for our society. 'There are many woman who endure this abuse in silence and that should not occur.' The couple have filed for divorce and the case is ongoing.","Hillsborough Circuit Judge Eric Myers has an 'outstanding reputation'

"Freed to kill again: Convicted murderer Andrew Dawson called himself the 'Angel of Mercy' and butchered two neighbours after getting a life sentence for a 1981 killing . Five convicted killers released from jail have murdered again in the past four years, some just weeks after leaving custody, it was revealed today. Andrew Dawson, George Johnson, Ernest Wright, David Cook and . Desmond Lee were only given 'whole life' sentences after committing murder for the second time. The families of their victims said today 'life should mean life'. Even some relatives of the killers believe that their family-member should never have been released the first time round. Convicted murderer Andrew Dawson branded himself the 'Angel of Mercy' after a series of murders. He was given a life . sentence in 1982 after admitting the murder of a 91-year-old Henry Walsh in his . flat at Ormskirk, Lancashire, stabbing him a dozen times with bread knife. Within weeks of his release in 2010, he . stabbed defenceless John Matthews and Paul Hancock to death in separate . attacks, before leaving their bodies in their bathtubs in Derby. The 51-year-old told police he felt an 'urge to kill' before knocking on the . men's doors in the block of flats, where he also lived, and hacked them to death. Dawson then . wrote a rambling note to police confessing to one of the killings which . he signed: 'Yours, the Angel of Mercy'. Murder scene: Dawson savagely attacked John Matthews and Paul Hancock in the block of flats that they shared with him, pictured, and then dumped their bodies in bathtubs . His own brother Malcolm told The Sun: 'My brother was clever and hoodwinked those in charge that he was no threat. But he was evil. Cold blooded: George Johnson battered to death an 89-year-old widow after being released from jail after a sadistic murder in 1986 . 'If . you kill you should be locked up forever, no question. My brother never . apologised for what he did — he was just sorry he got caught'. George Johnson murdered Gerald Homer in 1986 for just £3, forcing him to strip naked before hacking him to death, inflicting 35 wounds using knives and scissors in Wolverhampton. He was freed in 2006 and five years later he battered to death 89-year-old widow Florence Habesch for £25 as she made a cup of tea. His attack was delivered with such force he caved in her skull. His first victim's sister Eileen Dawson, 64, told The Sun today: 'Life should mean life, not just 15 or 20 . years. If someone takes someone else's life, then why should they have . their own?' Her husband Vincent, 63, added: 'It isn't right. If . life meant life then that old lady would be still alive today'. Pensioner David Cook, 65, of Rhymney, South Wales, beat neighbour Leonard Hill, . 64, senseless before throttling him with a TV flex in 2011. Cook carried out the violent killing when next-door neighbour Mr Hill paid him a visit. Afterwards Cook ransacked his neighbour’s bungalow, stealing his wallet before going to a nearby pub for a drink with locals. The murder was chillingly similar to the strangulation of Sunday school teacher Beryl Maynard, which he did in 1987. Cook then used a dressing gown cord and 'strangled her and killed her', his trial heard. Killed again: Pensioner David Cook, 65, left, beat neighbour Leonard Hill, 64, right, senseless before throttling him with a TV flex in 2011 - 25 years after his first murder . Murdered: Victim Beryl Maynard (right), with her husband Roger and their two children, was strangled with a dressing gown cord in 1987 by David Cook . 'Evil and dangerous' Desmond Lee killed his lover Christopher Pratt, before dumping his body in 2009. Lee killed his lover by breaking his voice box and a bone in his neck. The . body was still in his flat when he stole Mr Pratt’s credit and debit . cards, paid off a phone bill, bought booze for a party with neighbours, . ordered more than £200-worth of food from Asda and attempted to buy . £1,181-worth of goods from Argos. Lee . killed him while out on licence, having spent nearly 14 . years in jail for the murder of Bradford woman Shirley Carr in 1989. He suffocated Mrs Carr, who was his landlady, in November 1989 after she taunted him over the breakdown of a relationship. Lee was jailed for life in 1990 but released on licence in 2004. Twice jailed: 'Evil and dangerous' Desmond Lee killed his lover Christopher Pratt, before dumping his body in 2009, 20 years after he throttled and killed his landlady . In 2010 pensioner Ernest Wright was told he would spend . the rest of his life behind bars after carrying out a shotgun execution . 38 years after murdering another man . The 70-year-old had served 26 years in prison for a 1971 killing when he was freed on life licence in 1999. Career criminal: Pensioner killer Ernest gunned a man down 38 years after his first murder . Despite his release he continued to mix in criminal circles and carried out several night-time burglaries, police said. Then, in March three years ago, he gunned down Neville Corby, 42, after bursting into his home in Bradford, West Yorkshire. Wearing . a balaclava he twice reloaded his shotgun as he fired six shots at Mr . Corby and his intended target, Craig Freear, 31, whom he had a . long-standing feud with. He was jailed in 1973 after beating Trevor . Hale to death with an iron bar in Aylesbury, then trying to burn his . body in a shallow grave. All the five killers were ready for freedom by parole boards, but . then murdered again, often in similar ways to their first homicide. David Cameron is known to back 'whole life' terms for murderers, but Eurocrats fight them in Strasbourg because they believe they breach the offenders' human rights and are 'inhumane'. Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'Reoffending has been too high for . too long and we are introducing significant reforms to the way offenders . are rehabilitated and managed in the community. 'From 2015 all . prisoners will for the first time receive a minimum 12 months' supervision on release and GPS satellite tags will also allow us to keep . a much closer eye on them. 'Our changes will see the best of the voluntary, public and private sector working together to cut reoffending.' It came as it was revealed that one in seven murders in Britain is committed by suspects freed on bail while awaiting trial for other crimes. Last year 56 murders – more than one a week and a shocking 37 per cent rise on 2011 – were carried out by people bailed by the courts. If they had been remanded in  custody, the victims’ lives may have been saved.","Andrew Dawson, George Johnson, Ernest Wright, David Cook and .

"A hitman who led a shootout in Peru during which a policeman and a rival gang member were killed and two others were injured has been revealed as a 12-year-old boy. Police say Nabil Blanco Cerda is the youngest hitman who has ever been arrested in the country after he was held along with alleged teenage accomplices in Chincha, in the country's Ica region. He was said to be part of a gang that opened fire in a café, killing a rival gangster and injuring two others, then cutting down a policeman in a hail of bullets as they made their escape. Under arrest: Alleged members of the gang which included a 12-year-old hitman are searched after their arrest by Peru's Criminal Investigation Department in the town of Chincha, in the country's Ica region . Agents of Peru's elite Criminal Investigation Department, the Latin American nation's equivalent of the FBI, finally arrested the gang in an armed raid on Sunday. The youngster, together with two 16-year-olds and a number of adults, had allegedly been recruited by Edwin Lopez Gabriel, a mob leader known as 'Loco Peluza', as part of a mafia-style extortion ring. Police say that Gabriel had set up a trade union in order to cover his criminal activities and had used the gang to intimidate businessmen into paying protection money and to wipe out rivals. Operating under the guise of the Civil Construction union, they are said to have stalked the streets of Chincha dealing drugs and extorting cash in a reign of terror which has been linked to four other killings and more than 30 assaults. 'For months [Gabriel] covered up his crimes by pretending to be union leader,' said one of the officers who caught him. In total, 16 people were arrested by police who said they were shocked to find that the gang's hit squad was led by the 12-year-old, who would act as the enforcer while collecting illegal taxes. The discovery of such a young boy involved in violent crime in the country raises the spectre of Brazilian-style gang warfare, in which the youths of that country's ghettoes are enlisted into gangs, sometimes before reaching adolescence. The film City of God gives a fictionalised account of the kinds of violence that the Brazilian favelas have become notorious for. City Of God: The arrest of such a young boy on suspicion of involvement in violent crime and murder raises the spectre of Brazilian-style ghetto violence in Peru . The beginning of the end for the gang came with the March 2 shootout at a Chincha cafe. Members opened fire, killing former convict Miguel Santillan Reymundo, 32, and injuring Marvin Fajardo and Cecilia Sánchez Velásquez Dianderas. Minutes later they shot police Lieutenant Eric Lévano Castilla, 29, six times as he tried to arrest them. A Criminal Investigation Department spokesman said that, along with alleged ringleader Gabriel and the three minors police arrested Roberto Parra Belleza, José Llerena Enríquez, Elvis Medina Bernaola, Jhonatan Asencio Llancari, Miguel Romero Palla, Víctor Tasayco Talla, Ciro Páucar Martínez, Samir Roberto Falla, Steven Moreno Ramos, Luis Cárdenas Chacón y Néstor Echegaray Guillén on suspicion of involvement in the gang.","Boy said to have been part of a gang that opened fire in a Peruvian café .

"Victim: An autopsy report has revealed 50-year-old Wayne A. Jones (pictured) died last year after being shot 23 times by five police officers in Martinsburg, Virginia . A mentally ill man who stabbed a police officer with a pocket knife was fatally shot 23 times by five cops as he lay on the ground. An autopsy report shows Wayne A. Jones, 50, died as a result of multiple gunshot . wounds to his brain, heart, . lungs, liver, kidney and stomach, following the violent shootout in Martinsburg, Virginia, in March 2013. Although the schizophrenic man's death was ruled a homicide, Berkeley County grand jury in October did not indict the officers who shot him. Now the Stephens City man's brothers are suing the city for $200 million in damages on behalf of Jones' estate, claiming the 'rogue' officers used unreasonable and excessive force. The family’s lawyer, Sherman L. Lambert Sr., filed a copy of the autopsy report in federal court in Martinsburg on Tuesday. He also filed an amended lawsuit that adds the officers as defendants. The filing came less than a week after Magistrate James E. Seibert ordered the release of the medical examiner’s findings and a report by West Virginia State Police, which investigated the shooting. Herald Mail Media reported the five defendants in the wrongful death lawsuit are Erik Herb, Paul Lehman, Eric Neely, Daniel North and William Staub. According to the amended complaint, the officers shot at Jones as he tried to get to his feet after he stabbed a cop in the torso with a pocket knife. It was later revealed the wound was so minor, the officer didn't need medical treatment. Lehman was the first officer to encounter Jones and fired his gun eight times. This was followed by Herb's five, Neely's four, Staub's three and North's two. The officers were armed with Sig Sauer .45-caliber handguns that hold nine rounds in the magazine. Taking action: Jones' family members (pictured sitting) are suing the city of Martinsburg, Virginia for $200 million in damages, with the family's lawyer, Sherman L. Lambert Sr., filing a copy of the autopsy report on Tuesday . After the shooting occurred, Martinsburg . police admitted they used projectile stun guns twice on Jones, which . had little effect, and shot him. The lawsuit also claimed Jones' body was left in a pool of blood for four hours before he was moved. According to the lawsuit, the actions of the officers prove that they are 'rogue' and should be disciplined and closely monitored. The complaint also states that, although the officers were placed on administrative leave following the shooting, they were given various maintenance jobs and trained for other positions at the department. The police department have not commented publicly on the matter. Jones’ estate is administered by his brothers, Robert L. Jones and Bruce A. Jones of Winchester, Virginia. A jury trial is set for October 28, 2014. Jones' brothers had battled the state medical examiner’s office for a copy of the autopsy, which the office initially declined to provide because it involved a homicide.

"Luftwaffe pilot Oberleutnant Horst von der Groeben was killed when his bomber crashed into the shore near Whitstable . A campaign has been launched to move the bodies of two Luftwaffe pilots to a German war cemetery after their single, unmarked grave was discovered 72 years on. The airmen were buried in the same grave in a Kent churchyard after their two bombers were shot down during a raid on London in August 1940. Three days later another German bomber crashed in the area, resulting in the remains of four men to be buried in one coffin on top of the other two men. More than 20 years later the German . War Graves Service had the remains of all its servicemen killed in . Britain in World War Two exhumed, and interred at the Cannock Chase . German Military Cemetery, in Staffordshire. But the two airmen - Oberleutnant . Horst von der Groeben and Oberleutnant Gerhard Muller - were left behind . as it was not realised their coffins lay underneath the top one. They have remained in the unmarked grave in Whitstable cemetery ever since. Two local historians have now . unravelled the macabre mystery and have identified the unknown airmen . through their identity disc numbers. After realising their names were not . on the Cannock Chase Memorial, Joe Potter and Andy Saunders researched . local records and archives and were able to pinpoint them to 'War Grave . Number 1' at Whitstable. Now the family of Oblt von der . Groeben, the two historians and the Whitstable Royal British Legion are . calling on the authorities to move the bodies to Cannock Chase. Mr Potter said: 'It is a rather bizarre and macabre mystery. 'In 1962 the exhumation team did not realise the graves of another two men lay underneath. 'Although the local records, which . still exist today, show 11 German airmen were buried at Whitstable in . August 1940, only nine were relocated to Cannock. 'Whitstable council should have informed the Germans about the burials of these two men after the war but didn't. 'As a result the two men have . remained forgotten and unidentified in a scruffy grave that is just a . patch of grass with no headstone on. Von der Groeben and his fellow airman Gerhard Muller were buried in this plot at a churchyard in . Whitstable,  but the coffins of other German servicemen were placed on top so when the bodies were exhumed 20 years later they were left behind . 'While . there is an argument for letting the men rest in peace where they were . originally buried it would be fitting for them to join their fallen . comrades at Cannock and be added to the official roll of honour there. 'But it is down to the German War Graves Service to organise and finance.'Historian and author Mr Saunders said: 'I researched this story, with Joe Potter, for my book 'Finding The Foe'. 'I . would be happy to kick-start a fund to help get these men properly . buried under named headstones at the German Military Cemetery.' Horst von Weitershausen, the nephew . of Oblt von der Groeben, said: 'Myself and my two brothers want to move . his grave from Whitstable to Cannock.' In August 1940, Britain faced the real prospect of invasion from the Nazis. During . the height of the Battle of Britain Hitler sent wave and wave of . bombers to attack strategic military targets across south east of . England. On . August 13 a squadron of Dornier 17 bombers found themselves on a doomed . raid as a communication error meant they had no fighter escorts. Downed: The wreckage of Oberleutnant Horst von der Groeben's crashed bomber on Whitstable beach after it was shot down during a raid on London in August 1940 . Blitz raid: The airmen's Dornier 17 bomber was one of five shot down by RAF Hurricanes on August 13, 1940 . Oberleutnant Gerhard Muller's body is carried away from the mudflats . near Seasalter, Whitstable. He had bailed out but was killed after his . parachute failed to open . After bombing coastal targets the planes came under fierce attack by RAF Hurricanes, resulting in five of them being shot down. Oblt Muller was killed after he bailed out of his plane over Seasalter, near Whitstable, and his parachute failed to open. The body of Oblt von der Groeben was washed up at Whitstable after his crashed on the shoreline there. From their identity numbers, they were recorded as being buried at Whitstable on August 17 in the deep grave. The Whitstable branch of the Royal British Legion is in contact with the German embassy in London with a view of getting the process of relocation started. It is thought a fee of about 3,000 pounds will be required to cover the cost of the exhumation and reburial.","Nazi airmen's Dornier bomber was shot down by Hurricanes over Kent during a Blitz raid in 1940 .

"A heartbroken dog whose owner died two months ago is missing her so much he is attending services at the Italian church where her funeral was held patiently waiting for her to return. Loyal Tommy, a seven-year-old German Shepherd, belonged to Maria Margherita Lochi, 57, and had been her faithful companion after she adopted him when she found him abandoned in fields close to her home. Mrs Lochi adopted several strays she found but friends said she developed a particular close affection for Tommy and would walk to church with him from her home every day - where the priest would allow him to sit patiently by her feet. Pining: Tommy the German Shepherd waits faithfully during Mass at the church where his owner Maria Margherita Lochi's funeral was held . Following her death at San Donaci near Brindisi, a funeral service was held at which Tommy joined mourners and since then he has been a regular at the church arriving on time when the bells ring out to mark the start of services. Father Donato Panna said:''He's there every time I celebrate Mass and is very well behaved - he doesn't make a sound, I've not heard one bark from him in all the time he has been coming in. 'He used to come to Mass with Maria and he was obviously devoted to her - I let him stay inside as he was always so well behaved and none of the other parishoners ever complained to me. 'He's still coming to Mass even after Maria's funeral, he waits patiently by the side of the altar and just sits there quietly. I didn't have the heart to throw him out - I've just recently lost my own dog so I leave him there until Mass finishes and then I let him out. Sad: Heartbroken Tommy, a seven year old German shepherd, had been adopted by Maria Margherita Lochi, 57, after she found him wandering fields behind her house in San Donaci near Brindisi, Italy . Routine: Tommy and Maria would walk to church together every day - where the priest would allow him to sit patiently by her feet . 'Tommy's been adopted by everyone in the village now and he is everybody's friend. Everyone looks out for him and leaves food for him - although it would be nice to find a proper home for him.' The story of Tommy is similar to the 2009 Hollywood blockbuster Hachi starring Richard Gere which told of how a faithful Akita dog waits patiently for his master after he also dies. It was based on the true story of a Japanese Akita called Hachiko, whose owner died in 1925 but for the next nine years he waited patiently at a railway station for his owner from where they regularly caught a train.","Tommy, a German shepherd, had been adopted by Maria Lochi as a stray .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be welcoming their second baby in April 2015, Kensington Palace has confirmed. Kate's pregnancy was announced last month but the due date had not been released until now. In a statement, the palace said the 32-year-old Duchess, who is around fourteen weeks pregnant, continued to suffer from extreme morning sickness but her condition was 'steadily improving'. Scroll down for video . Spring baby: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be welcoming their second baby in April 2015, Kensington Palace has confirmed . The pregnant Duchess will make her first public appearance on Tuesday where she will join Prince William to officially welcome Singapore's President Tony Tan as he begins a four-day visit to the UK. The royal couple's second baby will be fourth in line to the throne, behind one-year-old Prince George, who was born in July last year. Kate recently took refuge with her parents while she was 'struggling terribly' with her debilitating antenatal sickness. The royal retreated to her family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, last week with her son, Prince George. Sources said the Duchess 'hasn't been at all well' as she battles hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting in expectant mothers. Illness: Kate, 32, is around fourteen weeks pregnant with her second child, and has taken refuge with her parents and Prince George due to her antenatal sickness . Her mother Carole Middleton has apparently helped to take charge of her recovery and has been researching alternative sickness cures, such as herbal tea, on the internet. And despite the presence of Spanish nanny Maria Borallo, Mrs Middleton has also been taking George off her daughter's hands. She has been seen in local shops with her 15-month-old grandson, prompting one startled assistant to write on Twitter: 'Served Kate Middleton's mum and Prince George today at work. He is gorgeous!' The Duchess says she feels far more relaxed at the Middleton family's £5million Georgian mansion, Bucklebury Manor, than at Kensington Palace. Baby number two: Kate was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with George . One source told the Mail: 'Kate is feeling so lousy that she just wanted to be with her family and out of public view. 'She is extremely close to Carole, who is very much a hands-on grandmother. Between her and their nanny, Maria, Kate has all the help she needs with George while she is feeling so sick. 'And Bucklebury is somewhere she can just relax and be herself.' The Duchess – who has now returned to London – has not been seen in public since palace officials were forced to announce her pregnancy last month, several weeks earlier than intended due to her sickness. Kate was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and severe dehydration during her first pregnancy with George. But doctors have been better prepared this time and may, some medical experts have suggested, even have treated her with a drip at home. A source added: 'Don't be fooled by the fact that she hasn't been admitted to hospital this time. She is just as poorly. The difference is that her doctors have been able to diagnose and treat her quicker. She really hasn't been at all well, though.' The Duchess was forced to cancel her first solo overseas visit – a trip to Malta – last month because of the severity of her condition. Last fortnight she also reluctantly cancelled a visit to a project by The Art Room in London and several other forthcoming engagements have now been scratched out of her diary. Caitlin Dean, of the charity Pregnancy Sickness Support, said: 'Hyperemesis gravidarum is not morning sickness. It is a chronic and debilitating condition that can cause sufferers to vomit up to 30 times a day.' Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies. The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. It causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis. It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers. The severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences. They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week. It can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food. Hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat. Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated. Treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition. An intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice. The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage.","Kensington Palace confirmed news today .

"What do Barack Obama, Thomas Jefferson, George W. Bush and the other past U.S. presidents have in common? Besides holding the coveted title of commander-in-chief, it appears that all of them but one are cousins. The remarkable discovery was made by 12-year-old BridgeAnne d’Avignon, of Salinas, California, who created a ground-breaking family tree that connected 42 of 43 U.S. presidents to one common, and rather unexpected, ancestor: King John of England. ‘They all have the trait of wanting power,’ d’Avignon told the station WFMY. Budding genealogist: BridgeAnne d'Avignon created a family tree that connected 42 of 43 U.S. presidents to one common ancestor . History detective: It took d'Avignon several months to search through more than 500,000 names and trace the male and female lineages of American leaders . King John, also known as John ‘Lackland’, is renowned for signing the Magna Carta in 1215, which limited the monarch’s power and helped form the British Parliament. John’s other claim to fame, or infamy, is that he was depicted as the villain in the Robin Hood tales. Common grandfather: The 12-year-old traced the lineages of nearly all of the U.S. presidents to King John, the signer of the Magna Carta . D’Avignon, a seventh-grader at Monte Vista Christian School in Watsonville, started the project in hopes of tracing back her own bloodline in France, but somewhere along the way she decided to take her genealogical quest to the highest level. In order to create the family tree, the 12-year-old spent months scouring through over 500,000 names in search of the ‘presidential Adam.’ Her 80-year-old grandfather, who has been tracing roots for nearly six decades, helped her make the presidential links. D’Avignon started with the first U.S. president, George Washington, she traced both the male and female family lines to make the connection. Prior to d’Avignon’s discovery, genealogists were only able to link 22 families of presidents, likely because they only focused on male bloodlines. The only former commander-in-chief not linked to King John is the eighth president, Martin Van Buren, who had Dutch roots. The teen also found out that she is the . 18th cousin of President Obama. She even wrote to her new-found relative . a letter to share her findings with him. So far, however, d’Avignon said she received only a generic response from the White House. Odd man out: Only the eighth president of the U.S., Martin Van Buren, was not related to King John because he had Dutch roots . D’Avignon created a poster of the presidential family tree and is selling signed copies of it in hopes of raising enough money to make a trip to Washington DC. The middle-school student says her goal is to hand-deliver a replica of her family tree to the president. 'I think we just all go back somewhere; it’s just a matter of proving it,' she said. Powerful relative: D'Avignon discovered that she is the 18th cousin of President Obama .","12-year-old girl created family tree linking 42 of 43 U.S. presidents to King John of England, who signed Magna Carta in 1215 .

"Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has proposed 'M.A.S.H-style' units to fight the Ebola threat, despite specialised medical response teams already existing in Australia, saying that the Federal government has not responded appropriately to the outbreak. Senator Lambie has announced a five point 'action plan' to fight the deadly virus, which has killed thousands in Africa and has started infiltrating Western countries, 'in order to restore confidence and public trust' in the government. 'Mr Abbott has bungled the response to the Ebola threat from the start and is guilty of being complacent,' said Senator Lambie. 'If any public hysteria or panic develops, it will be because the average Australian has found that the Abbott government has been untrustworthy and dysfunctional in their management of this serious and unprecedented threat to our public health.' Scroll down for video . Senator Lambie has called for MASH style units to fight the Ebola threat . The Ebola virus could infect 10,000 people a week by the end of the year, according to the World Health Organisation . The American TV show series M*A*S*H popularised the work of Mobile Army Surgical Hospital workers . The plan includes making travel to and from all African countries illegal, and boosting custom's resources to install thermal imaging at airports to ensure that all overseas arrivals are scanned for symptoms of Ebola. The points also include establishing quarantine facilities and dedicated Ebola treatment areas, and establishing a medical research unit for Ebola and other deadly diseases to engage in and contribute to world research. The outspoken Tasmanian senator has further proposed establishing specialist medical teams in conjunction with the Australian Defense Force capable of domestic and international deployment, which she said will be 'similar in organisational structure to MASH teams of Vietnam era'. These suggestions have been deemed unfounded by a senior doctor, who notes that such teams already exist in Australia. Dr Steve Parnis, the Vice President of the Australian Medical Association, told Daily Mail Australia there was no need for them to be implemented. 'We have those teams. They're called AUSMAT teams,' he said. 'These are civilian teams, doctors, nurses, people with logistical expertise. 'The question is whether the existing services will be deployed by government and whether they have the manpower.' The work of Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals were popularised in the early 1970's by the airing of US television series M*A*S*H, which ran for 11 years. The series, though set during the Korean War, commented on conditions and actions from the Korean War and while often viewed as an unconventional sitcom, often raised the role of the US as both war-maker and peacemaker. The show centered around the work of Hawkeye (Alan Alder), Father Mulcahy (William Christopher), Margaret 'Hot Lips' Houlihan (Loretta Swit), and Maxwell Q. Klinger (Jamie Farr). Australia's equivalent to the Mobile Hospitals,AUSMAT, is based in Darwin and consists of doctors, nurses, firefighters and allied health staff. AUSMAT teams have been involved in responding to many natural disasters and international crisis,  including deployment to the Philippines when Typhoon Haiyan struck in November 2013. 'There's certainly no need to set up anything new,' Dr Parnis said, adding that Australia has good public health resources. A spokesman for Senator Lambie disagreed, saying there was a need for a specific Ebola unit for volunteer medical professionals. Senator Lambie is one of the most outspoken new senators . Alan Alda and others were stars of M*A*S*H, the program which made popular the work of mobile surgical hospital workers during the Korean War . 'You don't want to degrade the other resources you have for natural disasters, because obviously, these are going to have to be specialist teams,' he said. Health Minister Peter Dutton tried to tamp down fears Ebola would reach Australia on Friday, saying the nation remains at very low risk. Earlier this week the World Health Organisation warned infections from the deadly virus could hit 10,000 infections a week by the end of the year. The ABC reported the government has been screening passengers from West Africa since August. Senator Lambie's plan also proposed banning travel from Ebola-stricken countries and for thermal imaging to be installed at airports.","Outspoken senator calls for 'MASH style' units to fight Ebola .

"'When we hear the term missing . persons, most people conjure up images of Chandra Levy, Caylee Anthony . or Natalee Holloway,' says charity . 40 per cent of all missing persons are black . A renewed campaign to highlight hundreds of missing African-American women has been launched amid ongoing criticism that less attention is given to their cases by authorities and the media. According to the National Crime Information Center, nearly 40 per cent . of those who have disappeared, often in suspicious circumstances, are black. However critics allege that public . attention mainly focuses on white women who have vanished. According to the Black And Missing Foundation, most women disappear in the states of New York, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland and Florida. Vanished: Phoenix Coldon, 23, of St Louis (left) disappeared on December 18 while Stacey English (right) was last seen on Christmas Day. Both women's cars were found with the engine running . A total of 273,985 minorities . were reported missing in the United . States (out of 692,944 for all . races) as of December 2010. The foundation has . teamed up with a TV network to make a series, Find Our Missing, telling the stories behind the women's disappearances. The non-profit organization was formed in 2008 to . draw attention to cases and keep pressure on authorities when leads and information dry up. The Black And Missing . Foundation told MailOnline there are a number of reasons as to why the cases of missing . black women are largely forgotten. Firstly, the organisation points out . that there is often a lack of diversity in newsrooms meaning the . African-American community is not properly reflected in coverage. Not forgotten: Ashani Creighton, now 19, (left) was abducted by her grandparents from Orlando in 1998 while Sharaun Cole, now 41, (right) was last seen outside her New York home in 1983 but few details are known about her disappearance. These photos have been doctored to show the ageing process . Another key reason is that missing . persons from a lower economic status are often associated with some sort . of criminal activity. Behind the hundreds of cases are . painful details sketched out by families, left wondering what has become . of their loved ones. Many women have been missing for decades. In two incidents at the end of last . year, a chilling connection was made between two missing women - 500 . miles apart -  discovered in part because of the attention charities . brought to their cases. Phoenix Coldon, 23, of St Louis, Missouri, went missing on December 18 while Stacey English, 36, vanished in Atlanta, Georgia on Christmas Day 2011. Remember me: The FBI's National Centre for Missing Persons reports that almost 40 per cent of those missing are African-American . Startling: A total of 273,985 minorities were reported missing in the United States, according to the FBI in 2010  - this is the percentage breakdown  based on race . The cars of both women were abandoned with the engine running and the keys in the ignition. In both cases the cars were impounded, a fact that police in both cities . did not realize until several days into the investigations. Miss Coldon's mother Goldia Coldon said at the time that the fact both women were African-American had not gone unnoticed. A separate non-profit group, Black And Missing But Not Forgotten had also picked up on the cases. There were other heartbreaking cases where . years have passed without any clues to where the women have gone, . leaving anguished families with little hope of closure. Arnika Miller, now aged 33, disappeared on August 21, 2010 from Topeka, Kansas. Before she went missing, it is alleged that Miss Miller told a co-worker that her boyfriend and his friends had assaulted her and stolen her identification and money and that she was afraid of them. She had duel citizenship with Canada. Her family are deeply concerned for her safety as she is an insulin-dependent diabetic and she may have had a broken leg. Her last sighting was unknown. Asia Nicole Martin, now 26, was last seen on May 27, 2005 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. She told her roommate that she was going for a walk at 8.40pm and never came home. The student bought a bus ticket to visit her mother in Denver but never boarded it. Her roommate said that she was acting normally when she left, but her family are concerned that something may have happened to her as it was unusual for her not to contact them and she has an unspecified medical condition. Tilawna Cheatham, now 31, disappeared on August 11, 1989 when she was nine years old in Aiken, South Carolina. Her photo has been age progressed to show what she would look like, aged 27. The girl was last seen after she argued with her mother, took spare change from a jar and left home. Two neighbours spotted the girl at 5.30pm at a convenience store a few blocks from her house. Latoria Renae McClarin, 27, went missing on November 1 from Goldsboro, North Carolina. She left her house with a man, identified as Ray, and told her family she would be right back. Ray is believed to be an acquaintance from the city of Wilson in the state but Miss McClarin's family don't know anything else about him. She does not have medication that she needs with her. Ashani . Karin Creighton, who would now be 19, was last seen by her mother in . Orlando, Florida after being initially abducted by her grandparents, Ernest S. Jackson and Kaia Jackson in 1998. It is time for all people - regardless of race - to be treated equally in their times of greatest need. Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black And Missing Foundation . The . grandparents were taken into custody in 2000. Miss Creighton is feared dead . but what happened to the teenager is still unknown. In the case of Sharon Davis, now 61, . who has been missing for eleven years, she was last seen at 7am on June . 13 after being dropped off by her daughter in a Dallas parking lot. She had said she was going home to . change her clothes for a meeting but her van was later found abandoned. The vehicle had a broken window and was wiped clean of fingerprints. Her two children alleged that Ms . Davis's husband may know more about her disappearance as she  had filed . for divorce two days before she was last seen. Natalie Wilson, co-founder of the Black And Missing Foundation, told ABC: 'When we hear the term ''missing . persons'', most people conjure up images of Chandra Levy, Caylee Anthony . or Natalee Holloway. 'As a result, the public is misled in . believing that victims of abductions and kidnappings are [all] blonde, . blue-eyed and female.' Still out there? Shandell McLeod (l), 35, was last seen on October 1 in Lithonia, Georgia - her family fear her life is in danger. Sharon Davis vanished in 2001 after her van was found abandoned in a Dallas parking lot . In danger: Sharnecia Monique Frazier (l) has been missing since 2005 and would now be 22 - she was last seen in Montgomery, Alabama. Sheila Hughes was nine months pregnant when she vanished in Aliceville, Alabama in 2000 . Ms Wilson added: 'It is time for all people - regardless of race - to be treated equally in their times of greatest need.'

Back on land, a bashful bear has been showing the happy go lucky false killer whale a thing or two about modesty. The coy cub tried to hide from the camera after a hard day posing for pictures in  Kamchatka, Russia. Camera shy: The bear had been happy to pose for pictures, left, before deciding enough was enough, right . Gone fishing: The striking animal showed that he is as good a hunter in water as he is on dry land . Photographer Yury Sorokin, 30, from Moscow, who spent the day watching the playful bear, was just metres away when the camera shy bear closed his eyes and covered his face with his paw. He said: 'The bear was fishing for red salmon in the lake and after eating a substantial dinner decided to have a rest in the sun. 'I think it was at that point that he decided enough was enough. He'd hardly paid any attention to me all day but once he'd exhausted himself and filled his belly I guess he just wanted to relax on his own without me taking pictures. 'I was overwhelmed with different emotions at the time, when I first spotted him I feared for my life but by the end of the day we had become quite close. What's so funny? This chuckling cheetah looks like he was having a laugh in the hot Kenyan sun . 'All of the time I was looking through my viewfinder because I didn't want to miss a shot. I guess he just got tired of posing in the end.' In Masai Mara, Kenya, a cheeky cheetah grabbed photographer Callie De Wet's attention as the big cat was spotted chuckling to himself. Such laughable behaviour, which Mr De Wet spied through his lens, is more fitting of a hyena then a cheetah . He said: 'I was snapping away at a family of cheetahs basking in the sun, when I spotted this one laughing away to himself.'","False killer whale gets its name from striking resemblance to killer whale .

"Sir Cliff Richard pictured in Portugal this summer, the first sighting of him after police raided his home. He is now preparing to sue BBC over its coverage . Sir Cliff Richard is preparing to sue the BBC over its controversial live TV coverage of the police raid on his home. The singer will seek damages for breach of privacy if, as he expects, he is not charged over an allegation of historic sexual abuse. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Sir Cliff is also considering legal action against South Yorkshire Police. The force struck a deal with the Corporation to film the swoop on his £3 million penthouse. In August the BBC faced an avalanche of criticism from leading lawyers, celebrities and politicians after it dispatched a helicopter to hover over the Berkshire property and stationed reporters at its gates before police had even arrived. Cameramen in the air were able to zoom in on officers through the windows as they searched through belongings. Sir Cliff, who vigorously denies any wrongdoing and has not been arrested, was in Portugal at the time. ‘No citizen should have to watch on live television their home being raided in this way,’ concluded a blistering Home Affairs Select Committee report. Sir Cliff’s lawyer Gideon Benaim denounced the ‘premature and disproportionate’ reporting which caused the veteran entertainment ‘immeasurable harm’. Friends say Sir Cliff is now determined to launch a concerted fightback. As his association with the BBC goes back to the start of his career – he appeared on Juke Box Jury in 1961 and on the first episode of Top Of The Pops in 1964 – legal action is likely to cause acute embarrassment. The singer was said to be dismayed to learn of the extent of co-operation between South Yorkshire Police and the BBC in the weeks leading up to the raid. As the Home Affairs Select Committee noted last month, not only did the force give the broadcaster the date of the search, it also ‘handed over a great deal of information freely’. This newspaper can disclose that emails, text messages and other documents given to the committee show that the BBC: . One legal expert said last night that the level of intrusion meant Sir Cliff would have a ‘strong case’ and added that the BBC would struggle to mount a public interest defence. The police investigation began when a man, now in his 40s, came forward earlier this year to claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted him during a Christian rally in Sheffield organised by Billy Graham, the American evangelist, in 1985. The BBC were able to capture images of police arriving at the property as they received advanced notice of the raid and sent a helicopter to hover overhead, . Hundreds of politicians, celebrities and lawyers complained over the BBC's coverage - which showed police officers going room-to-room (pictured) - saying it made the singer look guilty . The BBC’s Johnson first contacted South Yorkshire Police about the allegation in mid-July and spoke to Carrie Goodwin, head of corporate communications. In a letter, Goodwin recalled that Johnson was able to ‘detail the allegation, accurately and the location the allegation related to. 'Specifically he spoke about a boy aged between 11 and 14 alleging that he had been taken to a room... where he was made to carry out a sexual act.’ A month before the raid, Goodwin sent Johnson an email asking if he would like her to ‘set something up with the officer in the celebrity case’. He replies: ‘That would be fab.’ Notes from the meeting show that Johnson asked if the BBC could accompany officers during the search of Sir Cliff’s home. Unsurprisingly, the request was turned down. However, fearing Johnson was about to break the story prematurely, police felt they had no choice but to deal with him and agreed to give him advance notice of the raid. In fact the head of the investigation, Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick would later say the force had been ‘effectively blackmailed’. Over the next few weeks, dozens of emails and texts were exchanged between the force and the reporter. In one email, on July 18, Johnson asked if the BBC could speak to the alleged victim. He said he was worried the alleged victim might tip off other media about the raid. He asked Goodwin: ‘I don’t know how closely you’re keeping him updated on progress and plans. I wouldn’t want him becoming aware of progress through our interest, prompting him to...alert other media’. BBC reporter David Sillito speaks to camera as cars leave Sir Cliff's house. The BBC coverage of the raid was the first time the musician was aware of the police sting . South Yorkshire Police say they were given no choice but to hand details of the raid to Dan Johnson, for fear that he would reveal the operation ahead of time . Carrie Goodwin, press chief for the force, messaged Mr Johnson a month ahead of the raid asking whether she should ‘set something up with the officer in the celebrity case’. He replied: ‘That would be fab.’ Goodwin responded that the ‘complainant is being kept up to date to an extent but I’ll make the team aware of your concerns’. At this point she warns Johnson that the inquiry isn’t ‘progressing as quickly as thought’ because ‘there doesn’t seem to be a UK address’. It might mean, she adds, that officers will ‘need to go and try one of the foreign ones [Cliff owns homes in Portugal and the Bahamas]. 'We are considering which one would operationally be the better choice.’ Eventually they did find Sir Cliff’s Berkshire address, and tipped off Johnson the night before the raid. Helpfully, one of Goodwin’s team sent the reporter an aerial photograph of the property and said: ‘From what I’ve been told by officers who are down there now there won’t be much to see from the street.’ At 10.20am the following day, with the police poised to swoop on the apartment, Johnson exchanged text messages with a police media officer, Lesley Card. He asked: ‘You parked underground? Helicopter can’t see you’. Card replies: ‘No we’re not parked near the property at this time – while we wait to hear bout entry, we’re parked off in the grounds somewhere.’ Johnson then asks: ‘Have you managed to get in his place?’. He is told: ‘Yes, we have managed to gain entry.’ He later asks: ‘Give me a shout before they take anything out, so we can get the chopper in place for a shot.’ When asked about the legal action, a spokesman for Sir Cliff declined to comment. The singer, who was interviewed under caution by police ten days after the raid, has described the allegation against him as ‘completely false’. He has received huge support from the public and has continued to work. Next September he will embark on his 75th birthday tour, which has just added a sixth date at London’s Royal Albert Hall. ‘I am moved by the support the fans have shown, and am very much looking forward to seeing them on the tour next year,’ he said. After broadcasting live, the BBC received hundreds of complaints from viewers, with many saying that the coverage made the singer look guilty. Keith Vaz MP said the police acted 'entirely properly' in their dealings with the BBC, but that their coverage had caused 'irreparable damage' (pictured, the head of South Yorks Police speaks to MPs over the incident) Yesterday, Jack Good, 83, the TV producer credited with turning Sir Cliff into a star in the late 1950s, called the broadcast ‘shameful’. Sir Michael Parkinson, 79, a former BBC journalist, described it as a ‘witch-hunt’ and attacked the Corporation for an ‘error of judgment’. Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis said: ‘The decision by the leadership of South Yorkshire police to allow the searching of Sir Cliff Richard’s house to be televised, like some morally challenged reality TV show, demonstrates there is something sick at the heart of Britain’s police and justice system.’ However, Home Affairs Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz said the BBC acted ‘perfectly properly’ in its dealings with police over the raid, but the coverage had caused Sir Cliff ‘enormous, irreparable damage’. Last night the BBC said the Home Affairs Committee ‘has already endorsed the way the BBC handled this story. We have nothing further to add’. South Yorkshire Police said: ‘While we believe our actions in relation to dealing with the media were within policy and were well-intended, they were ultimately flawed and we regret the additional anxiety which was caused to Sir Cliff Richard.’ It said it ‘no longer provides privileged briefings to reporters’.","Sir Cliff  to sue the BBC for breach of privacy over raid on his UK home .

"Former Hasidic Jew Ari Mandel, 31, claims he posted his 'Portion in olam habaah [heaven]' on eBay on Tuesday as a joke . A New Jersey man who offered $100,000 for his spot in heaven by an eBay bidder before the auction site took down his proposal. Ari Mandel, 31, who identifies himself as atheist lived in an Orthodox Jewish community until he was 23. He posted his 'Portion in olam habaah [heaven]' on eBay on Tuesday. Since Mandel no longer considers himself a member of the Hasidic community, he was happy to give up his spot. He promised the winning bidder a signed . contract guaranteeing his spot in Habaah, plus another contract . guaranteeing that he would live free of sin in order for that spot to be . secured. He also promised never to return to religious life and steal . the spot back for himself. ‘I didn't think anyone would take it seriously,’ Mandel told NBC News. ‘It's gotten way more attention than I expected. I really didn't expect it to blow up and go crazy the way it did.’ Mandel . posted his prank auction on Tuesday and the price quickly grew from 99 . cents to $100,000, with more than 180 people bidding.

Return: Bulgaria's green cat has finally reappeared after vanishing from the streets of Varna three days ago . The feline was not seen for three days, raising fears that she has been abducted as a result of her new found fame. Some residents of the popular tourist destination insisted that rain had washed the animal's colour away and say a similar-looking green cat was seen last year. Although the unusual colour was initially thought to have been caused by an act of cruelty, reports emerged the green shine was from paint at the nearby construction yard where she sleeps. It is hoped that the stand-out nature of the feline won't influence owners to paint their own cats. Ginger companion: The cat was pictured cosying up to another ginger moggy - believed to be her son . Theory: It is thought the cat's coat is dyed green by paint she rubs against in a construction yard where she sleeps . The RSPCA has warned that dyeing or painting animals for cosmetic reasons could have 'potentially fatal consequences'.

"Escaping from the hectic world to curl up with a good book is one of life’s simple pleasures. But thanks to the popularity of e-readers, it seems that when you settle down to enjoy a novel you’re no longer alone. The digital devices not only track which books you read, but can monitor the passages you dwell on and the time you put your book down at night to go to sleep. Growth strategy: The information being collected is being used to recommend new books and boost sales to grow the e-book market, according to Michael Tamblyn, of Kobo, which supplies e-readers to WHSmith . Michael Tamblyn, of Kobo, which supplies e-readers to WHSmith, John Lewis and Tesco, said it collects information from users to recommend new books and boost sales. ‘We’re synchronising a bookmark constantly as you move along,’ he said. ‘That gives us insight into how you’re engaging in the book that you’re in ... so if you have stayed up through the night and you can’t put that book down, that helps us find other books from other people who have had that same kind of experience. ‘When you think about the number of books people buy and don’t finish, the “other people who bought this also bought this [formula]” isn’t that good a way to try to recommend a book.’ Amazon’s Kindle device also collects information about users’ habits, monitoring how long they spend reading as well as remembering the last page they read. The internet giant – which sells around 60 per cent of all e-books bought in the UK – reserves the right to store the information collected by Kindles on its servers. Renate Samson, of the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘It is rather alarming to think that whilst you read your e-book your e-reader device is reading you. ‘That these products feel the need to monitor more than just what we read, but to actively store data on what page we might linger on or more worryingly what time of day or night we choose to read seems disproportionately intrusive on what is to most of us a moment of personal quiet time.’ Monitoring: Amazon’s Kindle device also collects information about users’ habits, monitoring how long they spend reading as well as remembering the last page they read . Invasion of privacy: Renate Samson, of the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘It is rather alarming to think that whilst you read your e-book your e-reader device is reading you' At the moment e-books account for around a fifth of all book sales in the UK, across all age groups. Many older readers have adopted the gadgets because they can easily increase the font size, making books easier to read without having to pay for a special large-print edition. Mr Tamblyn said that it was collecting data to help it increase the e-book market. ‘What we’re interested in is where does the next 20 per cent come from? We think it will be people who are holding onto print much more tightly than in the past,’ he said.","The devices can monitor passages you dwell on and time you go to sleep .

"Enemy No 1: Internal emails released by the Defense Department show that no U.S. sailors witnessed Osama bin Laden's burial at sea aboard USS Carl Vinson . Internal emails among U.S. military officers indicate that no American sailors watched Osama bin Laden's burial at sea from the USS Carl Vinson, and traditional Islamic procedures were followed during the secret ceremony. The emails, obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act, are heavily blacked out, but are the first public disclosure of government information about the al-Qaida leader's death. The emails were released Wednesday by the Defense Department. Bin Laden was killed on May 1, 2011, by a Navy SEAL team that assaulted his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. One email stamped secret and sent on May 2 by a senior Navy officer briefly describes how bin Laden's body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet, and then placed in a weighted bag. According to another message from the Vinson's public affairs officer, only a small group of the ship's leadership was informed of the burial. ‘Traditional procedures for Islamic burial was followed,’ the May 2 email from Rear Adm. Charles Gaouette reads. ‘The deceased's body was washed (ablution) then placed in a white sheet. The body was placed in a weighted bag. ‘A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. After the words were complete, the body was placed on a prepared flat board, tipped up, whereupon the deceased's body slid into the sea.’ Final destination: Bin Laden's body was taken to an unknown location aboard USS Carl Vinson and dropped into the sea, but the Defense Department says that it cannot find any images showing the terrorist mastermind's remains on the ship . Fallen mastermind: In this undated file image from video seized from bin Laden's walled compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the al Qaeda leader watches TV . Stronghold: Members of the anti-terrorism squad are seen surrounding the compound where bin Laden was killed by Navy SEAL Team 6 in Abbottabad May 4, 2011 . The email also included a cryptic reference to the intense secrecy surrounding the mission. ‘The . paucity of documentary evidence in our possession is a reflection of . the emphasis placed on operational security during the execution of this . phase of the operation,’ Gaouette's message reads. Long-awaited news: U.S. President Barack Obama is pictured after announcing live on television the death of Osama bin Laden from the East Room of the White House in Washington May 1, 2011 . Recipients . of the email included Adm. Mike Mullen, then the chairman of the Joint . Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. James Mattis, the top officer at U.S. Central . Command. Mullen retired from the military in September 2011. Earlier, . Gaouette, then the deputy commander of the Navy's Fifth Fleet, and . another officer used code words to discuss whether the helicopters . carrying the SEALs and bin Laden's body had arrived on the Vinson. ‘Any . news on the package for us?’ he asked Rear Adm. Samuel Perez, commander . of the carrier strike group that included the Vinson. ‘FEDEX delivered the package,’ Perez responded. ‘Both trucks are safely enroute home base.’ Although . the Obama administration has pledged to be the most transparent in . American history, it is keeping a tight hold on materials related to the . bin Laden raid. In a response to separate requests . from the AP for information about the mission, the Defense Department . said in March that it could not locate any photographs or video taken . during the raid or showing bin Laden's body. It also said it could not . find any images of bin Laden's body on the Vinson. The Pentagon also said it could not . find any death certificate, autopsy report or results of DNA . identification tests for bin Laden, or any pre-raid materials discussing . how the government planned to dispose of bin Laden's body if he were . killed. Historic moment: In this May 1, 2011, image, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden receive an update on the bin Laden mission in the Situation Room . The Defense Department also refused to confirm or deny the existence of helicopter maintenance logs and reports about the performance of military gear used in the raid. One of the stealth helicopters that carried the SEALs to Abbottabad crashed during the mission and its wreckage was left behind. People who lived near bin Laden's compound took photos of the disabled chopper. The CIA, which ran the bin Laden raid and has special legal authority to keep information from ever being made public, has not responded to AP's request for records about the mission.","Emails describe how Osama bin Laden's body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and slid into the sea after religious remarks in Arabic .

"Fresh light has been shone on the mystery of Sandy Island after an Australian librarian found the landmass that wasn't on a 1908 map. The mysterious island sparked worldwide interest last month when a team of researchers who went on a hunt for it discovered nothing but waves when they arrived. A range of maps and charts, including Google Earth and others both historical and modern, showed in the Coral Sea between Australia and New Caledonia. Earliest mention? Sandy Island is shown in this 1908 admiralty chart in Auckland Museum's collection as a substantially sized island in the middle of the Coral Sea to the east of the Chesterfields . However, its existence would have been a geological oddity since it apparently sat in a region of deep waters. In an effort to track down its earliest appearance on a map librarian Shaun Higgins scoured Auckland Museum's large collection of maps and charts of the Pacific, the museum's blog reported. After searching through maps dating as far back as the 1700s, Mr Higgins finally tracked down Sandy Island's earliest appearance in the collection to a 1908 admiralty chart. Grey Meylan, a writer in the museum's exhibitions team, said the chart indicates that the island was discovered by a ship called the Velocity in 1876. But, he adds, there is a generic note attached to the map which warns: 'Caution is necessary while navigating among the low lying islands of the Pacific Ocean. 'The general details have been collated from the voyages of various navigators extending over a long series of years. The relative position of many dangers may therefore not be exactly given.' Mr Higgins told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'It has the same shape as [on] Google Earth, but it's dotted. It could have been dotted because it was an unidentified hazard.' Phantom island: Sandy Island as it appears on Google's satellite maps. It sparked worldwide interest last month when a team of researchers who went on a hunt for it discovered nothing but waves when they arrived . A reader the Auckland Museum's blog posted a comment on their story saying the Velocity was a 140 ton whaling ship captained by a J.W. Robinson. The post, which cited an article in the Hobart Mercury from April 1877, went on: 'Captain Robinson reported that he left the river [Hobart] on the 15th April 1876 and proceeded to Cato’s Bank where whales were seen once during a gale of wind. 'Shortly after this the vessel sprang a leak, which kept on increasing and a course was shaped for the Chesterfield group, where an anchorage being obtained the leak was partially stopped. 'While there an anchor and chain were lost in a heavy gale, and the brig then went to Solomon Islands anchoring in Mackira Bay, San Christoval [San Cristobal].' The commenter added: 'This gives the Velocity in the area of ‘Sandy Island’ in 1876.' A reference to the island is also found in the 1879 edition of the Australia directory produced by the admiralty hydrographic department, the Herald reported. 'In 1876, the master of the whaler Velocity reported that while cruising on the eastern side of the Chesterfield and Bampton reefs, he observed heavy breakers in lat 19' 50' S long, 158' 50' E,' it said. 'The master of Velocity also reported a line of sandy islets as extending about North and South along the meridian of 159' 57 E, between lat 19'7 S and 19'20 S.' Look for yourself: This map embedded from Google maps shows the location of the phantom island . Interest was sparked in Sandy Island after a group of researchers from the University of Sydney went on a voyage in search of it and found it did not exist. As well as appearing on Google Maps, the Times Atlas of the World appeared to identify the phantom landmass as Sable Island, and it was also shown weather maps used by the Southern Surveyor, the maritime research vessel which the team travelled on. Mission: Dr Maria Seton, of the University of Sydney, who was part of the team who went in search of Sandy Island last month . But when the ship, which was tasked with identifying fragments of the Australian continental crust submerged in the Coral Sea, steamed to where it was supposed to be there was nothing there. The island had supposedly sat in an area of very deep sea, making its existence something of a geological oddity that researchers wanted to investigate. 'We wanted to check it out because the navigation charts on board the ship showed a water depth of 1,400 metres (4,620 feet) in that area - very deep,' said Dr Maria Seton, of the University of Sydney, after the 25-day voyage. 'It's on Google Earth and other maps so we went to check and there was no island. We're really puzzled. It's quite bizarre.' The latest development in the Sandy Island mystery seems to put paid to the theory, previously reported by MailOnline, that the landmass appeared as the result of an error in digitising satellite maps. However, it does not answer the question of why it wasn't removed from maps after amateur radio enthusiasts discovered it wasn't actually there in 2000. Indeed, Tim Totten, one ham radio enthusiast, told MailOnline that he had heard of a number of rumours of so-called 'Sandy Islands' that turned out to be phantoms. He was part of an expedition disproving the existence of another such land mass with the same name near the Solomon Islands, he said. The Coral Sea's Sandy Island now appears to have been removed from Google Maps, however it still appears on the service's Satellite View and on Google Earth.","Sandy Island appeared on a range of maps and satellite pictures but Australian team that went in hunt of it found nothing there .

"It may sound like a plot straight out of a science fiction novel, but a U.S. mission to blow up the moon with a nuke was very real in the 1950s. At the height of the space race, the U.S. considered detonating an atom bomb on the moon as a display of America's Cold War muscle. The secret project, innocuously titled 'A Study of Lunar Research Flights' and nicknamed 'Project A119,' was never carried out. Plot: The U.S. was planning to launch an atomic bomb, like Fat Man, pictured above, that would be launched into space in a scrapped plan to blow up the moon . Brains of the operation: Astronomer Carl Sagan, . left, was involved in the planning of the mission and physicist Leonard . Reiffel, right, was the man in charge . However, its planning included calculations . by astronomer Carl Sagan, then a young graduate student, of the behavior . of dust and gas generated by the blast. Viewing the nuclear flash from Earth might have intimidated the Soviet Union and boosted U.S. confidence after the launch of Sputnik, physicist Leonard Reiffel told the AP in a 2000 interview. Reiffel, now 85, directed the inquiry at the former Armour Research Foundation, now part of the Illinois Institute of Technology. He later served as a deputy director at NASA. Would you miss it? American scientists were looking to blow up the moon to get an edge of the Soviet Union in the space race . Sagan, who later became renowned for popularizing science on television, died in 1996. The author of one of Sagan's biographies suggested that he may have committed a security breach in 1959 after revealing the classified project in an academic fellowship application. Reiffel concurred. Under the scenario, a missile . carrying a small nuclear device was to be launched from an undisclosed . location and travel 238,000 miles to the moon, where it would be . detonated upon impact. The planners decided it would have to be an atom bomb because a hydrogen bomb would have been too heavy for the missile. Reiffel . said the nation’s young space program probably could have carried out . the mission by 1959, when the Air Force deployed inter-continental . ballistic missiles. Military officials apparently abandoned the idea because of the danger to people on Earth in case the mission failed. The scientists also registered concerns about contaminating the moon with radioactive material, Reiffel said.

"Progress: The brain of someone with MS, which in later stages, can leave patients unable to walk . Stem cells could hold the key to treating people paralysed by multiple sclerosis, landmark research has revealed. Treatment with human stem cells has allowed mice crippled by a version of MS to walk again after less than two weeks. Scientists admit to being astonished by the result and believe it opens up a new avenue of research in the quest for solutions to MS. Professor Tom Lane, from the University of Utah, who led the US team, recalled: 'My postdoctoral fellow Dr Lu Chen came to me and said ‘the mice are walking’. I didn’t believe her.' The genetically engineered mice had a condition that mimics the symptoms of human MS. They were so disabled they could not stand long enough to eat and drink on their own and had to be hand-fed. The scientists transplanted human neural stem cells into the animals expecting them to be rejected and provide no benefit. Instead the experiment yielded spectacular results. Within 10 to 14 days, the mice had regained motor skills and were able to walk again. Six months later, they showed no sign of relapsing. The findings, published in the journal Stem Cell Reports, suggest the mice experienced at least a partial reversal of their symptoms. A similar outcome in humans could help patients with potentially disabling progressive stages of the disease for which there are no treatments. 'This result opens up a whole new area of research for us to figure out why it worked,' said co-author Dr Jeanne Loring, director of the Center for Regenerative Medicine at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. 'We’ve long forgotten our original plan.' MS is an auto-immune condition caused by the body’s own defences attacking myelin, the fatty insulation surrounding nerve fibres. As myelin is stripped away, nerve impulses can no longer be transmitted properly leading to symptoms ranging from mild tingling to full-blown paralysis. Drugs that dampen the immune system can slow early forms of the disease, but little can be done for patients in the later stages. Breakthrough: The scientists transplanted human stem cells into the animals. Within 10 to 14 days, the mice had regained motor skills and were able to walk again. Members of the team believe the surprising success may be linked to the way the stem cells were grown in an unusually uncrowded lab dish. This led to stem cells that were highly potent, with an enhanced ability to produce certain proteins.Chemical signals from the stem cells instructed each mouse’s own cells to repair the damage caused by MS, said the scientists. One signal was identified as a protein called TGF-beta, raising the prospect of delivering a similar therapy in the form of a drug. 'Rather than having to engraft stem cells into a patient, which can be challenging from a medical standpoint, we might be able to develop a drug that can be used to deliver the therapy much more easily,' said Prof Lane. He added: 'We want to try to move as quickly and carefully as possible. I would love to see something that could promote repair and ease the burden that patients with MS have.'","Mice crippled by version of MS could walk again after less than two weeks .

"Archaeologists excavating an ancient mound in northern Greece have uncovered what appears to be the entrance to an important tomb. And it is believed to have been built at the end of the reign of warrior-king Alexander the Great. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who visited the tightly-guarded site earlier this week, said the discovery ‘is clearly extremely important’ and dates between 325 and 300 B.C. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists excavating an ancient mound in northern Greece (picutred) have uncovered what appears to be the entrance to an important tomb. It is believed to have been built at the end of the reign of warrior-king Alexander the Great and Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described the discovery as 'extremely important’ Alexander, who started from the northern Greek region of Macedonia to build an empire stretching as far as India, died in 323 B.C. and was buried in Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, to the west, where the lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. But archaeologists believe the apparently unlooted Amphipolis grave, which is surrounded by a surprisingly long and well-built wall with courses of marble decorations, may have belonged to a senior ancient official. Excavator Katerina Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site. Alexander (statue pictured) was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC, and died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC . Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. In the past, the lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one of Alexander's military commanders who became governor of Syria after the king's death. ‘The excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside,’ Samaras said. The tomb is expected to be opened in the next fortnight. Workers have previously uncovered a flight of 13 steps that lead to a broad path, flanked by masonry walls, which end in a built-up arch covering two headless, wingless sphinxes - mythical creatures that blend human, bird and lion characteristics. The tomb is believed to date back between 325 and 300 B.C, during the reign of Alexander the Great.

"A widower has settled his $6million lawsuit against three airlines who barred his late wife from planes because she was 'too fat' to fly. Vilma Soltesz, who was 407lb, died at the couple's holiday home in Hungary after she was not allowed to fly back to New York City by Delta, KLM or Lufthansa in 2012. Her husband Janos Soltesz, 57, settled his wrongful death suit last month for an undisclosed amount. Scroll down for video . Vilma Soltesz, 56, from New York, who weighed 407lb and had her leg amputated after suffering from diabetes, died while on holiday in Hungary in October 2012 because she was told she could not board three separate flights . The suit said the couple were sent on a 'wild goose chase' across Europe in October 2012 by the airlines, which ultimately caused Mrs Soltesz's death, according to the New York Daily News. Morbidly-obese Mrs Soltesz was also wheelchair-bound by an amputated leg and suffered from diabetes and kidney disease. She was found dead at the age of 56 at her vacation home in Hungary in October 2012, days after several aircraft crews repeatedly failed to accommodate her size despite telling her they could do so, according to the lawsuit which was filed in federal court in Manhattan last October. The couple left their Bronx home in September 2012 on a Delta Air Lines plane, securing two seats for Vilma and one for her husband. The couple arrived safely in Budapest on a vacation, according to the lawsuit. By October 2, 2012, Vilma Soltesz sought treatment at a hospital in Hungary when she fell ill. She was released and told she could fly home but to see her doctor immediately upon her arrival. Mrs Soltesz, pictured with her husband during their airport ordeal, tried to board three separate flights to New York in 2012 but eventually died at her holiday home in Hungary. Her husband Janos settled his lawsuit last month for an undisclosed figure . In Prague although a local fire department were brought into to help move Mrs Soltesz into three seats assigned to her, they could not lift the 407lb woman out of the wheelchair . The pair tried to leave Budapest two weeks later on a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight, with seats similar to what they had on their flight from the United States, according to the suit. But a captain told them to disembark after Mrs Soltesz struggled to maneuver from her wheelchair into her assigned seats, the lawsuit says. After waiting in a Budapest airport for more than five hours, the couple drove to Prague to catch a Delta flight they were assured could accommodate them. But Delta did not have an adequate wheelchair to transport Vilma Soltesz to her seat, the suit added. 'The Delta flight coordinator told Janos and Vilma that Delta ''did not have access to a skylift'' to get Vilma onto the aircraft from the rear, and that there was nothing more Delta could do for them,' the lawsuit stated. Later, on October 22, as several medics and firefighters helped her board a Lufthansa flight, the captain told the couple they had to disembark because 'other passengers need to catch a connecting flight and cannot be delayed further,' the lawsuit says. 'Exhausted and feeling ill,' Vilma Soltesz went to bed after the couple drove back to their vacation home in Veszprem, Hungary, the lawsuit says. On October 24, Janos found her dead - nine days after she was supposed to have seen her doctor in New York.","Vilma Soltesz, who was 407lb, died  in Hungary in 2012 after being barred from three flights with Delta, KLM and Lufthansa .

"Homes have been evacuated and roads closed on the southern-most Canary Island following a government-issued warning about a possible volcanic eruption. The southern tip of El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake late on Saturday as an underwater volcano just off the coast started spewing matter some 60ft into the air. The island, which has 500 volcanic cones, has experienced more than 10,000 tremors  in the past four months. Renewed fears of an eruption came as vast quantities of magma - the molten rock from just under the earth's crust - began bubbling into the sea off the port of La Restinga. Scroll down for video . A 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit El Hierro in the Canary Islands on Friday suggesting a nearby underwater volcano could soon erupt. This could force rock to emerge from the sea, creating a new island. In 2011, the southern tip of El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake and magma appeared off the coast, pictured . Witnessess said that explosive plumes and jets could be seen on the ocean surface from the underwater volcano which began erupting last month.

Volcano . expert Juan Carlos Carrecedo said at the time: 'There is a ball of magma rising to . the surface producing a series of ruptures which generate seismic . activity.

"Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 was in trouble and simply heading for the nearest safe airport when it turned off-course, according to a veteran pilot who predicts, in a viral online post, that the wreckage will be discovered somewhere west of the Maldives today. Chris Goodfellow, a Canadian pilot with 20 years experience, has hailed captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah a hero, not a hijacker, in his fascinating explanation, which claims to debunks all theories about the fate of the missing jet. He insists the only reasonable scenario is that a fire broke out aboard the plane and Shah was doing exactly what he needed to do in an emergency - get the plane to the nearest airport as soon as possible. In this case, that was the 13,000 foot strip Palau Langkawi, and that is directly where the aircraft was heading when it was last tracked. However, Goodfellow believes the crew were overcome by smoke and the aircraft flew as a 'ghost plane' for hours past the chosen airport before finally crashing into the Indian Ocean near the Maldives. Scroll down for videos . Ghost flight: A new theory claims MH370 was headed for an emergency landing at Palau Langkawi, shown on the map, but the crew were overcome by smoke before they got there and the plane continued to fly on autopilot for hours into the Indian Ocean . 'We old pilots were always drilled to always know the closest airport of safe harbor while in cruise. Always,' Goodfellow wrote. 'Instinctively when I saw that left turn with a direct heading I knew he was heading for an airport.' He said he immediately brought up Google Earth and discovered the runway, which was had fewer obstacles blocking the plane's approach than if Shah attempted to return to Kuala Lumpar, which was also further away. 'This pilot did all the right things. He was confronted by some major event aboard that made him make that immediate turn back to the closest safe airport,' he says in the post. Goodfellow's initial post went took the web by storm after he posted it on Google Plus and then Reddit. Simple theory: Chris Goodfellow, a Canadian pilot with 20 years experience, has hailed captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah a hero, not a hijacker, in his interesting post, which took the internet by storm . He wrote a number of follow up posts . answering the hundreds of questions he had received as more information, and speculation, came to light. In his last note late on Tuesday, he claimed . reported sightings of an aircraft over the Maldives corresponds to his . theory and he predicted it will be found sometime Wednesday a small . distance west of the Maldives. In his first post, Goodfellow said the loss of transponders and communications makes 'perfect sense' in the event of a fire. He suggests an electrical fire may have started inside the plane, perhaps incapacitating crew with smoke. The plane's cargo - which reportedly included a shipment of lithium batteries - may have ignited. Or possibly one of the tires overheated during takeoff and began burning slowly, eventually making it to the cockpit where the pilots were overcome by smoke. He said all the circumstances that night - a full plane, hot weather, and a long run takeoff runway - make this incident all the more plausible, and he cited a similar occurrence in Nigeria of a DC8 that had a landing gear fire on takeoff. He believes at that point, the Malaysian plane 'just continued on (that route)probably on (autopilot) until either fuel exhaustion or fire destroyed the control surfaces and it crashed.' 'I said four days ago you will find it along that route - looking elsewhere was pointless,' Goodfellow added in his captivating piece. He said he has been stunned that no officials, pilots or reporters have looked at the case from the pilot's point of view. 'Thanks to Google earth I spotted Langkawi in about 30 seconds, zoomed in and saw how long the runway was and I just instinctively knew this pilot knew this airport. He had probably flown there many times,' the pilot wrote. As for the last voice transmission, Goodfellow told said 'Good night' is customary as a hand-off to a new air traffic controller and also strongly indicates to him that all was OK on the flight deck. Emergency landing: Goodfellow said he knew within 30 seconds of pulling up Google Earth that Shah was heading for an emergency landing at In this case, that was the 13,000 foot strip known as Palau Langkawi, pictured . The missing plane, considered history's worst aviation disaster, went missing on March 8 with 239 people on board . He said there are many ways to communicate distress, but at this point he doesn't believe the pilots knew anything was wrong, though things may well have been in the process of unraveling. He says the plane would have had around 8 hours of fuel, possibly more, and 20-25 per cent would have been burned with takeoff and the climb to cruise. When the turn was made toward Langkawi, he would have had six hours or more worth of fuel left, which he says 'correlates nicely' with the fact data was still being detected until fuel exhaustion. '(This) only confirms to me that the crew was incapacitated and the flight continued on deep into the south Indian ocean,' he said. Whatever caused what he believes was a serious mechanical issue, Goodfellow believes Shah was bravely attempting to save his life and the lives of his crew and passengers. 'Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah was a hero struggling with an impossible situation trying to get that plane to Langkawi. There is no doubt in my mind,' he said. 'Smart pilot. Just didn't have the time.'","Veteran Canadian pilot Chris Goodfellow says his viral online post debunks claims that the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight was hijacked .

"Several discount stores across Britain have been unknowingly selling fake bottles of Head and Shoulders shampoo, which contain potentially dangerous ingredients including 'sex change' chemicals. Thousands of counterfeit bottles of the top-selling haircare brand have been seized by Trading Standards officers after customers began reporting side effects of itching and bleeding after using the products. Tests carried out by scientists at Loughborough University, on samples collected during the UK seizures, revealed the fakes had a 'significantly different chemical make-up to the genuine product'. The bogus products were found to contain high levels of the 'sex change' chemical Diethyl Phthalate, which can affect reproductive health and can also be toxic to wildlife. Thousands of bottles of counterfeit Head and Shoulders shampoo were seized across the country by Trading Standards after they were found to be fake. Tests showed they had high levels of a 'sex change' chemical .

An investigation found fake bottles of the leading shampoo brand had been on sale at two Trago Mills' stores in Cornwall and at a discount B&M store in Northern Ireland. Health experts fear there could be thousands more of the counterfeit bottles on sale across the country, with the fakes so realistic that it is extremely difficult to tell the difference between the bogus product and the real thing. The makers of the genuine Head and Shoulders brand, Procter and Gamble, said chemicals in the fakes had the potential to cause irritation to breathing and skin, could be harmful if swallowed and had risks of 'serious damage' to eyes. The counterfeits also tested positive for large amounts of the 'sex change' chemical Diethyl Phthalate, which can affect reproductive health. The endocrine chemicals, which could find their way into into rivers and lakes from drains and sewage, can lead to fish having their hormones altered and some scientists claim it can stop them breeding. Experts said there was ten times the amount of the 'sex change' chemical compared to any other ingredients in some of the fake bottles. An investigation on TV show Fake Britain found that of the 160 bottles seized from Trago Mills stores in Falmouth and Liskeard in Cornwall, every one turned out to be a counterfeit. In a statement, Trago Mills said: 'As a retailer that has been established for nearly 50 years, we have always taken great care to build relationships with reputable suppliers and top brands, in order to source the best products for our customers. The genuine Head and Shoulders brand, Procter and Gamble, said chemicals in the fakes had the potential to cause irritation to breathing and skin . 'We purchased this particular product in good faith, from a trusted source, and we were one of a number of wholesalers and retailers, worldwide, who received it. 'The copy was so advanced that it took rigorous testing to identify it as a copy. 'We work closely with the Office of Fair Trading to ensure our customers' best interests are put first and are grateful to them for helping us to identify this sophisticated copy and to ensure the product was removed immediately from sale.' Cornwall Trading Standards was involved in the investigation and a spokesman described them as 'extremely good counterfeits' which looked almost identical to the real thing. She added: 'The copies were so incredibly good that the store, in our opinion, had done everything they could to make sure it wasn't selling counterfeits. 'As such, we have closed the investigation against the store that sold it, by way of providing advice for them to potentially spot counterfeits in the future.' Tests on the counterfeit products, carried out  at Loughborough University, found it did not have any acidity regulator, meaning there's nothing to control chemical reactions in the bottles, which could produce harmful substances. A skin sensitiser was also found, which could cause contact dermatitis to those allergic. On the BBC investigative show, a woman in St Austell, called Sharon, described how the fake shampoo which she'd unwittingly bought at a 99p Store in the town, caused her scalp to itch and turn red after just the third use. Scabs then formed which later began to bleed. She said: 'You'd itch so vigorously and then it would kind of scab and then the next time you would itch it would make a certain patch bleed. Dozens of fake bottles of Head and Shoulders shampoo was seized from Trago Mills in Falmouth, Cornwall (pictured). However, Trading Standards confirmed the store took all necessary action to avoid counterfeits . A probe by TV show Fake Britain found counterfeit bottles of Head and Shoulders in B&M Stores (file picture) 'I was quite angry to think that something I was paying my money for was making me sore and itchy. 'You feel dirty I suppose that you're forever sitting there scratching. 'Having a sore head and scalp was bad enough but to actually have a product to make me bleed. 'I was still using it so who knows what the chemicals were in it that I was putting on my head. 'It's disgusting.' The BBC show also interviewed a woman called Nicole from Antrim, Northern Ireland, who bought Head and Shoulders shampoo from a local B&M store. She used it to wash her five-year-old daughter Imogen's hair and said she noticed adverse effects immediately. She said: 'The next day after use it looked like there were particles of paint in her hair. 'It wasn't small bits of dandruff, it was big flakes. The size of a small finger. 'My worry was, is my daughter going to be losing her hair? 'I'd say ""is it sore"" and she would say ""mummy, it's really itchy"". She was scratching like crazy.' Sharon, from St Austell, Cornwall (pictured), told Fake Britain how the fake Head and Shoulders shampoo which she'd unwittingly bought at a 99p Store  caused her scalp to itch and turn red after just the third use . Imogen eventually received treatment from her GP, but her mother notified Northern Ireland Trading Standards of the reaction. Officers launched an investigation and within weeks the authority seized almost 2,000 bottles of the illegal product from 15 discount stores across the country. Nicole added: 'What makes me angry is that I don't know what the cause is, what was in the shampoo. I don't know what I've put in her hair and the effects are ongoing. Something needs to be done about it.' B&M Retail said it was 'shocked to discover that some counterfeit product had entered the supply chain from one of the wholesale supplies of the product'. The store added: 'As soon as we were made aware the suspect stock was withdrawn from sale across all B&M stores. 'We are actively supporting the Trading Standards service to ensure a successful prosecution of the parties responsible further up the supply chain. 'This incident is the first in our 30 year history and we have taken steps to prevent a repeat occurrence.' Procter and Gamble, the firm which makes the genuine Head and Shoulders brand, today urged anyone who believes they may have a counterfeit product to contact Trading Standards. A spokesman said: ‘As we do not make these counterfeit products we cannot guarantee their safety so our first advice to people would be that, if they are in doubt, to stop using it immediately. 'We would also recommend that they return the product to the retailer where they made the purchase and make a complaint, or contact Trading Standards directly.’ MailOnline has contacted 99p Stores for comment.","Thousands of counterfeit Head and Shoulders shampoo found across UK .

"Terrorist group Isis may be considering using Ebola as a suicide bio-weapon against the West, according to a military expert. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person who is showing the symptoms – and it wouldn't be difficult for fanatics to contract it then travel to countries they want to wreak havoc in, according to a military expert. Capt. Al Shimkus, Ret., a Professor of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval War College, said that the strategy is entirely plausible. Scroll down for video . Terrorist group Isis may be considering using Ebola as a suicide bio-weapon against the West, according to a military expert . He told Forbes: 'The individual exposed to the Ebola Virus would be the carrier. In the context of terrorist activity, it doesn't take much sophistication to go to that next step to use a human being as a carrier.' And Professor Anthony Glees, Director at Buckingham University's Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies, agrees that the strategy might be considered. He said: 'In some ways it’s a plausible theory – IS fighters believe in suicide and this is a potential job for a suicide mission. They are sufficiently murderous and well-informed to consider it, and they know that we’ve been remiss in the UK.' The virus is running rampant in West Africa, with 3,800 dead in just a matter of months and the first cases appearing in Europe at the U.S. The possibility that Isis, also known as Islamic State and Isil, could make the situation far worse is one that should be taken very seriously, another expert said. In the May 2013 issue of the journal Global Policy, Amanda Teckman, author of the paper The Bioterrorist Threat Of Ebola In East Africa And Implications For Global Health And Security concluded: 'The threat of an Ebola bioterrorist attack in East Africa is a global health and security concern, and should not be ignored,' Forbes reported. Far from being lone voices on this theory, concern in America about Ebola being used as a bioweapon was in fact a catalyst for its $5.6billion Project Bioshield, according to a source familiar with the matter, who did not wish to be named. The virus is running rampant in West Africa, with 3,800 dead in just a matter of months and the first cases appearing in Europe at the U.S . Signed off by President George W. Bush in 2004, it ensures generous funding for scientists researching bioweapon counter-measures, as well as accelerating research against chemical, radiological and nuclear agents. It also grants the U.S government the power to stockpile huge quantities of medical countermeasures. However, Jennifer Cole, Senior Research Fellow, Resilience & Emergency Management, at the Royal United Services Institute, while acknowledging that Isis using Ebola as a weapon isn't out of the question, says that now would not be the best time to employ this strategy. She told MailOnline: 'Everyone's looking out for signs of Ebola at the moment so they'd be very unlikely to get away with it. 'The other issue with Ebola is that it's very hard to control. The militants could just end up wiping themselves out before they've had the chance to pass it on. 'For a suicide attack, strapping sticks of dynamite to your chest is far more effective.' Middle East security expert Andreas Krieg, from King’s College London's Department of Defence Studies, echoed Cole's scepticism. He said: 'It is certainly possible for Isis to use the Ebola virus as it is a cheap and accessible source in West Africa. However, considering the WHO’s and international community’s effort to contain the spread of the virus it will be increasingly difficult to ""export"" the virus via air transport to other parts of the world. It would require a lot of effort and have a low chance of success.' He added: 'Isis is not currently focusing on the West. At the moment Isis’ focus is on expanding its territory and influence in Syria and Iraq. It is bogged down there. Within this context I do not see any place for Ebola as a bio-weapon to be used against any of the opponents. It would be too risky as they would likely infect their own fighters and people living in their territory.' Professor Glees added: 'It would be logistically very difficult to get an IS fighter to West Africa, come into contact with Ebola, wait to find out if they were infected, then leg it to London.' The first person diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. died on Wednesday despite intense but delayed treatment, and the government announced it was expanding airport examinations to guard against the spread of the deadly disease. The possibility that Isis, also known as Islamic State and Isil, could make the situation far worse is one that should be taken very seriously, another expert said. The checks will include taking the temperatures of hundreds of travelers arriving from West Africa at five major American airports. The new screenings will begin Saturday at New York's JFK International Airport and then expand to Washington Dulles and the international airports in Atlanta, Chicago and Newark. An estimated 150 people per day will be checked, using high-tech thermometers that don't touch the skin. The White House said the fever checks would reach more than 9 of 10 travelers to the U.S. from the three heaviest-hit countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. President Barack Obama called the measures 'really just belt and suspenders' to support protections already in place. Border Patrol agents now look for people who are obviously ill, as do flight crews, and in those cases the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is notified. As of Wednesday, Ebola has killed about 3,800 people in West Africa and infected at least 8,000, according to the World Health Organization. A medical official with the U.N. Mission in Liberia who tested positive for Ebola arrived in the German city of Leipzig on Thursday to be treated at a local clinic with specialist facilities, authorities said. The unidentified medic infected in Liberia is the second member of the U.N. mission, known as UNMIL, to contract the virus. The first died on September 25. He is the third Ebola patient to arrive in Germany for treatment. The virus has taken an especially devastating toll on health care workers, sickening or killing more than 370 of them in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - places that already were short on doctors and nurses. There are no approved medications for Ebola, so doctors have tried experimental treatments in some cases, including drugs and blood transfusions from others who have recovered from Ebola. The survivor's blood could carry antibodies for the disease that will help a patient fight off the virus.","Isis fanatics may be thinking of infecting themselves with Ebola, says expert .

"Web sleuths from across the world have joined in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 by turning to the map search website Tomnod. The online community has added to the confusion surrounding the 12 day mystery of the missing jetliner as people post possible sightings and new theories. Even celebrities have taken to poring over satellite images uploaded to the website and offering up their suggestions as to where the plane might be. Investigators meanwhile probing the . disappearance of the plane believe it most likely flew into the . southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the investigation said today. Courtney Love appears to be the most famous user of Tomnod after she posted a photograph of satellite imagery from the site on her Facebook page on Monday, and suggested: 'I'm no expert but up close this does look like a plane and an oil slick.' Elsewhere, users of social networking site Reddit have posted an image which they claim appears to show debris from the plane in the Strait of Malacca. Users of social networking site Reddit have posted an image which they claim appears to show debris from the plane on the surface of the Strait of Malacca, along with an overlay which shows the scale of the Boeing 777 (left) The area highlighted the same place where . crew on a Greek-flagged oil tanker on Sunday responded to radio reports . of suitcases found floating on the surface. Users of Reddit have also suggested the scale of the potential debris matches that of the missing aircraft. Another image to have gained attention . appears to show a plane flying over a jungle, discovered by  a . university student in Taiwan, according to Taiwan's China Times. DigitalGlobe has uploaded high-resolution satellite and aerial images to its Tomnod site that let people explore the seas for clues about the crash, as well signs of a wreckage or oil slick. The authenticity of the photo by the Taiwanese student, also posted to Reddit on Sunday, has not yet been verified and online commentators have raised questions over the veracity of the image, with some pointing out it appears to be a different model to the missing Boeing 777. The plane also appears to have been painted white. The image surfaced at the same time as news emerged that Malaysian villagers claim to have seen the missing jet flying over the north east of the country at around the time the aircraft is thought to have made a 'U-turn'. Courtney Love posted a snapshot of an area of the ocean she believed could contain the remains of the missing flight MH370 on her Facebook page on Monday . DigitalGlobe has uploaded high-resolution satellite and aerial images to its Tomnod site that let people explore the seas for clues about the crash, as well signs of a wreckage or oil slick . At . least nine people - tuna fishermen, farmers and villagers - in Kelantan in Malaysia have made reports . to police about seeing lights in the sky and some said they heard the . loud noise of an engine. Similarly, residents of a tiny island in . the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives say they saw a plane with Malaysia . Airlines markings in the early hours of Saturday March 8. Asian military officials may be staging a mass cover-up over missing flight MH370, because they do not want to expose gaping holes within their countries' air defences, a leading aviation expert has suggested. The Malaysian Airlines jet went missing 1.30am on Sunday, March 9. But it was not until the following Tuesday that the Malaysian Air Force reported they had spotted the aircraft on radar over the Strait of Malacca at 2.15am. Now Thailand's military say they detected a plane at 1.28am, eight minutes after MH370's communications went down, heading towards the Strait but did not share the information because they were not asked for it. Intensive background checks on everyone aboard had turned up no-one else with a political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the plane. Writing on his blog, Aviation expert David Learmount said: 'Maybe these states’ air defences, like Malaysia’s, are not what they are cracked up to be. And maybe they wouldn’t want the rest of the world to know that.' Mr Learmount, a former pilot and now operations and safety editor at the respected Flight Global publication, points out that MH370 might have flown over several Asian countries including Thailand, Burma, China, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan. He said they may be withholding vital radar data about Flight MH370 for fear it would expose gaping holes in their multi-billion pound air defences. One said: 'I've never seen a jet . flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes but I'm sure . this was not one of those.' Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein however told a daily news conference today that the reports had been investigated by police in the Maldives and were determined to be untrue. Investigators earlier told the New Straits . Times that they were now convinced the aircraft flew low over the village, . which is in the north east - exactly the same area where the villagers . and fishermen in Malaysia who saw bright lights in the sky and heard noises on the night the jet . vanished are living. Investigators told a Malaysian newspaper that the Boeing 777 had dropped to a lower altitude - under 5,000ft - to avoid ground radar, using the surrounding terrain as a sonar barrier. This type of flying is considered to be dangerous and risky, because it places tremendous pressure on the frame of the aircraft - and flying low at night without radar assistance could lead to the plane crashing into trees or mountains. The first report of a 'bright light descending at high speed' came from Mr Alif Fathi Abdul Hadi, 29 who said he saw the light heading towards the South China Sea at 1.45am on the night the aircraft disappeared. Businessman Mr Alif lives in Kampung Kadok, in the far north west of the Malaysian mainland, close to the southern border of Thailand - and the light he witnessed would have been several miles to the north of the flight path the jet was on before it vanished. Lending credibility to the account by . Mr Alif is the claim by fisherman Azid Ibrahim, 55, who saw a bright . light streaking overhead at 1.30am on Saturday, about 100 miles south of . where Mr Alif had seen the light. Mr . Alif told said the bright light was the type that aircraft use when . taking off and landing at night - like a car uses its headlights. The satellite image from Tomnod, the online map site used by millions in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, shows a passenger plane over a jungle . Mystery: The image was found by an university student in Taiwan . 'I was walking towards the rear of my house when I saw the light, and wondered where it was heading to,' he said. 'The airspace here is like a highway for aircraft and they usually travel in routine patterns. 'However, the light I saw was moving towards a completely different direction. It was going towards the sea, near Bachok (which lies to the south of Mr Alif's home).' His description tends to indicate that . if the light he saw was on the doomed aircraft, it had turned north . instead of continuing on its regular north-easterly flight path. Mr . Alif said the aircraft he usually sees fly across the sky for as far as . his eyes could see but the light he saw in the early hours of Saturday . vanished from view behind a line of coconut trees. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) has expanded their search area for the missing flight into the Indian Ocean . Hope: A message of support is displayed at Kuala Lumpur International Airport . While he thought nothing of it at the time, when he learned about the missing aircraft MH370 the following day he lodged a report with police. Mr Alif's account tended to coincide with that of fisherman Mr Azid who told the New Straits Times: 'Usually, lights from an airplane look like distant stars at night but the one that I saw was big, as the aircraft was flying below the clouds. 'I followed the light for about five minutes before it disappeared.' A Royal Australia Air Force pilot in an AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft scans the surface of the sea during a search operation for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to the west of Peninsula Malaysia . Investigators probing the . disappearance of the plane believe it most likely flew into the . southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the investigation said today.

'The . working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went . to the southern end of that corridor,' said the source, who spoke on . condition of anonymity.

"While Liverpool are chasing MK Dons teenager Dele Alli, the central midfielder is aiming to replicate Kop hero Steven Gerrard by netting his first England goal against Germany. England Under 19s take on Germany in Dusseldorf on Monday evening and childhood Liverpool fan Alli is intent on following in the footsteps of his idol by scoring his first international goal against the nation's bitter rivals. Alli, who is also being monitored by Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United, said: 'It’s something I have been thinking about. Talent: 18-year-old midfielder Dele Alli is being closely monitored by Liverpool among other suitors . Kop hero: Alli hopes to replicate Steven Gerrard by scoring his first international goal against Germany . I’ve had a few chances when I’ve been playing for England and I feel like they’ve been easy chances, but I’ve just been messing up so I can’t wait to get off the mark. I am actually a Liverpool fan and Gerrard is someone I look up to massively.' England U19 take on Germany U19's on Monday evening with the game being shown live on Eurosport 2 at 5pm. Gerrard's debut England strike back in 2001 was a beauty. David Beckham crossed from the right, Rio Ferdinand nodded the ball back and the Liverpool star controlled it with his chest before firing into the bottom left corner from 25 yards. In an unforgettable night it put England 2-1 ahead, just before half-time, before they went on to thrash the Germans 5-1. Alli added: 'If the ball drops for me on Monday like it did for him against Germany, I’m smashing it. If I get the goal I’ll obviously be happy but the win is all that matters.' Youth: The MK Dons youngster made his debut at the age of 16 in an FA Cup match against Cambridge City . MK Dons manager Karl Robinson claims Alli, who impressed during the Dons' emphatic 4-0 win over Manchester United in the Capital One Cup, is one of the most talented teenagers the country has ever produced. The club did well to hold on to him when Liverpool thought that a £3.5million offer would seal a move. If Alli's own description of himself is anything to go by, the Barclays Premier League is in for a treat when he finally makes it there. He joked: '[Tottenham midfielder] Harry Winks and I were talking about who I play like and he was trying to tell me I’m like Fernandinho but I’m not having that I’d prefer to think I’m a cross between Gerrard and Yaya Toure.'","The MK Dons teenager wants to replicate his hero Steven Gerrard by scoring his first international goal against Germany .

"It sounds like a most unlikely aphrodisiac. But scientists have discovered the venom from what’s considered the world’s deadliest spider could be the secret to bolstering a man’s love life. Toxins produced by the Brazilian Wandering Spider, or Phoneutria nigriventer, appear to combat erectile dysfunction within 20 minutes of entering the body. Tests carried out on rats show the venom boosts performance by increasing the release of nitric oxide, a chemical that dilates blood vessels and improves blood flow. This is similar to how existing impotence drugs work. In tests on rats the spider's toxin boosted erections by triggering the release of nitric oxide . The Brazilian Wandering Spider is responsible for killing more people than any other arachnid. Victims usually die within an hour of being bitten. It is also known as the banana spider because of its habit of stowing away in shipments of the fruit. In 2008, a supermarket in Chatham, Kent, was forced to close after an assistant spotted one of the spiders under a box of bananas as she stacked them. One in ten men in the UK suffers erectile dysfunction at some point in their lives. Although drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years, around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement. Traditional treatment: Viagra works in around 70 per cent of patients but the rest see no improvement . For these men, the only other options are to inject drugs straight into the penis, or use a pump that manually increases blood supply to the organ. Neither is very popular. A drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative. Researchers from Brazil and the US extracted the toxin, called PnTx2-6, from the deadly venom and injected it into rats which had age-related erectile dysfunction. They found the toxin boosted erections by triggering the release of nitric oxide, which boosts circulation in the male genitals by helping blood vessel walls relax. In a report on their findings, published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, the researchers said: ‘The decrease in erectile function associated with age was partially restored 15 to 20 minutes after injection with PnTx2-6.’ Brazilian scientists first became interested in the deadly spider’s ability to boost sexual performance when victims of bites reported major improvements in their sex lives.","The Brazilian Wandering Spider is responsible for killing more people than any other arachnid .

"A mystery 'storm cloud' caught on weather radar after erupting off a U.S. military missile testing ground in New Mexico has left weather experts baffled. Conspiracy theorists have speculated that the plume-like cloud, which seems to appear out of nowhere, could have been kicked up by the explosion from an unreported weapons test. Deepening the mystery, U.S. National Weather Service offices in Albuquerque and El Paso have confirmed the reading, but say they have no idea where it could have come from. The mysterious plume as it appeared on the radar at Plymouth State Weather Centre as it headed toward Cannon Air Force Base. Weather experts are baffled about where it could have come from . The plume was tracked north-east, over Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis, home of the 27th Special Operations Group, over Amarillo in north Texas and towards the Oklahoma border . The plume first appeared at sunset on Monday evening over the part of the vast White Sands Missile Range in east Socorro county, close to the 'Trinity Site' where the first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945. It was spotted in publicly accessible radar data by a blogger, who tracked its progress and has published his findings in two YouTube videos and a blog post. He showed how the Weather Channel's storm identification system had detected the plume as a strong storm cell which seemingly emerged out of nowhere on a clear night. A second view of the plume, on the College of DuPage's NeXt Generation Weather Lab service, showed how it appeared to burst out of a small point, like the aftermath of a massive explosion. The plume was tracked north-east, over Cannon Air Force Base near Clovis, home of the 27th Special Operations Group, over Amarillo in north Texas and towards the Oklahoma border, where it appeared to dissipate. A closer look at the whereabouts of the beginning of the apparent weather event showed that it emerged from the White Sands Missile Range, a site which extends to some 3,200 sq/miles across New Mexico that is used as a proving ground for the U.S. military's ballistic missiles. In its previous incarnation as the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, the site played host to the 'Trinity' test of the world's first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945. In that test scientists from the Manhattan Project exploded a 20 kiloton plutonium bomb of the same kind as the Fat Man device that was a month later dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki, killing 40,000 people instantly. There is as yet no evidence of a nuclear explosion. The U.S. has not officially tested any atomic weapons since signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1992. The Trinity Site, where the world's first atomic bomb was detonated in July 1945, which is close to the source of the unexplained plume on the White Sands Missile Range . The Trinity test explosion pictured 0.016 seconds after detonation. The 20 kiloton plutonium bomb was of the same kind as the Fat Man device that was a month later dropped on the Japanese city of Nagasaki . Nevertheless the bizarre 'weather' event's appearance over a military site has led to speculation that some kind of massive weapon has been exploded at white sands, propelling a huge amount of particulate debris into the atmosphere. With the Carrizozo volcanic field just east of the site, another possible explanation could that a volcanic eruption - which has gone unreported for whatever reason - could be the source of the plume. There have been been no eyewitness reports or photographs of the plume, and no official statements from agencies involved in either missile testing or geology. Weather experts told KOB Eyewitness News 4 that they have no idea what it could be. So, whatever the source of the reading, the consensus appears to be that it was not weather related.","There is speculation that the cloud could be the result of a weapons test .

"I have done my best to avoid  talking about my 20-year relationship with Laurence Olivier for almost two decades. But now, due to the many stories flying around, most of which seem to favour his troubled wife Vivien Leigh, I want to protect his truth as I know it. I first met Olivier on the set of the 1962 film Term Of Trial but I’d fallen in love with him years before that when he played Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights. I was just 11 and dreamed about him until, at 18, I was starring opposite him. We had to go to Paris to shoot on location – and there all my dreams were finally consummated. It was the beginning of an on/off love affair which would last 20 years, outside of my two marriages to Robert Bolt. Price of fame: Laurence Olivier admitted to accidentally pushing his then-wife Vivien Leigh into a fire place . In 1963 he asked me to join his new Old Vic National Theatre to play Abigail in Arthur Miller’s The Crucible, which he was directing. In a break in rehearsals one morning, he noticed how exhausted I looked and asked me what was wrong. I told him about my Nona saga. Nona was a fellow RADA student who had looked me up, and finding that  I now lived in a house in Chelsea, barged through my front door with her suitcase one afternoon and asked if she could stay with me until she got her bearings. She apparently had no family – and stayed for three years. When I told Larry that she had been diagnosed as a manic depressive, schizophrenic nymphomaniac – it wasn’t unusual to find three men queuing on the steps of my home waiting to ‘entertain’ Nona – his eyes popped open in astonishment. ‘A manic depressive, schizophrenic, nymphomaniac, eh .  .  ?’ he repeated quietly. ‘Well, well, what a coincidence .  .  . ’ He went on to tell me  that Vivien had been diagnosed with exactly the same three conditions. First meeting: Sarah Miles and Laurence Olivier in Term of Trial in 1962, where they embarked on a 20 year on/off relationship . Over the next 25 years, Larry would share many Vivien stories, sometimes portraying her in a very disturbing, cruel light. He, too, did not always emerge smelling of roses. For example, he told how once, before he and Vivien parted for good, he pushed her aside during a row  and she accidentally tripped and fell into the fireplace, hitting her head on the fire dog. Larry thought he had killed her. When Vivien came round, he swore that if he didn’t part from her, next time he surely would kill her. The more we compared notes, the closer we became, for we both shared the utter despair, the unimaginable frustration and hopelessness of wrestling with two such pitiable creatures, albeit not at the same time. But because I was still going through my Nona era, Larry often gave me invaluable advice. Nona attempted suicide three times by swallowing  sleeping pills. On two occasions I just managed to get her to hospital in the nick of time. But the third time, seeing her lying there like Ophelia, her mane of almost pale green hair flowing over the white pillow, I whispered in her ear: ‘Nona, jump if you really want to die.’ A few months later she did. Larry admitted that the period  after . splitting up with Vivien was the darkest, most lonely time of his whole . life. Indeed, if it wasn’t for the fact that Vivien was always . threatening  to kill herself while they were together, he might have . taken his own life, for he was seriously off balance at that time. Larry . was too much of a gentleman to speak openly about Vivien’s sex . addiction. But I do know that Vivien would get her kicks by making sure . she would time her ‘amours’ to coincide with Larry returning to their . house in Chelsea or Notley Abbey, their country estate in . Buckinghamshire. Jealousy . was rife between the pair, but Vivien became unmanageable when Larry . began having hit after hit. She wanted to be Larry. She . demanded that he use his influence to create opportunities for her to . become a Dame, and felt that Larry wasn’t helping her sufficiently to . that end. But he told me: . ‘The truth is she wasn’t good enough in the theatre. She would never . even bother turning up for her voice production classes. ‘Now, . if she had stuck to filming, she would have won Oscar after Oscar, but . that wasn’t good enough for Vivien – she was determined to beat me at my . own game.’ I worked with Vivien in 1959, long before I met Olivier. Diva: Vivien Leigh, as Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the wind, demanded that Sarah was not allowed to wear any colour but black when they worked together . When I was 16 and still at RADA, my agent Robin Fox – the patriarch of the Fox acting dynasty – suggested I get my first experience of a film studio and he secured a walk-on part for me in The Roman Spring Of Mrs Stone, starring Vivien and Warren Beatty. It was daunting, scary even, walking through the gates of Elstree Studios at 5am and asking the porter at the front desk for my dressing room key, precisely as Robin had instructed. I was somewhat puzzled to discover that although the number  on the door matched that on my  key, the name on the door read Lotte Lenya – who back then was a musical legend. Had there been some mistake? I checked my key number yet again. It was correct so, full of confidence, I placed the key in the lock, only to receive three sharp taps on my shoulder as I did so. ‘You can’t go in there, that’s Lotte Lenya’s dressing room!’ hissed a small lady behind me, her dazzling eyes hot with confrontation. I stood my ground. ‘Good morning, Miss Leigh,’ I replied as sweetly as  I could muster. ‘That’s Lotte Lenya’s dressing room,’ she repeated, eyes hotter than ever. ‘The porter has obviously given you the wrong key, you shouldn’t be up here. Walk-ons are downstairs in the extras’ dressing rooms.’ Her sharp tongue and dazzling eyes were beginning to have an effect on me. I was only 16, after all, so what right had the great lady to terrorise me in this way? ‘Now off you trot this instant, and check your key number with the porter,’ she demanded. I showed her my key. ‘Look, the numbers match, but by all means, you check with the porter if you wish,’ I suggested, opening the door and walking in. Lotte’s dressing table was full of her private, personal paraphernalia .  .  . maybe Vivien had a point, maybe there had been a mistake. Still, I trusted Robin, my wizard of an agent; he probably represented Lotte Lenya too, and had arranged  it all beforehand. I sat down as Robin had instructed to await the arrival of the costume designer, Bumble Dawson who was to dress me. Bumble was Vivien’s best friend at that time. Suddenly Miss Leigh flounced in, stuffing a sheet of paper into my hand. ‘That’s a list of colours you can’t wear,’ she announced before flouncing out again. Every colour was on that list except black. Rising star: Sarah in 1965, three years into her relationship with Laurence Olivier . Bumble turned away from me after reading Vivien’s long list. ‘Bitch,’ she mumbled under her breath, thinking I hadn’t heard. ‘We’ll show her .  .  .’ Indeed, she did. For my walk-on role, Bumble dressed me in an overwhelmingly soft, sumptuously sexy black leather suit, well ahead of its time. The moment I appeared on the set Warren did a double-take, which Vivien caught. He then picked up a copy of Esquire magazine, placed it in front of his face, walked over the stage floor and made a beeline for me. He stood there, directly in front of me, pointing to his face in close-up on the magazine’s cover. Suddenly he whipped it away, revealing his real face. ‘Hi, my name’s Warren Beatty,’ he said. He gave a slight bow before returning to his chair and glancing toward Vivien as he went. From then on, I felt distinctly uncomfortable, with Vivien’s vixen eyes glued to either Warren or me all day. It was obvious to me that they were having an affair. If only I could have pacified Vivien by telling her that Warren’s advances meant nothing to me – he wasn’t my type at all – the day might have turned out quite, quite differently. But I found Vivien to be a distinctly brittle, dark and jealous woman. Since it was my first day in  the movie world, I presumed that this egomaniacal behaviour must be the norm. As fate would have it, a few years later I was invited to a tea party at the home of the actor Robert Morley in Henley. I recall it being a beautiful afternoon, and the garden was packed with showbiz types. About halfway through the afternoon, a lady dressed in black wafted across the lawn. Her escort led her to a chair in the shade under a tree. I bided my time and then I went over with a plate of cakes and offered her one. She looked at me in a puzzled manner. ‘Have we met before?’ she asked in a somewhat tired voice. ‘Yes, on The Roman Spring Of Mrs Stone,’ I replied. ‘You told me I could only wear black.’ ‘Of course .  .  . ,’ she replied, and remembering, she sort of shrugged an embarrassed apology. Our eyes were drawn to her outfit. ‘Black suits you,’ I told her truthfully. I’ll never forget the inconsolable fragility within her smile, the ravishing beauty now ravaged by life. Whatever the truth about the relationship between Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh – and the truth, being such a pliable substance, is always in the middle somewhere – one thing is for sure: when Larry and Vivien split up most of the chattering classes sided with her. Sarah Miles, whose screen credits include Hope And Glory, Lady Caroline Lamb and White Mischief, has turned her Sussex manor house into a retreat for healing and meditation.

"A 23-year-old online poker star has beaten the reigning World Series of Poker Player of the Year in a $1million buy-in charity poker tournament. Holden, Massachusetts, resident Daniel Colman won $15.3million on Tuesday in the Big One for One Drop poker event in Las Vegas. It's the second-largest payout in the series' history, behind only the $18million paid out in the inaugural Big One event in 2012. Mr Colman, a professional card player, refused to talk to reporters after winning the tournament, or even smile, according to The Las Vegas Sun. Daniel Colman of Massachusetts outlasted 41 other poker players to win this $15.3million pile of cash at the Big One for One Drop tournament in Las Vegas . Eventually he was persuaded to pose with his winnings and special bracelet, but declined every request for an interview to discuss how he outlasted 41 other players during the three-day event. He wouldn't even talk to ESPN, which is planning to air a six-hour documentary later this month chronicling his victory. Instead Mr Colman sped out of the Rio's Amazon Room within five minutes of the high point of his short career, accompanied by Olivier Busquet and Haralados Voulgaris, high-rolling gamblers presumed to have bankrolled part of his buy-in, the paper reported. Mr Colman, or one of his handlers, apparently said as they rushed out the door that he had 'no interest in promoting poker.' Daniel Negreanu, the famed poker player and Canada native who took second place at the tournament, discussed the event afterward . Just two months ago Mr Colman had just $350,000 in live tournament earnings to his name. Now he's earned more than $18million, the fourth-most any American has made playing poker, according to the Hendon Mob poker database. 'Really he’s a class act, a good kid and I really like the way he plays,' said Daniel Negreanu, the famed poker player and Canada native whom Mr Colman bested, according to Card Player. 'He plays a lot different than a lot of the other young kids, because he’s a lot more careful.' Mr Negreanu took home $8million for his second-place finish. In a 2013 interview with HUSNG.com, Mr Colman said he almost gave up poker the year before to pursue his education. 'Summer of 2012, I was making plans to go back to college and give up poker, but I messed up my applications and then ultimately decided to give poker one last go around,' he said. 'It was winter in Montreal and I was playing every single day. After that, I moved to Rio de Janiero where I definitely didn’t play as much, and now I am back in Montreal in the summer when the weather is nice so my grind isn’t ideal here, but it’s still pretty good.  I’ve also made a lot of trips to Vegas, New York, and back home in Massachusetts, as well as one trip to Sweden for a week.' The Big One tournament raised $4.6million for the One Drop Foundation, a nonprofit created by Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte and dedicated to providing clean water to developing countries. The event attracts businessmen and poker professionals alike.","Daniel Colman beat out 41 other players during the three-day event to win the second-largest payout in the series' history .

"MH370 searchers have said electronic 'pings' initially thought to have come from missing Malaysian Airlines flight may not have emanated from the plane at all. A senior Australian naval officer said he 'increasingly suspects' some of the signals detected last month didn't come from the jetliner's black-box flight recorders, piling further doubts over the search effort. Australian naval Commander James Lybrand said of four 'pings' picked up by the U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, two were too weak to have been from a man-made device. Scroll down for video . Sonar 'pings': U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, that picked up the signals last month, is lowered into the Indian Ocean once more . Too . weak: A total of four signals, two on Saturday April 5 and two on Tuesday April 8, were detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the . search for flight MH370. But two of them now appear to have been too weak to . have been from a man-made devic . Search teams picked up two signals on April 5 at a frequency of 33.5kHz before two more were received three days later at 27kHz. While both are significantly lower than the 37.5kHz frequency black box beacons are designed to emit, the April 5 signals are still possible, down perhaps to weakening batteries or the 'vagaries of deep-sea conditions'. Cmdr Lybrand, captain of the Ocean Shield vessel, said: 'As far as frequency goes, between 33 kHz and 27 kHz is a pretty large jump.' He did say the authorities still believe that the two April 5 signals, one of which was held for 2 hours and 20 minutes - are consistent with black-box locator beacons. Fresh doubts: Australian naval Commander James Lybrand said while both readings are significantly lower than the 37.5kHz frequency black box beacons are designed to emit, the April 5 signals are still possible, down perhaps to weakening batteries or the 'vagaries of deep-sea conditions' So what was it? Dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between 0.2kHz and 150kHz to obtain sonic information about their environment . Cmdr Lybrand did not give any clues as to what may have emitted the April 8 'pings' if they did not indeed come from MH370. Dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between 0.2kHz and 150kHz to obtain sonic information about their environment. Experts say dolphins' lower frequency vocalizations (between about 0.2 and 50kHz) are likely used in social communication while higher frequency clicks (40 to 150 kHz) are primarily used for spacial awareness. Days after the signals were detected, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was 'very confident' they were from the . black box on MH370. Embarrassing: Days after the signals were detected, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was 'very confident' they were from the black box on MH370 . 'We have very much narrowed down the search area...and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from MH370,' he said. 'We have a series of detections, some lasting for quite a long period of time. 'We're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade. We're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires. 'I really don't want to give any more information than that at this stage...as a sign of respect to the Chinese people and their families.' The British firm whose satellites helped track the final route of missing Malaysian Airlines airliner MH370, is to offer a free, basic tracking service to prevent other flights from disappearing. Inmarsat said today that the service would be offered to all 11,000 commercial passenger aircraft which are already equipped with Inmarsat satellite connection, comprising virtually 100 percent of the world's long haul commercial fleet. It's launch comes two months after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 went missing without a trace on March 8 with 239 passengers on board. It still has not been found despite a multi-agency, international search effort, including fruitless analysis by Inmarsat's own network of satellites. Nerve centre: The control room at Inmarsat. MH370 automatically sent hourly signals to a satellite belonging to the British firm after the plane's transponder and all communication systems had shut down. Yet, not a single piece of wreckage from the lost plane has been found, not even after a new analysis led investigators to change the focus of their search yet again . It was very brief electronic 'pings' from Inmarsat equipment on the lost plane that prompted investigators to look for wreckage in the Indian Ocean. 'In the wake of the loss of MH370, we believe this is simply the right thing to do,' Chief Executive Rupert Pearce said. 'This offer responsibly, quickly and at little or no cost to the industry, addresses in part the problem brought to light by the recent tragic events around MH370.' It said at its results last week that it would make available free data transfers for a position reporting service. It would see a plane determine its location using GPS and then . transmit that data - together with a heading, speed and altitude - over . Inmarsat's global network of satellites every 15 minutes. Still nothing: A map of the most recent search area, which is 5,700 feet off the coast of Perth . Looking: Captain Flt Lt Tim McAlevey of the Royal New Zealand Air Force flying a P-3 Orion during a search trying to locate missing Malaysia Airways Flight MH370 over the Indian Ocean . The Malaysian Airlines jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on March 8 and data from Inmarsat's satellite network was analysed to deduce the airliner's flight path. But it has still not been found and investigators appear no closer to finding it as they were two months ago when the plane mysteriously vanished from the world's radars. Not a single piece of wreckage from the lost plane has been found, not even after a new analyses led investigators to repeatedly change the focus of their search. The latest search area is based on extremely limited satellite data combined with radar data taken some five hours before the plane is believed to have gone down. It is, as one search official said, 'a very inexact science.' The aircraft could indeed still be in the area planes and ships from several countries have been combing in recent weeks. Each unsuccessful day, though, adds to the skepticism. Disappeared: The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 which vanished two months ago without trace . A source told the New Straits Times that if they were to find debris from the jet it would be down to 'luck' and they might need to expand the search . Sources said that while the plane could be on land, the possibility of a specific country hiding the plane was 'absurd' 'Without any kind of proof, uncertainty rules the day,' said Tim Brown, a satellite imagery expert at GlobalSecurity.org in Alexandria, Virginia. 'People still can't wrap their head around how a modern airplane that big could just go missing in the modern world.' The focus of the search has changed repeatedly since air traffic controllers lost contact with the Boeing 777 between Malaysia and Vietnam. It began in the South China Sea, then shifted toward the Strait of Malacca to the west, where Malaysian officials eventually confirmed that military radar had detected the plane. Then came evidence that the plane had continued flying for at least five hours after contact was lost. The plane automatically sent hourly signals to a satellite belonging to Inmarsat after the plane's transponder and all communication systems had shut down. The 'pings' did not include specific location information, but the team of experts who studied them said they must have come from one of two vast arcs that ran through both the Southern and Northern hemispheres. Days of costly and fruitless searches off the coast of Perth since then have employed satellites, advanced aircraft and ships, but so far there have only been dead ends. 'The problem is, we're dealing with probabilities — estimates,' Brown said of the Inmarsat data. 'It's where they THINK the plane went down.'","Searchers now say 2 of 4 'pings' picked up 'too weak' to be man made .

"The FBI has been called in to help analyse the home flight simulator belonging to the pilot of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane. A US official, speaking anonymously, says the FBI is currently working on data from the simulator while Malaysia's defense minister says investigators are trying to restore files.

I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly. 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' Captain Shah, a father-of-three, was passionate about his simulator, which he built using off-the-shelf parts.

Probe: Police in Malaysia searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah (right) and Fariq Abdul Hamid (left) after officials confirmed the plane was taken over by a 'deliberate act' Investigators probing the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 239 people on board believe it most likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the investigation said today. No wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing. An unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER is under way involving 26 nations in two vast search 'corridors': one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia's Sumatra island to west of Australia. 'The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor. A relative of a Chinese passenger aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 shows a paper reading 'Hunger strike protest, Respect life, Return my relative, Don't want become victim of politics, Tell the truth' Families of the passengers aboard the missing plane decided to organize a hunger strike to express their anger and disappointment at the handling of the situation by authorities . China, which is leading the northern corridor search with Kazakhstan, said it had not yet found any sign of the aircraft crossing into its territory. Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why. The minister in charge of the operation said the multinational search team was deploying the most sophisticated equipment available to find the plane. 'It probably is the largest peacetime armada of assets and satellite information-sharing that we have ever seen for a rescue and search operation,' Malaysia's Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said. Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital datalinks: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar. The source close to the investigation said that it was thought 'highly probable that ACARS was switched off prior to the final verbal message' received for the cockpit. A pilot of an AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft scanning the surface of the sea during a search operation for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to the west of Peninsula Malaysia . Two RAAF Orions have been assigned to the Malaysian-coordinated search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 . That message, an informal 'all right, good night' radioed to Malaysian air traffic controllers to acknowledge their handover of the plane to Vietnamese airspace, was believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot, the airline said earlier this week. Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that minutes later the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established commercial route towards India. After that, ephemeral pings picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. The data from the satellite placed the plane somewhere in one of the two corridors when the final signal was sent at 8:11 a.m. The methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, have been interpreted as suggesting strongly that foul play, rather than some kind of technical failure, was behind the disappearance. Last week, a source familiar with official U.S. assessments said it was thought most likely the plane flew south, where it presumably would have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.

He is pictured in a T-shirt with a Democracy is Dead slogan as police investigate claims he could have hijacked the plane as an anti-government protest . If it did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found - and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board. U.S. government sources said intelligence agencies had extensively analysed people on the flight but came up with no connections to terrorism or possible criminal motives. A senior U.S. official said he was 'not aware of any stones left unturned'. China has said there is no evidence that Chinese passengers, who made up over two-thirds of those on board, were involved in a hijack or act of sabotage. Australia is leading the search of the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy. It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles), roughly the size of Spain and Portugal. The U.S. Navy said it had switched mainly to using P-8A Poseidon and P-3 Orion aircraft to search for the missing plane instead of ships and helicopters. 'The maritime patrol aircraft are much more suited for this type of operation,' said Navy Lieutenant David Levy, who is on board the USS Blue Ridge. '...It's just a much more efficient way to search.'","FBI are looking at electronic files deleted from pilot's home flight simulator .

"Celebrities are inadvertently stoking a boom in 'sexting' among teenagers, a child protection chief has warned (posed by  model) Celebrities are inadvertently stoking a boom in 'sexting' among teenagers, a child protection chief has warned. Schoolchildren are copying trends to text sexually explicit messages and pictures in the same manner as some celebrities and adults, Dr Zoe Hilton has told MPs. She told the Commons Education Committee that the trend could potentially harm children who do not understand the dangerous implications of sharing the explicit images. Dr Hilton said: 'Obviously children and particularly older children are looking at celebrities and are looking at what the adult population are doing', the Telegraph reports. She added: 'I think we've got to the point with older teenagers where sexting is a normative behaviour. 'What we need to do is get them to recognise when it's abusive, when it's harmful, when it's linked to exploitation, when it's linked to the beginning point of an exploitative relationship.' She added, however, that some people will carry on regardless of 'all the safety messages in the world'. It comes after experts at an NSPCC debate warned that the fashion for imitating the sexy selfies taken by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian was putting children at risk of abuse. And earlier this week Home Secretary Theresa May warned that sending a single 'sext' or sexual online message to an under-16 could become illegal. Ms May has asked officials to carry out an 'urgent' review on whether the law needs to be tightened. At present there is no specific offence against an adult sexual messaging with under-16s, except when it contains graphic images, or if an adult attempts to meet up with their victim to engage them in a sexual act. Campaigners argue it is vital to close this loophole so offenders can be stopped before they have a chance to groom their potential victim. Kim Kardashian has recently been singled out for criticism at an NSPCC debate, because she is notorious for sharing provocative images of her body . Miss Kardashian's habit of posting explicit sexual images of herself on the internet is said to be encouraging young girls to do the same and making them vulnerable to online predators. The reality TV star found herself singled out for criticism at an NSPCC debate last week, because she is notorious for sharing provocative images of her body with her 25million Twitter followers on a daily basis. Last week she generated headlines around the world by posing naked for a magazine shoot, with the pictures circulating freely on the internet. Nazir Afzal – the chief prosecutor for the North West of England who helped bring the Rochdale grooming gang to justice in 2012 for abusing up to 47 girls – said Miss Kardashian was tempting young girls into sexualising themselves and presenting opportunities to predators. His comments were echoed by Government adviser Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers' Union, who was also at the event held at the London School of Economics. Mr Bailey said the prevalence for sexting and sending sexual imagery among teenagers had become normalised, and raised his concerns that many 'indecent child images are actually self-generated'. The chief prosecutor for the North West of England said Miss Kardashian was tempting young girls into sexualising themselves and presenting opportunities to predators . Talking about the girls who become influenced by celebrities, Mr Afzal said: 'The sexualisation of children does not help. The reality is that younger and younger children these days are now exposed to the kinds of things, I saw Kim Kardashian a couple of days ago [the magazine images]. 'It's those kinds of things, role models out there saying this is the way to live your lives.

Mr Bailey added: 'The idea of what was regarded as pornography, and what you see being very much available now, is very, very different.

"If it seems like it never stops raining, blame the Russians. Or even the North Koreans. CIA chiefs fear hostile nations are trying to manipulate the world’s weather, a conference heard. A leading academic has told how he got a mysterious phone call asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding. Professor Alan Robock, from Rutgers University in New Jersey, said: ‘Consultants working for the CIA rang and said we’d like to know if someone is controlling the world’s climate would we know about it? Scroll down for video . A leading academic revealed how he got a mysterious phone call asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding. File photo . ‘Of course they were also asking - if we control someone else’s climate would they then know about it.’ The professor is one of many scientists from around the world are actively looking at manipulating the weather as a way of combating climate change. Geoengineering techniques range from cloud seeding, in which chemicals are sprayed by planes trigger rainfall, to shooting mirrors into space to reflect sunlight and cool the Earth. Professor Robock told the callers that any attempts to meddle with the weather on a large scale would be detectable. However, he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s  annual conference in San Jose, that the weather has been weaponised in the past. During the Vietnam War, US scientists tried to increase rainfall to hamper the enemy’s progress by spraying particles into the clouds. And the CIA seeded clouds over Cuba ‘to make it rain and ruin the sugar harvest’. Professor Alan Robock, from Rutgers University in New Jersey, got a mysterious phone call asking whether foreign countries could be triggering droughts or flooding . Asked how he felt when he got the call, the professor said: ‘Scared. ‘I’d learned of lots of other things the CIA had done that haven’t followed the rules and that wasn’t how I wanted my tax money spent. ‘I think this research has to be open and international, so there isn’t any question of using it for hostile purposes.’ To add to the intrigue, the CIA is believed to have helped fund a major report into geoengineering. Published last week by the prestigious US National Academy of Sciences, the report mentions the ‘US intelligence community’ in its list of sponsors, alongside organisations such as Nasa. Professor Robock said the CIA had told one of his colleagues it wanted to fund the report, but apparently did not want this fact to be too obvious. He said: ‘The CIA is a major funder of the National Academies report so that makes me really worried who is going to be in control.’ He added that the tension created by any large-scale meddling in the climate could escalate to such an extent that it would end in all-out war. The professor said: ‘If one country wants to control the climate in one way, and another doesn’t want it or if they try to shoot down the planes...if there is no agreement it could result in terrible consequences.’","CIA chiefs fear hostile nations are trying to manipulate the world’s weather .

"Counter terrorism police have contacted Sydney man and onetime terror accused Zaky Mallah and asked him for an ISIS flag. Just over four hours into the Martin Place siege, officers the NSW Police Joint Counter Terrorism Team  and asked him if he could give them an ISIS flag. Zaky Mallah, 30, from Westmead in western Sydney offered the Counter Terrorist police the flag that hangs on the wall of his apartment, the moderate Islamic Front flag, but 'they weren't interested'. Scroll down for video . Counter terrorism police contacted Zaky Mallah four hours into the Martin Place siege and requested an ISIS flag. He offered his Islamic Front flag (pictured, on the wall behind Mr Mallah) but police weren't interested . Flag request: Counter terrorism police contacted Zaky Mallah and asked him for an ISIS flag, which he didn't have . Counter terrorism police made the request to Zaky Mallah as officers staked out the Lindt cafe in Martin Place (pictured) as the siege entered its fifth hour . The news comes as Radio 2GB broadcaster Ray Hadley said he had three telephone conversations with a young man who is among the hostages and that the hostage said the gunman had made several demands. Earlier, the gunman appeared to force the hostages to hold up another Islamic flag, the Shahada which bears the words in Arabic, 'There is no God but Allah'. Mr Mallah, once accused of terrorism but acquitted, has turned against extremists since a visit to Syria . Mr Mallah was the first person to be charged with terrorism back in 2003 after he made a video which Federal Police and ASIO said contained a planned suicide attack on federal government offices in Sydney. Mallah, a Lebanese Australian, was charged under Australia's then new anti-terrorism laws after he made the video. He spent two years in the high maximum security Multi Purpose Unit at Goulburn prison awaiting trial, before being acquitted. It was only in 2009 that he was able to obtain an Australian passport. Two years ago Mr Mallah travelled to Syria and lived with the FSA rebels engaged in the bloody civil war against Muslim hardliner President Bashar el Assad 'before it got crazy over there'. After returning home, he encouraged young people to go to Syria and engage in jihad to experience the freedom fight taken up against El Assad, but since the rise of ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra he has changed his mind. The Shahada flag apparently carried into the Martin Place siege by the gunman is also the emblem of Jabhat al-Nusra.","Counter Terrorist police have asked Sydney man Zaky Mallah for an ISIS flag .

"She has grown to be something of a national treasure since becoming a judge on the Great British Bake Off. But Mary Berry, who has no problem whipping up a Victoria Sponge, has managed to upset Yotam Ottolenghi over her hummus recipe. The Israeli cook, who is famed for transforming vegetarian cooking in the UK, was outraged that the baking star added olive oil to the dish – and leaves out the tahini. Yotam Ottolenghi said he was 'upset' that Mary Berry added olive oil to hummus recipe and leaves out tahini . During his appearance at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in Gloucestershire he said: ‘Hummus cannot have anything but chickpeas, soaked overnight and never from a tin, lemon juice and tahini and water and a little bit of garlic. ‘Some people put olive oil in their hummus, or other oil, which is a big no no. 'That makes me really upset.' But after watching the 79-year-old preparing her version of hummus on television he was left fuming. He added: ‘I love Mary Berry but I saw her make hummus in one of her shows without tahini and it had chickpeas crushed with olive oil.’ The renowned restaurant owner reportedly put his head in his hands as he became frustrated at the thought. Mary Berry says you could also add chopped coriander leaves and a pinch of cumin to hummus . He was further infuriated to learn that she uses tinned chickpeas, among other non-traditional ingredients. Her recipe recommends adding chopped coriander leaves, a pinch of ground cumin and three tablespoons of Greek yoghurt. She also says that tahini – a thick paste made from ground sesame seeds – can be used if you like the ‘traditional sesame seed flavour of hummus’. And Berry is not alone in the oil debate – Delia Smith adds olive oil to her hummus and Nigella Lawson prefers garlic oil. While Heston Blumenthal further waded into the debate, saying he would even consider leaving out the lemon juice. ‘I use one third olive oil and two thirds groundnut oil,’ he told the Times. ‘The oil brings richness. You have got to put in salt and you need acidity, lemon juice or vinegar. Without that it would all be wrong.’ But Ottolenghi, who maintains olive oil is fine as long it is drizzled on top of the dish, said the dispute is far more heated in Jerusalem. One of the chapters in his books entitled Hummus wars explains the so-called ‘hummusia fetish’. He says there is evidence in scriptures that Jews ate it in biblical times but that ‘nobody seriously challenges the Palestinian hegemony in making hummus, even though both they and the Jews like calling it their own’. The dip has become so popular among Brits that a survey last year revealed that 41 per cent of people had a pot in the fridge. And we reportedly get through 12,000 tonnes a year with sales at Waitrose growing by 40 per cent annually.

"A new lawsuit has revealed the extent of former President Clinton's friendship with a fundraiser who was later jailed for having sex with an underage prostitute. Bill Clinton's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who served time in 2008 for his illegal sexual partners, included up multiple trips to the onetime billionaire's private island in the Caribbean where underage girls were allegedly kept as sex slaves. The National Enquirer has released new details about the two men's friendship, which seems to have ended abruptly around the time of Epstein's arrest. Naming names: A lawsuit between Jeffrey Epstein (right, in 2011) and his legal team has included multiple mentions about the convicted pedophile's connection to former President Bill Clinton (left, earlier this month) Pedophile paradise: The lawsuit included flight records that showed Clinton made multiple trips to Epstein's private island, Little St James (pictured), between 2002 and 2005. Women were reportedly kept there as sex slaves . Tales of orgies and young girls being shipped to the island, called Little St. James, have been revealed as part of an ongoing lawsuit between Epstein and his former lawyers Scott Rothstein and Bradley Edwards. It is unclear what the basis of the suit is, but they go on to call witness testimony from some of the frequent guests at Epstein's island to talk about the wild parties that were held there in the early 2000s. Convicted: Epstein was investigated in 2005 after a woman reported that he paid her 14-year-old daughter for sex . Flight logs pinpoint Clinton's trips on Epstein's jet between the years 2002 and 2005, while he was working on his philanthropic post-presidential career and while his wife Hillary was a Senator for their adopted state of New York. 'I remember asking Jeffrey what's Bill Clinton doing here kind fo thing, and he laughed it off and said well he owes me a favor,' one unidentified woman said in the lawsuit, which was filed in Palm Beach Circuit Court. The woman went on to say how orgies were a regular occurrence and she recalled two young girls from New York who were always seen around the five-house compound but their personal backstories were never revealed. At least one woman on the compound was there unwillingly, as the suit identifies a woman as Jane Doe 102. She 'was forced to live as one of Epstein's underage sex slaves for years and was forced to have sex with... politicians, businessmen, royalty, academicians, etc,' the lawsuit says according to The Enquirer. Epstein's sexual exploits have been documented since 2005, when a woman in Palm Beach contacted police saying that her 14-year-old daughter had been paid $300 to massage him and then have sex. The claim prompted a nearly year-long investigation that led to the eventual charge of soliciting prostitution which came as part of a plea deal. He spent 13 months of a 18-month sentence in jail and remains a registered sex offender. Several of his famous friends cut ties- including Clinton and then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer who returned his campaign donations- but not all of them: Prince Andrew reportedly stayed at Epstein's mansion in New York in 2010, months after he was released from jail. Keeping ties: Clinton was also friends with an unnamed woman who stored pictures of underage girls for Epstein, and though Clinton cut ties with Epstein after his arrest, he invited the woman to Chelsea's 2010 wedding . Clinton's connection to Epstein, who . worked as a financier and education philanthropist before more than 40 . women came forward with claims about him being a sexual predator, has . been long-established, but The Enquirer also tells how the former . president was also friends with some of Epstein's seedy acquaintances. The . lawsuit claims that Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who 'kept . images of naked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit . underage children for Epstein... and photographed underage females in . sexually explicit poses'. While he cut off ties with Epstein, this woman's abuses apparently did not end their relationship as she was reportedly one of the 400 guests at Chelsea Clinton's 2010 wedding. Latest ladies: Clinton was pictured posing for a photo with Barbie Girl (left) and Ava Adora (right), two known prostitutes who work at the Bunny Brothel in Nevada . Though the lawsuit may be bringing up sexual skeleton's from Clinton's past, he has added to the drama of late by posing for a photo with two known prostitutes at a fundraiser in Los Angeles last month. The drama of his extramarital affairs is apparently just one concern for Clinton family loyalists, as a Wall Street Journal article released today details how . 'I'm not in the political camp; I'm in the friends camp. And the friends camp definitely has concerns about her running,' the former Secretary of State's friend Linda Bloodworth-Thomason told the paper, .","The former president was friends with Jeffrey Epstein, a financier who was arrested in 2008 for soliciting underage prostitutes .

"Divers in Sweden have discovered a rare collection of Stone Age artefacts buried deep beneath the Baltic Sea. Archaeologists believe the relics were left by Swedish nomads 11,000 years ago and the discovery may be evidence of one of the oldest settlements ever found in the Nordic region. Some of the relics are so well preserved, reports have dubbed the find 'Sweden’s Atlantis' and suggested the settlement may have been swallowed whole by the sea in the same way as the mythical island in the Atlantic Ocean. Divers in Sweden have discovered a rare collection of Stone Age artefacts buried beneath the Baltic Sea, pictured. Archaeologists believe the relics were left by Swedish nomads 11,000 years ago and the discovery may be evidence of one of the oldest settlements ever found in the Nordic region, dubbed 'Sweden's Atlantis' The artefacts were discovered by Professor Bjorn Nilsson from Soderton University, and a team from Lunds University, during an archaeological dive at Hano, off the coast of Skane County in Sweden. Buried 16 metres below the surface, Nilsson uncovered wood, flint tools, animal horns and ropes. Among the most notable items found include a harpoon carving made from an animal bone, and the bones of an ancient animal called aurochs. Aurochs are ancestors of modern-day cattle and lived through Europe before becoming extinct in the early 1600s. The last reported auroch died in Poland in 1627. This find is significant because it suggests a date for when these items would have been used. Many of the artefacts have been preserved because the diving location is rich in a sediment called gyttja. Atlantis is the name for the large island or continent said to have been swallowed up by the Atlantic Ocean centuries ago. Tales of the mythical island first appeared in books by Greek philosopher Plato around 370BC. In all of his books, Plato used interesting stories to contextualise and explain his ideas about government and philosophy and it is thought the story of Atlantis formed part of this. However, this has also lead to claims the stories were made up purely for effect. Despite this, many maps have previously featured Atlantis, including the Map of the New World by Sebastian Muller, 1540, pictured, that shows Atlantis Island in red at the bottom, labelled Nouus Orbis. Atlantis was written about again in 1882 by Ignatius Donnelly who claimed Atlantis was not only real, but influenced cultures including the Egyptians and Mayans. Studies of rock found at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean concluded that there has never been a large island buried in the region, and many people now think Plato may have got the location of the island wrong. Other claims suggest the island may have been near modern-day Santorini, off the coast of Greece. Black, gel-like Gyttja is formed when peat begins to decay. As the peat is buried, the amount of oxygen drops and it is thought this lack of oxygen prevented the organic artefacts from being lost. Nilsson told The Local: ‘Around 11,000 years ago there was a build-up in the area - a lagoon of sorts - and all the tree and bone pieces are preserved in it. 'If the settlement was on dry land we would only have the stone-based things, nothing organic.’ The dive was part of a three-year excavation partially funded by the Swedish National Heritage Board. Archaeologists are continuing the dig, and are now particularly interested to see whether there is also an ancient burial site in the region. The artefacts were discovered by Professor Bjorn Nilsson from Soderton University during an archaeological dive at Hano, off the coast of Skane County in Sweden, marked at A. The dive was part of a three-year excavation partially funded by the Swedish National Heritage Board . Atlantis is the name for the large island or continent said to have been swallowed up by the Atlantic Ocean centuries ago. An artist's illustration is pictured. Tales of the mythical island first appeared in books by Greek philosopher Plato around 370BC - although the remains of the island have never been found . This would add weight to the claims it was once a settlement location that has since been lost at sea. If the region was a settlement, it would have similarities with Atlantis - the mythical island first referred to by Greek philosopher Plato. Atlantis was said to have been a large island, or even a continent, in the Atlantic Ocean that sank and vanished almost overnight. However, this underwater civilisation has never been found, and many claim Plato either made it up, or the location was not in the Atlantic Ocean. Other claims suggest the island may have been near modern-day Santorini, off the coast of Greece. Nilsson is quick to dismiss the claims the settlement is ‘Sweden’s Atlantis’, however, stressing that the Swedes at the time would have been nomadic. This means that the settlement may have only been temporary, and that a village never permanently existed on the site - unlike the mythical Atlantis.","Divers found a harpoon, tools, horns and the bones of ancient cattle .

"Most of our studies of Mars so far have focused on whether water could have once existed on its surface millions or billions of years ago. But now researchers at the University of Michigan say small amounts of liquid water could form on the planet today - despite its below-freezing temperatures. To come to the conclusion they created chambers that mimic the conditions on Mars, and found that they were able to make liquid water form for brief periods of time. Researchers at the University of Michigan have created the conditions on Mars to show that liquid water can exist on its surface - for brief periods of time. Here PhD student and researcher Erik Fischer sets up the Mars Atmospheric Chamber in the Space Research Building . Liquid water is an essential ingredient for life as we know it, and Mars is one of the very few places in the solar system where scientists have seen promising signs of it. Evidence of water on Mars dates . back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues . of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and . fogs. Viking orbiters that . followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing . how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars . is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist . on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have . been warmer and wetter in the past. In . June last year, Curiosity found Powerful evidence that water good . enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of . soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface . of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. This includes gullies down crater rims, instrument readings and in self-portraits taken by the Phoenix lander several years ago that appeared to show wet beads on the lander's leg. No one has directly detected liquid water beyond Earth, though; the U-M experiments are among the first to test theories about how it could exist in a climate as cold as that on Mars. The researchers found that a type of salt present in Martian soil can readily melt ice it touches - just like salts do on Earth's slippery winter walkways and roads. 'For me, the most exciting thing is that I can now understand how the droplets formed on the Phoenix leg,' said Dr Nilton Renno, a professor of atmospheric, oceanic and space sciences who led the research. In 2008, Dr Renno was the first to notice strange globules in photos Phoenix sent back. Over several weeks, the globules seemed to grow and coalesce. While Dr Renno deemed them water and suggested that salts on the planet's surface might make it so, many of his colleagues disagreed. Salts had never been found on Mars. But then they were. Among those that Phoenix detected is calcium perchlorate, a mixture of calcium, chlorine and oxygen that's found in arid places like the Atacama Desert in Chile. Years . later, the Curiosity rover found it elsewhere on Mars. Now scientists . believe it and other salts are sprinkled across the planet's surface. In 2008, Dr Renno was the first to notice strange globules in photos Nasa's Phoenix lander sent back from Mars. Over several weeks, the globules seemed to grow and coalesce. He deemed them water and suggested that salts on the planet's surface might make it so, which has now been confirmed . Nasa's stationary Phoenix lander touched down on the surface of Mars on 25 May 2008. It was the first successful landing in a Martian polar region and remained operational until November 2008, during which time it dug into the ground to research the history of water on Mars . In the case of Phoenix, Dr Renno believes the craft's landing thrusters blasted away the topsoil, exposing the ice and melting it. That formed muddy saltwater that splashed on the lander's leg as it touched down in the northern polar region. The salts allowed the droplets to remain liquid. Their existence and stability, Renno says, tipped scientists off to a cycle that doesn't need always need help from an Earth-borne spacecraft. The U-M researchers recreated the Phoenix landing site conditions in their lab in metal cylinders two feet (0.6 metres) high and five feet (1.5 metres) long. The late Martian spring and early summer temperatures in the chambers ranged from -120 to -20°C (-185 to -5°F). Atmospheric pressure hovered around 1 per cent of Earth's while relative humidity varied, but for most experiments it was set to 100 per cent. This image shows the team's successful attempt to create water in a Mars-like environment. On the left is salt by itself, during which time no water formed. If salt was placed on top of water ice, however, as shown on the right, they found that liquid water was able to form . They tested two scenarios: salt by itself and salt on top of water ice. In the salt-only experiments, they put millimeter-thick layers of salt on a temperature-controlled plate to simulate Mars-like soil. Even after more than three hours, no liquid water formed. When the researchers placed salty soil directly on ice three millimetres (0.12 inches) thick, however, drops of liquid water formed within minutes when the chambers reached -73°C (-100°F). That is well within the range of conditions observed at the Phoenix landing site. The findings show how small amounts of liquid water could exist across a large swath of Mars' surface and shallow subsurface, from its polar regions to its mid-latitudes, for several hours a day during the spring and early summer. Such a cycle could form gullies, Dr Renno says, that flow, freeze, thaw and flow again. Water could also form just beneath the surface. The chamber simulates the atmospheric conditions of Mars, usually at -50°C/-50°F (shown), in hopes of producing water through the interaction of salt with the atmospheric conditions simulated by the chamber. The resulting research allows Astrobiologists to postulate about the potential of life on Mars . Dr Renno says the water wouldn't necessarily need to stay liquid indefinitely for it to support microbial life now or have supported it in the past, and even just a tiny droplet of water is enough for bacteria to grab hold of and survive. 'Mars is the planet in our solar system that is most similar to Earth,' added Erik Fisher, first author on the new paper and doctoral student in the epartment of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences (AOSS). 'Studies suggest that Mars used to be even more Earth-like in the past, with flowing water on the surface. 'By studying the formation of liquid water on Mars we can learn about possibilities of life outside Earth and look for resources for future missions.'","Researchers at the University of Michigan simulated Mars in a lab .
They found that they were able to make liquid water survive in its climate .
This suggests that liquid water can form on the surface of Mars even today .

"Scientists have created a machine with the potential to read our dreams while we sleep. Researchers in the US say it is so powerful that it can extract images from people’s brains and display them on a screen. The data from the brain scanner has already been used to detect and reconstruct images of faces that people are thinking of. Researchers believe the same technology could be used in the future to enable them to reconstruct images from people’s memories, imagination and dreams. Scientists say they have created a machine with the potential to read dreams during sleep (library image) It could also possibly be used to collect images of criminals from the minds of witnesses. Alan Cowen, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, said: ‘Our methods yield strikingly accurate neural reconstructions of faces. ‘This represents a novel and promising approach for investigating face perception, but also suggests avenues for reconstructing ‘offline’ visual experiences — including dreams, memories and imagination.’ Six volunteers were shown 300 faces while they laid inside an MRI scanner. Scientists were then able to analyse how their brains responded to dozens of different facial features including blond hair and blue eyes to dark skin and beards. When they had compiled a database of responses, they showed the volunteers a new set of faces and measured their reaction to each image. By comparing the second responses to the database, they were able to reconstruct the image they were looking at. The research is based on a theory that all human processes have a ‘neural correlate’ and that thoughts and feelings are merely a complex pattern of chemical reactions. Some neuroscientists believe there is the potential to read such patterns if they can only build sensitive enough instruments. Six volunteers were shown 300 faces while they laid inside an MRI scanner. They then compiled a database of responses used to create the machine . Mr Cowen and his fellow researchers, Brice Kuhl of New York University and Professor Marvin Chun of Yale, believe that extracting facial images is the first step towards eventually producing advanced mind-reading technology. Mr Kuhl said: ‘I study memory, and it’s hard not to be excited by the prospect of being able to reconstruct the images that we bring to mind when we remember something. ‘We are certainly heading in the direction of reconstructing dreams too. Something that looks like a high-definition movie of your dreams is not going to happen in the immediate future, but we have already seen improvements in the sensitivity of these methods.’ Mr Cowen assured the public that the technology did not enable them to forcibly extract information from subjects, however. He told Fox News: ‘This sort of technology can only read active parts of the brain. So you couldn’t read passive memories – you would have to get the person to imagine the memory to read it. ‘It’s a matter of time, and eventually – maybe 200 years from now – we’ll have some way of reading inactive parts . of the brain. ‘But that’s a much harder problem, as it involves measuring very fine details of brain structure that we don’t even really understand.’","Scientists have created a machine which can read dreams while we sleep .

"The President of Turkey has suggested French security forces are to blame for the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris last week, since the culprits had recently served prison sentences. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused the West of 'playing games with the Islamic world', warning fellow Muslims to be 'aware'. Erdogan said Muslims are 'paying the price' for the attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Jewish kosher supermarket in Paris last week. Scroll down for video . Blame game: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested French security forces were behind the Paris attacks as they 'track' former prisoners and the culprits in the Charlie Hebdo shootings had served time . 'French citizens carry out such a massacre, and Muslims pay . the price,' Erdogan said yesterday. 'That's very meaningful ... Doesn't their intelligence . organisation track those who leave prison? 'Games are being played with the Islamic world, we need to . be aware of this. 'The West's hypocrisy is obvious. As Muslims, we've never taken part in terrorist massacres. Behind these lie racism, hatespeech and Islamophobia,' Erdogan added. Erdogan also denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin . Netanyahu for attending a solidarity rally in France on Sunday . with other world leaders after the Paris attacks. 'How can a man who has killed 2,500 people in Gaza with . state terrorism wave his hand in Paris, like people are waiting . in excitement for him to do so? How dare he go there?' he said. Erdogan denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his attendance at the Unity rally in Paris  alongside, from left to right,  Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, EU President Donald Tusk and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas . Erdogan made the comments at a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ankara on Monday . Erdogan did not attend the Sunday march, though Turkish . Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu participated. Erdogan is not the only senior Turkish politicianpublicly voicing conspiracy theories over the Paris attacks. The Mayor of Ankara, Melih Gokcek, said he was convinced the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was behind the attacks, linking them to France's recent move towards recognising Palestine as an independent state. 'Mossad is definitely behind such incidents… it is boosting enmity towards Islam.' Mr Gokcek said, according to Financial Times. In Russia, several pro-Kremlin commentators blamed the United States and the CIA for the attack, the newspaper reported. One, Alexei Martynov, director of the International Institute for New States, said 'I am sure that some American supervisors are responsible for the terror attacks in Paris, or in any case the Islamists who carried them out.' The former Imam and recruiter of jihadists, and the man who helped radicalise the Kouachi brothers has come forward to condemn the Charlie Hebdo murders. Farid Benyettou, revealed as working as an intern in the hospital where many of the dead and dying were taken said: 'It was a cowardly assassination and monstrous.' Farid Benyettou has condemned the Charlie Hebdo murders, despite radicalising one of the brothers involved in the shootings . His face hidden, the 32 year old told i-Tele: 'Whatever was done, whether it be the cowardly and monstrous murder of the journalists, or of the police and members of the Jewish community – it should not be attributed to Islam. 'If you are murderers then that's your business.' Benyettou, who has since been removed from the wards of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital to finish his studies in training school, said he had come forward in the name of Islam. He said: 'I am not here to proclaim my innocence but to condemn what has been done. My innocence is not in doubt. 'Some people will say if I don't that 'Farid Beyettou may agree with what has been done' and some people may identify with that. 'No. Farid Benyettou absolutely does not agree with what happened.' Benyettou said that he had mentored Cherif Kouachi, the younger of the terrorist brothers, for around two months. He said: 'He came unexpectedly. He wanted discussion. With him it was always the same topic…. 'It all turned around combat. He was fascinated by that – his knowledge of the religion was limited to that. Having a good relationship with his neighbours, the behaviour of Muslims in every day life, he had no idea about. 'And the relationship with God did not interest him. He was someone very, very stubborn. I told him I could not agree with what he was saying about violence and that it was probably the worst crime a Muslim could commit. 'He seemed to change his stance, accept criticism. Nothing could have seen what was to come.' Then in a passionate defence of France he said: 'Some think that France oppresses Muslims. I am proof to the contrary. Yes I have a criminal record – terrorist written on it. 'I think this is the worst thing to happen yet despite this, doors have been open for me. 'I was given help, never been discriminated against. On the contrary.' Benyettou was radicalised after the arrest of his brother, Youssef Zemmouri in 1998 when security forces dismantled the Parisian Salafist Group. Self taught he became an 'emir' and taught theology courses. He was arrested along with six others in 2005 for helping to send jihadists to Iraq after the US invasion. Three years later, then aged 27, he was sentenced to six years in prison and release in 2011.","Recep Tayyip Erdoğan suggested French security forces knew of attack .

"Data: Gavin Schmidt, of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, admits there's a margin of error . The Nasa climate scientists who claimed 2014 set a new record for global warmth last night admitted they were only 38 per cent sure this was true. In a press release on Friday, Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed ‘2014 was the warmest year on record’. The claim made headlines around the world, but yesterday it emerged that GISS’s analysis – based on readings from more than 3,000 measuring stations worldwide – is subject to a margin of error. Nasa admits this means it is far from certain that 2014 set a record at all. Yet the Nasa press release failed to mention this, as well as the fact that the alleged ‘record’ amounted to an increase over 2010, the previous ‘warmest year’, of just two-hundredths of a degree – or 0.02C. The margin of error is said by scientists to be approximately 0.1C – several times as much. As a result, GISS’s director Gavin Schmidt has now admitted Nasa thinks the likelihood that 2014 was the warmest year since 1880 is just 38 per cent. However, when asked by this newspaper whether he regretted that the news release did not mention this, he did not respond. Another analysis, from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) project, drawn from ten times as many measuring stations as GISS, concluded that if 2014 was a record year, it was by an even tinier amount. Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed ‘2014 was the warmest year on record’ Its report said: ‘Numerically, our best estimate for the global temperature of 2014 puts it slightly above (by 0.01C) that of the next warmest year (2010) but by much less than the margin of uncertainty. ‘Therefore it is impossible to conclude from our analysis which of 2014, 2010, or 2005 was actually the warmest year… the Earth’s average temperature for the past decade has changed very little.’ Scientists disagree over its significance, but there is little doubt that the rapid warming of the 1980s and early 1990s has slowed – although greenhouse gas emissions have surged. Bob Ward, of the Grantham Institute on Climate Change, said the new figures showed the notion that global warming had ‘stopped’ was a ‘myth’, although it had ‘temporarily slowed’. Since 1951, he added, the long-term trend was for warming of 0.12C per decade, and in his view, it would ‘pick up again unabated’ if emissions continued to rise. However, if the long-term rate is 0.12C per decade, this would mean the world would be 1C or so warmer by the end of the century, not 4C-5C as some have claimed. Climate sceptics insisted that the new figures showed the warming ‘pause’ had continued. Dr David Whitehouse, of the Global Warming Policy Forum, said ‘there has been no statistically significant warming trend since 1997’ – because the entire increase over this period was smaller than the error margin. Dr Ed Hawkins, associate professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said the past 15 years had seen a slightly slower rate of warming. But he added: ‘You have to take a longer view, because 15 years is too short a period. We expect natural fluctuations, volcanic eruptions and changes in solar output to sometimes slow and sometimes increase warming rates.’ Since 1880, Earth’s average surface temperature has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius), a trend that is largely driven by the increase in carbon dioxide and other human emissions into the planet’s atmosphere .","Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies claimed its analysis of world temperatures showed ‘2014 was the warmest year on record’

"Britain's ageing nuclear submarines have been issued with  ‘Code Red’ safety warnings after inspectors found radioactive leaks and a chronic shortage of Royal Navy engineers trained to repair faulty reactors, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. An official watchdog discovered major safety issues with both the UK’s nuclear-powered submarines and facilities used to repair nuclear missiles, raising the risk of a catastrophic accident involving radioactive material. Last night, experts described the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator (DNSR) report for 2012-13 as the most worrying they had seen. Code Red: Tireless, the oldest submarine in the Royal Navy fleet, which entered service in 1984, suffered damage to  its circuits earlier this year resulting in a radioactive leak . The document, obtained by this newspaper, reveals: . Head of the DNSR Dr Richard Savage wrote: ‘Significant and sustained attention is required to ensure maintenance of adequate safety performance and the rating [Red] reflects the potential impact if changes are ill-conceived or implemented. ‘The inability to sustain a sufficient . number of nuclear suitably competent personnel is the principal threat . to safety. Vulnerabilities exist in core skill areas, including safety, . propulsion, power and naval architects. In March 2007, sailors Anthony Huntrod, 20, (right) and Paul McCann, 32, (left)  were killed on HMS Tireless when a self-contained oxygen generator exploded during an Arctic exercise north of Alaska. They died trapped in a small, smoke-filled compartment. An inquest heard that there was a significant possibility the generator was salvaged from a hazardous waste depot in a cost-cutting bid  by the MoD. ‘Due to build delays with the Astute . Class, there has been a requirement to extend the Trafalgar Class beyond . their original design life in order to maintain the SSN flotilla at a . fully operational level. Some . of the emergent technical issues affecting the Trafalgar Class over the . last few years can be directly attributed to the effects of plant . ageing.’ The . report also raises concerns over whether the UK’s nuclear fleet and its . inland nuclear establishments could withstand an earthquake on the same . scale as the one that struck the Fukushima reactor plant in  Japan in . 2011. The document . notes that facilities which form part of Britain’s Defence Nuclear . Programme (DNP) require ‘continued priority attention’ to reach . recommended safety standards. Last . night, nuclear expert John Large told The Mail on Sunday that the DNSR . report revealed a crisis in Royal Navy nuclear safety. He . said: ‘This is the most self-damning and concerning report that I have . seen. We’re talking about a ticking time-bomb, with a higher risk to the . public and the environment than we previously feared. ‘The combination of a lack of nuclear . engineers, the Astute submarines being so far behind schedule and the . Trafalgar Class sailing beyond their design date is very worrying. 'The Trafalgars, including HMS Tireless, the oldest boat of the class, should be withdrawn immediately.’ HMS . Tireless, which entered service in 1984, suffered damage to  its . circuits earlier this year resulting in a radioactive leak. The . nuclear sub was patrolling off South-West England when the problem . arose, forcing its captain to return to Devonport. A more serious leak . was avoided because of swift remedial action. Nuclear . materials – including Trident missiles – are brought to the AWE’s site . at Aldermaston, Berkshire, for assembly, maintenance and . decommissioning. Warning: There are also fears over the Aldermaston centre where Trident missiles are serviced . These processes include ‘uranium polishing’ – the removal of impurities from the material in order to extend its life cycle as a component in nuclear missiles. The DNSR report states: ‘Inspection programmes have not been as comprehensive as regulators would expect. As an example, corrosion in the structural supports of a building was not identified as early as would be expected which resulted in the Office for Nuclear Regulation issuing a Safety Improvement Notice.’ Last night the AWE admitted corrosion had affected its uranium component manufacturing facility, but added repairs had been completed. An MoD spokesman said: ‘We would not operate any submarine unless it was safe to do so and this report acknowledges that we are taking  the necessary action to effectively manage the technical issues raised by the regulator. ‘It also highlights that the MoD is committed to maintaining expertise in submarine technology and operation – underlined by last month’s operational handover of the first two Astute Class submarines.’","Safety issues with UK's nuclear subs and facilities used to repair missiles .

"A hard-hitting new campaign to get black British voters to the polling booths has been launched with the help of a host of black stars. Homeland actor David Harewood, musician Tinie Tempah, former Arsenal captain Sol Campbell and Paralympic athlete Ade Adepitan have been photographed with their faces painted white as part of the striking campaign by Operation Black Vote. The campaign aims to encourage black Britons to register to vote before it's too late – with the voting registration deadline on April 20. Sol Campbell is part of a new campaign to encourage minorities to register to vote for the General Election . Posters featuring David Harewood and Tinie Tempa in a new campaign to encourage minorities to register . Four posters have been released with photographs taken by leading photographer John Rankin Waddell. A separate online advert starring Harewood, made by famous ad agency Saatchi and Saatchi, has also been released. A survey of voters in the 2010 general election put the turnout rate for white voters at 67 per cent but only 51 per cent for non-white voters. The former Premiership star said he agree to pose for the campaign to encourage black and Asian communities to use their votes on May 7 or their voices will not be heard. He said: 'I agreed to do the Operation Black Vote pictures because I wanted to highlight the problem with some sections of Britain who are not registering to vote for their future.' Campbell posed for a photograph alongside the caption: 'If you don't register to vote, you're taking the colour out of Britain.' Campbell, 40, last month ruled out standing for the Conservatives in Kensington after Sir Malcolm Rifkind announced he would be standing down. At the time he said his 'ambitions lie elsewhere in the political arena' which led to speculation he could run for London Mayor. Homeland's David Harewood said black Britons were being sidelined from politics. He said: 'If you want change, you have to vote for it. In order to vote, you have to register. We can't continue to stand on sidelines of the British democratic system, we are a part of it and our voices matter.' Former Paralympian and current TV presenter Ade Adepitan is also part of the Operation Black Vote campaign . Operation Black Vote also launched a 2015 general election manifesto with the aim of 'reclaiming democracy, empowering citizens and fighting race equalities'. It says that in the past black and minority ethnic (BME) groups presented a broad range of 'key policy demands' to all parties, but adds: 'Our experience shows that whilst all parties express interest in our proposals during elections, this interest soon evaporates once in power.' Instead OBV has created a list of manifesto points of its own, including automatic voter registration linked to the National Insurance system, the introduction of e-voting and proportional representation, voting from the age of 16, state funding of parties and a 'minister for race equality' in the Cabinet.","Sol Campbell stars in 'Operation Black Vote' encouraging minorities to vote .

"Fears are growing of a neo-fascist uprising in Ukraine as ousted president Viktor Yanukovych called for referendums in every region to determine how pro-Russian the country actually is. Hundreds of members of the ultra-nationalist Right Sector movement stormed the parliament (Rada) building in Kiev last night, smashing windows and breaking down doors. The riot erupted just hours before Russia's foreign ministry today warned that ethnic minorities in Ukraine are 'living in fear' of the expanding power of the far-right across the divided nation. Right Sector activists are angry over the killing of their leader, Oleksandr Muzychko, better known as Sashko Bily, who died in a shoot-out with police in a cafe in Rivne, in western Ukraine, on Monday. Scroll down for video . Revenge: Hundreds of members of the ultra-nationalist Right Sector movement stormed the parliament (Rada) building in Kiev last night, smashing windows and breaking down doors .

Blame game: The emergence of far-right groups such as Right Sector in Ukraine has been cited by Russia as justification for its move to annex Crimea and protect the peninsula's ethnic Russian majority from Ukrainian 'fascists' 'We will avenge ourselves on [Interior Minister] Arsen Avakov for the death of our brother,' Right Sector member Roman Koval told local media. 'The shooting of Sashko Bily is a contract killing ordered by the minister.' Meanwhile, Ukraine's deposed president Viktor Yanukovich called for each of the country's regions to hold a referendum on its status within Ukraine, instead of presidential elections planned for May 25. 'We want a vote': Meanwhile, Ukraine's deposed president Viktor Yanukovich called for each of the country's regions to hold a referendum on its status within Ukraine, instead of presidential elections planed for May 25 . Fight back: Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh (not pictured) said he plans to run for president in a May 25 election, but is a rank outsider . Well-armed: Right Sector members usually wear masks, helmets and protection for their hands and feet, and carry sticks or iron bars in case of confrontation with riot police . Hard line: Since late November, huge crowds have been camped out in central Kiev, opposing the government's partnership with Russia and calling for early elections . 'As a president who is with you with all my thoughts and soul, I urge every sensible citizen of Ukraine: Don't give in to impostors! Demand a referendum on the status of each region within Ukraine,' Yanukovich, who fled to Russia last month, was quoted as saying in an address to the people of Ukraine. Yanukovych is currently in hiding in Russia, wanted for mass murder in Ukraine after allegedly . ordering police to shoot more than 100 people during last month's . anti-government protests. He fled across the Russian border with a handful of bodyguards towards the end of February where he was granted safe haven by Russia's President Vladimir Putin. A senior White house official has caused outrage after she posted a 'selfie' on Twitter holding a sign that read: '#United­For­Ukraine @State­Dept­Spox.' US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki was accused of trivialising the crisis in Ukraine when she tweeted: 'To echo Barack Obama today - proud to stand #UnitedForUkraine. World should stand together with one voice.' The photograph showed her, in a yellow suit, giving a thumbs up and holding the sign. But her attempt at 'solving the crisis with selfies' was widely mocked online. 'Presenting The Latest US Strategy to Counter ""Russian Aggression,""' one blogger posted on zerohedge.com. '#Selfies!' Another wrote: 'No wonder Putin covers his mouth when speaking to Obama, perhaps to hide his laugh?' And one wondered: 'How flippin’ sad has the USA become?' Psaki defended the tweet, saying: 'The people of Ukraine are fighting to have their voices heard and the benefit of communicating over social media is it sends a direct message to the people that we are with them, we support their fight, their voice and their future.' Insisting he is still the rightful leader of Ukraine, he has sporadically emerged to comment on the ongoing turmoil in Ukraine. His . comments, after Moscow annexed Crimea following a referendum there in . favour of joining Russia this month, echo Russia's call for Kiev's new . leaders to enact nationwide constitutional reforms that may grant . broader powers to the country's regions. 'Only . an all-Ukrainian referendum, not a snap presidential election, can, in a . significant way, stabilise the political situation and preserve . sovereignty and Ukraine's (territorial) integrity,' he said. Ukraine remains deeply divided over protests that led to Yanukovich's ousting and many eastern Russian-speaking regions are sceptical over the policies of the new government in Kiev. The emergence of far-right groups such as Right Sector in Ukraine has been cited by Russia as justification for its move . to annex Crimea and protect the peninsula's ethnic Russian majority from . Ukrainian ‘fascists'. Russia said this month Mr Muzychko was under investigation . for fighting alongside rebels in Russia's Chechnya region in the 1990s. And as Kiev reeled from the night's unruly demonstrations, U.S. resident Barack Obama issued yet another shot across Russia's bows, demanding it take broader steps to reduce tensions in Ukraine now. 'It's well known and well acknowledged that you've seen a range of . troops massing along that border under the guise of military exercises,' he told CBS. 'But these are not what Russia would normally be doing. And, you know, it . may simply be an effort to intimidate Ukraine or it may be that they've . got additional plans.' And in Russia, the country's foreign ministry today alleged that ethnic minorities in Ukraine are living in fear after the ouster of the country's president and the coming to power of interim authorities that include right-wing nationalists. The statement by the ministry was in line with Russia's frequent contention that Ukraine's large ethnic Russian community faces repression under the new government that Moscow characterizes as fascist. The ministry statement raises the stakes on the issue, saying that ethnic Germans, Hungarians and Czechs in Ukraine also feel themselves in peril. 'They are unsettled by the unstable political situation in the country and are seriously afraid for their lives,"" the statement said, without citing specific incidents. Russia has brought large numbers of troops to areas near the Ukrainian border and speculation is strong that Moscow could use protection of ethnic Russians as a pretext for a military incursion. Tensions between Ukraine's ethnic Russians and Ukrainian-speakers continue to plague the country in the wake of the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia in February after months of protests against him. The Crimea region, where ethnic Russians are a majority, voted this month to secede from Ukraine and Russia has formally annexed the Black Sea peninsula, a move that Western countries have denounced as illegitimate. Talk percolates of similar referenda in other regions with large Russian populations, although none has been scheduled. As reports of his public address trickled in, none specified if he envisioned referenda in each region or a national vote, nor did he say what actually should be voted on. Proposals have been floated by Russia and some politicians to federalize Ukraine - giving the regions more autonomy. The interim authorities reject such a move. Another warning: And as Kiev reeled from the night's unruly demonstrations, U.S. resident Barack Obama (pictured boarding Air Force One in Rome today) issued yet another shot across Russia's bows, demanding it takes steps to reduce tensions in Ukraine now . Golden gates: Meanwhile, Russia's President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with the newly promoted top officers from various branches of the Russian armed forces and Interior Ministry at the Kremlin in Moscow . Yanukovych's biggest rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, attacked the statement, accusing Yanukovych of being 'a tool aimed at destroying the independence of Ukraine.' Also today, Russia's president said Ukraine could regain some arms and equipment of military units in Crimea that did not switch their loyalty to Russia. Russian forces took control of Ukrainian military installations in Crimea this month after Russia formally annexed the Black Sea peninsula. Some Ukrainian servicemen reportedly joined Russian forces, while others withdrew. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Friday told President Vladimir Putin that the Ukrainian withdrawal from Crimea is complete, Russian news agencies reported. Putin also approved Shoigu's proposal to turn over arms and equipment of the units still loyal to Ukraine, the reports said. No specifics were given on quantities, types of hardware or timing.","Hundreds of members of neo-fascist Right Sector storm parliament in Kiev .

"A massive world 2,500 times the size of Earth has been discovered by an international team of astronomers. Named MOA-2011-BLG-322, the planet is around eight times the size of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. Astronomers believe it orbits a star 25,000 light-years away and has a mass that is one third that of our sun. A massive world 2,500 times the size of Earth has been discovered by an international team of astronomers. Pictured is an artist's concept of an alien planet . The giant planet, reported by Ian O'Neill at Discovery News, was found using a technique known as ‘microlensing’. Microlensing uses Albert Einstein’s theory of general relatively which suggests what we perceive as the force of gravity actually arises from the curvature of space and time. Einstein believed that although Earth appears to be pulled towards the sun, it is in fact the shape of space-time around the sun that changes the way Earth moves.

"Common symptoms of depressive disorder are memory loss and blunted emotional responses . Severe depression and chronic stress can shrink the brain by blocking the formation of new nerve connections, a study has shown. The effect disrupts circuits associated with mental functioning and emotion. It could explain why people with major depressive disorder (MDD) suffer from concentration and memory loss, as well as blunted emotional responses. Several genes involved in building synapses, the connection points between brain cells, were suppressed in people with MDD, scientists found. This was thought to contribute to shrinkage of the brain's prefrontal cortex, which is known to occur in MDD sufferers. Researchers in the US analysed brain tissue from patients who had died after being diagnosed with MDD. They found molecular signs of reduced activity in genes necessary for the function and structure of brain synapses. Evidence pointed to the involvement of a single genetic ""switch"", or transcription factor - a protein called GATA1. Turning on GATA1 reduced activity of the genes and triggered the loss of brain connections. Study leader Professor Ronald Duman, from Yale University, said: 'We wanted to test the idea that stress causes a loss of brain synapses in humans. 'We show that circuits normally involved in emotion, as well as cognition, are disrupted when this single transcription factor is activated.' The research is published in the latest issue of the journal Nature Medicine. Further studies on rats showed that when GATA1 was switched on, the rodents showed signs of depression. This suggests that loss of brain synapses may be linked to depressive symptoms as well as mental impairment. 'We hope that by enhancing synaptic connections, either with novel medications or behavioural therapy, we can develop more effective antidepressant therapies,' Prof Duman added.",Depression blocks the formation of new nerve connections in the brain .
"An Atlanta man shattered the record for fastest drive from New York City to Los Angeles last Saturday by making the transcontinental trip in 28 hours 50 minutes. Ed Bolian spent years outfitting a 2004 Mercedes with expensive gadgetry, spare gas tanks, and, of course, bedpans and finally realized his dream October 20. That smashes the record set in 2006 by an unbelievable two hours. But his attempt is sure to gather controversy as it involved traveling at an average of 98mph, well in excess of many speed limits. He also used a series of gadgets to avoid getting caught for speeding. Scroll down for video . Proud: Ed Bolian (center) is now the holder of fastest man to drive from New York to Los Angeles at his sides are his co-pilot Dave Black (right) and Dan Huang (left) Vaunted vessel: Bolian and company made their historic dash across the continent in this CL Class Mercedes and some help from a few extra gizmos and additions . Mind blowing: Atlanta Lamborghini dealership manager Ed Bolian has broken the record for fastest transcontinental drive from New York to Los Angeles by two hours. He did it in 28 hours 50 minutes . The Lamborghini dealership sales director is hesitant to show off the proof, but according to Jalopnik, the 27-year-old has GPS data tracking every inch of the journey he took with a co-pilot and passenger starting October 19. ‘I've wanted to break the record since I was 18 years old,’ Bolian said, explaining away the trip’s huge costs and many risks. He began putting all the pieces together years ago, first by buying a used CL-Class blue Mercedes from a man in Palm Beach, Florida. ‘I thought about a Ferrari 612,’ said Ed. ‘But gas mileage would've been bad. A Bentley would've been perfect, but you'd want the V8 for gas mileage, and those are still way too expensive.’ Souped up: Bolian planned the trip for years and pumped untold sums into the car for GPS, laser jammers, CB radio, and other gizmos that helped ferry him safely and very quickly through a dozen states . Large tanks: In order to cut down on fuel stops, Bolian installed two 22-gallon addition gas tanks that let him drive 800 miles straight--with the help of bedpans . Previous record holder: Bolian's October 19 to 20 drive blows Alex Roy's 2006 record of 31 hours 4 minutes out of the water . Famous race: A zany 1981 comedy starring Burt Reynolds, Farrah Fawcett, and Dom Deluise immortalized the Cannonball Run, which took place in real life for much of the 1970s . The origins of the Cannonball Run aren't entirely clear, but the death defying and hugely illegal race from New York City to Los Angeles is named after Edwin 'Cannonball' Baker. Baker made history in 1933 when, apparently just to say he did it, he raced from coast to coast in 53 hours 30 minutes in a car called the Blue Streak. Fast forward to the 1970s, when cars could go far faster than Baker's Graham Paige, and Car and Driver editor Brock Yates created the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. For years, daring drivers vied for the title of what became known as the Cannonball Run. A 1981 comedy starring Burt Reynolds and Farrah Fawcett immortalized the name. The run was last completed by Dave Heinz and Dave Yarborough in 32 hours 51 minutes behind the wheel of a Jaguar. Their record was next bested in the US Express race, which replaced the illicit Cannonball Run, by Doug Turner and David Diem. Their time of 32 hours and 7 minutes wasn't beaten until Alex Roy did it in 31 hours 4 minutes in a BMW in 2006. Now, they're all Cannonball also-rans and Bolian's feat won't be easily topped. He chose the Mercedes for its fuel economizing V8 engine and active suspension he needed in order to pack in as much fuel as possible. Bolian’s whip boasts two additional 22-gallon gas tanks, which add hundreds of pounds of fuel but allow the car to travel 800 miles between stops. But breaking the record was going to take more than just a souped up Mercedes. To ensure a clear run, free from traffic jams and, perhaps more importantly, traffic cops Bolian, also invested in a police scanner, two GPS units that relay traffic information and iPhone apps such as Trapster. The car was also fitted with two laser jammers and had a truck mounted antenna. Friends were enlisted to travel along the route, about 150 miles ahead of the Mercedes, and check for any potential obstacles. Bolian decided to take the classic route pioneered by the illegal street racers of the 1970s’ Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining Sea Memorial Trophy Dash of the 1970s AKA Cannonball Run: Red Ball Garage in Midtown Manhattan to the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach, California. 'I've wanted to break the record since I was 18 years old': Bolian has now lived his dream and didn't get a single ticket on the way . 'I don't even remember Indiana': Bolian says it was tough getting out of Manhattan, but once they did it was smooth sailing all the way to LA . Almost here: They got to California as the sun rose on October 20. They could have played it safe and gone the speed limit as the rising western sun blinded them Instead, they pushed it in order to make their feat all the more impressive . And they're off: The classic starting line and the place where Bolian's historic run began, the Red Ball Garage, sits between Lexington and Third Avenues in Manhattan . Cool finish: The Cannonball Run ends here, at Redondo Beach, California's Portofino Hotel, 2,813.7 from where it begins in New York City . ‘Every year, Alex hears about five to seven attempts to break the record,’ said E. ‘None of the challengers come close.’ But by far the most difficult part of Bolian’s endeavor, he said, was finding people to make the trip with him. With only two weeks until he was scheduled to go, nobody had agreed to take on the challenge with him. Then, after trawling deep within his Facebook friends, he found Dan Huang. ‘I got a Facebook message from Ed,’ Huang told Jalopnik, ‘He didn't even have my cell phone number.’ Along with a friend of Bolian’s, David Black, as co-pilot, the three of them piled into the Mercedes on October 19. Proof: Bolian used technology to track and eventually prove his feat, hiring a GPS company to follow him every inch of the way and even gauge his speed . Things did not go well initially. ‘It took us 15 minutes to get out of Manhattan,’ Ed said. But then things quickly picked up. They had friends drive ahead and check for cops and obstacles. New Jersey passed, then Pennsylvania, then Ohio. They kept a breakneck pace. ‘I don't even remember Indiana,’ Ed said. By the time they got to Texas, they were making such good time that they could have gone the speed limit the rest of the way and still tied Roy’s time. Instead, they pushed it. And on October 20, they reached Redondo Beach, California’s Portofino Hotel. They’d beat the record by an astonishing two hours and gone down in history with the fastest Cannonball run drive in history. Astonishing: With Bolian at the wheel, Black as co-pilot, and Huang on a spare tire in back, the trio drove 2,813.7 in 28 hours 50 minutes .","Atlanta Lamborghini dealer Ed Bolian used a souped up a 2004 Mercedes to speed into the record books October 20 .

"There is no scientific proof of man-made global warming and a hotter earth would be ‘beneficial for humans and the majority of other species’, according to a founding member of environmental campaign group Greenpeace. The assertion was made by Canadian ecologist Patrick Moore, a member of Greenpeace from 1971 to 1986, to U.S senators on Tuesday. He told The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee: ‘There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years. If there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see. No actual proof, as it is understood in science, exists.’ Heated debate: Patrick Moore, pictured here giving a speech in Montreal, has claimed that there's no scientific evidence for man-made global warming . Moore pointed out that there was an Ice Age 450million years ago when CO2 was 10 times higher. He said: ‘There is some correlation, but little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global temperature through the millennia. The fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when CO2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main cause of global warming.’ Even if the earth does warm up, Moore claims that it will be to the advantage of humans and other forms of life, as ‘humans are a tropical species’. Patrick Moore pictured talking about nuclear power in Augusta, Georgia, in 2011 in Mayor Copenhaver's office . The largest warming to date has been at the northern mid latitudes, according to the Florida State study . 'There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years. If there were such a proof it would be written down for all to see. No actual proof, as it is understood in science, exists. 'The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states: “It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” (My emphasis)“Extremely likely” is not a scientific term but rather a judgment, as in a court of law. The IPCC defines “extremely likely” as a “95-100% probability”. 'But upon further examination it is clear that these numbers are not the result of any mathematical calculation or statistical analysis. They have been “invented” as a construct within the IPCC report to express “expert judgment”, as determined by the IPCC contributors. 'When modern life evolved over 500 million years ago, CO2 was more than 10 times higher than today, yet life flourished at this time. Then an Ice Age occurred 450 million years ago when CO2 was 10 times higherthan today. 'There is some correlation, but little evidence, to support a direct causal relationship between CO2 and global temperature through the millennia. The fact that we had both higher temperatures and an ice age at a time when CO2 emissions were 10 times higher than they are today fundamentally contradicts the certainty that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main cause of global warming. 'Today, we live in an unusually cold period in the history of life on earth and there is no reason to believe that a warmer climate would be anything but beneficial for humans and the majority of other species. There is ample reason to believe that a sharp cooling of the climate would bring disastrous results for human civilization. 'The IPCC states that humans are the dominant cause of warming “since the mid-20th century”, which is 1950. From 1910 to 1940 there was an increase in global average temperature of 0.5C over that 30-year period. Then there was a 30-year “pause” until 1970. 'This was followed by an increase of 0.57C during the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000. Since then there has been no increase, perhaps a slight decrease, in average global temperature. This in itself tends to negate the validity of the computer models, as CO2 emissions have continued to accelerate during this time. 'The increase in temperature between 1910-1940 was virtually identical to the increase between 1970-2000. Yet the IPCC does not attribute the increase from 1910-1940 to “human influence.”' He said: ‘It is extremely likely that a warmer temperature than today’s would be far better than a cooler one.’ Humans, he added, just aren’t capable of predicting global temperature changes. Moore said that he left Greenpeace because it ‘took a sharp turn to the political left’. Dr Doug Parr, Chief Scientist at Greenpeace UK, told MailOnline: 'On climate science, Greenpeace accepts the consensus view put forward by 97 per cent of climate scientists, every national and international scientific institute and every government in the world – climate change is happening, it’s caused mainly by human activity, and it’s highly dangerous for the future well-being of people on this planet.' Moore has made several other assertions over the years that have been at odds with Greenpeace's views. He has advocated logging, claiming it actually causes reforestation, and attacked campaigners for fear-mongering over nuclear energy. His latest comments came as two of the world’s leading scientific organisations warned that man-made global warming is worsening and will disrupt both the natural world and human society. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society, which is the national scientific academy of the United Kingdom, are releasing an unusual plain language report on climate change that addressed 20 issues in a question-and-answer format. ‘People do have persistent questions all about climate change,’ said study author Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California. ‘This is a one-stop shop for many of those questions.’ The report, released on Thursday, addresses new issues such as the recent slowing in the increase of world temperatures and how heat-trapping gases are connected to extreme weather. Increases in extreme weather, melting glaciers, rising seas and oceans getting more acidic are already happening, the 36-page report said. And those changes ‘are expected to increase greater warming and will threaten food production, freshwater supplies, coastal infrastructure and especially the welfare of the huge population currently living in low-lying areas,’ the report said. The report said that while the rate of warming is slower in the 2000s than it was in the 1990s it doesn't negate the 150 years of observations that show the world is warming. The report also says that more the 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases lately has been absorbed into the oceans' deep water, which for a while slows surface warming but not the long-term trend. There is enough evidence on the science to warrant action, Sir Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, said in a news release. ‘We've changed the chemical composition of the atmosphere; that's not a belief system. We know that beyond a shadow of a doubt,’ Santer said in an interview. ‘We ignore this at our peril.’","Patrick Moore has poured cold water on manmade global warming theories .

"A mystery investor or hedge fund reportedly made a bet of almost $1billion at odds of 10/1 last month that the U.S. would lose its AAA credit rating. Now questions are being asked of whether the trader had inside information before placing the $850million bet in the futures market, or if the bet happened at all. There were mounting rumours that investor . George Soros, 80, famously known as ‘the man who broke the Bank of . England’, could be involved. Was it him? George Soros, 80, has been mentioned as potentially being the mystery investor who won a $1billion bet that the credit rating would fall . He made more than $1billion on currency speculation when the British pound left the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in 1992. But a source with knowledge of the firm said Soros was not involved in the rumoured trade and questioned whether in fact there had been such a trade at all. The latest bet was made on July 21 on trades of 5,370 ten-year Treasury futures and 3,100 Treasury bond futures, reported ETF Daily News. Now the investor's gamble seems to have paid off after Standard and Poor’s issued a credit rating downgrade from AAA to AA+ last Friday. Whoever it is stands to earn a 1,000 per cent return on their money, with the expectation that interest rates will be going up after the downgrade. Concerned traders: Wall Street opened down on Monday after Standard and Poor's issued a credit rating downgrade from AAA to AA+ last Friday . The link has been made to Mr Soros in . part because he has been tied to President Obama’s administration since . 2008, reported The Examiner. He also recently stopped managing money for outside investors, meaning he is under less scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commision . But the mystery bet could easily have been made by another trader with similar resources, despite Mr Soros’s links with the Obama administration. The bet also raises questions of whether President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner knew that a downgrade was on the cards. Mr Geithner said in April there was ‘no risk’ of a downgrade - but the government now appears annoyed, not surprised, by last week’s decision. He has since slammed S&P for showing 'terrible judgment' in their decision and a 'stunning lack of knowledge' of U.S. fiscal budget maths.","Unknown investor or hedge fund 'made $850million bet'

"Criticism: Professor Richard Tol demanded his name be removed from a climate change report, accusing the UN of being too alarmist . A climate scientist has accused the United Nations of being too alarmist over global warming – and demanded his name be removed from a crucial new report. Professor Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, said fellow UN academics were exaggerating climate change and comparing it to the ‘apocalypse’. His comments are a blow to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which on Monday will publish its first update in seven years on the impacts of climate change. Previous IPCC reports on climate . impact have been plagued by errors that damaged the body’s credibility. Most famously, it said in 2007 that glaciers in the Himalayas could . disappear by 2035, a claim it has since withdrawn. Scientists . are meeting in Japan this week to agree the wording of the final . document, which will be used to inform policy decisions of governments . around the world. Leaked . drafts of the report predict that by the end of the century man-made . global warming will have done serious harm to the global economy, . displaced hundreds of millions of people and created violent conflict. Chapters on flooding, water supply and agriculture estimate huge . impacts. Prof . Tol, the lead co-ordinating author of the report’s chapter on . economics, was involved in drafting the summary for policymakers – the . key document that goes to governments and scientists. But he has now . asked for his name to be removed from the document. He . said: ‘The message in the first draft was that through adaptation and . clever development these were manageable risks, but it did require we . get our act together. ‘This . has completely disappeared from the draft now, which is all about the . impacts of climate change and the four horsemen of the apocalypse. This . is a missed opportunity.’ Professor . Tol told the BBC: ‘You have a very silly statement in the draft summary . that says that people who live in war-torn countries are more . vulnerable to climate change, which is undoubtedly true. But . if you ask people in Syria whether they are more concerned with . chemical weapons or climate change, I think they would pick chemical . weapons – that is just silliness.’ 'Exaggerating': A scene from the 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow. Professor Tol said said fellow UN academics were exaggerating climate change and comparing it to the 'apocalypse' The report is the second of three IPCC reports addressing the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. Last September the first report summarised the physical  science of climate change, concluding that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The second part will set out the impact a warming world will have on people, economies, animals and natural ecosystems. The third part, to be finalised next month, will summarise possible mitigation – what we can do to reduce the problem. Prof Tol does not dispute the view that climate change is caused by man – but he says its impact has been exaggerated. However, others say his figures underestimate the economic impact of climate change. Bob Ward, of the London School of Economics, said: ‘Prof Tol’s  contribution to the IPCC report has been under scrutiny because he inserted – at a very late stage, so avoiding the IPCC expert review process – a section which publicised his own work. ‘The section contained a number of errors. Prof Tol has expressed extreme reluctance to correct the errors in his work and it does not surprise me that he alone among the 410 authors of this report has refused to endorse the summary.’ But Professor Tol said: ‘Mr Ward is wrong on all scores. No new material was introduced after the expert or indeed the government review. Rather, material was moved from one chapter to another. 'That material was taken from 18 different studies, only two of which by me. All errors that were identified, including a minor one by Mr Ward, have been corrected. No IPCC author is ever asked to endorse the Summary for Policy Makers.’","Prof Richard Tol said UN academics were exaggerating climate change .

"A 17-stone pot-bellied pig scared off a gang of burglars who attempted to raid a family's home on New Year's Eve. Ludwig the pig faced the raiders inside Mike Maughan and his partner Liane Scholz's home in Derby. The couple, who lived in the house for two months before the raid have now pledged never to eat pork again because of the bravery of their pig. Ludwig the pot-bellied pig, left, managed to scare off burglars from his owners' home in Derby . Ludwig's owners Mike Maughan, rear and Liane Scholz, right, were asleep when raiders attacked their home . The couple, who are originally from Canada believe that Ludwig, pictured, chased the burglars away . Mr Maughan said: 'The noise he makes is like a low rumble that sounds like the biggest Rottweiler you can imagine so I think they just ran. 'It was New Year’s Eve and when we came down in the morning, the door was wide open. 'The room was still warm so they can’t have been there for that long. 'They must have woken Ludwig up and when he realised that we weren’t up and would have been disturbed he sprang into action. 'There were things in there they could have taken, like a bike, but they just left.' The couple, from Canada, adopted Ludwig after he was handed into an animal rescue centre in their native country. However, when they moved to Britain, Ludwig was almost prevented from coming as local authorities did not have the correct paperwork to export a pet pig. Mr Maughan, right, said the raiders were probably scared off by Ludwig's incredibly low growl . Ms Scholz said: 'He is actually the first pot-bellied pig to be exported from Canada as a pet. 'The options on the form were fattening, which is a no-no as he is fat enough as it is, slaughter is clearly not going to happen and breeding, which he can’t do because he is fixed. 'So after many phone calls, the Canadian government actually added an extra box to the form that says pet! 'We are the people that buy pets for our pets. 'At the time, we had a little cockatiel who would fly around the house but she was afraid of other birds. 'I didn’t want to get a dog or a cat. I tried to get Mike interested in lots of different exotic animals and we settled on a pig. 'I spent two years doing research. Pigs are a nice pet because they are very intelligent but there is a trade-off. 'A pig is like a two or three-year-old toddler but he is a toddler who will never grow up and they live to around 20. 'When we first got him back and he was only a couple of months old, we put a litter tray down for him. But he got confused and had an accident on the kitchen floor. 'But I showed him where it was and then four hours later he went to his litter box and we have never had an accident since.' Ms Scholz, right, said there are many misconceptions about the cleanliness of having a pet pig . Keeping Ludwig clean often only involves brushing him, or on occasion using dog shampoo . The couple said that much of the time Ludwig was too lazy to cause any damage to their home . Ms Scholz said there were many misconceptions concerning having a pig for a pet. She said: 'Pigs like to be clean. He doesn’t have much of a coat so when he gets dirty you just give him a brush down with a broom. 'Or if he is particularly unclean, or needs to be extra fancy, then he might have some dry dog shampoo. 'He goes to the toilet in the back yard like a dog would and we just clean up after him.' Originally the couple moved from Canada and wanted to settle in London but they faced significant problems over their house guest. She revealed: 'I moved over a couple of months before and was actually living in London but none of the landlords would allow me to have a pig! 'As a house animal, he is well behaved and isn’t a destructive animal but I could see the potential for it. It’s the same with a dog. They get destructive because they are bored.' Ms Scholz, left, believes that she is able to communicate with Ludwig, right, using sign language . The couple imported the unusual pet with them when they moved to the UK from Canada . According to Ms Scholz, Ludwig, pictured, can be quite an emotional animal even though he is tough . Ms Scholz said it was important that they trained Ludwig and she believes that she is now even able to communicate with the 17-stone animal . 'So we make him little treat boxes that he has to figure out and he has toddler toys and dog toys. “He never wrecks the yards, though, because he is just too lazy. When you tell him to do something, he wants to know what the outcome will be. 'So he won’t just do things on command but he knows the words for things and I have started using sign language with him now as well, which seems to be working. 'He is also a very emotional animal, as tough as he is physically, if he is really naughty I will shame him and send him outside. Then he cries and he actually sheds tears. 'Our bond is incredible - he only gets up when we get up. Until then he stays pretty quiet. 'The noises he makes are quite a nice low-decibel level generally, unless you are trying to make him do something he doesn’t want to, then it just sounds like he is being slaughtered!'","Ludwig the pig scared off a group of burglars from his owner's Derby home .

"An expedition to a remote part of northern Australia has uncovered three new vertebrate species isolated for millions of years, with scientists today calling the area a ‘lost world’. Conrad Hoskin from James Cook University and a National Geographic film crew were dropped by helicopter onto the rugged Cape Melville mountain range on the Cape York Peninsula earlier this year and were amazed at what they found. It included a bizarre looking leaf-tail gecko, a gold-coloured skink (a type of lizard) and a brown-spotted, yellow boulder-dwelling frog, none of them ever seen before. New species found: The bizarre looking leaf-tail gecko was among the vertebrate species which were found by Conrad Hoskin and a National Geographic film crew . Hoskin, a tropical biologist from the Queensland-based university, said: ‘The top of Cape Melville is a lost world. ‘Finding these new species up there is the discovery of a lifetime. I'm still amazed and buzzing from it. ‘Finding three new, obviously distinct vertebrates would be surprising enough in somewhere poorly explored like New Guinea, let alone in Australia, a country we think we've explored pretty well.’ The virtually impassable mountain . range is home to millions of black granite boulders the size of cars and . houses piled hundreds of metres high, eroded in places after being . thrust up through the earth millions of years ago. In isolation: The species, including the brown-spotted yellow boulder-dwelling frog, have been isolated for millions of years in the rugged Cape Melville mountain range on the Cape York Peninsula in Australia . A 'lost world': Hoskin said it was 'the discovery of a lifetime' in the area which is largely unexplored because of a virtually impassable mountain range. Pictured is the gold-coloured skink . While . surveys had previously been conducted in the boulder-fields around the . base of Cape Melville, a plateau of boulder-strewn rainforest on top, . identified by satellite imagery, had remained largely unexplored, . fortressed by massive boulder walls. Within days of arriving, the team had discovered the three new species as well as a host of other interesting finds that Hoskins said may also be new to science. The highlight was the leaf-tailed . gecko, a ‘primitive-looking’ 7.9 inch-long creature that is an ancient . relic from a time when rainforest was more widespread in Australia. The . Cape Melville Leaf-tailed Gecko, has huge eyes and a long, slender . body, is highly distinct from its relatives and has been named . Saltuarius eximius. Hoskin said the findings detailed in the latest . edition of the international journal Zootaxa. He said: ‘The second I saw the gecko I knew it was a new species. Everything about it was obviously distinct.’ Ancient relic: The gecko is a 'primitive-looking' creature which originates from a time when rainforest was more widespread in Australia . Back for more: The National Geographic film crew intend to return to the area to search for more new species including snails, spiders and even small mammals . Highly camouflaged, the geckos sit motionless, head-down, waiting to ambush passing insects and spiders. The Cape Melville Shade Skink is also . restricted to moist rocky rainforest on the plateau and is highly . distinct from its relatives, which are found in rainforests to the . south. Virtually impassable: The Cape Melville mountain range on the Cape York Peninsula (pictured) features boulders the size of cars and houses . Also discovered was a . small boulder-dwelling frog, the Blotched Boulder-frog, which during . the dry season lives deep in the labyrinth of the boulder-field where . conditions are cool and moist, allowing female frogs to lay their eggs . in wet cracks in the rocks. In the absence of water, the tadpole develops within the egg and a fully formed frog hatches out. Once the summer wet season begins the frogs emerge on the surface of the rocks to feed and breed in the rain. Tim Laman, a National Geographic photographer and Harvard University researcher who joined Hoskin on the expedition, said he was stunned to know such undiscovered places remained. He said: ‘What's really exciting about this expedition is that in a place like Australia, which people think is fairly well explored, there are still places like Cape Melville where there are all these species to discover. ‘There's still a big world out there to explore.’ According to National Geographic, the team plans to return to Cape Melville within months to search for more new species, including snails, spiders, and perhaps even small mammals. Hoskin said: ‘All the animals from Cape Melville are incredible just for their ability to persist for millions of years in the same area and not go extinct. It's just mind-blowing.’","A leaf-tailed gecko, a gold-coloured skink and a yellow boulder-dwelling frog were discovered .

The Brazuca ball has six polyurethane . panels that are bonded to keep the ball the same weight and roundness in . even the heaviest of rain. The never-before-seen panel shape revolutionizes the game by producing faster flight speed and maintaining true roundness. The bladder of the Brazuca ball is made of latex and provides the desired rebound. The . ball is textured and feels more like the adidas’ Finale 13, the . official UEFA Champions League ball, than the adidas Jabulani used in . South Africa four years ago. The . adidas Brazuca ball, in a bold white/night blue/multicolor colorway . befitting Brazil, is the most colorful ever for a FIFA World Cup. Adidas came under fire four years ago for the unpredictability of their ball, with goalkeepers especially unimpressed. Michael Carrick compared it to a 'beach ball', Daniel Agger said it made players 'look like drunken sailors' and Brazil stopper Julio Cesar claimed it was 'like a ball from a supermarket'. But adidas claim the 'rougher' Brazuca will avoid an 'unreliable flight', and will have vastly improved touch and accuracy. ‘We do extensive flight path analysis and the results have shown constant and predictable paths with deviations hardly recognisable,’ Matthias Mecking, Adidas football director, told the BBC. The ball itself weighs 437 grams (0.96 pounds) and it has a water absorption rate of just 0.2 per cent, meaning it can retain its shape, size and weight even in the rain (which could benefit England in Manaus). The manufacturers have recently announced that a promotional ball will be fitted with six cameras to capture a 360 degree view of the on-pitch action. According to their YouTube page: 'adidas developed an innovative camera-ball; the brazucam. Capturing 360º views through six different lenses, offering fans around the world the opportunity to enjoy and share the love of football from an entirely new perspective.

All-over regular texture . The ball is created by six propeller-shaped polyurethane panels being thermally bonded together. Between the seams the Brazuca also has a different geometry to other balls, helping it remain more stable in the air. ‘The most important thing on the soccer ball is how much roughness you . have,’ Dr Rabi Mehta, an aerodynamics expert at Nasa’s Ames Research . Center in California, told the BBC. Smoother balls, as seen with the previous Jabulani, are more unpredictable due to a process known as ‘knuckling’. As air passes over the seams it can create a force that knocks or moves the ball. The Brazuca, with its multiple seams and roughness, will be less prone to the ‘volatile swoops’ of the Jabulani. ‘The smoother you make the ball, the higher the speed at which it knuckles,’ says Dr Mehta. ‘In . essence what happened in my opinion is that with the traditional ball, . the critical speed at which you got maximum knuckling was lower than the . typical kicking speed in World Cup soccer. ‘By . making the ball smoother, that critical speed went up and happened to . coincide with the typical kicking speeds, about 50 to 55 miles (80 to 88 . kilometres) per hour, especially in free kick situations.’ This year’s rougher ball brings us ‘back to square one’ says Dr Mehta. Another way the Brazuca seems to have overtaken the Jabulani from four years ago is the depth of the seams. The Brazuca’s are about 0.06 inches (1.56 millimetres), compared to just 0.02 inches (0.48 millimetres) for the Jabulani, about three times shallower. The total length of the seams on the Brazuca are also longer, and all of this combines to make the ball rougher - travelling further. It can be compared to dimples on a golf ball, with the seams disrupting the flow of air. ‘This agitation is essential for fast and reliable flight,’ Dr Simon Choppin, a research fellow at the Centre for Sports Engineering Research at Sheffield Hallam University. Robo-boot: The Brazuca underwent a series of extensive tests, including this robotic boot trial, in order to meet and exceed FIFA regulations . Putting the pieces together: The Brazuca ball is comprised of a groundbreaking six-panel design, which improves symmetry, uniformity and efficiency . ‘A perfectly smooth ball experiences large amounts of drag and high aerodynamic forces. ‘The seams of a football disturb the flow of the air. ‘This results in a smaller wake-area of low pressure - behind the ball - reducing the pressure difference and reducing the force, which slows the ball down. The lower drag force means the ball travels for a longer distance.’ The result is that the ball should more closely resemble traditional 32-panelled balls that most footballers are used to, with Mehta insisting 'the complaitns we got in the last two World Cups will be minimised. Despite this ball having just six panels, the deep and long seams will create one of the most advanced footballs yet used at a World Cup. And Cesar, hoping to lift a dream trophy with his Braziulian colleagues this summer, is a lot happier. 'The ball is a good one, we had contact with it today,' the former Inter Milan and Queens Park Rangers player said of the Brazuca after training with it on Wednesday. 'I think the outfield players are going to like it too,' he added. Glove affair: Goalkeeper Julio Cesar eyes the new Brazuca ball during training in Teresopolis . Still like it, Julio?

'The sign of a good ball is when no one really talks about it,’ the Liverpool midfielder said at the launch event in December. ‘I . don’t think anyone will have anything negative to say about Brazuca. I . think the feedback from players will be really positive. 'It's very true and reliable, and those are the two most important things I want from a ball. 'The .

"The levels of Antarctic sea-ice last week hit an all-time high – confounding climate change computer models which say it should be in decline. America’s National Snow And Ice Data Center, which is funded by Nasa, revealed that ice around the southern continent covers about 16million sq km, more than 2.1 million more than is usual for the time of year. It is by far the highest level since satellite observations on which the figures depend began in 1979.In statistical terms, the extent of the ice cover is hugely significant. Scroll down for video . The Gerlache Strait separating the Palmer Archipelago from the Antarctic Peninsular off Anvers Island . It represents the latest stage in a trend that started ten years ago, and means that an area the size of Greenland, which would normally be open water, is now frozen. The Antarctic surge is so big that overall, although Arctic ice has decreased, the frozen area around both poles is one million square kilometres more than the long-term average. In its authoritative Fifth Assessment Report released last year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change admitted that the computer models on which scientists base their projections say Antarctic ice should be in decline, not increasing. The report said: ‘There is low confidence in the scientific understanding of the observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent since 1979, due to… incomplete and competing scientific explanations for the causes of change.’ An adult chinstrap penguin jumps out of the sea at Port Lockroy, Antarctica . A Crabeater seal on an iceberg in Paradise Bay, Antarctica. Crabeater seals are the most common large mammal on the planet after humans, with an estimated population of 15 million . Some . scientists have suggested the Antarctic ice increase may itself be . caused by global warming. But Professor Judith Curry, head of climate . science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, said the . arguments were not convincing. She added: ‘We do not have a quantitative, predictive understanding of the rise in Antarctic sea ice extent.’ She . said it was becoming increasingly apparent that long-term cycles in . ocean temperatures were responsible for a significant proportion of the . ice decline in the Arctic – a process that may be starting to reverse. Prof . Curry also revealed that because of the ‘pause’, in which world average . temperatures have not risen for more than 16 years, the Arctic ice . decline has been ‘touted’ by many as the most important evidence for . continued global warming. But in her view, climate scientists have to consider evidence from  both Poles. She . added: ‘Convincing arguments regarding the causes of sea-ice . variations require understanding and ability to model both the Arctic . and Antarctic.’ The Gerlache Strait separating the Palmer Archipelago from the Antarctic Peninsular off Anvers Island . For years, computer simulations have predicted that sea ice should be disappearing from the Poles. Now, with the news that Antarctic sea-ice levels have hit new highs, comes yet another mishap to tarnish the credibility of climate science. Climatologists base their doom-laden predictions of the Earth’s climate on computer simulations. But these have long been the subject of ridicule because of their stunning failure to predict the pause in warming – nearly 18 years long on some measures – since the turn of the last century. It’s the same with sea ice. We hear a great deal about the decline in Arctic sea ice, in line with or even ahead of predictions. But why are environmentalists and scientists so much less keen to discuss the long-term increase in the southern hemisphere? In fact, across the globe, there are about one million square kilometres more sea ice than  35 years ago, which is when satellite measurements began. It’s fair to say that this has been something of an embarrassment for climate modellers. But it doesn’t stop there. In recent days a new scandal over the integrity of temperature data has emerged, this time in America, where it has been revealed as much as 40 per cent  of temperature data there are not real thermometer readings. Many temperature stations have closed, but rather than stop recording data from these posts, the authorities have taken the remarkable step of ‘estimating’ temperatures based on the records of surrounding stations. So vast swathes of the data are actually from ‘zombie’ stations that have long since disappeared. This is bad enough, but it has also been discovered that the  US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is using estimates even when perfectly good raw data is available to it – and that it has adjusted historical records. Why should it do this? Many have noted that the effect of all these changes is to produce a warmer present and a colder past, with the net result being  the impression of much faster warming. They draw their conclusions accordingly. Naturally, if the US temperature records are indeed found to have been manipulated, this is unlikely to greatly affect our overall picture of rising temperatures at the end of the last century and  a standstill thereafter. The US is, after all, only a  small proportion of the globe. Similarly, climatologists’ difficulties with the sea ice may be of little scientific significance in the greater scheme of things. We have only a few decades of data, and in climate terms this is probably too short to demonstrate that either the Antarctic increase or the Arctic decrease is anything other than natural variability. But the relentless focus by activist scientists on the Arctic decline does suggest a political imperative rather than a scientific one – and when put together with the story of the US temperature records, it’s hard to avoid the impression that what the public is being told is less than the unvarnished truth. As their credulity is stretched more and more, the public will – quite rightly – treat demands for action with increasing caution… .

"A team of scientists has discovered that a giant 'burp' of carbon dioxide from the North Pacific Ocean helped trigger the end of last ice age, around 17,000 years ago. The recent study, led by Dr James Rae of the University of St Andrews in Scotland, found that changes in ocean circulation in the North Pacific caused a massive outpouring of CO2. This was released from the deep ocean into the atmosphere, helping to warm the planet sufficiently to trigger the end of the ice age. A team of scientists has discovered that a giant 'burp' of carbon dioxide from the North Pacific Ocean helped trigger the end of last ice age, around 17,000 years ago (stock image shown). The recent study was led by Dr James Rae of the University of St Andrews, Scotland . Previously, scientists have suggested that the Antarctic Ocean and North Atlantic were the only places likely to release CO2 as a result of glaciers retreating, due to their deep water formation. However, a change in rainfall over the North Pacific region caused by the East Asian monsoon and the westerly storm track made the ocean surface saltier and less buoyant, allowing it to form deep water, say the scientists. Deep waters form when air temperatures are cold but the salinity of surface water is high, so water becomes denser and sinks lower. One example is the Gulf Stream, which carries salt into high latitudes of the North Atlantic Ocean where water cools. The cooling and the added salt cause the waters to sink in the Norwegian Sea. This is the formation of Atlantic Deep Water. If deep water comes to the surface it will warm and release carbon dioxide, as cold water holds more carbon dioxide than warm water. Via University of Southern California . This resulted in CO2 stored in the deep Pacific being released into the atmosphere, where it helped warm the planet and melt back the ice sheets that covered much of the Northern Hemisphere. 'Our study shows that North Pacific deep water penetrated all the way into the deep ocean, allowing it to release deep ocean CO2,' said Dr Rae, of the University's Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. 'We tested this idea further with a climate model, which showed that deep water formation in the North Pacific causes ocean CO2 release, large enough to drive the atmospheric CO2 rise recorded at the start of the deglaciation. 'The results of our study came as a big surprise, as we were expecting to see a signature of CO2 release from the ocean around Antarctica, which has been the leading hypothesis for deglacial CO2 rise. 'Instead we found a signal we can only explain with CO2 release from the North Pacific.' The researchers warn, however, the man-made activities will warm the climate much faster than this release of CO2 did. 'Humans have driven CO2 rise in the atmosphere as large as the CO2 rise that helped end the last ice age, but the man-made CO2 rise has happened 100 times faster,' said Dr Rae . The team of scientists from the University of St Andrews, University of Bristol and University of Kiel, Germany made a series of chemical measurements on minuscule fossil shells to trace ocean CO2 storage and circulation patterns up to two miles (3.2 kilometres) beneath the ocean's surface. 'This study is only really possible thanks to new developments in geochemistry, that allow us to reconstruct the pH [acidity] of the ocean in the past for the first time, giving an accurate measurement of how ocean CO2 is stored and released,' added Dr Gavin Foster, of the University of Southampton. The new findings will help scientists understand how Earth's climate can operate, and the different ways in which the ocean and atmosphere can exchange CO2. But Dr Rae warned: 'Although the CO2 rise caused by this process was dramatic in geological terms, it happened very slowly compared to modern man-made CO2 rise. 'Humans have driven CO2 rise in the atmosphere as large as the CO2 rise that helped end the last ice age, but the man-made CO2 rise has happened 100 times faster. 'This will have a huge effect on the climate system, and one that we are only just starting to see.'","Scientists have found evidence for a giant release of carbon dioxide .

"Food Standards Australia New Zealand is considering allowing electrolyte drinks 'to carry health claims related to their respective purposes' A bottle of sports drink has nine teaspoons of sugar and should be on the shelves next to soft drinks such as Coke and Lemonade rather than being allowed to carry claims of health benefits on their bottles, a consumer advocacy group has warned. Consumer group Choice claims most people receive no health benefits from drinking sports drinks, which contained a similar amount of sugar to a can of coke. Choice has also revealed that a 600mL bottle of Gatorade has 36 grams of sugar - or nine teaspoons - while a standard 375ml can of Coca Cola has 40 grams, or one extra teaspoon. The group said the drinks should be in soft drink isles of supermarkets rather then next to health foods. The comments follows a submission by the Food Standards Australia New Zealand asking for electrolyte drinks 'to carry health claims related to their respective purposes'. Drinks are currently required to have a certain level of energy, sugar and sodium before they can say that they 'improve hydration'. 'Rules about health claims were introduced last year to stop situations where you had clearly unhealthy products like sweets and chocolates making claims that they were 99 per cent fat free,' a spokesperson for CHOICE, Tom Godfrey, said. 'There's extensive research showing that any specific health claim gives a product a ""halo effect"" and people believe the product is healthier overall.' Consumer group CHOICE, has opposed the proposal claiming it would mislead consumers . 'Sports drinks can help elite athlete but they aren't designed for everyday use,' Mr Godfrey said . 'Yet drinks like Gatorade and Powerade are marketed and sold to everyone. 'Most people will receive no health benefit from a bright blue sugar drink. Sports drinks belong on the shelves next to Coke and Lemonade, not in the health food aisle and the claims on the label need to reflect this.' The advocacy group claims that the drinks are already well overused by consumers who drink the product when playing sport, when they are simply spending time outdoors or as hangover cures. 'There's extensive research showing that any specific health claim gives a product a ""halo effect"" and people believe the product is healthier overall,' CHOICE spokesperson, Tom Godfrey, said . However, Geoff Parker from the Australian Beverages Council said the labelling would allow product supplier to share research about the benefits of hydrating through sports drinks with consumers, rather than misleading them. 'What manufacturers wanted to do was to tap into a whole lot of internationally recognised research and scientific studies which are out there, which start to flesh out some of the more detailed, functional benefits that electrolytes and sports drinks can actually make,' he told the ABC. 'So some of their claims might be ... that sports drinks hydrate better than water for intensive exercise, for example, or [that] sports drinks hydrate twice as fast as water for intensive exercise.'","Food Standards Australia New Zealand issued a proposal for electrolyte drinks 'to carry health claims related to their respective purposes'

"This could have been avoided. If Roy Hodgson had said he wanted to give Adam Lallana the chance to build on his eye-catching efforts against San Marino, we would have been none the wiser about Raheem Sterling’s fatigue. Every word the England manager says is scrutinised. I can see where Hodgson was coming from but an issue has been created that both men could have done without. Had Hodgson explained he wanted to use Sterling for an impact – which he had, by winning the decisive free-kick against Estonia – there would be no quarrel. Now, though, Sterling is in the spotlight and contending with questions such as ‘how can a 19-year-old be tired?’ but those who believe he has made a mistake saying he wasn’t in the right condition to play for England are not looking at the full picture.

It doesn’t matter whether you are 19 or 29, if you play nine games in a month, like Raheem did in September, it will leave a mark on you physically. So, in some respects, he has been brave to confront the issue and explain his concerns to Hodgson. Would I have ever done it? No. I feared if I missed a game, someone would come in and take my place. I also never wanted to give managers an excuse to leave me out, so there were times when I played in games I shouldn’t have done. Was it the right thing to do? No. Injuries are what I would mask but I remember a game at Bolton in September 2006 when I was shattered, having been to the World Cup in Germany. We lost 2-0, one of the goals came from a cross into the box. I tried to jump for a header but had nothing in my legs. Had I been right, I know I would have got my head to the ball first. As a central defender, you can find a way of getting through a game, you don’t have to operate at the rapier pace that Raheem moves with.

We want Raheem to thrill us, to be an exciting figure for many years to come. We don’t want him to get to 25 and his best form be a thing of the past. If he is managed properly now and looks after himself, he won’t suffer burn out like another former Liverpool and England teenage prodigy. A few weeks ago, I spent some time with Sir Alex Ferguson. During our conversation, he remembered how, in 1997, Michael Owen and I had played at the Under-20 World Cup in Malaysia. Michael came back and went straight into Liverpool’s first team at the start of the season. By contrast, the United players in that England squad – Ronnie Wallwork and John Curtis – were both given a month off to recover but Michael was on a rapid upward curve and at the end of that campaign, he set the World Cup finals in France alight. Michael wanted to play in every game for club and country but, in October 1998, Gerard Houllier and Roy Evans – in their brief reign as Liverpool’s joint managers – decided to rest him for a UEFA Cup game against Valencia. Michael wasn’t happy and said in an interview “I’ll rest when I’m 40”. Former  Liverpool and Englad striker Michael Owen wanted to play every game for club and country . Sterling told Hodgson he was feeling tired and not in the right mental state during training on Saturday evening . VIDEO Sterling defends England tiredness . That comment went down well with supporters and ex-players but was he right? No. Michael played far too much for Liverpool and England too early, never getting a summer off to recharge physically or mentally. Was it a coincidence that he suffered a serious hamstring injury in April 1999? Raheem is becoming like Michael, with stature and his pace and his importance to club and country at such an early stage of his career but there have been signs over the last few weeks that such a punishing spell is beginning to catch up with him. He may have only played two games at the World Cup but Sterling was training every day in stifling conditions, having just come off a season in which he had been a key figure in Liverpool’s title charge. After three weeks off, he then went to the USA for Liverpool’s pre-season tour. Don’t underestimate what an impact that schedule will have had on him, physically and mentally. Figures back that up. Between May 30, 2013 and October 13, 2013, Raheem had played 615 minutes of football. In the same period this year, that figure had shot up to 1682 minutes. Sterling may have only started two games at the 2014 World Cup but the England winger was in training daily . Sterling came on in the 64th minute but still received criticism from those on Twitter for his decision . Sterling, warming up during the first half, complained of feeling tired in training ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier . Hodgson and Brendan Rodgers will talk about how to handle him going forward but, naturally, they are going to want to use him when they can as he is a match-winner. That’s why he played against Middlesbrough in the League Cup. Liverpool’s poor start in the league meant Rodgers needed his quality. Liverpool could not have afforded to be on the end of a giant-killing that night, so the plan would have been to get the game won and get Sterling off early. As it was, things never went to plan and he subjected to 120 minutes. Since then, his performances have been notably lacking sparkle. Sterling retweeted those criticising him online before writing: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human' His importance at Anfield is vital and that is why, at the end of last season, Rodgers called him “the best young player in Europe”. He was dazzling in that spell but that was a spell when Liverpool were only playing one game a week. This is the first time he has played consistently in games of this pressure and will take some adjustment. But If he is become one of the top players in the world, he will ultimately have to get used to an unrelenting schedule.","Raheem Sterling told  Roy Hodgson he was too tired to start for England against Estonia on Sunday .

"A federal judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss a case that could fatally cripple the Obamacare health insurance law. The Affordable Care Act forbids the federal government from enforcing the law in any state that opted out of setting up its own health care exchange, according to a group of small businesses whose lawsuit got a key hearing Monday in federal court. The Obama administration, according to their lawsuit, has ignored that language in the law, enforcing all of its provisions even in states where the federal government is operating the insurance marketplaces on the error-plagued Healthcare.gov website. Thirty-six states chose not to set up their exchanges, a move that effectively froze Washington, D.C. out of the authority to pay subsidies and other pot-sweeteners to convince citizens in those states to buy medical insurance. But the IRS overstepped its authority by paying subsidies in those states anyway, say the businesses and their lawyers. Tea party conservatives have long pushed for an end to Obamacare, and the lawsuit might give them the victory they're after . The IRS has been offering tax incentives to citizens in all 50 states to get them to enroll in Obamacare, the plaintiffs say, although the Affordable Care act forbids it in the 36 states that have opted out. Without the subsidies, the employer mandate doesn't go into effect . The subsidies serve as a trigger that determines who has to comply with the now-famous individual and employer mandates. So, the lawsuit claims, the Obama administration illegally enforced the Affordable Care Act – suddenly making millions of taxpayers and small employers subject to paying fines if they don't play ball. The Affordable Care Act authorizes subsidies only for policies purchased 'through an Exchange established by the State.' A different section of the law empowers the federal government to set up its own exchanges for each state that chose not establish one. But government lawyers have argued that 'Congress made clear that an exchange established by the federal government stands in the shoes of the exchange that a state chooses not to establish.' The Treasury Department, they contend, 'has reasonably interpreted the Act to provide for eligibility for the premium tax credits for individuals in every state, regardless of which entity operates the exchange.' But that amounts to the federal government ignoring the letter of the law, lawyer Sam Kazman says. And 'without those subsidies, the employer mandate isn't triggered,' he told MailOnline. And that could make the entire Obamacare system unsustainable. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is the named defendant in the legal action, which claims her agency is ignoring 36 states' desire to opt out of enforcing the Affordable Care Act . Oops: President Obama appeared with 13 Obamacare supports Monday in the White House rose garden, but only three of them have actually enrolled in the health insurance exchanges . Kazman is general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market think tank that is coordinating the case. Attorney Sam Kazman says the federal government is illegally subsidizing health insurance in all the states that chose not to set up their own health care marketplaces. And without the subsidies, the entire Obamacare system could fail . 'The IRS cannot rewrite the law that Congress passed,' said Tom Miller, resident fellow at another think, the tank American Enterprise Institute. 'Its regulation expressly flouts the statutory text of the Affordable Care Act, the intent of Congress and the reasoned choices of [36] states.' 'The . fiscal impact' of denying the Obamacare system millions of dollars in . lost fines, 'while sizable, wouldn't be large enough to bring down the . house,' Kazman added. The poltical one, however, is.' 'You'd . have 34 ""refusenik"" states exempting their employers and many of their . citizens from the employer mandate and portions of the individual . mandate,' he explained. 'You'd . have companies in participating states considering whether to move . their operations' to states where they don't have to obey the Affordable . Care Act. 'And you might even have some of those states seeking to undo . their choice to participate.' Headaches: The Obamacare website has suffered glitch after glitch since its October 1 launch, creating PR problems for the White House and practical problems for the HHS and IRS . The . Competitive Enterprise Institute said in a statement that the IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services have pushed regulations that Congress didn't authorize, forcing some . employers 'to cut back employees' hours' in order to dodge Obamacare's . more economically challenging requirements, 'even though they are . located in states that have refused to set up their own insurance . exchanges.' U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman refused to dismiss the case, as the government requested, but also denied the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the IRS and HHS from granting subsidies in what lawyer Kazman calls 'refusenik' states. This Michigan company says complying with the Obamacare law is forcing it to let some employees go and trim others back to part-time hours to offset the cost of the employer mandate -- a provision that wouldn't kick in without the IRS subsidies . Judge Friedman said Tuesday that he will rule on the merits of the case by February 15. By then the Obamacare law will be in full swing, nearing the end of its open enrollment period and providing health care services to Americans who sign up for coverage by December 15. Kazman said his organization would 'take . an immediate appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals' in order to get a . re-hearing on the motion for an injunction to stop the clock on Obamacare while the larger legal issues are worked out. At the lawsuit's heart is a set of distinctions that Congress drew between the 14 states – 15 including the District of Columbia – that chose to establish health insurance exchanges and the 36 that opted out. The plaintiffs, who all hail from 'refusenik' states, say the federal government has invalidated their state governments' choices. Kazman said that the Obamacare . statute does not empower the IRS or HHS to 'give subsidy funding to . people in states not authorized by Congress to receive it. That move, he agreed, had he effect of 'gutting a choice – to participate in the . exchange program or not – that states were given by Congress.' The government is 'asking you to interpret ""north"" to mean ""south,""' plaintiffs’ attorney Michael Carvin told Judge Friedman on Monday. The White House referred questions about the lawsuit to the Health and Human Services Department, which declined requests for comment and passed the buck to the Justice Department. The DOJ didn't respond to emails seeking a position on the lawsuit, which its lawyers are defending.","Small-business plaintiffs say the government is treating all 50 states the same even though Congress allowed them to opt out – and 36 did .
The IRS is granting insurance subsidies to taxpayers in the 'refusenik' states, even though the text of the Obamacare law doesn't allow it .

He also refused, however, to issue an injunction barring the Obama administration from implementing the law while the case moves forward ."
"Raheem Sterling is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill Luis Suarez's boots at Liverpool... not playing for England . True measure of a top coach like Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal is to find a lower-league gem and make him into a world beater like Ian Rush or Stuart Pearce . Wayne Rooney and Jack Wilshere have a telepathic understanding that gives England a fighting chance at Euro 2016 . If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich then he’s a bottle job. Ozil seems to have achieved the impossible by joining a top club, winning a World Cup, then seeing his market value slide dramatically. That’s a hell of an effort. Is it all his fault? Probably not, although he has done nothing to address how lightweight he is. He is quite literally a pushover in the Premier League. Not all small players are so easily shoved aside – look at Lionel Messi. But others don’t help him. The apologists among the Arsenal fans who talk about secondary assists, and Ozil’s so-called brilliant pass earlier in the move – these people are making stuff up to try to make him look better than he is. Just tell the truth chaps – he’s been a massive disappointment. He’s a big player who should be having a direct impact on games. Mesut Ozil has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich after just over a year at Arsenal . Ozil, brought to his knees against Chelsea, has been accused of being too lightweight for the Premier League . Arsene Wenger says you need to watch him for 90 minutes in the flesh to properly make a judgement. Well I have done – on more than one occasion this season – and he’s still lightweight with minimal contribution. I also saw a manager who refused to substitute a player who was having little or no impact on the game. Stubbornness or stupidity? You decide. And then we come to how Wenger uses Ozil. He puts him out wide. Most Arsenal fans will tell you his best position is in the No 10 role behind Danny Welbeck. They don’t get paid £8m a year so how come he can’t see it, and when he has played the Germany man there how come it doesn’t work as effectively and regularly as it should? Arsene Wenger says you need to watch Ozil for 90 minutes to see his full contribution - and it's still not great . Lionel Messi, in action against Rayo Vallecano, is a small player but is not considered a push-over, unlike Ozil . It’s easy for opponents to bully Ozil. There is no Patrick Vieira or Gilberto Silva at Arsenal these days – nobody to protect a player like him. That's a massive oversight from Wenger, whose squad-building powers are at their weakest right now. But at the end of the analysis and debate about Ozil you have to look at the player himself. Has he done enough? Has he made himself ready for the Premier League? Has he adapted to the pace and power of the game? Has he shown any signs of addressing why he has such little direct impact on games? Gilberto Silva and Patrick Vieira would have been able to protect Ozil when they were playing . The Xbox managers will throw in their stats about assists here, but I’m talking about coming away from a game and thinking: ‘Ozil was head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch, that’s why he cost £42.5m.’ How many times have you done that? Blame Wenger, blame the apologists, blame his team-mates – blame whoever. Ultimately the player has got to look at himself. If he slips off to Bayern Munich for a cut-price fee can he honestly look at himself in the mirror and say he did his best for Arsenal? Of course not.","Mesut Ozil has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich .

"She was the double Oscar-winning actress who captivated audiences with her roles in Gone With the Wind and A Streetcar Named Desire. And fans of British actress Vivien Leigh were just as intrigued by her private life as her performances thanks to her tumultuous marriage to actor Laurence Olivier. Now a century on from her birth, people can gain a rare insight into the life and loves of the legendary star thanks to a new display at London's V&A museum. 'We wanted to rescue Vivien Leigh from the shadow of Laurence Olivier': A collection of photos acquired by the V&A show rare glimpses of the life of the glamorous actress. Here, Vivien Leigh is shown in George Cukor's pool in Hollywood, taken during the Duel of Angels tour, 1960, Photographer unknown . Hoarder: Vivien Leigh kept a diary from the age of 16 and thousands of her letters from friends . Stage presence: The collection contains rare photographs of, and taken by, the actress . The V&A have acquired the archive of the British film and theatre actress from her grandchildren. It covers all aspects of her career and personal life including her diaries, begun as a 16-year-old in 1929 and maintained until she died in 1967, aged 53, from tuberculosis. The archive explores the grand love affair between Leigh and and second husband Olivier, and contains more than 200 letters, telegrams, photographs, newspaper clippings and postcards between 1938 and 1967. Leigh and Oliver were the golden couple of the Forties and Fifties during their 20 year marriage. Golden couple: With her husband of 20 years Laurence Olivier . Love of her life: Leigh and Olivier were on and off screen lovers . During April-June 1939, whilst Olivier was playing in No Time for Comedy on Broadway in New York and Leigh was shooting Gone with the Wind in L.A, a total of 40 letters were exchanged between the couple. As well as expressing their affection for one another, their letters contained their theatrical observations and plans on the foundation of the National Theatre. Leigh also corresponded with some of the most eminent names in 20th-century history including Winston Churchill, Graham Greene and Noël Coward. She meticulously kept more than 7,500 personal letters from friends and colleagues addressed to both her and Laurence Olivier. The archive uncovers correspondence with T. S. Eliot, Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe, Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Mother - who offers her thanks to the couple for remembering her. Oscar-winning performance: With Clark Gable in Gone With The Wind . High praise: The actress with Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire.

Professional correspondence includes many letters from playwright Tennessee Williams. One addressed to Leigh in September 1950 enthuses about her role of Blanche DuBois (for which she won an Oscar). He wrote: 'It is needless to repeat here my truly huge happiness over the picture and particularly your part in it. It is the Blanche I had always dreamed of and I am grateful to you for bringing it so beautifully to life on the screen.' It's praise the actress must have been delighted to receive as another letter reveals how she wrote to film director Elia Kazan during preparation for the role worrying about getting it 'right'. She wrote: 'You do know that when I said over the phone I'm worried about the way I'll look, 'I didn't mean good I meant right'.' Before divorcing Olivier from in 1960, the couple entertained a wide circle of guests at Notley Abbey, the home in Buckinghamshire they created in 1943. An impressive list of signatures ranging from Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Sir Alec Guinness to Bette Davis, Orson Welles, Judy Garland and Rex Harrison is recorded in their visitors' book which is part of the archive. A changing selection of material from the archive will be on display in the V&A's Theatre and Performance Galleries this autumn. As well as personal diaries and photographs, it will include Leigh's annotated film and theatre scripts, press clippings and her numerous awards. An annotated version of the image from the V&A's archives . Historic: A volume of press cuttings about Vivien Leigh's role in Gone With The Wind . Insight: Leigh kept a diary throughout her life and programmes from her stage productions, right .

"A holiday island popular with Britons is preparing for a mass evacuation because of a possible volcanic eruption. Experts have recorded 150 tremors on El Hierro, the smallest of the Canary Islands, since yesterday - raising fears of an imminent eruption. Last night 53 people were ordered out of their homes over fears of landslides and the army has been called in to prepare for a possible evacuation. Seismic activity: Residents in El Frontera leave their homes last night. El Hierro has been hit by more than 150 tremors in the last 24 hours . About to blow? Parts of the Canary Island of El Hierro have been evacuated over fears of a volcanic eruption . Schools on the tiny island, home to 10,000 people, have been closed and a tunnel linking the two main towns - Frontera and Valverde - has been shut. Volcano expert Juan Carlos Carrecedo said: 'There is a ball of magma rising to the surface producing a series of ruptures which generate seismic activity. 'We don't know if that ball of magma will break through the crust and cause an eruption.' But he warned an eruption was possible 'in days, weeks or months'. The last volcanic eruption in the Canary Islands took place on the island of La Palma in 1971. Tectonic plates map with the Canary Islands circled. The last volcanic eruption in the Canary Islands took place on the island of La Palma in 1971 . Evacuation: Schools on the tiny island have also been shut and the tunnel linking the two main towns - Frontera and Valverde - is closed . Readings: A seismologist records the seismic activity on the island. There are fears the tremors could cause landslides . El Hierro, which has an area of just 108 square miles, is popular with British tourists looking for quiet sunshine holidays away from the bustle of neighbouring islands like Tenerife and Lanzarote. It is not known how many, if any, Britons are currently on the island. More than 8,000 tremors have been registered on El Hierro since July 19, collectively known as an earthquake 'swarm'. Only 15 of them have been strong . enough for people on the island to notice, but yesterday an earthquake . of 3.8 on the Richter scale was felt all over the island. The last eruption on El Hierro, which has around 250 small volcanic craters, was in 1793 and lasted for a month. Newspaper . Canarias7.es reported that two units of the Spanish military's . emergency intervention unit will leave Tenerife today to help with any . evacuation operation. Eruption: A diagram showing where the epicentres of tremors have been. El Hierro was formed when three volcanoes erupted 100 million years ago . Warning: Seismic activity is shown on a monitoring screen. Experts say a ball of magma is rising up underneath El Hierro, and could trigger a volcanic eruption . The . Canary Island government began a geological survey of El Hierro earlier . this month to determine what was causing the tremors. It raised the volcanic risk to 'yellow' on Sunday - the highest alert status since the earthquake 'swarm' began in July. Some experts said a volcanic explosion could actually attract more tourists to the island. Eumenio . Ancochea, volcanologist at Madrid's Complutense University, said: 'An . eruption could fill the island with people interested in these . phenomenon. 'It's normal that people are scared but there is no danger. 'After an eruption the lava advances at a few metres per hour and you can easily take photographs as it descends.' Magma: El Hierro is the smallest of the Canary Islands, but has more than 250 small volcanic craters . Under the Canary Islands lies an area of magma which is able to break through to the surface when the African Plate - on which the islands sit - shifts. It is to this that the islands owe their very existence. Most of the islands are . still volcanically active and there has been speculation that a smaller, previously undetected fault line also runs . through the chain. El Hierro - which means 'iron' in . Spanish - was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years . ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high. Volcanic . activity - mainly where three ridge lines converge - has caused El Hierro to expand continually. The last time it erupted was in 1793. Some . 50,000 years ago, massive landslides triggered by earthquakes caused a . large part of the island to crack off and fall into the Atlantic Ocean, . according to Irish Weather Online. That created the El Golfo valley on the island and caused an 300ft-high tsunami that probably reached the American coast. This . feeds into the belief that volcanic activity on La Palma - the most . tectonically active of the Canary Islands - could trigger a . mega-tsunami. The theory . - which has never been confirmed - claims that a possible fault line . through the island would cause a major landslide under certain . circumstances. That . landslide would then spark a tsunami that would cause extensive damage . all down the Atlantic Coast of the U.S., the Caribbean, Western Europe, . West Africa and the east coast of South America.","108 square mile island is home to 10,000 people .

"When a man from Singapore had his wish to visit North Korea granted, he braced himself for the scenes of 'barren lands' and 'really, really sad people' that he had seen via a BBC Panorama documentary. But what he found blew his mind - for all the right reasons. Inside the communist enclave in 2013, photographer Aram Pan witnessed bustling markets, men and women enjoying themselves at a Western looking water park and miles and miles of crops ready for harvest, shattering all of his illusions about what a holiday to North Korea would entail.

North Korean men wearing suits enjoy ice cream in the sunshine, contradicting the most commonly cited cliche that North Korea is a 'destitute, starving country'. One man perches on a kerb and waves in his white socks and sandals . Unlike other tourists who have visited the country, Mr Pan did not have to hide the photos and video he was taking from inside the country - he simply asked for permission. 'I have been curious about North Korea for many years. The average person has probably seen more photos about outer space than of North Korea. It's one of those great mysteries that I wanted to discover for myself and I figured it might just be possible,' Mr Pan told MailOnline. He decided to set about planning a trip in 2012, by writing and asking permission to do a photographic project. 'It was a spur-of-the-moment decision. I didn't want to do a sneaky, undercover project as I didn't want to get into any trouble,' he said. Explaining how he got inside the secretive state, he explained: 'I sent several mails and faxes to multiple North Korean contacts, all of which are easily available online if you do a search. Then one day someone actually replied and I met their representative. It was a lot easier than I expected.' Women in brightly coloured bathing suits throw sand on the beach, as others stand with their bicycles in the background. In June 2013 it was reported that, as part of his plans to turn North Korea into a 'world class' tourist destination, leader Kim Jong-un ordered the transformation of the industrial port of Wonsan into a beach resort town .

Mr Pan, a commercial photographer by day who specialises in 360 degree panoramic virtual tours for real estate, hotels and automobiles, has now been on two visits to North Korea and plans to go on a third this autumn. 'I was supposed to book my first trip in August 2012. Unfortunately I was suddenly unwell and had to postpone my first trip to August 2013. Later when I approached the local travel agency (Universal Travel Corporation) specialising in North Korea tours with my proposal, the manager was very excited about it and immediately offered to sponsor my first trip. 'After that first trip, the manager of a second travel company (DPR Korea Tourism) based in Malaysia offered to sponsor my second trip. 'Currently, talks are already underway to plan a third trip this autumn and I’ve been told that more travel agencies in Singapore and Malaysia are already interested in marketing exotic tours to North Korea.'

Mr Pan said: 'People seem to go about their daily lives and everything looks so incredibly normal.' Consumer goods, such as electrical rice cookers and other kitchen appliances, have begun to flood North Korea via China . 'The things I've seen and photographed tell me that the situation isn't as bad as I thought,' Mr Pan explained after he saw healthy looking men and women play volleyball together on the beach . 'Coming back from my second trip, many things still puzzle me. I've travelled from Pyongyang to Hyangsan to Wonsan to Kumgangsan, to Kaesong and back. The things I've seen and photographed tell me that the situation isn't as bad as I thought,' he said. 'People seem to go about their daily lives and everything looks so incredibly normal. Some of my friends tell me that everything I've seen must be fake and all that I've photographed are a massive mock up. 'But the more I think about that logic, the more it doesn't make any sense… would anyone mock up miles and miles of crops as far as my eyes can see and orchestrate thousands of people to seemingly go about their daily lives?' In the late 1990s, North Korea suffered a major famine that is thought to have led to between 500,000 and 600,000 deaths. However, despite starvation no longer being a fact of life in North Korea, the most commonly cited cliche about the country is still that it is 'destitute' and 'starving'.

Mr Pan believes that to fake everything on such a massive scale would mean North Korea's organisation skills are 'far beyond that of any developed country'. He was escorted throughout his time in the country but said he had no schedule to follow and was given the ability to move around 'quite freely'. He has also reasoned that none of his photographs or video were confiscated or deleted.

"Pope Francis called on the church to adapt to 'changing conditions of society' yesterday following a conference that rejected changes that would have softened the church's stance toward homosexuality and divorce. As he beatified Pope Paul VI who implemented the Second Vatican Council's vast changes, Pope Francis said 'God is not afraid of new things'. Liberal reforms to church doctrine which fell short of the two thirds majority needed for success in the meeting would also have opened the way for Catholics who are divorced and remarried to receive communion, the central sacrament of the church. Pope Francis (pictured yesterday at the Vatican) spoke of the failings of opposing wings of the Church following the end of the Rome synod on family life which left supporters of gay rights and divorcees disappointed . Traditionalists, the Pope said, risk a temptation of 'hostile inflexibility'. It is unclear whether the document issued Saturday is a set-back for the pope, but the conference did prompt the church to discuss difficult issues such as the role of gays, lesbians and divorced Catholics. Commentators said the bishops had done what Francis had asked of them, which was to talk about the issues in an 'open way'.  But those talks, to 'take the bishop's pulse' on current issues, had exposed a split reformers and conservatives. An interim document issued last week by the bishops halfway through their synod included wording that welcomed the 'gifts and qualities' of gay Catholics and called on pastors to 'avoid any language or behavior' that could discriminate against divorced Catholics, USA Today reported. Saturday's report did not feature the reconciliatory language. The final paper also emphasised strongly that there was no change in the church's attitude to gay relationships. St Peter's Square: The attempt at liberal reform of the church's teachings are part of Pope Francis's attempt to steer the Vatican towards new thinking on gay rights and doctrine on marriage and the family . 'No grounds whatsoever exist for assimilating or drawing analogies, however remote, between homosexual unions and God's design for matrimony and the family,' it said. Divorced and remarried Catholics were denied hopes of a reform that would approve their taking communion without any annulment of their first marriage. The synod said 'greater theological study' and 'further consideration' were required. The church does not recognise divorce so remarried Catholics are regarded as adulterers. Some experts compared Pope Francis' efforts to modernise the church's postion, with Paul's implementation of the Second Vatican Council, which dramatically modernized the church in the 1960s and 1970s. Sunday's ceremony leaves Paul, who was pope from 1963 until his death in 1978, just one step short of sainthood. Popes John XXIII and John Paul II, who came before and after Paul, respectively, were made saints six months ago. Also attending the beatification Mass was Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI. Gathering: Priests attend a mass in St. Peter's square at the Vatican yesterday. Traditionalists, the Pope said, risk a temptation of 'hostile inflexibility' Since Francis became anointed last year, he has repeatedly broken with tradition. While the bishops failed to build on the tone he set last year by saying, 'Who am I to judge?' when asked whether gays can be good Christians, observers applauded the openness of addressing the contentious issues. A year-long debate and discussions will now before the bishops will reconvene for another three-week synod. A document on pastoral guidelines will then be formalised. Commentators believe Pope Francis will spend the next year making his case with bishops, but they believe the outcome could simply lead to the gap between church leaders widening.","Pope calls for the church to adapt to 'changing conditions of society'

"They may appear cute and cuddly, but as one alligator soon learned, otters can be vicious predators. These photos show an otter overpowering a juvenile gator and despite the reptile doing its best, it was no match for the fanged weasel-cousin. The animals were spotted at Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge in Florida, where it soon became clear that the otter was in it to win it. Bow down: The alligator growls in panic as the otter bites down on its neck in the water . P-otter and Voldemort: Although an alligator would traditionally be seen as the superior predator in this fight, it did not stand a chance against the otter . oh, snap: The animals were photographed at Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge in Florida, where the otter attacked the juvenile alligator, completely overpowering the reptile . The otter attacked the relatively young gator by biting it over the neck, ensuring it could not turn around and bite back. After a short struggle, the otter was able to drag the reptile onto a riverbank and out of sight. It then proceeded to eat the animal alive, validated by the ‘crunching noises’ that could be heard from the bank. Despite their adorable appearance, otters are the apex predator of many freshwater species. The munchies: The otter later dragged the juvenile gator on to a riverbank and began eating it alive . Otterly terrifying: The photographer said he was certain the otter ate the alligator because of the 'crunching noises' Although . they mainly feed on fish, they often add shellfish, crabs and small . mammals to their diet and it is not unheard of that they go for larger . animals and reptiles such as juvenile or small alligators. North American river otters can grow to be three to four feet long and weigh between 10 and 30lbs and must eat the equivalent of 15 per cent of their own body weight each day to keep warm. The attack took place at a 21,574 acre wildlife refuge along the St. Johns River near DeLeon Springs. Its . geographical location, which overlaps subtropical and temperate . climates allows for a high diversity in types of animals, including 215 . species of birds, 22 species of amphibian and 50 species of reptiles.","Otter attacked a young alligator at Florida wildlife reserve .
