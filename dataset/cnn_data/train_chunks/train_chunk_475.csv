Walter Cronkite ‘wanted to destroy’ Dan Rather out of jealousy that he was younger and making more money than him, a new book claims. The veteran broadcaster despised his successor at CBS and supposedly heaped ‘venom’ upon him in a bid to derail his career. The feud only got worse when he became convinced that Rather had canned his special to mark the 25th anniversary of John F Kennedy’s assassination. Frienemies: Dan Rather, left, and Walter Cronkite, right, had a famously strained relationship; Cronkite is quoted as calling Rather 'insincere' Succession: Rather, right of centre, took over anchoring after Chronkite, centre, stepped down from the CBS Evening News . In a withering judgement, Cronkite is quoted as saying: ‘I think it’s unfortunate that any other person feels about another as I do about Dan. ‘But to me, I guess, Dan just reeks of insincerity.’ The claims reopen old wounds in the famously strained relationship between the two men, especially on the side of Cronkite who died in 2009 at the age of 92. He was replaced by Rather as the CBS evening news anchor in 1981 at the age of 65 in a mandatory retirement that became one of the most rancorous successions in TV history. According to Cronkite, the forthcoming biography by author Douglas Brinkley, problems really began in 1987 when Rather stormed off the set of the evening news when told he would lose his first 15 minutes of broadcast time because of the U.S. Open tennis coverage. Cronkite told colleagues he would have fired him on the spot for such a public display of insubordination. News veteran: Cronkite, seen at the 1957 inauguration of Eisenhower, was replaced by Rather as the CBS evening news anchor in 1981 at the age of 65 in a mandatory retirement that became one of the most rancorous successions in TV history . Rather says in the book: ‘It was like he woke up in 1987 and saw me in his old job with successful ratings, making more money than he ever did - and I was relatively young to boot. Old wounds: This and more is described in author Douglas Brinkley's upcoming biography of the news stalwart . ‘He wanted to destroy me. I didn’t know what to do. I kept wondering how to handle his venom. ‘I decided I didn’t want to fight him. So I hunkered down in the fetal position and just took it.’ Cronkite became ‘more and more bitter toward the Rather regime’ when he became convinced that Rather had spiked his proposed Kennedy special. Rather tells the book that things ‘escalated’ but he was not to blame. He said: ‘Believe me, it was a complete non-starter from the get-go. ‘It wasn’t… a serious consideration. But Walter created this false scenario that I had somehow nixed his Kennedy special.’ In an effort to quell the row, CBS executives signed Cronkite to a final 10-year deal but ordered him to stop publicly criticising Rather. Matters were not helped however when it emerged Cronkite would lose his personal staff and that his salary was being was slashed by $850,000 a year to $150,000. The downgrade came on his 72nd birthday. The biography, extracts of which appeared in the New York Post, is the latest salvo in the war between the two broadcasters. According to reports from the time, Rather completely snubbed Cronkite at the 1984 Democratic National Convention even though he was waiting in a studio next door. 'He wanted to destroy me. I didn't know what to do. I kept wondering how to handle his venom.' -Dan Rather . For his part Cronkite said that Rather’s replacement Bob Schieffer, who took over in 2005 should have done so sooner and that the new man was ‘one of the great television journalists of our time’. Cronkite said at the time: ‘Although Dan did a fine job, I would have liked to have seen (Schieffer) there a long time ago’. Rather’s comments in the biography are all the more surprising as he had been effusive in his praise for Rather when he died and said his ‘admiration for his accomplishments never wavered.’ Cronkite was still alive when in 2006 Rather’s career at CBS came to an end over his bungled 60 Minutes II report on George W Bush’s national guard service.","Cronkite biography paints tense picture between two CBS News anchors .

Iran and world powers blamed each other today for the lack of progress in talks on Tehran's nuclear programme. The stalemate has dimmed hopes of a breakthrough which it was hoped would avert the threat of a new Middle East war. On the second and final day of talks in Moscow, frustration mounted over the failure to move any closer to ending a decade of negotiations over Iranian work. Deadlock: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (centre) visiting the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility in April 2008 which the international community believe may be one of the sites that Iran is potentially enriching uranium to weapons grade . If talks collapse, nerves could grow on financial markets over the danger of higher oil prices and new conflict in the Middle East. Israel has previously threatened to bomb Iranian nuclear sites if diplomacy fails to stop Tehran getting the bomb. An Iranian diplomat said: 'We did not come to Moscow only for discussions. We came to Moscow for a resolution. But we believe the opposite side is not ready to reach a resolution.' Iran says its nuclear programme has only non-military purposes, but the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany want Tehran to stop enriching uranium to levels that bring it close to acquiring weapons-grade material. Battle: European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, (pictured in 2011) who is leading the world powers' delegation, found Monday's talks had been 'intense and tough' according to her spokesman . Iran's negotiators want relief from . economic sanctions and are pushing the six powers to acknowledge its . right to enrich uranium, something they refuse to do until Tehran allows . United Nations inspections of its work. A . spokesman for European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, who . is leading the world powers' delegation, said Monday's talks had been . intense and tough. A Western diplomat made clear late on Monday Iran needed to do more to address proposals made by the six powers at the last round of talks. The diplomat, who was at the talks, said: 'Our key requirements are: stop, shut and ship.' Power: The Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (seated second from right) leads the country with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (seated second from left) He was referring to demands for Iran to stop producing higher-grade uranium, ship any stockpile out of the country and close down an underground enrichment facility, Fordow. But an Iranian official said Tehran's delegation had made detailed proposals on the first day of talks and the six powers had responded with one-line answers that lacked any depth. He said: 'Our feeling is that the agenda this group is following is not suitable for the arguments that Iran was making. We believe we are at a crossroads. And today the other side has to choose a path.' Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who leads Russia's delegation at the talks, said diplomacy could still be salvaged. Ryabkov said: 'I don't think anything will break down. We will have a reasonable outcome.' Ambition: The Bushehr nuclear power plant, just outside the southern city of Bushehr, Iran is feared to be among possible Israeli military targets if negotiations over Iranian uranium enrichment fail to reach agreement (picture from 2010) Production: A picture taken inside the Russian built nuclear power plant in Bushehr south of Tehran in 2009 when journalists were allowed to tour the facility . The Moscow talks follow two rounds of negotiations since diplomacy resumed in April after a 15-month hiatus. During the break in talks the West cranked up sanctions pressure and Israel repeated its threat to bomb Iranian nuclear sites if diplomacy failed. A second Western diplomat said: 'We haven't reached an agreement, but it is more complex than that. We haven't got to the end of the conversation.' A series of United Nations Security Council resolutions since 2006 have demanded Iran suspend all its enrichment-related activities. Tehran denies planning to build nuclear weapons and says its programme is purely for civilian purposes. Rather than halt enrichment - a process which refines uranium for use as fuel or, if done to a much higher level, nuclear bomb material - Iran has increased its activities. Experts said a breakthrough was unlikely as the six powers involved are wary of making concessions that would let Tehran draw out the talks and gain the time needed to develop nuclear weapons. Unity: U.S. President Barack Obama (right) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) yesterday at the G20 Summit in Mexico have both called on Tehran to prove its nuclear programme is not aimed at developing weapons . An EU embargo on Iranian oil takes full effect on July 1 and new U.S. financial sanctions shortly before that. Iran's crude oil exports have fallen by some 40 percent this year, according to the International Energy Agency. Increasing the pressure, is Israel - believed to be the only nuclear-armed country in the Middle East - has said time is running out before Iran's nuclear facilities, some of which are deep underground, become invulnerable to air strikes. Western diplomats said one positive sign to emerge from Monday's talks was that Tehran was willing to discuss higher-grade uranium, the international community's most pressing concern. In early 2010, Iran announced it had started enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, a level much higher than what is needed for power generation and seen by some experts as a dangerous step towards being able to make bomb material. The six powers want a substantive response to their offer of fuel supplies for Tehran's research reactor and relief in sanctions on the sale of commercial aircraft parts to Iran. Diplomats said the powers had also suggested, at a meeting in Baghdad in May, that they suspend introducing new sanctions at the United Nations level while diplomacy is taking place, but only if their demands on high-grade uranium are met. Displaying unity after meeting on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Mexico on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama again called for Tehran to prove its nuclear programme is not aimed at developing weapons. Obama said the two leaders agreed on the need for a diplomatic solution to the standoff and that there was still time to resolve the matter through diplomatic means.","Second and final day of talks between six world powers and the Iranians fail to reach any new agreements .

Fateful night: Evan Dube, 19, was at a barbecue on the beach in Lerwick when he went for a swim just after 9pm . A U.S. student who was working on an archaeological project in the Shetland Islands collapsed and died after going for an evening swim. Evan Dube, 19, was at a barbecue on a beach in Lerwick with a group of ten students from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, before his death on Saturday night. The first-year student swam out into the sea soon after arriving at 9pm. 'Evan went into the water and after coming ashore appears to have collapsed,' said police. An ambulance arrived in minutes, and Mr Dube was then airlifted to a nearby hospital, but all resuscitation attempts failed, and an autopsy is taking place today. The teenager, from Plaistow, New Hampshire, was taking part in the Shetland Islands Climate and Settlement Project, a study involving students from several higher education institutions from Maine. It was looking at the severe climate transformations of the most northern of the Scottish Isles, particularly at a settlement in Quendale Valley that was entirely buried by sandstorms and subsequently abandoned between 1690 and 1710AD. Mr Dube's college released a statement saying: 'Bates College has been shaken and deeply saddened to learn that first-year student Evan Dube died on Saturday night, May 19, in the Shetland Islands, Scotland. Tragedy: The teenager was described by his college as 'serious, exuberant and a caring friend' Shocked community: Police said the teenager collapsed after coming out of the water and could not be resuscitated . 'At this time we have no other information about the incident to offer— simply that we have lost a member of our Bates community long before his time. 'Evan’s fellow students in Scotland are receiving grief counseling and will return to Boston on Tuesday.' Bates said Mr Dube, a Buddhist, would be remembered as 'a young man who was studious and serious, exuberant and funny - and a caring friend.' Dean of Students Tedd Goundie wrote in an email to the student body: 'We will be absorbing this terrible loss for many days and long into the future. 'Please join me in keeping Evan’s family and friends in your thoughts and prayers.'","Evan Dube, 19, was one of ten students taking part in the Scottish project ."

The new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble space telescope has discovered the first hints that these chemicals might be present in an unlikely place - the rocky, icy surface of the distant dwarf planet Pluto.

The new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble space telescope has discovered the first hints that these chemicals might be present in an unlikely place - the rocky, icy surface of the distant dwarf planet Pluto . The chemicals detected on the surface might have been produced by sunlight or cosmic rays reacting with Pluto's surface ices, which include frozen methane, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. ‘This is an exciting finding. Plutonian hydrocarbons may be responsible for giving Pluto its ruddy color,’ said the Southwest Research institute's Alan Stern. The researchers also found evidence that things on Pluto appear to be changing. The Hubble space telescope's new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph captured an image of a strong ultraviolet 'absorber' on the surface of Pluto. Scientists hope to learn more when Nasa's Messenger craft arrives in 2016 . There are changes in Pluto’s ultraviolet spectrum compared to Hubble measurements from the 1990s. The changes may be simply be caused by looking at different terrains, or to other effects, such as changes in the surface related to a steep increase in the pressure of Pluto’s atmosphere.‘The discovery we made with Hubble reminds us that even more exciting discoveries about Pluto’s composition and surface evolution are likely to be in store when NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft arrives at Pluto in 2015,’ Stern added.","Hydrocarbon molecules may explain planet's red hue .

Close: Universities minister David Willetts will speak at a Google conference days after the Mail revealed the company's 23 meetings with Tory ministers . A senior Conservative will be cosying up to Google this week, days after the Daily Mail revealed the extraordinarily close relationship between the Tories and the technology firm. On Wednesday, Science Minister David Willetts will speak at Big Tent, an annual media event organised by Google and attended by its executive chairman Eric Schmidt. It will take place in Hertfordshire following the secretive Zeitgeist conference, which begins today. David Cameron spoke at the gathering in 2006, and in 2007 was flown to California to address its US equivalent. Google has not announced who will be at this year’s Zeitgeist, but former US president Bill Clinton is expected to attend. A guest list which was leaked last month also included singer Annie Lennox, Jim O’Neill from Goldman Sachs, model and actress Lily Cole and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The Grove hotel will host both events. Mr Willetts’s speech will come days after the Mail revealed there have been 23 official meetings between Tory ministers and Google since the general election – the equivalent of one a month. The links are so strong that in recent years at least three senior figures have moved between the Tories and Google. History: David Cameron spoke at the Google Zeitgeist conference in 2006 and 2007 . Saturday's Daily Mail . The Prime Minister has met Google executives three times since the election, while Chancellor George Osborne has held four meetings. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has met the firm’s staff seven times, and his boss, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, has met them four times. Mr Willetts had one meeting with a Google executive, in January 2011. The revelations led to concerns that the internet giant has the ear of the Government on a host of sensitive topics. Labour says the Conservatives have avoided tackling online porn because of their close relationship with the company. The party’s media spokesman Helen Goodman said: ‘Of course it is important for ministers to listen to business, but a meeting with Google every month does look like the sort of privileged access that small businesses can only dream of.’ Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, left, has had four meetings with Google, while Ed Vaizey, the Culture Minister has met Google chiefs seven times . Last week a spokesman for Google said: ‘It’s absolutely right that governments speak with companies about issues that affect their citizens. ‘The British Government makes the list of those meetings publicly available – including the Daily Mail’s 34 meetings over the same period.’ Yesterday the firm insisted Big Tent was a ‘public conference to debate the internet and society’. It added: ‘The science and universities minister is one of a wide range of speakers, including Amanda Platell from the Daily Mail, who will talk about these important matters.’ Other Big Tent speakers will include Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, Father Ted writer Graham Linehan and Damian Tambini, an academic at the LSE. Last year’s line-up included Big Brother producer Peter Bazalgette, Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts and senior Tory Mr Hunt. Attendees discussed topics such as ‘What was the role of technology in the revolutions in the Middle East?’, ‘What are the limits of free speech online?’, ‘Do we need tougher privacy laws or are we in danger of stifling innovation?’ and ‘Can technology and access to information be used to help prevent conflict?’.","David Willett's will deliver speech at event attended by executive chairman Eric Schmidt .

An eccentric aristocrat eco-activist has broken into a GM research institute in a bid to destroy controversial field trials on genetically modified wheat. Hector Christie, 50, son of the founder of the Glyndebourne opera, is said to have caused ‘significant damage’ during the raid in the early hours of Sunday. The Old Etonian inherited the 6,000-acre Tapeley Park estate in Devon and featured in the Channel 4 series Country House Rescue last year. Break in: Hector Christie is said to have caused 'significant damage' during a raid of a GM research facility . He has a long history of protest and was once arrested in Germany dressed as a potato. The target of Sunday’s break-in was the controversial GM wheat trial at the  Rothamsted Research centre in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. The wheat has been modified to emit chemical signals to drive away aphids, which the institute claims will allow farmers to use fewer chemical pesticides. However, consumers are sceptical of the benefits of such crops and as a result there is no demand for GM wheat in Britain. Protest group Take The Flour Back has been set up to challenge the trial. They are concerned that pollen from the GM wheat will spread to contaminate grasslands in the area. Controversial: The target of Sunday's break-in was the controversial GM wheat trial at the Rothamsted Research centre in Harpenden, Hertfordshire . However, it appears that Christie mounted his own protest by breaking into the laboratories. In a statement Rothamsted said the protester caused ‘significant, random property damage but failed in his attempt to disrupt the experiment’. Director Maurice Moloney described the break-in as an ‘act of vandalism’ and said the ‘illegal activity’ had taken place despite efforts to hold talks with protesters in the hope of allowing the trials to run their course. Eleanor Baylis, a Take The Flour Back spokesman, said they ‘had no information’ about the break-in but said the group was ‘relieved if the quantity of GM pollen released from the trial has been reduced’. Christie is due to appear in court on July 13.","Significant damage caused in raid .

Matthew Milat, 19, told 17-year-old David Auchterlonie he was just 'doing what my family does', before brutally beheading him in Belanglo Forest, south of Sydney. Milat's uncle Ivan had killed seven backpackers in the forest in April 1992, including British women Joanne Walters and Caroline Clarke, both 22.

Notorious spot: Milat decapitated his teenage victim in Belanglo Forest, south of Sydney, just as his uncle Ivan did to one of the backpackers he killed 20 years earlier . His nephew's troubled state of mind was clear from the poems, which included phrases such as 'I am not fazed by blood and screams', which he wrote before the sickening attack. Another contains the line: 'Clouds roll over in light blue skies/ Like darkness in a killer's eyes.' Milat hovered over David with an axe for ten minutes before the murder, telling him, 'You move, I chop your head off.' Milat and Cohen Klein, also 19, are now facing a sentencing submission hearing in the New South Supreme Court after pleading guilty at an earlier hearing to murdering David. The court was told David's family remained 'terrified' at the knowledge of how he died at the hands of Ivan Milat's relative.

Accomplice: Cohen Klein, left, is facing a sentencing submission hearing in the New South Supreme Court alongisde Matthew Milat after they pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to the murder . Matthew Milat, the 19-year-old nephew of notorious serial killer Ivan, composed several ominous poems before his brutal murder of 17-year-old David Auchterlonie. In one of the twisted verses, read out during today's hearing, he wrote: . 'Lifeless corpse, Motionless and drained, . Another street has been blood stained, . heart and soul I do not own, . and there is no place I can call home, . What sort of life do I lead, . the kind that keeps me on the streets, . Kill for cash, Is what I do, . call me up I'll work for you, . I am not fazed by blood or screams, . Nothing I do will haunt my dreams, . Maybe they might scare you, . Coldblooded (sic) killer, that's me, Not you.' Another poem is written in rap style and entitled, Your Last Day. David's father, also David, told Acting Justice Jane Mathews that his son 'received a life sentence, but it's a curse for those of us left behind', Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported. In a poignant moment, he said that he had wanted to kiss his son goodbye when he saw his body but he was a court exhibit now. The teenager's mother, Debbie Locke, said she often wears her son's jackets and hooded tops to feel close to him. In court documents seen by The Telegraph, Milat said that in committing murder he was just 'doing what my family does'. As he walked towards the forest with his victim and Klein, he said, 'we're going to Belanglo. Someone's going to die.' The court was told that the murder and 15 minutes of dialogue were captured on Klein's mobile phone. David's grandmother, Sandra, told the court after she saw him in the mortuary, 'I can still see the fear impaled on his face.' During today's hearing, parts of a 15-minute audio recording of the murder were played - after the judge invited the family of the victim to leave if it was going to be too distressing for them. Milat is heard telling David he had 'dobbed him in' for stealing, before adding: 'You move, I chop your head off. I warned you that I was a bit of a f***in' nut lately.' David was forced to lie face down in the dirt and can be heard repeatedly denying doing anything to Milat. Then the recording plays what a transcript describes as the 'sound of axe hitting Auchterlonie in the head.' Shocking deaths: Ivan Milat's seven victims, including British 22-year-olds Joanne Walters, bottom left, and Caroline Clarke, second right at bottom . The sentencing hearing continues. Ivan Milat, now 68, is serving seven consecutive life sentences and will never be released from his maximum security jail south-west of Sydney. Australia's worst serial killer, Milat came to be known as the Backpacker Murderer. His victims were kidnapped and shot or stabbed to death, with one young woman, from Germany, being decapitated. Miss Clarke, from Northumberland, had been shot several times in the head while Miss Walters, from  south Wales, had been stabbed nine times. The Britons' bodies were found in the forest in September of the same year. No other bodies were found at the time, but a year later a local man discovered a skull. Police returned to the forest and found five more bodies of backpackers who had been murdered in previous years. Milat had also killed a German backpacking couple, a German woman who was hitchhiking alone, and two young travellers from Melbourne. He was arrested after British backpacker Paul Onions managed to escape and give police details of his attacker.","Matthew Milat's uncle Ivan murdered seven in same forest 20 years earlier .

Failed by police: No-one has ever been convicted of murdering Daniel Morgan, who was found dead in a pub car park in Sydenham, south London, in 1987 . Bungling police and prosecutors caused the collapse of a multi-million pound murder prosecution by losing four crates of evidence, a damning new review has found. Five inquiries failed to find Daniel Morgan’s murderer after he was killed in a Sydenham pub car park in 1987, and the case has become one of Britain's most notorious unsolved murders. Mr Morgan was found with an axe embedded in his head, and his family have always believed he was killed because he was about to unveil a web of corruption involving his business partner Jonathan Rees, an ex-Met police detective friend named Sid Fillery, and a string of police officers. Defence lawyers acting in the case asked for access to particular documents just a month before the last murder trial collapsed at the Old Bailey last year. It then emerged that four whole boxes of evidence had been left in storage instead of being handed over, and that three were relevant to the trial proceedings. As a result, Mr Rees and his brothers-in-law Garry Vian and Glenn Vian were cleared of any involvement in the killing. The report said: 'The police team were unable, in respect of four of the boxes, to locate them.... These latest developments proved to be the final undoing and the cumulative weight against the Crown's position became untenable.' The review was jointly produced by the police and Crown Prosecution Service, and while it found that the loss of the boxes was the case's 'final undoing', it also criticised the 'unreliability of critical witnesses'. The three witnesses in question were 'assisting offenders' - commonly known as 'supergrasses' - whose handling is covered by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act of 2005 (Socpa). They were undermined by what the report called 'factors that adversely affected their credibility', and this led to the collapse of the case against two other defendants - James Cook, accused of murder, and former detective sergeant Sid Fillery, charged with perverting the course of justice. The costs of the five police inquiries and an inquest, as well as three years of legal hearings, are unofficially estimated at £30 million. The report found: 'This was a truly exceptional case in terms of a combination of factors, namely its age; the size and the number of linked operations; the enormous volume of material generated, particularly unused, and the fact that all three of the Socpa witnesses were undermined, post charge, by factors that adversely affected their credibility. In addition there was a lack of scientific evidence.' A total of 17 points of 'good practice' were included in the review. The guidance relating to supergrasses states that a 'thorough investigation addressing the credibility of the witness' is vital whenever they are used. Cleared: Sid Fillery (left) was cleared of perverting the course of justice, while Jonathan Rees (right) was acquitted when the murder case against him collapsed . There should also be a 'full and auditable record of all police contact regarding the management of any Socpa witness' and 'consideration needs to be given at the outset to the types of unused material that could reasonably be expected to be encountered in a particular prosecution, and its anticipated location'. The good practice guidance adds: 'Consideration must be given to the size and complexity of the disclosure task from the outset.' Scene of the crime: The Golden Lion Pub in Sydenham, where private eye Daniel Morgan was found axed to death in the car park . Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick and Alison Saunders, chief Crown prosecutor for London, issued a joint statement today. It said: 'This case, as the trial judge said, was of an exceptional scale and complexity, with over three quarters of a million documents gathered over 20 years being examined. 'The issues around the disclosure exercise were such that we could not guarantee that all relevant material had been identified, considered and disclosed so as to ensure a fair trial. A further factor related to the unreliability of critical witnesses. 'To this end, the purpose of the review was to identify potential good practice and learning for both police and prosecutors for future cases. 'What the review was not was an investigation into allegations of corruption; nor was it intended to serve the purpose of an investigation for police disciplinary purposes. 'Those recommendations identified within the review will now be implemented by both agencies.' Labour MP Tom Watson has accused the News of the World of collaborating with suspects in the Morgan murder case . Back in March, Labour MP Tom Watson accused the News of the World of collaborating with suspects in the Morgan murder case by placing a senior detective under surveillance on the pretence that he was having an affair. Speaking during an adjournment debate ahead of the 25th anniversary of Mr Morgan’s death, he said News of the World crime journalist Alex Marunchak was a close associate of Mr Morgan's business partner Mr Rees - who became a main suspect in his murder - and regularly paid his company Southern Investigators for information. ‘Jonathan Rees and Sid Fillery were at the corrupt nexus of private investigators, police officers and journalists at the News of the World,' he said. ‘Southern Investigations was the hub of police and media contacts involving the illegal theft and disclosure of information obtained through Rees and Fillery’s corrupt contacts.’ When Detective Chief Inspector Dave Cook started to investigate the murder, at a time when Mr Rees was still a suspect, it is alleged Mr Marunchak placed the police officer under surveillance. Mr Rees was accused of Mr Morgan's murder in 2008 but the case collapsed in 2010. West Bromwich East MP Mr Watson told the adjournment debate: ‘The person who was investigating a murder was put under close surveillance by a close business associate of the man he was investigating. ‘A journalist tried to undermine a murder investigation.’ He added: ‘I think Rupert Murdoch owes the Morgan family an apology. I also don’t think he has made his last apology to the grieving parents of dead children.’ Mr Marunchak has previously denied having any contact with Daniel Morgan, and all allegations of wrongdoing.","Five inquiries failed to find Daniel Morgan’s murderer after he was killed in a Sydenham pub car park in 1987 .

Arrest: Gordon Collins-Faunce told police he picked up his baby son by his head and threw him in a chair when he became overwhelmed caring for him . The grandfather of the ten-week-old boy who was beaten to death allegedly by his father last week wants to know why previous abuse was not flagged up by Child Protection Services. Gordon Collins-Faunce, 23, from Maine, is accused of picking up baby Ethan Henderson by the head, squeezing his skull and throwing him so violently into a chair, he snapped his neck. When Ethan arrived at the hospital, doctors noted he had older brain injuries and  described him as a 'dirty child' with nappy rash and an unwashed belly button. He died three days later from severe bleeding to the brain. His mother, 23-year-old Christina Henderson, was at work at the time. Irving Faunce - former mayor of Gardiner and Wilton selectman, and a health care consultant - wants to know why the family were not contacted or why CPS did not act. 'A report and follow-up could easily have prevented Ethan's death,' he told the Portland Press Herald. He also made a promise to his grandson that he would not let anything like that happen again. 'My wife and I would do whatever we can do to make sure this doesn't happen again,' Mr Faunce said. 'I also promised that we would work on his behalf to make sure that those who should be accountable (for) what had happened to him are held accountable.' Legislators also want answers. The Legislature's Health and Human Services Committee held a hearing on Wednesday to explore how the state Office of Child and Family Services responds to reports of abuse and what obstacles may inhibit its response. After Collins-Faunce was charged with the murder, he admitted to detectives he had broken the boys arm because he became frustrated as he was changing his diaper. He told doctors at the time the child had caught his arm in his crib. Victim: Baby Ethan sustained severe brain damage and died three days later. His father also admitted he had previously broken his arm when he became stressed while changing his diaper . After Ethan's death, he admitted to police he became frustrated with the boy when he started crying. 'He said he stood up straight and held Ethan by the head with both hands for ""one minute max"",' the police affidavit said. 'He then hurled Ethan into a chair in the living room, seeing the boy's head snap back as he landed. On a scale of one to ten, he estimated his force to be eight or nine,' the affidavit read. Grandfather: Irving Faunce wants to know why CPS did not do anything when baby Ethan was treated for a broken arm last month . He has been charged with depraved indifference murder and is being held on $100,000 bail in the York County Jail. Friends told the Press Herald that Collins-Faunce had been targeting Ethan, and that his girlfriend had never known. 'He's been targeting Ethan and she just didn't realize it,' Nicole Tucker said. Officials are refusing to comment on the case citing confidentiality laws and the fact it is an open, ongoing investigation. Sue Hadiaris, a spokeswoman for Southern Maine Medical Center, said: 'There is an investigation that's open right now. There's not any way we would be able to make any kind of a comment about where Ethan received his care or the care he received.' A Department of Health and Human Services worker told police that a daycare provider reported that Ethan's half sister, three, had come to daycare 'covered in bruises'. It is not yet clear if any action was taken following this report. According to the Portland Press Herald, Irving Faunceadopted Gordon Collins-Faunce and his two sisters when Gordon was eight years old and had been in a succession of foster homes. He was said to have been sexually and physically abused and was taking medication for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Faunce - an administrator at a nursing home in Penobscot - said he wants to understand where mistakes were made and how to correct them, so that what happened to his grandson doesn't happen to anyone else. He said: 'I work in the health care business. I'm very aware of mandated reporting. It just strikes me how an infant could go through having a fractured arm and have it seen by two physicians and it didn't go to someone.' The DHHS rarely comments on cases involving child abuse and neglect, citing a state law that requires it to keep much of its child protective information confidential. Family: Collins-Faunce is pictured with his fiancee Christina Henderson, her three-year-old daughter and their twin sons Ethan and Lucas. A family friend said she believed the father picked on Ethan . Anger issues: Collins-Faunce was discharged from the military after he held a knife to a roommate's throat . The affidavit also noted that Collins-Faunce has been taking medication for post-traumatic stress disorder as he was physically and sexually abused as a boy by various foster parents. He told police he was discharged from the military after he held a knife to a roommate's throat and had been an alcoholic throughout 2010 but had since stopped drinking. His medication for post-traumatic stress disorder had recently changed, and he was having trouble sleeping. But Tucker said his new mood stabilizers seemed to be worked. 'The day this happened, he didn't take his meds,' she said. Collins-Faunce is being held in the York County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. The other two children were removed from the home but Henderson is now petitioning to have them returned now her fiance is out of the house.","Gordon Collins-Faunce, 23, admitted he was 'losing control' of his children .

Fun-loving and mischievous: Tyler Whelan was killed after being kicked across a room and into a door, rupturing his abdomen . A 'wicked and controlling' man who murdered his 'fun-loving, mischievous' stepson has today been ordered to serve at least 17 years in prison. Elvis Lee, 34, was yesterday found guilty of murdering Tyler Whelan, five. Lee admitted he kicked and bit Tyler on the day of his death but denied murder. The boy's mother, Stephanie Whelan, 27, has been found guilty of failing to prevent his death and is due to be sentenced next month. The kick was so hard that Tyler flew two feet through the air hitting a door at his home in Paston, near Peterborough, rupturing his abdomen and slowly killing him. At Cambridge Crown Court today, Mr Justice Nicol sentenced him to life with a minimum tariff of 17 and a half years. He said: 'Tyler had been left in your care while his mother took two other children to school. 'His young life was cut tragically short. This has been a tragedy for his father, his mother and the rest of the family. Tyler was particularly vulnerable because of his age. He was only half your height and a quarter of your weight. 'I entertain the lingering suspicion you inflicted more blows than you have admitted and that may have been the reason Tyler said nothing to his mother when she returned.' A report published after the conviction found that key opportunities to protect Tyler were missed by authorities tasked with his care. It acknowledged that previous incidents in which the boy was hurt had been 'seen in isolation' with 'minimal attempts to link concerning patterns of injuries'. Michael Borrelli QC, mitigating, said Lee’s attack on Tyler on March 7 last year was not pre-meditated and was instead a loss of temper and 'act of spite'. Elvis Lee, left, was found guilty of murder while Tyler's mother, Stephanie Whelan was found guilty of allowing his death . He . said: 'My client was himself the victim of considerable violence as a . child. He lacked a real appreciation as to the consequences of what he . did because, despite the treatment he himself had been the victim of, he . had never suffered serious injury.' The trial heard evidence that Tyler suffered a number of 'non-accidental' injuries in the year before his death. But Mr Borrelli said his client had been cleared of cruelty and neglect allegations and should be sentenced on the basis that this was an isolated attack. In June 2010, a year before he died, Tyler was taken to hospital with a fractured leg. His mother said he had fallen up some stairs but paediatric registrars referred the case to social services over other bruising to his body. Children's services said there was no risk and his injuries were from a genuine accident. In September that year he was in hospital again after falling off a bike. Again social services were told about the incident and again they deemed it to be from a genuine accident. On February 2011 teachers raised concerns over what they thought to be a radiator burn. Tyler's mother said he was accident prone. He was taken to see a GP but there was no further action. Head of children's services at Peterborough City Council, councillor Sheila Scott said: 'It was a single violent assault that led to his death and the perpetrator has now been brought to justice. Malcolm Newsam, Executive Director of Children's Services, said: 'There were certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more rigorous.' A serious case review found it was not possible to say with certainty that Tyler's death was predictable or preventable. Mr Newsam added: 'Nonetheless the service we offered Tyler was not good enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for that failing.' Whelan, who lived in Paston but is originally from Wigan, and Lee, also from Paston, were each cleared of two counts of cruelty or neglect relating to their failure to seek prompt medical attention on previous occasions. In statement read outside the court on . behalf of Tyler's family yesterday, his father Shaun Harrison said: 'The last year . of my life has been unbearable. Tyler was a fun-loving mischievous little boy with a big heart and amazing smile. 'I feel lost without him in my life and I can't believe he has gone. It hurts me that I will never get the . chance to see him grow up and see the man he should have become.' A serious case review, compiled by the Peterborough Safeguarding Children Board and published after the verdict at Cambridge Crown Court, acknowledged failings by the organisations responsible for his care, including Peterborough Children’s Services. The report concluded that it was impossible to say that, had there been greater intervention, the tragedy would have been prevented. But the report said: 'Whilst it would . be very challenging to state with any conviction that the subject’s . (Tyler’s) death was either predictable or preventable, there were . certainly numerous missed opportunities when interventions should have . been more rigorous and incisive on clear occasions when there were . concerns about his safety at home. 'Additionally, there were some . occasions when initiatives were not taken to assess the levels of risk . to the subject when there was a procedural requirement to have done so. 'Even . if any of the missed assessment opportunities had in fact been taken . and completed in line with procedures, it could still not be said with . any certainty that they would have made a difference to the eventual . tragic outcome.' Superintendent . Simon Megicks, from Cambridgeshire Police, said: 'This was a wicked . crime in which an innocent five-year-old was murdered by a person who . should have been looking after him. Shaun Harrison, Tyler's father, watched in court as Lee was sentenced to 17 years in prison . 'Lee is a controlling and violent man who lost his temper and inflicted fatal injuries to Tyler. Whelan has been found to have allowed his death following these fatal injuries - Tyler deserved more from his mother. 'Every child has the right to be protected and feel safe in their own home and it is a parent’s responsibility to ensure this is the case.' In a statement, Malcolm Newsam, executive director of children's services at Peterborough City Council, said there were 'lessons to be learned' following Tyler's death. He added that these were consistent with previous Ofsted inspections which had found weaknesses in the council's procedures to safeguard children. Sheila Scott, the council's cabinet member for children's services, expressed regret for the 'terrible tragedy'. DS Simon Megicks described the murder as a 'wicked crime' in which an innocent child was killed by someone who should have been looking after him . She said that since last year the council had recruited an extra 25 social workers, reduced workloads and is now completing assessments of all vulnerable children in a 'timely fashion'. Mr Newsam said: 'There were certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more rigorous. However, sadly, it is not clear that even if we had completed this work to the required standard, that the outcome for Tyler would have been any different. 'Nonetheless, the service we offered Tyler was not good enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for that failing. 'We would like to reassure residents that Peterborough's children's social care department is unrecognisable now to what it was 12 months ago and we have made significant improvements to our services to vulnerable children. 'We appreciate that our actions since last summer cannot change what has happened in the past, but we can confirm that our services are now much more effective at protecting vulnerable children.'","Review finds 'numerous missed opportunities' in preventing boy's death .

The £27million Olympics opening ceremony will feature smoke stacks, pits and steam power as it showcases Britain's industrial past, new aerial photographs suggest. Danny Boyle is expected present a grim picture of Britain's satanic mills with a towering factory chimney the centrepiece of a scene showing off the country's coal-powered past. The organisers have already revealed how they will show off cricket on the village green, dancing happily around the maypoles and singing for joy in the background. But they are expected to show a darker side to our past in the second scene. Industrial heritage: A new aerial photograph of the Olympic Stadium as preparations for the opening ceremony continue shows a selection of props including cauldrons, chimney stacks and cotton looms . This dramatic image of what the opening ceremony is expected to look like was caught by a cameraman in an airship which passed near the Olympic Stadium in East London. The river snaking through the centre of London seems to resemble the aerial image of London in the EastEnders credits. But sprouting from the landscape are a selection of iconic images from the industrial past. There appears to be a coalmine in the image, as well as a water wheel, a cauldron and a cotton loom in the ceremony.

Among . the more unusual items on show are three enormous iron-framed beds, one . of which has a pirate's hat and a hook lying on it which might indicate . the use of the Captain Hook character from JM Barrie's Peter Pan.

The volunteer performers are not being paid but will receive travel and food costs, and officials have sent out letters warning those taking part not to divulge any information about what they are doing. Boyle, who directed the multi-Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire, said the aim of the ceremony was to create 'a picture of ourselves as a nation' and to ensure it is authentic there will even be giant fake clouds which will pour with rain.

Fugitive: Police have an arrest warrant for the younger Nichols, Dan, who failed to show up for a pre-trial hearing in a drug case . Police arrested notorious 'mountain man' Dan Nichols Tuesday on drug charges following a months-long search that came nearly three decades after he and his father kidnapped a world-class athlete. Nichols was taken into custody after phoning the U.S. Marshals Service and saying he would be in the Walmart parking lot in Butte between 2pm and 3pm. Nichols showed up as promised in a 1982 red Honda Prelude with Bozeman license plates and was arrested without incident, Walsh said. 'He basically turned himself in,' Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff John Walsh said. The sheriff said he did not know why Nichols called marshals. Nichols failed to appear in court in March on charges of drug possession and intent to distribute during a rock concert last August in Three Forks, and Jefferson County officials issued a warrant for his arrest. Nichols was 46 at the time of his arrest last year. Federal prosecutors became involved in April, charging Nichols with participating in a medical marijuana organization in Helena accused of illegally growing and distributing more than $1.7million in pot. The co-founders of that operation, Montana Cannabis, are either facing federal drug charges or have made plea deals. Mountain men: Don Nichols, right, stands with his son, Dan Nichols, left, as they pleaded not guilty in court in Virginia City, Montana in 1984. Standing with them is attorney, Steve Ungar . It was not immediately clear where Nichols had been living the past few months. He is scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Wednesday, and the U.S. Marshals Service is expected to take custody of him then. In 1984, Nichols and his father, Don Nichols, kidnapped biathlete Kari Swenson. Don Nichols planned to make the then 22-year-old Swenson his son's wife. The father-son duo made international headlines three decades ago when they abducted Swenson, a world-class biathlete, while she was on a training run in the mountains above the resort town of Big Sky. They forced her into the woods and kept her chained to a tree most of the time when would-be rescuers stumbled upon the camp. In the melee, Dan Nichols accidentally shot Swenson. An armed standoff ensued, and the elder Nichols gunned down a would-be rescuer. The two then eluded police for five months. Notorious: In 1984 Don Nichols kidnapped 22-year-old athlete Kari Swenson while she was on a run in the mountains in Yellowstone National Park - he kept her tied to a tree and killed her would-be rescuer . The pair, who had lived for long stretches in the mountains by poaching game and eating from makeshift gardens, evaded a prolonged manhunt by living in the remote wilderness northwest of Yellowstone National Park. Their habits prompted authorities to label them with a 'mountain man' moniker they embraced. Dan Nichols was paroled in 1991. His father was denied parole for his 85-year-sentence in a high-profile hearing last month. The hearing included emotional testimony from kidnapping victim Kari Swenson, her husband and her father, plus testimony from former and current law enforcement officials. Since her harrowing ordeal, Swenson went on to compete at a high level, despite diminished lung capacity from the gunshot wound.

DeJarnette was taken into custody on Monday evening after being arrested at his home on Hawaii's Big Island in connection with his wife Yu's death, the Los Angeles Times reports. The former detective said, at the time of his wife's death in 2006, that he had woken and found her lying on a lava embankment about 20 feet from the couple's home. She had suffered a severe head injury and was pronounced dead at hospital. DeJarnette was booked at the time for investigation of murder but was later released due to a of lack of evidence. The arrest comes after the authorities reopened the case in January. DeJarnette joined the LAPD in 1982, the Los Angeles Times reported, working as a homicide detective and investigating rape cases. After retiring from the police force in 2003, he moved to Hawaii's Big Island.

Thousands of cushions handmade as gifts for Olympics athletes may go to waste after London 2012 organisers told volunteers they can’t hand them out. The London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) initially told volunteers from the Woolsack project that they could present the 5,000 cushions they had created as souvenirs for the stars. But now, in apparent fear of angering commercial sponsors, they have reneged on the deal. Support: Team GB's heptathlete Jessica Ennis has championed the cushions, but will not be able to receive one due to red tape . Dedicated families and elderly and disabled members of the scheme have worked since early last year to create the individually crafted presents. But plans for a stand in the Olympic  Village to distribute the cushions  were quashed because the space was needed for sponsors. They were then told in February there would be no direct access to give athletes the items or delegates of National Olympic Committees who had also voiced an interest in receiving a gift. Project leader Jane Cooper, 53, said many people would be left outraged if their creations never reached the athletes they were designed for. She said: 'It shouldn’t have been reduced to this. It means so much to the people who make the cushions. Families, elderly and disabled members of the Woolsack volunteer scheme have spent months making the Olympic-themed cushions for athletes . 'The elderly, disabled . and people in care homes are among them. They feel this is their link . with the Olympics even if some are not able to get to London themselves. 'A . mum with three children in Wales said there was no way she could afford . to take her family to the games but that creating a cushion each would . be their contribution. 'Changes to distribution plans that . have been imposed on us by LOCOG are very frustrating, and have caused . us great difficulties in our planning. 'The . decisions that have been made haven’t made sense at all and I’m still . perplexed about the needs of commercial sponsors being repeatedly . raised.' Lisa Dobriskey, left, 1,500m athlete said she thought the cushions were 'really . original' and compared far more favourably to the Beijing Olympics' keyring, and Marilyn Okoro, right, 800m and 400m relay also supports them . Grateful: Katie Summerhayes (freestyle skiing), Scott Dixon, right, (cross country skiing) and Calum Irvine, left (biathlon) are lucky ones to already have received their cushions . She continued: . 'I’m saddened that so much that is great, exciting and wonderful about . the 2012 Games has been reduced to a stream of increasingly restrictive . emails.' The bouncy . cushions were initially coined as perfect gifts as they would not take . up considerable room in athletes’ cases packing after the games and . weigh just 300 grams. It was hoped the personal gift would be given to as many Olympic and Paralympic athletes as possible. But after losing the stand in June . last year, when 4,000 had already been made, the group feel efforts to . distribute them were discarded completely. Martyn Rooney, left, 400m rowing and Tom Parsons, right, high jump, were also fans of the unique gifts . The project was then presented to . AthCom, the Cultural Olympiad Board which represents athletes at the . games, spearheaded by former British Olympian triple jumper Jonathan . Edwards. He presented . Woolsack to the delegates of all the National Olympic Committees and . National Paralympic Committees of which a third were very interested or . wanted their athletes to have cushions. Plans to distribute them were then scrapped in October and to the athletes completely in February this year. Jane . said: 'I don’t exactly know why the Woolsack project has been placed in . such a difficult situation. The means to deliver the gifts steadily . eroded . Dedication: Volunteer Janet Ellison from Kempston, Bedford helped hand make thousands of cushions as gifts for Olympics athletes . 'Over the winter we focused on trying to use the regional training camps as the most appropriate way to get cushions to the athletes who wanted one. 'Despite the efforts our co-ordinator was making, the rules about giving gifts to athletes became more and more restrictive. 'It . took until January for LOCOG to confirm that there would then be no . arrangements for access or contact to distribute the cushions to . athletes. 'It has been frustrating to have one after another agreed plan brought to an end by or through LOCOG. 'We know how much the athletes love the cushions and want to have them, we will persevere and find ways meet their requests.' Volunteers Janet Ellison, right, and Heather Webb, left, fear thousands of cushions handmade as gifts for Olympics athletes may go to waste . The London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) has now said the space to hand out the cushions in the Olympic park has been allocated to commercial sponsors . LOCOG officially cited logistical reasons for deciding to not to continue with the project. A London 2012 spokesperson said: 'The Inspire mark was granted to over 2,700 projects across the UK to enable the projects an official association with the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 'This gives those projects the opportunity to profile themselves as part of the Games. 'In this case the London 2012 Athletes Committee was presented with a number of options of gifts that can be officially distributed to athletes at the Games and decided not to proceed with offering the cushions to all athletes for a number of logistical reasons. 'We think the Woolsack cushions are great and are happy that they are available to athletes from around the world on request.'","Volunteers have spent months knitting and sewing Olympic-themed cushions as gifts for athletes .

Rebels in Mali besieged the ancient city of Timbuktu today – the last major government holdout in the country. The separatist Tuareg rebels entered the city yesterday after a rapid advance across the country, in an increasingly bloody fight to secure a homeland. Residents of Timbuktu said they heard gunfire and explosions as fighters approached. They have been largely left to fend for themselves as troops from the government fled. Power struggle: Malian junta soldiers patrol a road in Kati, outside Mali's capital Bamako, today, and as rebels encircled the ancient trading post of Timbuktu . The Tuaregs are a nomadic Islamic people who want to establish a separate state. Many of them are heavily armed, with weapons they have retained from fighting in Libya’s civil war last year. Tuaregs are taking advantage of the chaos surrounding last week’s coup in Mali, west Africa, in which middle-ranking officers in Mali’s army ousted the president Amadou Toure. Tuaregs have already seized other big cities in the north. If Timbuktu now falls, they will control most of Mali’s Sahara desert region. The ancient city of Timbuktu (pictured) was besieged today by Tuareg rebels . Residents fleeing their advance said rebels had demanded all pictures of unveiled women be removed from public view. Timbuktu, a former famous trading centre, and famous for being an Islamic scholar centre and much of the city is on the World Heritage List. Nowadays though Timbuktu, which has a population of over 50,000, has fallen on hard times and is greatly impoverished. The attack came a day after the rebels - a loose alliance of separatist nomad Tuaregs and local Islamists - seized the town of Kidal which, along with Gao and the historic trading city of Timbuktu, is one of three main regional centres of Mali's north. Coup: Malian junta soldiers stand guard at their headquarters in Kati, outside Mali's capital Bamako today . 'I saw them (the rebels) entering the town itself and putting up their Azawad flags,' a Reuters reporter said, referring to the desert territory which is bigger than France that the rebels want to make their homeland. 'You can hear heavy weapons fire across the town,' the reporter added, saying the rebels had set up base in a captured fire station on its outskirts, which later came under attack from army helicopters and heavy weapons. Some rebel units were shouting 'God is Great' in Arabic, he said, suggesting they were linked to Islamist groups who do not have separatist goals but instead want to impose shariah law on the mostly Muslim country. Coup: Renegade Malian soldiers appearing on state television on Thursday to declare they had seized power in protest at the government's failure to quell a nomad-led rebellion in the north . The unrest in Africa's third largest gold-producer has been fuelled by weapons brought out of Libya during last year's conflict, and risks creating a vast new lawless zone in the Saharan desert that Islamist and criminal groups could exploit. Mid-ranking officers behind last week's coup accused the government of giving them inadequate resources to fight the rebels. But the coup has turned into a spectacular own-goal, emboldening the rebels to take further ground. Advances by the Tuareg-led rebels, who have joined forces with Islamist allies, are likely to increase Western concerns about growing insecurity in West Africa. 'If you have a successful Islamist revolt in northern Mali, people will sit up and take notice,' John Campbell, the Ralph Bunche Senior Fellow for Africa Policy Studies at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, said this week. Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure, whose decade-long rule was associated with stability and rising frustration with a political elite accused of turning a blind eye to widespread corruption, has said he is safe in an undisclosed location in Mali.","Residents of the ancient city hear gunfire and explosions as fighters approach .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:30 EST, 26 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:32 EST, 26 March 2012 . Along the wide-open expanses and rolling prairie of western North Dakota surrounding the state's booming oil patch, all sorts of bizarre litter can be found clogging the once picturesque roadside: Derelict hardhats, single boots, buckets, pallets, pieces of machinery, shredded semi tires, oily clothing, cigarette butts. The worst? Plastic jugs of urine pitched out windows as scores of truckers pass through oil country. Litter has become an escalating problem as the rush to tap vast caches of crude escalates in North Dakota. Growing problem: North Dakota has increasing numbers of trucks passing through thanks to an oil boom, but with that comes more trash. The most worrying is the bottles of discarded urine drivers throw out, as seen here . As the number of trucks coming to the oil mecca increases, so does the trash. Some of the industrial rubbish blows in from unsecured truckloads, but for many, the most frustrating trash is the gallons of discarded urine. The problem has local leaders and rural residents scratching their heads. There's no money to build new rest stops, and once-eager community volunteers are less willing to pick up junk now because they don't want to handle human waste. So little has been done to address the problem, save for upgrading mowing tractors with cabs to protect operators from getting sprayed with urine when the jugs are hit by a wheel or blade. 'I don't know if it can be solved other than by people having some respect because right now the countryside is being taken for granted,' said Tioga Mayor Nathan Germundson. 'It's a growing problem and it's sad.' The jugs are known around these parts as 'trucker bombs,' and they freckle the countryside. They show up in a variety of containers: antifreeze jugs, beverage bottles or milk cartons, and are usually hurled by drivers too hurried or weak-bladdered to stop and relieve themselves politely. There are only three rest stops along one long patch of road, and drivers are relieving themselves in a variety of containers: antifreeze jugs, beverage bottles or milk cartons, and then hurling the 'trucker bombs' out their windows . Of course, there's a reason they're thrown in the first place. There are only three rest stops along the hundreds of miles of highway in western North Dakota, and all are well outside the busiest areas of the state's oil patch. Until there are more truck stops or rest areas on the much-traveled route, the jugs will probably still be tossed by truckers, said Tom Balzer, executive vice president of the North Dakota Motor Carriers Association. 'It is a huge issue, but one of the biggest problems is there isn't lot of places for these guys stop to properly dispose of the receptacles,' Balzer said. 'I don't know that it's a case of being disrespectful but of the unbelievable growth out there.' The oil rush has brought the promise of prosperity to the state but it also has radically altered its landscape and culture. Nodding donkey pumps now rise from the once barren prairie, and there's been an influx of thousands of outsiders seeking their fortune in the oil patch. North Dakota has leapfrogged past a half-dozen states since 2006 to become the nation's No. 3 oil producer, and state officials estimate North Dakota will surpass Alaska and will trail only Texas within a year. That's the reason truck traffic has surged. The number of trucking companies operating in North Dakota increased by 600 last year to about 6,000, with most working in the oil patch, Balzer said. Nearly 100 new trucking companies were established in January alone, he said. Catching urine-tossing truckers is difficult, according to authorities. Troopers issued an average of a dozen littering tickets annually in western North Dakota over the past three years, up from about seven in the three years before that. Trucking has boomed to keep up with the oil growth and 100 new trucking companies were formed in January alone. But the increasing numbers of urine jugs are being partially to blame for the decrease in Adopt-A- Highway participants . 'We have to be in the right place at the right time,' North Dakota Highway Patrol Lt. Jody Skogen said. 'When a squad car is behind a driver, they are not as inclined to chuck something out the window.' Even if they do catch someone in the act, the penalties aren't high. The Transportation Department unsuccessfully pushed legislation more than a decade ago that would have bumped fines from $20 to $500 on anyone caught dumping human waste on the roadside. The agency intended to post roadside signs saying it was illegal to throw human waste on the road or ditch, and advertise the $500 fine. But lawmakers decided the signs would be off-putting and killed the legislation. Tioga citizens, fed up by littered roadways leading to their town, cleaned up part of the highway south of the city last spring. In less than one mile, volunteers picked up more than two heaping truckloads of rubbish. But such efforts are tough to sustain. Membership in the state's Adopt-a-Highway program has dropped in the area, and the jugs of urine may be partly to blame, said Walt Peterson, a Transportation Department district engineer in Williston. Even though state officials recommend that volunteers stay clear of the jugs and leave them to state maintenance crews to clean up, volunteering is a tough sell. For one, the jugs are repulsive. Two, they can explode under pressure from heat. 'The membership is down and they're older,' Peterson said. 'They don't want to pick up that much stuff and there is too much dangerous stuff like needles and urine jugs.' Peterson said his agency and local officials formed a group last month to address the litter issue in and around the city. Part of the plan calls for companies working in the oil patch to pay student groups to pick up the trash. So far, no one has signed on. But at least two companies have volunteered to pick up garbage along stretches of highways in Dickinson and Watford City, said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council. Gary Evans, treasurer of the local Lions Club in Stanley, said his group has been picking up trash along roadsides for more than 20 years. He said the club has about 15 active trash pickers and all are retirement age. Evans said he has picked up his share of urine jugs over the years and the amount has increased. Volunteers wear gloves and carefully handle the urine containers. Evans says he's fortunate never to have been showered with an exploding jug of urine. 'The ditches are full of them,' he said. 'It's pathetic.'","Trucking has boomed in recent years thanks to oil production .

A TV comedy sketch which shows a blind man groping a nude female model in front of duped students during a life-drawing class has been withdrawn after complaints from the college. Disgusted students, many of them elderly, were so shocked they called the police thinking the woman was being molested. The stunt was due to be shown as part of Channel 4's show I'm Spazticus in which disabled actors play pranks on the public. Controversial: A different sketch from Channel 4 comedy show I'm Spazticus, which shocked unsuspecting art students with a prank where a blind man groped their female life-drawing model . 'Duped': Officials at Southend Adult Community College (above) said they took part in the show in good faith believing it was aimed at challenging attitudes towards disability . But the amateur artists at Southend Adult Community College, in Essex, who had paid £300 for the course, failed to see the funny side of last month's prank. One of those taking part in the lesson said: 'They taped up all the windows and set up secret cameras before the people arrived. 'They then filmed these people in their class without their knowledge or consent to see their reaction. 'People got up and walked out in disgust, shouting at staff members as they left.' Another student complained: 'A lot of the people who take these lessons are elderly and were absolutely disgusted by what they saw.' Essex Police said officers had 'offered words of advice to the person', but said no offence had been committed because both were in on the joke. Linda Nash, a spokeswoman for the college, said they had agreed 'in good faith' to take part in the project. The comedy, which features disabled actors in mockumentary stunts, first aired as in 2005. A new series has been commissioned by channel four to coincide with the 2012 Paralympic games . Praise: The sketch show has previously won awards at the International Disability Film Festival . She added: 'We were shocked and surprised to discover the filming that took place within the class did not reflect the brief supplied by Zeitgeist Productions. 'We now feel, along with other students, that Zeitgeist Productions had no genuine intention of challenging people's perceptions on disability.' The college said it didn’t know the name of the model who agreed to take part in the stunt. The ‘artist’ was a man in his 30s who gave his name as Tim. 2012: Channel 4 commissioned a five-part series of the show to coincide with coverage of the London Paralympic Games . Marketing manager Lisa Pearce said: ‘We were told that the show had a working title of 'Dystopia' and would be played during the Paralympics. ‘It was meant to be a light-hearted show with an all-disabled cast and a script by disabled writers, exploring people’s attitudes and perceptions towards disabilities. 'They said it would not be harmful or cruel in any way and they wanted hidden cameras so that there would be genuine and unbiased reactions. 'The man, who was genuinely blind and came with a guide dog, was meant to feel the model and draw her. At no point did we think his actions would be crude. 'Given our ethos of being a fully inclusive organisation, we thought this was a really good piece of work the college could be involved in. 'We just haven’t been able to apologise to the students enough - although we feel like victims, just as they do.’ She said following the incident last month they had contacted both the producers, Zeitgeist Television, and Channel 4 to prevent it being shown on air. Channel 4 spokesman Nick Caley told The Daily Telegraph: 'During the filming of a prank involving a blind man and an actress playing a life model, who were both in on the joke, some of the art students didn't see the funny side. 'So, as a gesture of goodwill, we won't be broadcasting the footage.' The sketch show, which is written by and stars disabled actors, has previously won awards at the International Disability Film Festival.

Error: Radio presenter Rachel Burden made a joke about crime in Salford but it is safer than their former HQ in London . The BBC’s new home in Salford is safer than its former HQ in London -  suggesting that sensitive management and staff could be unnecessarily worried about security around their northern office. Bosses have offered workers personal guards to take them to their cars and tram stops but overall crime and violent crime at Media City are both lower than surrounding BBC Television Centre in Shepherd's Bush, Government figures show. A row about security at the BBC's new base erupted on Thursday after Five Live presenter Rachel Burden made an on-air gaffe accusing the corporation’s neighbours in Salford of being light-fingered. She was interviewing British Olympic cycling champion Laura Trott on the station’s breakfast show. When Ms Trott joked about leaving her medals behind in her car, Ms Burden, 35, shot back: 'You left then in you car? Around here?' This came as a leaked memo sent by Rhian Roberts, head of development for Five Live and Sports Extra, also warned that that the area is a 'different kettle of fish' to the BBC’s base in West London.. But comparing the two postcodes - M50 2LH and W12 7RJ - for the period April 2010 to March 2011 the Salford site had 17,746 crimes while the London site had 18,756. And the figures for violent crimes were 4,133 and 4,891 respectively, again in favour of Media City. Fears: The BBC's £200m Media City development in Salford, above. Staff were told that it was a 'different kettle of fish' from Television Centre in West London, below, but officials figures show overall crime is lower in their new northern home . Salford residents and BBC workers said today they feel very safe. Mark Graham, 32, who lives near to the site, said: 'I feel as safe living here as anywhere else. Comments like hers (Rachel Burden's) just create the wrong impression.' Mike Richards, 41, an engineer on BBC Breakfast, who lives in London, said: 'No one has mentioned security concerns to me. It’s definitely safer than White City.' The BBC’s move to Media City in Salford Quays – where about 1,600 staff are now based, has been riddled with gaffes and controversy, with many presenters refusing to move. BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins both refused to make the change and have since been replaced. Joke: Laura Trott, centre, with her gold medal following at the Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, Australia, but a BBC presenter suggested she shouldn't have left it in her car in Salford . Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson blasted the BBC’s move last year, describing Salford as ‘a small suburb with a Starbucks and a canal with ducks on it’ and said that he would resign if the motoring programme was moved north. Miss Burden, a mother-of-three, last year said she was ‘excited’ by the prospect of a move to the North and a new base in Salford. But she revealed she and her partner would not be selling their four-bedroom London home in Ealing, valued at £650,000. ‘London prices are likely to rise faster than other parts of the country so we want to hold on to it and let it out,’ she said. Despite the fears of management and staff their view of crime in Manchester appear to be wrong. At Media City site in Salford, above, its postcode area had 17,746 overall crimes last year and  4,133 violent crimes. This is better that the postcode for their old site at Television centre in White City, below, which had 18,756 total crimes and 4,891 violent crimes. The crime rate has also dropped in Salford . in recent years but remains slightly above the national average for . violent crime and robbery. She added that she was looking forward to settling in an upmarket Cheshire village with good schools and an easy commute to Salford. She said: ‘I was surprised prices in Cheshire aren’t much cheaper for a similar-sized house to our home, although the gardens are larger. It may not be easy to find a home that ticks every box so we are likely to rent first.’ Explaining her comments on Thursday a spokesman for BBC North said: 'During a light-hearted moment at the end of the interview with Laura Trott, an off-the-cuff remark was made. No offence was intended and we’re sorry if anyone was upset.' Burden's remarks follow reports that a number of staff have been warned over their safety following the move to Salford. Corporation chiefs have offered personal security guards to escort men and women to their cars and tram stops from the studios. And an extraordinary email intended to reassure staff about on-site security will serve only to increase fears, with a BBC executive admitting she has been looking at site security ‘following a couple of incidents’. In a move costing an estimated . £1.5billion, the BBC has relocated 2,500 staff across five departments . including Sport, Children’s and Radio Five Live to the Media City site. BBC Breakfast made its Salford debut . on Tuesday, while Blue Peter and Match of the Day are among the . programmes which air from the futuristic complex. The offer of personal security applies . particularly for those working late at night or early in the morning. In the leaked email intended to reassure staff about on-site safety, Rhian . Roberts, head of development for Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra, said . the measures had been tightened after incidents affecting staff. ‘I’ve been looking at on-site security . on 5 Live’s behalf following a couple of incidents – and also the . reality that Media City is a different kettle of fish to W12.’ The BBC’s buildings at White City have . private car parks manned by security and which require a pass to enter, . while the Tube station is yards away. Concerned: Rhian Roberts, left, head of development for BBC Radio 5 live and Sports Extra, said Salford was a 'different kettle of fish' to west London and there has been an offer of personal security for those working late . By contrast, the Salford Quays area . has open access as a number of businesses operate in the area and is . relatively deserted after normal working hours. The site is patrolled by . security guards on foot and on Segway electric two-wheeled vehicles. In the same email, Tony Chebrika, the . head of security for Peel Media Group – which owns and polices the site – . said he could ‘arrange for escorts’ for frightened staff.

The structures at the Richborough Power Station, near Sandwich, Kent, were brought crashing to the ground in just 21 seconds. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Demolition: The final cooling tower, which has stood for more than 50 years, then falls, all shown in a sensational video . Its 318ft (97m) cooling towers where reduced to rubble before the single 416ft (127m) chimney stack crumbled to the floor at 9am yesterday morning. Thousands of onlookers gathered to watch the series of thundering explosions. Among those to witness the destruction . of this local landmark was 83-year-old John Jones who helped build the . largest chimney between 1960 and 1961. Bang: The first of the cooling Towers is shown tumbling downwards as part of the controlled demolition . Dramatic: The second of the three cooling towers is seen falling by thousands of spectators . The great-grandfather said: 'It was . the hardest construction job I had ever been on. We worked seven days a . week mostly, putting in ten hour days and sometimes more, for a year.' The demolition was carried out by Holly Benett, who is believed to be the only female explosives engineer in the UK. Some locals had campaigned to keep the towers saying they formed part of the historical landscape and were used as a navigation point by fishermen. But the iconic buildings that had dominated the Kent skyline for more than 50 years where brought down to make way for a green energy park.

Fat fighters: Plymouth is having to open a third obesity clinic to deal with the waiting list backlog as so many people are morbidly overweight . A British city has been forced to expand its obesity provision because its specialist clinics can't cope with ever-growing waiting lists. Some residents in Plymouth, Devon, have waited as long as ten months to be seen at one of its two current NHS centres. One in four adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30, while around 4,000 are in the morbidly overweight category, according to government figures. The NHS weight management programme in Devonport has a waiting list of 198 people, 64 of whom have waited over the target 18 weeks - the longest for 44 weeks. The programme treats morbidly obese adults. The category covers patients with a body mass index (BMI) above 40, putting them at high risk of suffering serious health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. It has been estimated there are about 4,000 morbidly obese people in Plymouth. Health bosses said the number of clinics will be increased from two to three in April, with a view to dealing with the backlog by July and funding has been agreed for extra staff and training. Sarah Hind, who leads the weight management programme, said: 'The aim is to help people make small changes to their lifestyles over the two-year course which can all add up to becoming more active, eating and enjoying food in a balanced way and very often feeling much more positive.' Health hazard: Around 4,000 people in the coastal city are morbidly obese . She added: 'Losing weight and changing old habits is hard work but the little things can really help. 'This is not a quick fix it is about making changes for life. But when participants do commit the results can be amazing.' The weight-management programme in Plymouth was launched in 2006. There has always been high demand for the service. In 2009, the waiting list was suspended as it reached 332 people. The programme concentrates on diet, exercise and psychology.Patients are referred by their GP. Kicking old habits: The NHS weight-management programme was launched in 2006 and aims to help patients make changes to their lifestyles over a two-year period (file picture) Each programme has around 15 participants and is split into three phases. The first lasts for 10 weeks and looks at how to be active, meal planning and portion sizes, understanding habits and how to make changes. Phase two, which is fortnightly for two months, supports people to look at barriers to change and help them to continue healthier habits. The third and final phase continues over the following year. It aims to help people stay on track with sessions every month for the first six months and then every two months after that. It is predicted that by 2025, nearly half of men and over a third of women nationally will be obese. Plymouth Community Healthcare is the social enterprise which took over the running of community health services from NHS Plymouth in October. Anyone worried about weight affecting their health should contact their GP for advice.","NHS to open third clinic to tackle growing waiting lists .

Wales, will tomorrow hear an appeal against his sentence which could win his immediate release if . successful. Shame: Liam Stacey is led away in handcuffs outside Swansea Magistrates Court . The Swansea University biology student triggered revulsion after the . Premier League star’s collapse when he posted: 'LOL (laugh out loud). F*** Muamba. He’s dead!!!' His reviled tweet came at a time when the Bolton midfielder's plight was attracting a . wave of sympathy around the world. Football fans watched in horror as Muamba, 23, collapsed after suffering a heart attack during an FA Cup match on March 17. Millions witnessed the incident at White Hart Lane as Bolton's clash with home team Tottenham Hotspur was screened live on television. Stacey, seen arriving at the court earlier in the morning, posted a series of vile tweets about footballer Fabrice Muamba . But after a drunken Stacey received a deluge critical replies to his distasteful tweet, he responded with a torrent of racist abuse on the website. Support for Stacey’s jail sentence was widespread on the day it was handed down, and widely debated on Twitter. But a significant minority criticised his punishment and claimed it was politically motivated to make an example of him. His legal team will tomorrow launch an appeal against his sentence at Swansea Crown Court. The hearing, which is expected to last at least one hour, will go before High Court judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams. The messages were forwarded to the police by several members of the social network, including former England striker Stan Collymore, himself a victim of abuse on Twitter. Stacey initially claimed his account . had been accessed by somebody else, but later pleaded guilty to racially . aggravated harassment, and was sent to prison to ‘reflect the public . outrage’ at his comments. As he spent his first night . behind bars, the two teams replayed the . fixture that was called off when the midfielder came close to . death. Tottenham and Bolton met again at White Hart Lane, with the home team cruising to a 3-1 victory. It means Muamba's club are now out of the FA Cup, but this hardly seemed to matter to the fans and players treating the match as a chance to pay tribute to him. Team-mate Sam Ricketts was seen to wipe a tear from . his eye before kick-off. It was a difficult return for the entire Bolton . squad, and manager Owen Coyle commended them for their bravery. Players from both sides wore T-shirts . bearing messages of thanks to those who supported Muamba, while the . whole of the Tottenham stadium erupted in applause for him. Stacey, meanwhile, faces expulsion from . Swansea University. The third-year biology student had hoped to become a . forensic scientist. Describing his tweets, prosecutor Louise Barron . told the court: ‘The offence is clearly racially aggravated. ‘There was sustained and gratuitous . racism. These were unprovoked comments and persistent abuse. The . recipients were disgusted.’ Jailing the student at Swansea . Magistrates’ Court, District Judge John Charles said: ‘Not just the . footballer’s family, not just the footballing world, but the whole world . were literally praying for Muamba’s life. Your comments aggravated this . situation. ‘I have no choice but to impose an immediate custodial sentence to reflect the public outrage at what you have done.’ Applause: Everybody clapped for Muamba at the start of the match (and below) Stacey made his comments about the . Bolton midfielder while celebrating the Welsh . rugby team’s Six Nations grand slam victory earlier this month. The judge added: ‘You committed this . offence while you were drunk and it is clear you immediately regretted . it. 'But you must learn how to handle your alcohol better.’ Stacey, from Pontypridd, South Wales, . told police following his arrest at his student home in Swansea: ‘I was . at the bar when I heard what had happened to Muamba. 'I don’t know why I . posted [the comments]. I’m not racist and some of my friends are from . different cultural backgrounds.’ He later sent a text message to a . friend saying: ‘I said something about Muamba that I shouldn’t have and . tweeted back to some people who abused me. 'Getting police on me now . which isn’t good at all.’ Solidarity: Bolton's Nigel Reo-Coker (left) and Tottenham's Jermain Defoe shake hands . Another read: ‘Been bawling my eyes out on the phone to my mother for the last hour, really can’t be dealing with this.’ Gareth Jones, defending, said Stacey . ‘does not bear [Muamba] any grudge and is glad he is making a good . recovery’. He continued: ‘My client simply lost his head and posted . these disgusting comments to the bitter shame of himself and his . parents. 'For a moment of madness, his career has now gone.’ Upsetting: Fabrice Muamba is treated by medical staff after collapsing. Liam Stacey, 21, posted mocking tweets as the midfielder was treated on the pitch . Stacey’s . father Neale, 49, and mother Hayley, 46, were visibly shocked when the . details of his comments were read aloud yesterday. Jim . Brisbane, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Cymru-Wales, said: ‘Racist . language is inappropriate in any setting and through any media.

Controversial: B&Q has been heavily criticised by conservationists for increasing the amount of peat in its new topsoil . Peat bogs play a major role in protecting threatened wetland habitats around the world. They take millions of years to develop and are home to rare species of plants and animals. B&Q is the largest retailer in the UK of topsoil and sells about £5million worth of it every year. Rob Shore, head of wetland conservation at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said: 'This is a disappointing move by B&Q. Not happy: Rob Shore, head of wetland conservation at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, said it was a disappointing move by B&Q . 'It is not the actions you would expect from a market leader. They do drive the industry forward and should be taking a lead on issues like this. 'They are not being as aspirational as they could be.' When peat bogs are drained for human use, the vast amounts of carbon which is stored by them is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, the harmful greenhouse gas. Although some peat bogs are protected, others continue to be drained which releases up to a million tons of carbon dioxide every year. Plans are underway by the government to phase out the use of peat in gardens by 2020. Speaking to The Independent, the DIY chain said: 'Our topsoil does contain a percentage of peat and we are completely transparent about that on the packaging.' Its new topsoil is lighter than alternatives which are peat-free and is easier to transport.","Verve topsoil contains two-fifths of peat matter .

As the country plunges into the depths of a record youth unemployment crisis - with one in four youngsters now out of work - you might expect any jobs would be snapped up within hours. But a landlady has condemned Britain’s ‘stay-in-bed’ generation of youngsters after spending six months fruitlessly searching for trainee chef. Despite one in six 16 to 24-year-olds currently being part of the unenviable NEET tribe - short for not in education, employment or training - Janette Harrop, 53, has been unable to fill the pub's vacancies. Worth ethic: Publicans Janette and Tom Harrop are struggling to get many people even to turn up for an interview for a job in their kitchen . She has set up five interviews every week on average, but said only half of applicants have turned up. And those offered a job, which pays the minimum wage, have failed to show up for work. Now Janette and husband Tom, 55, who . run the Old Original pub in Scouthead, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, . have criticised the culture of ‘spoiling’ youngsters with pocket money . instead of instilling a basic work ethic in them. It comes 24 hours after deputy Prime . Minister Nick Clegg launched the £1billion ‘youth contract’ scheme in a bid to . create jobs for youngsters after figures revealed more than a million . 16 to 24-year-olds are without a job, more than at any time since . records began in 1992. Mrs Harrop said: ‘Our pub is a . fantastic place to work - it’s a young hard working team and another . youngster would fit in and enjoy working here. ‘But we are struggling to find that . person to become an apprentice because of lack of reliability. I have to . say it’s not an easy job and it’s not a doddle but it’s one you can get . a lot out of and hopefully have a whole career in. ‘We’ve had about 30 people apply but . barely half of those turn up for interviews. It just wastes my time as . well waiting for them. Help needed: Tom Harrop says when the job in the pub's kitchen was offered to an applicant, they turned up late or not at all . ‘After a bit you’re a bit cynical and . just think they won’t turn up, so I wait 20 minutes and then I won’t . wait any longer because I’m too busy. ‘Most of them just don’t turn up, . they’re full of enthusiasm over the phone and then they don’t bother. Some of them you ask for a trial and they might start off okay but then . they just let you down. ‘People come to work here then realise . the shifts are unsociable hours. That’s when they realise their friends . are out doing other things whilst they are working. It doesn’t help and . they let us down. ‘All we want to do is give someone a chance but it’s just finding that person.’ The post as a trainee chef would involve the chance to train on a . local college course so the person would be a fully qualified chef at . the end. The position includes food . preparation, cooking, cleaning, learning to keep the books and at the . beginning is a 30 hour week, with most mornings starting at rather leisurely 10am. Mr and Mrs Harrop expected hoards of . eager youngsters wanting to snap up the trainee chef job and advertised . in local shops, the job centre, the pub itself and local colleges, last . October. But despite youth unemployment being . at an all-time high the couple had just 30 people apply for the position . - with only half bothering to turn up for the interview. No takers: Despite lots of advertising, pub landlords Tom and Janette Harrop have been unable to recruit any pot washers, bar staff or a kitchen apprentice . One hopeful blamed his lack of bus . fare for not being able to come while others just never even called. When the applicants were invited for trial weeks they would often just . stop coming without warning. Janette thinks a lack of commitment to . hard work and more of a focus on their social life has led to the . record numbers of young people who are out of work across the country. Mrs Harrop added: ‘Since we first . advertised the job in schools, colleges and the job centre, we’ve had an . average of about five interviews set up every week. I’m lucky if two of . the applicants turn up. ‘The people who have taken the job have been unreliable, claiming they’ve got no bus fare and making excuses week after week. ‘Some youngsters are only too keen to . stay in bed on a work day because they have been enjoying themselves the . night before and we’ve allowed them to get away with it. ‘I think we spoil our children now. In our day we had to do paper rounds or milk rounds, you got yourself prepared for work. Condemnation: Publicans Janette and Tom Harrop who run The Old Original pub in Scouthead, Oldham, blame a something for nothing culture for their difficulties recruiting kitchen staff . ‘But whilst the world’s changed due to safety worries, it does make work suddenly come as a bit of a shock. ‘I think a lot of youngsters go out at . night and can’t be bothered in the morning. But it’s not that early, . it’s a 10am start for us - a lot of jobs are a 7am or 8 am start. ‘It is unsociable hours and we are out of the way and it is a big commitment but it’s a job. ‘I know they want to do both, going . out and working, but they just can’t when it comes to the next day and . getting up, they’re not fit for work. ‘We want them by the end to be a fully . qualified chef. It’s like any job the money isn’t fantastic at the . start but you work your way up, it’s a career. ‘We’re looking to employ someone who . we can send to college. They’d be doing NVQ certificates to do the job . professionally and long term. We’re offering someone the chance of . further education.’ Minimum wages for apprentices start at . £2.60 an hour between the aged of 16 and 19 or £3.68 hourly pay for . employees aged between 16 and 17 and £4.98 for 18 to 20 year olds.

His car was parked where he left it, there was no new activity on his credit card and no one had used his cell phone since it pinged off a tower near the reservoir that night. Divers had repeatedly scoured the depths of the reservoir, in between campus and the bar, since he disappeared. Authorities also used sonar to search the reservoir, but found no sign of Mr Garcia there until a man walking his dog reported seeing a body in the water Wednesday. Authorities said the body was found in an area of heavy weeds, which had limited visibility during their searches.

Police also found the student's wallet in his pocket and recovered his eyeglasses, according to his family, though the district attorney said he couldn't confirm for certain that the body was Mr Garcia's until authorities performed an autopsy. Mr Garcia's parents said police told them they will investigate whether their son died in an accident or if foul play was a factor.

Inside the bar, he also met up with friends from high school. At closing time, his college friends couldn't find him. A close friend of Mr Garcia's previously told the AP that Garcia was drunk 'but not smashed' that night. There is no fence around the reservoir where authorities found the body. Police got involved a day later, when his parents returned in a panic from a vacation to New York City after not being able to reach him. Mr Garcia lived at home with his parents, who emigrated more than two decades ago from Lima, Peru.

A suspect wanted over a £2million heist had been held in custody – but was released on bail after confusion between police and prosecutors, it has emerged. Lee Wildman, 35, was arrested and questioned by detectives investigating the theft of precious artefacts from a museum on Thursday, last week.

A Durham Police spokesman said that they were under pressure because  'we are governed by legislation as to how long we can hold . people without charge', adding: 'at the time we were both working . exceptionally hard to secure justice in challenging, fast moving . conditions.' Detective Superintendent Adrian Green told the Mirror: ‘He has been arrested, he has been . interviewed, he has been bailed and now we wish to interview him again.' ‘We will be making inquiries to tract . him and re-arrest him. The evidence was felt by some not to be strong . enough to charge,’ he said, adding that the decision whether to charge . was no longer down to police. However, the CPS said when it believed . enough evidence has been secured it gave the green light to bring . charges. But at some stage Mr Wildman was released. The CPS told the Mirror: ‘This was a . fast moving matter with finely balanced decisions taken within strict . legal custody time limits.’ Mr Wildman was one of five people . from the West Midlands who were arrested and bailed pending further . inquiries, following the night raid at Durham University's Oriental Museum. The raiders made straight for an 18th century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain figurine . He is currently being hunted over the . audacious heist in which a gang of thieves took just 120 seconds to steal . artefacts worth £2million from a museum – after breaking in by cutting a . hole in a brick wall. Wanted: Durham Police also released a photo of Adrian Stanton who is sought over the heist . The 'highly organised' criminals spent . 40 minutes using specialist tools to force a 2ft by 3ft gap into the . exterior of the building. But once they were inside, they needed only two minutes to snatch the valuable relics and flee. Durham Police named Lee Wildman, also . known as Jason or Lee Green, 35, and Adrian Stanton, 32, from Walsall, . West Midlands, as the two men they want to trace. Both men will be aware they are wanted by police, Det Supt Adrian Green, who is leading a 40-strong team of detectives, said. After the thieves had broken through . the brickwork, they headed straight for the Malcolm MacDonald gallery, . where they stole an 18th century jade bowl and a Dehua porcelain . figurine which were on display in separate cabinets. The bowl dates from 1769 and has a Chinese poem written inside, while the figurine, of fairies in a boat, stands at about 12in. Both are from the Qing dynasty, China's last imperial dynasty, which ended a century ago. Detective Superintendent Adrian Green said: 'It seems very clear that this was a well-planned, highly organised break-in. 'They have spent around 40 minutes . creating a hole in an outside wall and when it has been big enough, they . have entered the gallery and made straight for these two items. The figurine is of seven fairies in a boat and stands about 12in (30cm) high. Police believe the artefacts were stolen to order . Planned job: Police said they were sure it was planned for quite some time and believe the artefacts were stolen to order, 'for someone who has already identified a potential market' The gang spent 40 minutes making a hole in an outside wall at Durham University's Oriental Museum before swiping two highly valuable artefacts . 'I am sure this job has been planned . for quite some time and I would think the artefacts have been stolen to . order, for someone who has already identified a potential market.' There . are fears the Chinese artefacts may already have been spirited abroad . to be sold. Police have arrested five people in connection with the incident last Thursday, all from the West Midlands. Officers also want to question Adrian . Mark Stanton, 32, and Lee Paul Wildman, 35, who are believed to have . gone on the run. Wildman, who is from Walsall and also uses the names . Jason Green or Lee Green, was interviewed at the weekend but his present . location is unknown. Stanton's last known address was also in Walsall. Mr Green said: 'They will both be . aware of our interest and if anyone knows where they have gone, I would . ask them to contact the police or ring Crimestoppers.' Three men aged 56, 41 and 36, and a 34-year-old woman, were arrested at the weekend and released on bail. Another man, aged 27 and from Walsall, is under arrest and being interviewed at a police station in County Durham. A Durham Police spokesman said: . 'Durham Constabulary and the CPS have a very good working relationship. It’s not correct to say, as some have, that a suspect was released in . error. 'At the time we were both working . exceptionally hard to secure justice in challenging, fast moving . conditions. We are governed by legislation as to how long we can hold . people without charge. 'We will not be disclosing a detailed . sequence of events; it's neither appropriate nor productive to focus on . this one issue when we are concentrating our efforts on arresting those . we believe to be responsible for an extremely serious crime and . recovering priceless artefacts.'

Detectives are hunting a 'heavily blood stained killer' who battered a decorated war hero in his own home, police revealed . A murder inquiry was launched after the discovery of the body of William Davis, who only last week had marked his 92nd birthday. The frail widower, who served with the Royal Navy in the Second World War, was found dead at his terraced house in Willenhall, West Midlands, on Sunday evening. Initial post mortem results revealed Mr Davis died as a result of 'multiple head injuries' after being battered with a blunt instrument. Detective Superintendent Richard Baker, head of major crime at West Midlands Police, said: 'On Sunday, April 1, at approximately 6.30pm paramedics attended the home address of Mr William Davis . 'Neighbours became concerned when they couldn't raise William on Sunday evening. 'They managed to get entry into his home address where Mr Davis was discovered deceased within the premises. It was apparent that he had severe head injuries at that time. 'The scene is a heavily blood stained scene. There's an item that was found at the scene next to Mr Davis' body. It has been submitted for forensic examination. 'It's my belief that another item was used in the attack on Mr Davis. 'The type of item used could have been taken from the home address or could have been brought to the address. 'He died from multiple head injuries, some of which we believe were caused by a blunt instrument. It appears that when paramedics first arrived there was a light pulse but he died shortly afterwards.' Police confirmed there was no sign of a forced break in at Mr Davis' home and nothing was stolen.Det Supt Baker added: 'It appears to be a very violent attack. 'The motive is still unexplained but there doesn't appear to be any sign of forced entry or any sign of a search within the address. There's also no indication of anything being stolen. 'It's highly likely that the person or persons responsible for this may have left the address heavily blood stained.' Mr Davis, who worked as a locksmith after leaving the Navy and was known as Bill, lost his wife Clara in 2006, three years after they marked their diamond wedding anniversary. Step by step: Police search Hobley Street, Willenhall, West Midlands, following the suspected murder of William Davis . Officers were called to the scene at around 6.30pm on Sunday evening . The couple had a son and a daughter . as well as several grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who neighbours . said visited regularly. Paramedics were called to the house where he had lived alone early on Sunday evening but he was pronounced dead at the scene. Neighbours spoke of their shock at his death yesterday. An . employee at the local newsagent’s said Mr Davis had been going there to . buy his paper every day  for 60 years until difficulty walking meant he . couldn’t manage it any more. ‘He . would say hello to everybody in the street, he was a really kind . bloke,’ he said. ‘You would look at him and think “He’s not 90, he’s . about 70”. ‘The amount of stories he’s told me and the medals he has shown me – it was unreal. ‘What happened yesterday was a proper shock.

Jerry Sandusky, pictured at court last month, was labelled as a 'likely pedophile' in a 1998 report . More than a decade before former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky was charged with over 50 counts of child sex abuse, a psychologist warned university police that he was a 'likely pedophile' who was grooming young children. In 1998, State College psychologist Dr. Alycia Chambers, the therapist for one of Sandusky’s alleged victims, said in a report his behavior followed a 'pedophile’s pattern of building trust and gradual introduction of physical touch.' Despite the damning report, obtained by NBC News, no action was taken and Sandusky was allowed to continue in his position unwatched. The report is contained in the internal . Penn State files of a 1998 police investigation into claims the former . coach showered with an 11-year-old boy. The documents, made public for the first time, raise fresh questions about how the case was handled by the university and local authorities. Scroll down for video report . Former Penn State coach, who is facing 50 counts of sexually abusing 10 children, was described as a 'likely pedophile' as early as 1998 . In 1998, State College psychologist Dr. Alycia Chambers, the therapist for one of Sandusky¿s alleged victims, said in a report, pictured, that his behavior followed a 'pedophile¿s pattern= of grooming . 'There was very little doubt in my mind (Sandusky) … was a male predator, someone that was in the process of grooming a young man for abuse,' said Chambers in an interview with NBC News. 'I thought my report was strong enough to suggest that this was somebody who should be watched.' Chambers described her anger when police informed her last year that Sandusky had allegedly molested 10 other boys, 13 years after her clear warning. 'I was horrified to know that there were so many other innocent boys who had their hearts and minds confused, their bodies violated,' Chambers told NBC. 'It’s unspeakable.' Scroll down for video . Ignored: Dr. Alycia Chambers, the therapist for one of Sandusky¿s alleged victims, pictured, said Sandusky was a male predator who needed to be watched . Chambers was the psychologist for a 11-year-old boy, who had met Sandusky through his Second Mile charity for vulnerable children, reports NBC. The boy is now known as Victim 6 in the criminal case against the former coach due to go to trial this spring. Having spoken with her client and his mother, Chambers described in her  report how Sandusky had coaxed the boy into the shower after a workout, telling him, 'All the guys do.' Sandusky then allegedly squeezed the boy in a bear hug tightly from behind while they were both naked and lifted him up under the shower head. Scroll down for video report . Chambers described in her report, pictured in the center paragraph, how Sandusky had coaxed the boy into the shower after a workout, telling him, 'All the guys do.' Chambers gave her damning report, pictured, to Penn State police Officer Ronald Schreffler in May, 1998 . Sandusky had also kissed the boy on the forehead and told him, ‘I love you', according to the report, before inviting him to his house to 'sit on his lap' and go 'online' on his computer. 'My consultants agree that the incidents meet all of our definitions, based on experience and education, of a likely pedophile’s pattern of building trust and gradual introduction of physical touch, within a context of a ‘loving,’ ‘special’ relationship,” Chambers said in her report. Chambers gave her report to Penn State police Officer Ronald Schreffler in May, 1998. The police file shows that the investigation continued under the late Ray Gricar, local district attorney at the time, and a second boy who said Sandusky also hugged him in the Penn State showers was interviewed, reports NBC. Sandusky, pictured outside court last month, was not charged after the 1998 investigation, instead he was advised by police not to shower with children . Victim 6's mother had reported concerns over Sandusky's constant attempt to contact her child, which led to police monitoring two confrontations between her and the coach when he called at boy's home. On May 19, Sandusky called around and the mother confronted him. In the transcript, contained in the file obatained by NBC, she asked if the boy and coach's 'private parts' had touched during the bear hug. 'I don’t think so. … Maybe.' Sandusky has said before admitting that he had one the same thing with other boys. Sandusky then pressed to talk to the boy again, but the mother declined adn told him not to contact her son again, reports NBC News.. 'I understand,' Sandusky replied. 'I was wrong. I wish I could get forgiveness. I know I won’t get it from you. I wish I were dead.' According to the report, Sandusky, had invited the boy to his house, pictured, to 'sit on his lap' and go 'online' using his 'cool computer' Investigators had then interviewed Sandusky who acknowledged that he hugged the boy in the shower 'but that there wasn’t anything sexual about it'. Concluding the investigation, the report states: 'As a result of the investigation, it could not be determined that a sexual assault occurred and Sandusky was advised of such.' One of the investigators then 'advised SANDUSKY not to shower with any child. SANDUSKY stated that he wouldn’t.' This was followed by the words: 'Case Closed'. There are no reasons given in the report for why Gricar ultimately chose not to prosecute Sandusky . Sandusky retired from Penn State the following year - to spend more time working with Second Mile - but was made a 'professor emeritus' and maintained access to the locker room, where he continued to take young boys to the showers. 'It’s very disturbing,' Walter Cohen, a former Pennsylvania attorney general who reviewed parts of the Penn State police file told NBC News. 'It never should have been ignored. Never.' 'Jerry Sandusky should have been on the watch list,' he said. 'But instead, the case was closed.' Watch video report here: .

That however hasn't stopped over 200,000 units being shipped back to Shenzhen, a city bordering on Hong Kong. Smugglers are believed to be profiting around £13 for each device sold which will be launched in the People's Republic on Friday. Over 200,000 units have been shipped to the Chinese cities such as Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing . Among the ordinary shoppers wanting to get their hands on the latest must-have product were profiteering gangs. They infiltrated queues to buy iPads and re-sell them at inflated prices abroad . Customers in Apple's Regent Street store, all bagged up with their purchases. Dozens of people were paid by 'agents' to join queues around London and grab iPads to sell on. However, there is no suggestion that those pictured had any part in this . Sellers are demanding as much as £995 for those desperate to be get their hands on the tablet, ahead of the March 23rd release date. However that price is expected to drop significantly when the new model goes on sale to the Chinese public. A large number of devices were also dispatched from the U.S, where several retailers meant shorter queues for customers. Other cities such as Beijing and Shanghai.are believed to have been supplied with large quantities of the new apple device. Similarly, in the UK, Black market gangs paid as much as £300 to jump the queue in order to buy bulk purchases of the new tablets so they could then be sold on at a profit. Noah . Green, a 16-year-old student from Stanmore, North-West London, had been . fourth in the queue at Apple’s flagship store in Regent Street, London, . but said someone had paid him £300 to move back. Before going through the door, he . said: ‘It is worth it. I am still 18th in the queue so I will be one of . the first to buy an iPad. I am going to sell it though and earn some . money.’ Many appeared to have been paid £10 or £20 to wait in line for hours on behalf of a third party. Some buyers had their hands full of shopping bags filled with products. One was even pictured wheeling items out on a trolley. People were reported paid to wait in line for the gadget in London and the U.S. before the iPads were shipped to countries with later launch dates . The new iPad is to launch in 80 more countries on Friday March 23 . At Westfield shopping centre, in Shepherd’s Bush, West London, a number of buyers were seen handing purchases – still in their shrink-wrapped boxes – to a waiting group of Eastern European men . One said: ‘We’re just buying and selling, we’re not doing anything illegal. We bought them and we sold them.’At Covent Garden, men were seen handing over money, collecting receipts and organising scores of people queuing.One agent, who gave his name as Martin, said: ‘I hope to get around 70 iPads today. I will be sending them on to India.’ The new iPad will not be on sale officially in India for at least another week.Stores were given only a limited supply of the new device and many had sold out by mid-afternoon. This allowed buyers who did manage to get one the opportunity to make a quick profit by selling them via eBay. Sellers on the auction website were offering the 16GB version, which connects to the web via wifi, for as much as £562.79 – a mark-up of £163.79, or 41 per cent, on the official price of £399.

Ross Knowles, a 42-year-old boss at Kent County Council, is alleged to have siphoned off funds meant for big energy companies - which he used to buy a Jaguar car and trips abroad. The respected 'golden boy' of his sector cashed in invoices for as much as £400,000-a-time into his own personal account, a court was told. A jury heard that British Gas and NPower were two of the companies he defrauded, before being caught out. Knowles . worked with the Local Authority South East Region (Laser) buying energy . for Kent County Council in 2007, Maidstone Crown Court heard. Over . a 14-month period, Knowles - who earned a salary of £66,000 a year - . extracted more than £2million and kept it for himself, the court was . told. Allison Clare, prosecuting, told the jury that the Cambridge graduate was regarded as 'a bit of a star' and a 'golden boy'. She said: 'He was a huge asset to Laser, everybody thought. That may be why he was able to perpetrate the fraud. 'The essence of the fraud is really very simple.' Knowles would ask British Gas and . NPower to add an extra charge at their end of their dealings as a . 'comfort blanket', Miss Clare told the court. This was meant to be reclaimed by Kent County Council and Laser at the end of the year. Miss Clare added: 'British Gas charged that extra amount and during the course of the year a huge amount built up as a result.' After a year of the contract running, Knowles submitted an invoice for repayment of part of the money - totalling £400,000. But the court heard he paid that into his own personal account.

A star count shows how many areas of Britain are cut off from seeing some of the most spectacular constellations in the sky . Half of Britain cannot see a starry sky at night because of light pollution, a study has found. Glaring beams from streetlamps, shops and offices are creating an artificially bright landscape, says the Campaign to Protect Rural England. It found 53 per cent of us could see fewer than ten stars in the Orion constellation – slightly fewer than last year. Campaigners said that despite initiatives to reduce light pollution ‘the contamination of British night skies continues largely unchecked’. Together with the British Astronomical Association, they are calling for a reduction in light pollution which not only thwarts stargazers, but affects wildlife and human sleeping patterns. The research was carried out by around 1,000 volunteers who counted the stars they could see on a clear night in January and February. Just 2 per cent had truly dark skies, seeing 31 or more stars - concentrated in rural spots in the South West, West Midlands and Cumbria. Orion is one of the most easily recognisable constellations in the world and visible in Britain from November to February. Emma Marrington, of the CPRE, said unnecessary light ‘damages the character of the countryside’. She added: ‘Of course we need the right, well-designed lighting in the right places…but there should not be a blanket assumption that glaring lights are needed.’ ‘The evidence gathered during this year’s star count week shows that we need to take action now to roll back the spread of light pollution.’ And she warned: ‘When we saturate the night sky with unnecessary light, it damages the character of the countryside and blurs the distinction between town and country. Orion Nebula constellation from NASA Hubble Telescope: The orbiting telescope is (obviously) not affected by light pollution . The Local Government Association said dozens of local authorities had been trialling the dimming of street lights at night. Bob Mizon of the Campaign for Dark Skies, said: ‘Light pollution is a disaster for anyone trying to study the stars. It’s like a veil of light is being drawn across the night sky, denying many people the beauty of a truly starry night. ‘Many children growing up today will never see the Milky Way; never see the unimaginable glory of billions of visible stars shining above them.’ A spokesman from the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘New national planning rules provide strong protection against light pollution. ‘The national planning framework makes clear that councils should limit the impact of light pollution from artificial light when making planning decisions.","More than half of UK can see 10 or less stars in Orion .

They said police raids and the arrests in the capital of Belgrade and in the central city of Cacak were conducted in coordination with police from several European countries. Art experts have suggested the robbers took advantage of a low-security museum without knowing about the paintings or how difficult it can be to sell such well-known stolen art works. The robbers took the first four paintings they reached when they raided the museum shortly before closing time on a Sunday. Although the most valuable painting was among the ones they took, they left behind the second most precious picture in the room, Cezanne's Self Portrait with Palette, insured for £61.5 ($98million). The stolen works were among some 200 collected by billionaire pro-Nazi industrialist Emil Buehrle who died in 1956. He made his fortune producing weapons for Hitler's forces during the Second World War, including anti-aircraft guns which brought down many British bombers.

Bookies are running scared today as they face a £10 million hit if a woman wins the Grand National for the first time today. Millions are set to watch sisters-in-law Katie Walsh, 27, and Nina Carberry, also 27, set their family loyalty aside and battle for racing's biggest prize at Aintree. The highly-rated pair, who were bridesmaid and bride two months ago, are both from two racing dynasties and have rode winners at Cheltenham but no woman has ever gone that step further and won the world's greatest steeplechase. Good friends: Jockeys and sisters-in-law Nina Carberry, left, and Katie Walsh, right, are both riding in The John Smith's Grand National today and are backed to make history . The day job: Carberry, left, and Walsh, right, will don their silks this afternoon and try to stay the 4.5 mile Aintree course . Carberry, whose dad Tommy rode L’Escargot to a glorious win in 1972, is on the much-fancied Organisedconfusion, and married Walsh’s brother, Ted jnr, in February. While her sister-in-law will try to stay the four-and-a-half-mile course on Seabass, trained by her father Ted, who won with Papillon in 2000. 35 years since Charlotte Brew . became the first woman to ride in the race, 18 female-ridden runners . have started since but never won. 'I'm looking forward to it, it's a great opportunity and I might never have a ride in the race again, so I just want to enjoy the whole thing,' Ms Walsh said today. Lady's first: Nina Carberry can land the National and her horse is much-fancied by the punters . Dressed for success: Nina Carberry, left and right, is a regular fixture in the winner's enclosure but could make history today . 'As women riders we are not treated any differently and we wouldn't expect to be, but at some stage a woman is going to win a Classic on the Flat or the Grand National and I just hope it's me.' 'If you’re not in, you can’t win, and hopefully he takes to the jumps,' Carberry added about her horse Organisedconfusion yesterday. 'He jumps well at home but you just don’t know until you line up.' And the bookies fear they will be 'kicked where it hurts' if either woman wins the race at 4.15pm. 'Although women jockeys in the race have been relatively commonplace since Geraldine Rees became the first of her sex to complete the course aboard Cheers in 1982, this year’s National breaks new ground – two female riders with strong chances,' Ladbrookes' David Williams told the Mirror. What Katie did: Walsh has a big chance with Seabass and will go all out to beat her sister-in-law and the rest of the field . Both have ridden winners at the Cheltenham Festival – the most competitive environment there is in jump racing – so there is no doubt as to their talent and nerve. 'As a result, a victory for either would kick us where it hurts – we could be looking at losses of £10million.' But it is racing hero JP McCoy, who broke his National duck at the 15th attempt on Don't Push It two years ago, who has the potential to inflict one of the worst results ever on bookmakers if Synchronised becomes the first horse since Golden Miller in 1934 to win the top prize of last month's Cheltenham Festival and the Grand National in the same season.

Talackova and Allred held a press . conference today where the lawyer argued that her client 'didn’t ask Mr. Trump to prove he's a naturally born man, or see photos of his birth, . or to view his anatomy ... It made no difference to her.' But Trump appears keen to prove his manhood and called TMZ to say Gloria would be ‘very, very, very, very impressed’ if he were to display his genitals. ‘I think she would have a whole new image of Donald Trump,’ he continued. During the phone call the billionaire refused to apologise to Talackova and repeated that she would be allowed to come back into the competition – but added that ‘he couldn’t care less’ if she competes.

Simpson’s family during the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Jenna Talackova, 23, was thrown out of the pageant, founded by Donald Trump, when organisers found out she had undergone surgery to become a woman. Officials denied charges of discrimination and said the reason why a male-to-female transgender contestant could not compete was because Miss Talackova lied on her application form.

The transgendered contestant had already successfully reached the finals in the Miss Vancouver pageant before she was banned from continuing in the competition. After becoming suspicious, director Denis Davila questioned Ms Talackova, 23, who said that, even though she written on her application that she had been born a female, that was not the case. 'We have to have the facts straight. There is no discrimination here at all,' Mr Davila said. 'You can look at it the way she wants to look at it, but we all have to follow the same rules.' Following her expulsion from the competition, organizers faced much criticism with many fans saying that they were blatantly discriminatory. Over 20,000 people signed a virtual petition on Change.org calling for organizers to reverse their decision. The original decision from the Miss Universe Canada pageant sparked outrage with people calling for Jenna to be reinstated into the contest. People took to social media pages to express their disgust with one Facebook user writing on the pageant's page: 'Tell us what ""requirements"" did she not make? This reeks of discrimination...'

Up to 40 elderly cancer sufferers are dying needlessly every day because they are being denied the best treatments, a damning report warns. Patients over the age of 70 are routinely being ‘written off’ by doctors who assume they are too frail for surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Such discrimination has led to Britain having one of the worst cancer survival rates in the Western world, according to Macmillan Cancer Support. Scandal: Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in the Western world because elderly patients are too easily ruled out for surgery. (Posed by models) The charity estimates that if the treatment of older patients matched that on offer in the U.S., as many as 14,000 lives could be saved every year. Ciaran Devane, chief executive of Macmillan, described it as an ‘unacceptable act of discrimination’. In the report, he points out that while cancer rates are vastly improving across most age groups, they have actually worsened in patients aged 85 and above. And despite major advances in diagnosis and treatment, the survival chances for patients over the age of 75 have only increased by a fraction. Mr Devane said: ‘Writing people off as too old for treatment is utterly shameful. We have a moral duty to treat people as individuals and give them the best chance of beating cancer, regardless of their age. ‘The NHS and social care providers . must wake up to the specific issues older people face and ensure . treatment decisions are based on their overall health, not just their . date of birth.’ The report . warns that many doctors are wary of offering elderly patients surgery, . chemotherapy or radiotherapy as they are more likely to suffer . debilitating side effects, including sickness and extreme tiredness. The body is also more prone to infection which can cause death. Warning: While cancer survival rates have improved for most other age groups, they have actually worsened for those aged over 85, the study found. (Posed by models) Many doctors are also often worried about putting patients forward for treatment if they have illnesses such as dementia and diabetes in case their drugs or the condition itself causes complications. But the report urges doctors to look at patients’ health and physical fitness rather than their date of birth. It points out that while one 78-year-old may be bed-bound, another might be running half-marathons. Figures cited in the report show that only 36 per cent of cancer patients in England over the age of 75 are likely to survive their illness. This compares with 49 per cent in Sweden, 45 per cent in Germany and 40 per cent across Europe as a whole. The most recent figures show that between 1995-97 and 2003-05, cancer mortality rates dropped by 17 per cent for those under 75. By contrast, they fell by only 6 per cent in the 75-84 age group and they actually increased by 2 per cent among the over-85s. Professor Riccardo Audisio, a breast cancer surgeon at St Helens Hospital in the Wirral, admitted: ‘We have huge evidence of under-treatment for these patients. ‘It is despicable to neglect, not to offer, not to even go near to the best treatment option only on the simple basis of the patient’s age. This has been a horrible mistake that, particularly in the UK, we have suffered from.’ Last year, research found that only 54 per cent of breast cancer patients over 70 were given surgery compared with 85 per cent of younger patients.","Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Western world .

Every year the American Library Association releases a list of the ten books most frequently reported as banned or challenged by angry parents, schools and libraries across the country. And as is often the case, this year's most reviled author, Lauren Myracle, is in trouble for a tween trilogy deemed unsuitable in content, profane and sexually perverse. The controversial themes - that include sex, drugs and alcohol - are not the only thing to spark outrage from conservative readers across the nation. The books are written entirely in instant message language. Innocent? Tween author who writes in instant message shorthand has topped the list of American's most banned books with her series about high school girls . Ms Myracle's series about three high school friends entitled TTL, L8R G8R and TTFN, are apparently so incendiary they have been banned from a town in Texas where parents are disgusted by the profanity and sexually explicit nature of the book. While she acknowledges that the abbreviated language creates an initial barrier for adults, when it comes to subject matter, the author only pays attention to the positive feedback she receives from readers themselves. She told The Daily Beast: 'My . favorite comments come from girls who say, ""I feel like you’ve given me a . self-help book because my parents won’t talk about this."" 'When . I was a kid, I read Judy Blume to figure out what a hard-on was and . what to do when you got your period, so when people say to me, ""You’re . this generation's Judy Blume,"" I am wildly honored by that.' Cntrvrsy: Lauren Myracle's series tackles themes like sex, drugs and alcohol . She is also reluctant to take responsibility for exposing children to issues that they don't already know about, a common charge among many parents. 'Parents aren’t always realistic,' she . explained. 'One said to me, ""I can’t believe you introduced my . 13-year-old daughter to thong underwear."" I’m pretty sure she knows . about them already. She probably owns a pair.' 1. TYL, L8R G8R, TTFN - Lauren Myracle . 2. The Colour of Earth (Series) - Kim Dong Hwa . 3. 'The Hunger Games' Trilogy - Suzanne Collins . 4. My Mom's Having a Baby!

In fact contrary to the accusations flying at her from those who call her 'Satan's handmaiden' and a 'pedophile', Ms Myracle's hope is that girls will read her books and reflect on the bad decisions they might otherwise have made without thinking of the consequences. 'One girl goes to a college party when she’s still in high school. She gets drunk. She gets egged on to take her shirt off. Pictures get taken,' she summarised. 'I don’t write books to teach lessons, but if a girl can read a story like that and think, ""Maybe I won’t take off my shirt at a frat party when people have phones there,"" my work is done.' Other books on the list include a graphic novel by Kim Dong Hwa that upset people with its images of nudity, The Hunger Games Trilogy by Suzanne Collins and the Gossip Girl series. Also featured were legendary classics like Aldous Huxley's A Brave New World and seminal novel To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. As a reaction to the challenges made to literature with provocative content, The American Library Association holds an annual Banned Books Week to celebrate the freedom to read and warn of the dangers of censorship .

Theresa May announced the end of cheap alcohol today as she set out plans for new minimum prices which will add £2 to a supermarket 12-pack of beer or cider. The Home Secretary said as a result of the reforms 'cheap vodka, super-strength cider and special brew lagers will go up in price' in a bid to tackle anti-social behaviour. A minimum price of 40p per unit is likely to be brought in - hitting cut-price supermarket deals. Scroll down for video . Other moves in the Government’s long-awaited alcohol strategy include: . Minimum pricing could spell the end for supermarket own brands as they lose their price advantage. A . two-litre plastic bottle of cider, containing 15 units, can sell for as . little as £3. But under a minimum pricing scheme of 40p per unit, it . could not be sold for less than £6. Supermarket . own-brand whisky and vodka bottles containing 28 units can be found for . between £5 and £8. But this would rise to £11.20 under the minimum . price plans. 12-can packs . of Fosters and Strongbow are currently priced at £9 in the supermarkets, . but under the reforms they would rise to £11. Bulk buy promotions will also go - so an offer of two 12-pack boxes of beer for £16 would have to go up to at least £22. Supermarkets will also not be able to offer three-for-two deals on wine. Party's over: Supermarkets will be banned from offering buy-one-get-one-free deals on alcohol . End of cheap booze: Theresa May outlines new minimum prices for alcohol in the House of Commons today . Theresa May outlined the Government's plans today in a rare Friday statement in the House of Commons. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette . Cooper accused the Government of rushing out the proposals to avoid further bad . headlines over this week’s Budget. She said Mrs May was being . used as a 'human shield' in an effort to distract attention from the row . over the Budget’s 'granny tax' raid on pensioners. Mrs May told MPs that by increasing the cheapest drinks in price, anti-social behaviour will be cut. 'Most people have no problem with alcohol, they enjoy a drink - indeed it’s one of life’s pleasures, she said. 'But we all know there is a significant minority in this country who drink dangerously and who cause disproportionate harm.' Drunken violence had 'made many town centres no-go areas for law-abiding citizens'. She told the Commons: 'In some shops . and supermarkets, drinks are now so heavily discounted it is possible to . buy a can of lager for as little as 20p or a two-litre bottle of cider . for just £1.69. 'That means many people now drink excessively at home and many ""pre-load"" before they go out.' She said 'pre-loaders' were estimated to be two-and-a-half times more likely to be involved in violence than other drinkers. Evidence showed alcohol consumption . was closely linked to the price of drink and 'increasing the price of . the very cheapest alcohol does most to reduce heavy drinking', with . young people particularly affected by increases in cost. The Government argue that a 40p minimum . price could mean 50,000 fewer crimes each year and 9,000 fewer . alcohol-related deaths over the next decade. The death of bargain bulk buy promotions will hit middle class families stocking up on supplies of beer and wine. Supermarkets will not be able to offer three-for-two deals on wine. An offer of two 12-pack boxes of beer or cider for £16 would have to rise to at least £22 under the reforms. The Government are targeting young drinkers who 'pre-load' on cheap booze before going out. By increasing the price of drink bought in bulk, Ministers are confident they will cut consumption and change habits. However, they will inadvertently hit middle-class occasional drinkers trying to get the best value for money at the checkouts. The price of cheap two litre bottles of cider - currently just £3 could double under the reforms. However, they have not ruled . out setting a higher minimum price and are currently consulting on the . issue. The move will be welcomed by medical . experts, but has faced opposition from some Conservative MPs, who say it . will penalise moderate drinkers and cost consumers as much as . £700million a year. Ministers have been warned it could also be ruled . illegal under EU free trade laws. Mrs May added that 24-hour drinking had only made the problem of drink in town and city centres worse. She said: 'We were promised under Labour's Licensing Act 2003 a European-style cafe culture. 'Nothing . could be further from the truth in many of our town centres on a Friday . and Saturday night and it's law-abiding citizens who are actually . suffering as a result of that.' The . Government’s alcohol strategy, designed to reduce the estimated . £21billion annual cost of irresponsible drinking, will mean a ‘zero . tolerance’ approach to drunken behaviour in A&E departments. It also proposes a late-night levy to . make pubs and clubs help pay for policing and powers to prevent alcohol . being served to drunks. Time at the bar: David Cameron, pictured enjoying a pint at the cricket last year, will introduce a minimum price on alcohol - likely to be 40p per unit . The ‘zero tolerance’ approach to alcohol in A&E departments will mean hospitals getting . the right to instigate a review of licences of particular pubs and clubs . if they are getting large numbers of patients they suspect have been . drinking there. Police . will be encouraged to put officers in hospitals on Saturday nights and . other key periods, funded through the late-night levy on pubs and clubs. The plan says minimum prices will . tackle so-called ‘pre-loading’, when people drink cheap alcohol at home . before heading to a pub or nightclub. She also suggested that action was possible to restrict deep bulk discounts on alcohol. Critics of the proposal say it will penalise responsible drinkers, such as middle-class members of ‘wine clubs’ who take advantage of discounted deals on fine wines and champagne. Education Secretary Michael Gove is thought to have been among Cabinet ministers against the move. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said last night it was not ‘a magic bullet’, but ‘with the industry, we’re making strong progress. They are announcing a commitment by 2015 to take one billion units of alcohol out of the UK market by reducing alcohol content in some drinks and promoting lower-alcohol products.’ Ms Cooper said ministerial appearances on a Friday were usually only the result of a national emergency. However 'the only emergency' at the . moment was 'the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have gone wobbly over . the coverage of their Budget', she said. She said: 'There is no precedent for . handling a long-awaited consultation document on a Friday morning with . no notice in this way. 'Over the last 10 years there have . been only three government statements on a Friday: on the Iraq War, on . swine flu and on Libya. All of them involving serious issues around . national emergencies. 'What is the national emergency . today? The only emergency is that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor . have gone wobbly over the coverage of their Budget. 'Their Budget has gone wrong because . pensioners are furious about the granny tax, because middle earners are . shocked to discover they will be paying the higher rate and because . everyone else is furious to discover they are bringing in a £10,000 tax . break for the highest earners in the country including, we discover, . half the Cabinet. 'This is not about a 40p minimum price, it is about their failings on the 40p tax. 'The Home Secretary is being used as a human shield for the Chancellor and the Prime Minister and she should have said no.' Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium, said minimum pricing was in effect a ‘tax on responsible drinkers’. But Eric Appleby of Alcohol Concern said: ‘This is a victory for common sense. We cannot carry on with a situation where it’s cheaper to buy cans of lager than a can of Coke.’ And Andrew Langford of the British Liver Trust added: ‘We are delighted the Government has recognised the importance of minimum price and would urge them to increase the amount to 50p per unit so it has more impact.’ There were 1.1million hospital admissions in England relating to alcohol in 2009/10.","12-pack of Fosters or Strongbow will go from £9 to £11 in the supermarkets .

New terrestrial planets are believed to be forming around a neighbouring baby solar system – including a giant planet about the same distance to its host star as Saturn is to the Sun. Planets there may even contain mountains made entirely of diamonds, thanks to an abundance of carbon. The central star, Beta Pictoris, is twice as large as our sun and astronomers using Nasa’s Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer telescope discovered that it’s surrounded by a disk of extremely carbon-rich gas. Nasa’s Marc Kucher told Nature: ‘If carbon-rich worlds are forming in Beta Pictoris, they might be covered with tar and smog, with mountains made of giant diamonds. Life on such a planet is not implausible, but it would certainly be exotic.’ Nursery: Beta Pictoris is surrounded by carbon rich gas and dust with planets very likely forming and growing from asteroid collisions . The disk of dust and gas surrounding the star, which lies 70 light years away near the constellation Pictor and is only 12 million years old, is produced by collisions between and evaporation of asteroids and comets. Debris discs are a bigger version of the zodiacal dust in our Solar System. The Beta Pictoris disc was the first to be imaged - as early as 1984 - and remains the best-studied system.

Adan Abobaker was awarded a Queen's Gallantry Medal after diving into the River Thames in London in November 2010 to rescue a woman from the freezing water after hearing the screams of a passerby. Braving the high tide, strong . undercurrents and poor visibility, Mr Abobaker dived beneath the water . several times before reaching her and swimming to safety with her. He was later treated for hypothermia, but the woman he had rescued made a full recovery. Meanwhile, former policeman Ken McGonigle was awarded the same medal, but posthumously, for preventing an attack by insurgents in Afghanistan. He was working as a mentor . to the Afghan Police in Musa Qala, Helmand Province, on 7 August 2010 . when he was alerted by his Afghan interpreter to an imminent threat. The father-of-four ran outside to see . an insurgent armed with an RPG rocket launcher, looking to kill all . occupants of a helicopter about to lift off. Mr McGonigle, from Magheramason in . Northern Ireland’s Co Londonderry, knew that a number of service . personnel were on board so immediately drew his pistol and engaged the . gunman at close quarters. As another insurgent emerged he continued to engage until they disappeared and he could alert colleagues to the danger. He then led a party of marines to . where the gunmen were located and the group found four insurgents armed . with automatic weapons and RPGs. Mr McGonigle was killed in the ensuing fire fight. His citation read: 'Without his intervention it is likely that a number of British lives would have been lost.' Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux received a posthumous George Medal .

Reassurances: Thailand's Deputy PM Chalerm Yubamrung confirmed a man had been arrested on suspicion of a terror plot in Bangkok, but insisted the situation was under control . British tourists were warned today to beware of possible attacks targeting westerners in Thailand after police thwarted a terror plot in Bangkok. The US Embassy revealed a ‘real and credible’ threat against Americans and western holidaymakers in the Thai capital. The alert – the first of its kind in Bangkok in recent memory – followed the arrest of a Lebanese man with suspected links to Iran-backed Hezbollah militants. He was seized following a tip-off that helped foil a planned attack on New Year’s Eve. A second plotter was still at large last night. US officials urged Americans to ‘keep a low profile’ in public and to exercise caution in areas where western tourists gather. ‘Foreign terrorists may be currently looking to conduct attacks against tourist areas in Bangkok in the near future,’ they added. The warning in Bangkok comes at a time of heightened tension between the West and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions. Thousands of mourners chanted anti-US and Israeli slogans at the funeral in Tehran yesterday of slain nuclear expert Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Wednesday’s motorcycle bombing a ‘cowardly assassination’ and accused the US and Israel of being behind the attack. On alert: The foiled plot comes at a time of heightened tensions between the West and Iran over Tehran's nuclear ambitions, particularly after the bombing (above) of a Iranian nuclear scientist in the capital on Wednesday . American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton denied the US played any role in the bombing. Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Chalerm Yubamrung said Israelis were thought to be the targets of the New Year’s Eve terror plot in Bangkok. ‘At first, we were told the Palestinians were behind it, but it turned out to be Hezbollah,’ he said. He said two men were arrested on Thursday. Face-off: Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (left) blames the U.S. and Israel for the nuclear scientist's death, a charge U.S Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (right) denies . ‘The authorities had been following two Lebanese men and called in one of them for questioning,’ he said. ‘Technically the two men have not committed any crimes under Thai law so we could only use the immigration law to keep this one suspect in custody,’ he added. Despite the US warning, he insisted the danger had passed: ‘I want to confirm and I am confident that we have the situation under control. 'And I can guarantee no terrorist attacks will be allowed to take place. If they have disagreement, they should go fight somewhere else.’ Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim militant group, is the most potent military force in Lebanon, far stronger than even the national army. It is backed mainly by Iran and Syria.","Lebanese national with 'links to Iran-backed militants' arrested in Bangkok .

Arnold Schwarzenegger posing during the 38th Cannes film festival, where he presented Pumping Iron: Strong 'macho' men tend to hold right-wing views - and in particular support military action . If you have ever seen a film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger or Bruce Willis it will come as no surprise. Male action film stars are more likely to have right-wing political views than other actors, a study has found. On questions of foreign policy in particular, if the actor carries a gun on screen he is more likely to back the troops in real life. The researchers concluded that macho men were more likely to believe in the ‘utility of political aggression’ to solve conflict. They are unlike most of Hollywood which is traditionally left wing, including the dozens of actors who came out against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The study by Aaron Sell from Griffith University in Australia examined how the ability to fight still plays an important role in shaping men’s behaviour and outlook, even though we have long moved on from being Neanderthal hunter gatherers. Sell concluded that if a man has a strong upper body he is more likely to become aggressive when angered, he will became angry more quickly and tends to feel more entitled to things. But he also discovered that macho men were more likely to be right wing too in a surprising additional finding. His theory does indeed appear to be born out by the careers of Schwarzenegger and Willis. Whilst governor of California Schwarzenegger implemented stringent budget cuts in line with Republican doctrine. He has also made a number of visits to Iraq to show his support for U.S. troops and has spent time with American soldiers in Afghanistan. ‘Die Hard’ star Willis supported George H W Bush, George W Bush and appeared at the 2000 National Republican Convention in the US. Die-hard right winger? Willis supported George H W Bush, George W Bush and appeared at the 2000 National Republican Convention in the US. Others who have proclaimed their support for the Republican party in the US include Dirty Harry star Clint Eastwood, veteran action film actor Chuck Norris. The study authors conclude: ‘Upper body strength in adult males is a crucial variable that appears to have impacts on a wide range of mental mechanisms. ‘These mechanisms were designed by natural selection at a time when personal physical aggression was far more common and individual differences in fighting ability were far more relevant for the resolution of conflicts. ‘Despite the steady decline in physical aggression and violent deaths that have accompanied Western civilization, the human mind is still designed for ancestral environments.’","Physically strong men tend to hold right wing views .

"By . Lauren Paxman . UPDATED: . 03:18 EST, 25 November 2011 . Women wear bras all day every day for the whole of their adult lives, going through hundreds of different styles. But you won't have ever worn one quite like Asda's latest model. The Abacadabra promises to boost your bust by two cup sizes - nothing new there. However, it also has a 'lighter than air' feel which makes it more comfortable than the other push-up bras available. Better still, it costs just £6. The secret to the bra's success is all . in the design. George at Asda enlisted the help of a former aerodynamic . engineer to come up with a new form of underwear. Scroll down for a behind the scenes video... Abracadabra: George's new range of bras, designed by aerodynamic . engineer Antonio Padula, are filled with an injectable mould which . doesn't move around, making it more comfortable . Antonia Padula filled the bra with an injectable mould which is one solid cup rather than inserts which can move around and become uncomfortable. It’s brand new technology which was crafted to fit the curve of a woman’s body perfectly - as well as boosting the bust. The collaboration between George and Padula is a response to a survey which found that more than half of the female population are unhappy with the size of their bust. Seventy-five per cent of 20-29 year old women surveyed admitted to wearing ‘push-up’ bras on a daily basis, with 48 per cent of women under 29 specifically wanting to make their bust larger. Further research showed new mothers are most concerned with the look and size of their cleavage - 69 per cent said they would like to improve their chests. Two-cup boost: Before (left) and after shots show the effects of the 'lighter than air' bra . There are other ways to boost your bust, but women aren't quite as keen on them... 75 per cent of 20-29 year old women admitted to wearing a push-up bra every day . 23 per cent cited exercise as a preferred solution to their bust worries . 11 per cent are considering going under the knife . 10 per cent are willing to give a bust firming cream a try . Padula, an ex-mechanical engineer turned technological bra designer, created a bra that addresses the concerns of women who find push up bras too uncomfortable (15 per cent) and those who find them ineffective (87 per cent). A master of understanding the importance of curvature and shape following years in the aerodynamics engineering industry, Padula's Abracadabra was created to feel ‘at one’ with women’s curves, while still giving an enhancement of two sizes. The bra uses innovative ‘A2S’ technology, which means that it is made up of a single component injected mould rather than the usual multiple layered, padded insert or air filled cups. This technology streamlines the bra's shape for an instantly larger and lifted look while remaining discreet underneath clothing. George Brand Director Fiona Lambert said: 'As ever we continue to strive to be the first to market with innovative and problem solving solutions for both women and men. 'The Abracadabra is as magic as its title professes. It enhances, uplifts and enlarges the bust area by two sizes through its remarkable technological engineering.'",George's 'Abracadabra' boosts your bust by two sizes and costs just £6 .

Cornish MPs from all three major political parties could be set to form a coalition of their own to prevent the Government getting its controversial 'pasty tax' plan past Parliament, it emerged today. Lib Dem Stephen Gilbert said the six Cornish MPs would look to build a coalition of its own from Labour MPs and other disgruntled Government MPs - Lib Dem and Conservative - across the country opposed to George Osborne’s Budget plan to make pasties and other hot baked foods subject to VAT. Speaking at a Pasty Tax Summit in Truro, which brought together pasty producers and politicians, the MP for Newquay and St Austell said that there was opposition to the plan from across the country from the Cornish countryside to 'meat and potato pie' constituencies in the north of England. Hot food tax: Pasties that are sold hot in shops will have to charge the 20 per cent sales tax . He said that the Treasury was already adopting a 'bunker mentality' over the pasty tax and there was a chance that the legislation would either be defeated or that enough pressure could be brought to see it watered down. 'This is not going to sail through the Commons,' he said. 'There will be a vote on whether this goes forward. The only issue is whether we give the Government enough uncertainty over the result that they look at the alternatives. In . the 1980s Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson put VAT on hot food. But he . exempted freshly baked products, such as pastries and pies, that were . still warm from the bakery oven. George Osborne considered this a . loophole that needed closing. All food – pasties, sausage rolls, . toasted sandwiches and rotisserie chickens – that is sold hot in any . shop will have to charge the 20 per cent sales tax. Hot takeaway . restaurants and fish and chip shops already charge VAT. The Treasury guide says food is hot if it is ‘above ambient air temperature when provided to the customer’. This appears straightforward, but . could cause huge confusion when you consider variable factors such as . the weather or even how freshly-cooked the product is. Sales at bakery chains such as . Greggs and Subway have soared in recent years. But the new tax will mean . many prices rising by 20 per cent and not surprisingly they are trying . to force the Treasury into a rethink. 'We are looking for a coalition that can win a Commons’ vote.' The summit heard from industry figures that the VAT could sound the 'death knell' for many businesses. Under the current rules all hot food carries VAT but pasties and other savoury products such as sausage rolls are exempt because they are baked and are only warm because they have recently come out of the oven. The Chancellor said in last month’s budget that he wants to create a level playing field by imposing the tax on bakeries and supermarkets to bring them in line with fast-food outlets which already pay VAT. Pasty industry figures at the summit said the planned introduction of 20% VAT on their products would lead to a similar fall in sales that would hit jobs in a county already among the poorest in England. Mark Muncey, chairman of the Cornish Pasty Association trade body, said the industry wanted to avoid a cut in jobs and investment that would likely come if the VAT was added and hailed the 'fantastic public support' that the campaign had received. 'We all realise we have to tighten our belts in this period of austerity and I think we all understand we have overspent here and there,' he said. 'But when you start taxing just everyday food I think that starts to get a little bit hard and quite frankly people are a bit fed up and that it why I think you have seen such a big reaction.' Pastry but not a pasty: Politicians, including Prime Minister David Cameron, seemed keen to be pictured eating pasties in the wake of the 'Pastygate' fiasco . All six Cornish MPs, Lib Dems Mr Gilbert, Dan Rogerson and Andrew George, plus Tories George Eustice, Sarah Newton and Sheryll Murray, have questioned the plan to charge the standard rate of VAT from October. Mr Gilbert, the only MP to attend the summit at the offices of accountancy firm Francis Clark, said he believed there would be an opportunity to vote on the plan before Parliament rises for the summer. Delegates at the summit, chaired by local tax expert John Endacott, outlined potential ways to approach the Government over the tax, ranging from pushing for a complete repeal to trying to gain concessions such as paying VAT at only 5% or asking for pasties to be exempted. No decision was made during the session. Just another lunch: Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls popped to Greggs following 'Pastygate' Phil Ugalde, chairman of the Proper Cornish food company, which manufactures pasties, said his firm is likely to have to cut jobs if the plan goes ahead. 'I think he (the Chancellor) needs to take a look at it because the net benefit of VAT could be lost through general taxation if companies like us have to scale down and our profits reduce,' he said. 'It (the pasty) is a way of life and part of the retail scene in town centres, and retail is struggling enough already. 'We have had real material cost increases over the last four years. For some companies, this could be the real death knell.'","Six Cornish MPs 'to form coalition opposing pasty tax'

With its thatched cottages, Saxon heritage and proud farming roots Silverton in Devon's beautiful Exe valley is the quintessential English village. But residents say an Asbo 'Section 30 Dispersal Order' - more commonly used in inner cities - has smeared their image to help police tackle a minority of troublemakers. They have complained that the move will damage their formidable reputation - and send property prices tumbling. Dispersal order: Residents of Silverton say a Asbo 'Section 30 Dispersal Order' - more commonly used in inner cities - has smeared their image . Not since the Saxons first invaded has there been such outrage in . the parish at the imposition of new rules. An influx of problem families into the village with a population of 1,905 has been blamed for a rise in anti-social behaviour. Latest crime figures show the number . of 'nuisance' incidents in Silverton more than trebled - from nine to 33 . per year - between 2010 and the end of 2011. This is set against an overall 14 per . cent reduction in anti-social behaviour across Mid Devon Council's area . over a similar period. Police and council officials say the . Asbo will help tackle intimidation of residents, criminal damage and the . pelting of houses with objects. Jane Isaac, 53, landlady of the Lamb . Inn, where 80 villagers packed a public meeting, said an influx of . 'problem' families had damaged their reputation. 'We're being used as a dumping ground . for a couple of problem families who keep getting moved around council . properties,' she said. 'The idea is that they are dispersed throughout the council area to dilute the effect they have. 'But these families' kids just end up dragging local kids into trouble.' Her husband Alan, 56, said: 'Most Silverton people think the dispersal zone is over the top.' Picture postcard: Homeowners have claimed that the 'Asbo' will ruin their villages reputation and send property prices plunging . Officers will have the power to order . any group of two or more people 'causing, or likely to cause, . anti-social behaviour' to leave a dispersal zone - marked on village . maps stuck to lamp posts. Under 16s can be escorted back to . their homes while parents may receive warning letters and 'acceptable . behaviour' contracts for their children. Amanda Parker, 40, manager of the village's Spar store, said: 'Most customers are really angry about the dispersal order. 'It damages the reputation of the village and people feel it is going to hit property prices.' Hairdresser Anita Petherick, who opened the Silverton Barber Shop three months ago, said: 'Friends have asked me; ""why open a shop there - that's the Asbo village."" 'Neighbouring areas are getting the impression that this is a really bad place. 'But that's nonsense. I haven't heard one customer complain to me about anti-social behaviour.' The Rev Alan McDonald, vicar of Silverton's 15th century Grade I listed Church of St Mary the Virgin, said the order, obtained by the East and Mid Devon Community Safety Partneship, was disproportionate. 'Until this order was publicised most people in the village were unaware there was even a problem,' he said. The authority's community safety officer, Julia Ryder, said the new police powers would target a 'small number of individuals who are responsible for the behaviour, or who are encouraging others to get involved.' Sergeant Paul Roberts, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the order would not affect anyone 'wishing to meet and go about normal day to day activities.' However many villagers remain unimpressed. Retired Royal Navy warrant officer John Jackson, 69, moved to Silverton last year from Plymouth. 'You see kids riding around on BMX bikes, wearing hoodies and making a noise,' he said. 'Some of them probably have a few cans of lager. 'But that doesn't make Silverton a troublespot. If you think otherwise, try living where I was in Plymouth.'","One resident fumed: 'If you think Silverton is a troublespot, try living where I did in Plymouth'

"By . Thomas Durante . UPDATED: . 19:12 EST, 15 December 2011 . In a ceremony at the White House in September, President Obama told family and friends Sgt Dakota Meyer's tale of courage and heroism. The president described how Sgt Meyer charged through insurgent gunfire on five trips in a Humvee to save 13 Marines and Army soldiers and another 23 Afghan troops pinned down by withering enemy fire. He personally killed at least eight insurgents despite taking a shrapnel wound to one arm as he manned the gun turret of the Humvee and provided cover for the soldiers, according to the military. Exaggerated? Military documents reportedly claim that the deeds of Sgt Dakota Meyer described by President Obama and the Marines are inflated and in some cases, not true . But a journalist embedded with the soldiers who survived the firefight, as well as sworn statements from the military and Sgt Meyer himself, suggest those stories may be inflated accounts. A McClatchy reporter said that the . chronicle of the deeds that Sgt Meyer is said to have performed are full . of errors and in some cases, didn’t even happen. For one, the claim that Sgt Meyer shot eight Taliban insurgents dead cannot be substantiated by the driver of the vehicle he was driving in, who testified that he only saw Sgt Meyer shoot one. McClatchy also found that there’s no evidence to support that Sgt Meyer saved 13 U.S. Marines and soldiers, as the Marine Corps claims. Why? Because 12 Americans, including the embedded journalist, were ambushed - and four of them were killed in the battle. The . reporter’s first-hand account of the firefight also showed that the . soldiers who did survive were saved - not by Sgt Meyer - but by U.S. choppers that flew in to . help. In addition, military medal historian . Doug Sterner told McClatchy that it’s unlikely that the Marines would . release the story of a battle based on Sgt Meyer's account. Stretching the truth: A military historian argues that many Medal of Honor recipients like Sgt Dakota Meyer have been commended on exaggerations of their deeds . Sterner said: 'Give me a break. A recipient is responsible for writing his narrative? I have never heard of such a thing.' Sterner . added that the Meyer case is not alone, as many other Medal of Honor . recipients have been commended on exaggerations of their deeds. He said: 'Did this man deserve the Medal . of Honor? If the answer to that is yes, then the details of the . citation become secondary. But we do need to keep the record as . accurately as we possibly can.' But despite the claims, there is no . evidence to support that Sgt Meyer was falsely nominated for the honour, as seven witnesses reportedly support the fact that he risked his life repeatedly during the mission. In Afghanistan, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley on the day of the ambush. On Thursday, President Obama defended the Medal of Honor recipient, despite the McClatchy report about the account of his bravery. Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday the award was based on sworn testimony, reviewed by the Marine Corps, and Obama 'remains very proud' of Meyer and his 'remarkable acts of bravery.' The Marine Corps told McClatchy it was also standing by its citation . produced in Sgt Meyer's Medal of Honor nomination process. Sgt Meyer declined to comment. The revelations are the latest in a string of controversy for the Marine. Last . month, he sued a defense contractor that he said ridiculed his Medal of . Honor, called him mentally unstable and suggested he had a drinking . problem, thereby costing him a job. In a defamation lawsuit filed in Texas, Sgt Meyer alleges that his former employer, BAE Systems OASYS Inc. ruined his chances at landing a new job by telling a prospective employer that he was a poor worker during a three-month stint this past spring. Leaving active duty in May of 2010, . Sgt Meyer was hired by BAE in March the following year after working for . another defense contractor named Ausgar Technologies that hired . veterans to train active-duty service members, according to the Wall . Street Journal. BAE's . manager had claimed Sgt Meyer in that time 'was mentally unstable, that . Sgt. Meyer was not performing BAE tasks assigned and that he had . a problem related to drinking in a social setting,' according to the . lawsuit.

Ready to fight: In this undated photo released by the U.S. Marines, Sgt Meyer poses with a machine gun while deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Ganjgal Village, Kunar province, Afghanistan . The lawsuit, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, seeks unspecified damages. BAE Systems spokesman Brian . Roehrkasse said the company was . grateful to Meyer for his bravery but strongly disagreed with his . claims. Following his return from overseas, Sgt Meyer . had initially expressed interest in becoming a New York City firefighter after inspiration from his grandfather who was a firefighter in . Kentucky as well as by the men and women who responded to the September . 11th attacks. He missed the three-month . application window to apply because of the whirlwind of events surrounding his . Medal of Honor presentation, however. A . federal judge in Brooklyn had agreed to extend the FDNY . application period for 24 hours - giving Sgt Meyer until the end of the day to sign up, but Sgt Meyer turned down the opportunity, expressing his disapproval of his exception. Born in Columbia, Kentucky, in 1988, Sgt Meyer enlisted in the Marines after graduating high school. He began his service in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2007 as a sniper and was later sent to Afghanistan. The White House said Meyer is the third . living recipient of the military decoration since the Vietnam war. He is the first Marine so honoured with the medal.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . PUBLISHED: . 11:48 EST, 20 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:49 EST, 20 March 2012 . A Ferrari that made world headlines after being infamously written off by an FBI agent has sold for more than $370,000 (£230,000). The once-pristine F50 was stolen from a dealer in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, in 2003 and only discovered five years later. But the owner's relief turned to rage when one of the federal officers looking after the vehicle took it for a spin and smashed it into a hedge before its return. Oops! The Ferrari F50 was crashed into a hedge by an FBI agent in 2008 while he was looking after the vehicle during a probe into its theft five years earlier . Written off: The crash tore a huge hole in the left-hand side of the supercar. The damage came to a eye-watering $750,000 . Its chequered history didn't deter buyers, however, as a bidding frenzy erupted on US salvage website Copart. The auction site was managing the sale for an insurance company following a complicated legal dispute with the US Justice Department. It eventually sold for $370,000 (£233,000) after costs - with the buyer now expected to spend a further fortune painstakingly restoring it to its former glory. The 1995 model's complicated history began in . 2003 when pilot and criminal Tom Baker entered a Philadelphia Ferrari . showroom requesting a test-drive. Ouch! The car shows severe damage to the front axle as its towed away from the scene . On the mend: The new owner who bought the car for $370,00 is now expected to spend another vast sum to get it fully restored . The 1995 model of the Ferrari F50 is one of just 349 ever built and was the fastest car to ever come out of the Italian company's factory when it was launched. With a 4.7-litre V12 engine developing 513bhp, it could accelerate from 0-60mph in 3.7 seconds - when in full working order (like this one above). It could reach a top speed of 202mph. Famous owners include Rod Stewart. During the test, the salesman got out of the Ferrari - giving Baker the opportunity to accelerate away in the Italian car. It was thought the Ferrari, being one of just 50 in the USA, would be shipped off to another country and into the hands of a wealthy motorist's collection. So the insurance company paid out on the vehicle - only for Baker to have stored it in an aircraft hangar alongside two other stolen Ferraris in Kentucky. He sold the supercar in 2008 to a Kentucky doctor for $375,000 (£250,000) plus another Ferrari convertible. When the unsuspecting buyer went to register his ownership with Ferrari in Italy, he was shocked to find it was the now legendary stolen F50. He called the cops and the FBI arrived the next day to take car away. However, while transporting the Ferrari from one warehouse to another, Agent Fred Kingston lost control and crashed it in Lexington, Kentucky. The insurance company, which had paid out £400,000 when it was stolen, demanded the Department of Justice pay ($750,000) £475,000 for the vehicle. But they refused, claiming the accident occurred 'while the Ferrari was being detained by the FBI' and said the bureau was granted immunity due to a controversial federal law. Baker pleaded guilty to grand theft auto and was jailed for two years.","Iconic F50 supercar was stolen from a dealer in Pennsylvania in 2003 .

"Pollard leaked classified documents to U.S. ally Israel . He was arrested by FBI in 1985 and jailed for life . Israeli leaders now pleading for ‘gravely ill’ spy’s release . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 05:07 EST, 12 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:00 EST, 12 April 2012 . Israel is putting fresh pressure on the White House to release Jonathan Pollard, an American convicted of spying for Israel 27 years ago, reopening a long-running feud with its closest and most important ally. Israeli leaders say the former civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy should be freed after a dramatic deterioration in his health. Pollard, now 57, pleaded guilty to leaking classified documents to Israel after his arrest by FBI agents in Washington in 1985. Leaking documents: Jonathan Pollard, left,  is driven away from U.S. District Court in Washington in 1986 after pleading guilty to spying on the United States. Right, the most recent picture of Pollard taken in 1998 . But Washington has rejected renewed calls for his release by issuing a statement saying that American policy on the issue has not changed, despite claims by Pollard’s wife Esther that he is suffering from a life-threatening illness. The case is fraught with issues, given the strong ties between Israel and the United States, and the delicate issue of suspected dual loyalties among American Jews. Pollard, who is Jewish, enjoys . widespread sympathy in Israel, where he was granted citizenship after he . was imprisoned, and where many believe the sentence was too harsh . despite fact that Pollard was spying on an ally. Israeli politician MK Uri Ariel, left, joins Efi Lahav, right,campaign manager for the release of Jonathan Pollard, in a jewish traditional Passover ritual in Jerusalem with a chair reserved for Pollard . On June 13, US President Barack Obama, campaigning for re-election, plans to honour Israeli President Shimon Peres by bestowing on him the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. This has roused hopes that Peres - a Nobel Peace laureate and globally respected statesman who has better ties with Obama than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - might use the occasion to press the issue. More than 24,000 Israelis have joined a Facebook page urging Peres to miss the event if Pollard is not freed. US President Barack Obama, right, plans to honour Israeli President Shimon Peres, left, in June with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, giving Peres the opportunity to press the issue of Pollard's release . Netanyahu, who made a private visit to Pollard in prison a decade ago, has repeatedly raised the issue in meetings with Obama. With Passover currently being celebrated by the Jewish people, Netanyahu said earlier this week that the time had come to release Pollard. 'We must let him finish his life in dignity,' he said. Ronit Tirosh, an Israeli lawmaker who heads a parliamentary caucus pressing for Pollard's release, said that with time running out, Israel has to be vocal in its appeals, even if it upsets its American allies. ‘He's so sick, and so many years have passed, we have nothing to lose,’ she said. She described Peres' appeal as ‘the last card we have’ with the Americans. US President Bill Clinton, left, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, right, at the White House in 1998. Netanyahu demanded the release of Jonathan Pollard, which Clinton denied . Tirosh and many other Israelis argue that the punishment has been excessive, and that many other Americans convicted in espionage have served lesser sentences. Netanyahu himself attempted to link the Pollard issue to peacemaking during his first term as prime minister, pressing for Pollard's release as part of a 1998 interim deal with the Palestinians. President Bill Clinton, who was hugely popular in Israel, rejected the request after fierce opposition from U.S. intelligence officials. Even after more than a quarter of a century, many details of the case remain a mystery. Pollard delivered hordes of documents to his handlers, but the full extent of what was released has never been revealed. Darshan-Leitner, Pollard's lawyer, said the information was material that had traditionally been shared with the Israelis. She said the information had included details about Arab and Soviet military capabilities, and had helped Israel carry out the assassination of a senior PLO official in Tunisia in 1988. Much of the American military and intelligence community remains opposed to releasing Pollard. But this opposition has begun to crack, raising hopes that a breakthrough may finally be near. Former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Schultz, Lawrence Korb, the assistant secretary of defense at the time, former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, Sen. John McCain and former Vice President Dan Quayle have all called for Pollard's release in recent years.","Pollard leaked classified documents to U.S. ally Israel .

"By . Peter Simpson In Beijing . PUBLISHED: . 04:47 EST, 27 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:32 EST, 27 March 2012 . Conspiracy: China has been urged to probe speculation that Neil Heywood was poisoned . The Foreign Office has asked China to probe the sudden death of a Briton who had close links to a controversial high-ranking Communist Party official. Neil Heywood, 41, died last November and Chinese officials claimed his death was caused by excessive drinking. But his concerned friends and other members of the British community in the south western metropolis of Chongqing fear he may have been deliberately poisoned. 'Members of the expat community became suspicious about Mr Heywood’s death in Chongqing and contacted British consular staff. 'There were also numerous rumours, and because of the concern and repeated speculation, we recently asked the Chinese authorities to look into the case,' a Foreign Office spokesman told the Daily Mail. Mr Heywood was described today by 'shocked' acquaintances as a near tee totaller and in good health. Mr Heywood had a strong business relationship with Chongqing party secretary Bo Xilai and his family for over a decade. Mr Bo was a rising political star tipped for a leadership place - but he was sensationally purged earlier this month in a scandal that has shaken the ruling Communist Party. Mr Heywood, whose official Chinese medical records claim he died from 'excessive alcohol consumption', also had a business relationship with Mr Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai. Believed to have been married to Chinese national, Mr Heywood was cremated in Chongqing. Accusations: Bo Xilai, centre, is said to have used his anti-corruption campaign to attack business rivals of his wife Gu Kailai, left . His family and British consular staff said at the time they were satisfied with the Chinese coroner’s initial findings. But countless rumours and speculation, fuelled by Chinese online whistle blowers, claimed his death is linked to his professional relationship with the Bo family. Mr Bo was purged two weeks ago, reportedly for trying to stop a criminal investigation involving his wife - a probe ordered by his former police chief and right hand man, Wang Lijun. Together, Mr Bo and Mr Wang became . popular for a mafia-busting crusade to clean up the Chongqing . city-municipality - which has a population of 32 million - of corrupt . officials and business chiefs colluding with gangsters. But . Mr Wang fled to the U.S. consulate in nearby Chengdu in early February . after Mr Bo reacted angrily to his investigation involving his wife, it . has since been claimed. Favours: Mr Heywood is said to have helped the Bos' secure top British public school berths for their son, Bo Guagua, centre . Access: Mr Bo's son Bi Guagua, seen here on the right with action movie star Jackie Chan, left, won places at Harrow and Oxford . Prestigious: Mr Heywood's exact involvement in getting Bo Guagua, centre, into the top education institutions has not yet been confirmed . Dismissed Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai had built a national reputation as a crusader against organised crime and corruption among China's elite. But now a very different picture of his mafia-busting initiative — called da hei, or smash black —  is emerging, since Mr. Bo was fired last month after a scandal involving his police chief Wang Lijun. Critics called his clampdown, launched in 2009, the 'red terror', saying state security apparatus were allowed to act with impunity: framing victims, extracting confessions through torture, extorting business empires and visiting retribution on Mr Bo's  political rivals. Cheng Li, an analyst of the Chinese leadership at the Brookings Institution, told the New York Times: ‘Even by Chinese Communist Party standards, this is unacceptable.’ He added: ‘This is red terror.’ In 10 months, 4,781 people were arrested, including business executives, police officers, judges, legislators and others accused of running or protecting criminal syndicates, according to the New York Times. Chongqing’s top justice official was even found to have buried $3 million under a fish pond, during the crackdown. He became one of 13 da hei defendants to be executed. But Mr Bo's spectacular fall from grace was sparked when his enforcer, police chief Wang Lijun last month sought refuge in a United States consulate. He apparently feared for his safety after telling Mr Bo that his family was linked to an inquiry into the death of a British citizen, Neil Heywood, who was an acquaintance of Mr Bo’s family. Mr Wang asked U.S. diplomats for asylum but was coaxed out of the consulate after 12 hours by Chinese security officials and flown under guard to Beijing where he is being held in a secure government compound. Speculation is rife that the investigation into Mr Bo’s wife, which took place shortly after Mr Heywood’s death, led to Mr Wang’s attempted flight to the U.S. His failed escape bid brought down his boss who was destined for a seat on the all powerful Politburo Standing Committee in the autumn. It is understood Mr Heywood helped arrange business meetings with Mr Bo when he was a government minister in the Ministry of Commerce in the capital, Beijing. It is also claimed Mr Heywood helped the Bos’ secure top British public school berths for their son, Bo Guagua, who studied at Harrow and Oxford, though this cannot be confirmed. Mr Bo is the 'princeling' son of a celebrated communist revolutionary. His crime-busting policies and calls for a return to Chairman Mao’s socialist 'red' culture caused upset among modernisers in Beijing, with many claiming he used his anti-corruption dragnet to lock up political opponents. However, his hardline policies found support among the Chinese public who are angry at the widening rich-poor gap. Mr Wang’s dash to the U.S. embassy caused extreme embarrassment for Beijing, however - more so as the Party was preparing to stage its annual National People’s Congress ahead of the once in a decade change of leadership, which takes place later in the autumn. Last week, reports of an attempted coup inside the secure government compound in Beijing made headlines, with claims that Mr Bo’s supporters - among them nationalistic PLA generals - were battling it out with Party modernisers, including Chinese president in waiting, Xi Jinping, who moved to sack him. 'I am not aware of this case,' a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing said. Power: Chinese paramilitary police patrol the grounds of the Communist Party provincial head office in Chongqing which was the office of Bo Xilai .

Rest in peace: Senior Airman Nick Alden was killed last year in Frankfurt; his two-year-old son William died Saturday . The two-year-old son of an American airman has died almost exactly a year after his father was killed by an Islamic terrorist. Two-year-old William Alden was trying to reach something at the top of a dresser in the family’s Anderson, South Carolina home when it fell and crushed him. The boy's father was Senior Airman Nick Alden of Williamston, who was killed in March 2011 outside an airport in Frankfurt, Germany, by Arid Uka - a Kosovan Albanian who shouted 'God is great' as he fired a handgun into the bus carrying Alden and other troops. The family was preparing to leave for vacation when the boy died – the first time they would have gone on holiday since Alden was killed. Don McCown, the deputy coroner for Anderson County, says William was trying to reach something on top of the dresser when it fell on him Saturday. He told the Associated Press that the boy lived at the home with his mother, Patricia Brooks Alden, and his five-year-old sister. William died of asphyxiation, Mr MrCown said. Sgt David Creamer told the Anderson Independent Mail: ‘This poor lady has suffered so much, it’s unbearable. I do hate it for her.’ He said authorities had ruled the boy’s death an accident after performing a recreation, and no one will be charged. ‘My heart goes out to the family,’ he said. ‘It is so sad, there’s not much else to say.’ Hero: Father-of-two Nick Alden is thought to have died while trying to stop the gunman from killing any of his comrades on the bus after he witnessed him shooting the driver .

Uka confessed he was targeting the U.S. military when he opened fire on a U.S. military bus at the airport. Eyewitnesses to the attack said he yelled out Islamist slogans before firing the weapon. The Kosovo Albanian who admitted killing two U.S. airmen at Frankfurt airport said he carried out the attack after watching a clip of a Muslim woman being raped by American soldiers, which he mistakenly thought was real.

Students have been upset over a new plan that involves the formation of a nonprofit foundation which would offer core courses for about $600 each, or about $200 per unit - about four times the current price. The program is designed to cope with rising student demand as state funds dwindle. The move has raised questions about whether it would create two tiers of students in a system designed to make education accessible to everyone and whether it's even legal under state education law. Community colleges statewide have lost $809million in state funding over the past three years, causing schools to turn away about 200,000 students and drastically cut the number of classes offered.

The headteacher of a school for excluded pupils repeatedly punched a colleague in a drunken row outside a train station, a court heard today. Katrina Mann, 48, was seen ‘kissing and embracing’ fellow teacher Darren McCarthy, 38, before their late-night clash at Barking station, Essex. Witnesses called the police as the couple shouted and swore at each other at 11.45pm, Havering Magistrates’ Court heard. Unacceptable: Katrina Mann, left, the headteacher at Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre, repeatedly punched fellow teacher Darren McCarthy, right, during a drunken row outside a train station . Mann, the headteacher of Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre, McCarthy yelled at officers, screaming ‘why are you f***ing stopping me’. Mann then told McCarthy to ‘shut the f*** up, you p****, don’t say anything - you’re coming home with me.’ She added that she was ‘the head of a centre for excluded children and you don’t know what it’s like dealing with their behaviour.’ Roy Baxendall, the presiding magistrate, said today: ‘The behaviour that went on was totally unacceptable, particularly in the light of the jobs you do and the vulnerable people you are dealing with. ‘You completely lost it and completely showed yourselves up. Had your mitigation not been so strongly put you would each be facing very serious levels of fines.’ CCTV images showed the pair in the train station, where McCarthy was seen standing with his hands outstretched and shouting before aiming a blow towards Mann’s head. Drunken night: Ms Mann was seen 'kissing and embracing' Mr McCarthy before their late-night clash at Barking station, Essex, pictured . Both were then seen punching each other in the head, prompting a second member of the public to call the police. Officers arrived to find McCarthy ‘shouting and aggressive,’ claiming they were only stopping him because he was a ‘n*****.’ More blows were exchanged between the pair, Mann punching McCarthy three times before they were arrested on suspicion of drunk and disorderly behaviour. At the station, Mann said they had been drinking Stella lager at the nearby Barking Dog pub since 5.30pm and she had been too drunk to remember leaving or what had happened next. She added that she saw McCarthy as a ‘work colleague.’ He said he was not drunk and had been angry with police, who he felt had been racist and made him miss the last train home to Walthamstow, east London. The pair, who have been suspended from their jobs at Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre, denied charges of being drunk and disorderly in a public place and using threatening words and behaviour. Heavy night: The teachers had been drinking Stella lager at the Barking Dog pub, pictured, before their bust-up . But they admitted lesser charges of using disorderly words and behaviour before a planned trial this morning. They were each handed a conditional discharge for 12 months and ordered to pay £85 court costs. Donal Lawler, defending Mann, said the mother-of-four had been upset because her daughter's then-partner had assaulted her daughter. He was due to be sentenced on domestic abuse charges at Redbridge Magistrates’ Court today. Mr Lawler added: ‘Miss Mann has already paid a very high price for this because she is currently suspended from her job. ‘She is a lead teacher at a pupil referral centre that pupils are sent to when they are excluded from other schools. ‘It is the most problematic and the most challenging pupils. It is a very, very challenging job and one she does well - the school has had very good Ofsted reports.’ Andrew Lock, defending McCarthy, said the father-of-two was still angry with police about how he had been treated. The pair refused to comment about the incident, but a friend of theirs said: . ‘It’s all been blown out of proportion and as a result the school is having to operate without two dedicated members of staff.’ The Barking and Dagenham Tuition Centre has been praised by Ofsted for being ‘extremely successful’ at getting previously disaffected students back into education. The vast majority of its 226 11- to 16 year-olds have histories of poor attendance at mainstream schools. All have special educational needs, including social, emotional and behavioural difficulties. The centre also offers the borough’s nine secondary schools respite places for pupils at risk of permanent exclusion. A spokesman for Barking and Dagenham council said: ‘Ms Mann and Mr McCarthy are both on special leave pending court appearances and disciplinary investigation.’ Mann, of Hornchurch, Essex, and McCarthy, of Walthamstow, east London, admitted using disorderly words and behaviour during the incident on January 26.","Katrina Mann was seen ‘kissing and embracing’ fellow teacher Darren McCarthy before their late-night clash .

Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks was questioned by police today about payments to Ministry of Defence officials. Mrs Brooks, a former editor of The Sun, is understood to have been asked about evidence handed over by News Corporation's Management and Standards Committee. The 41-year-old was first arrested by detectives in July on suspicion of phone hacking and corruption, days after she quit News International. Hacking probe: Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie were among six people held in the phone-hacking arrests last week . She answered bail today after being rearrested last week with her racehorse trainer husband Charlie on suspicion of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Police searched several addresses in Oxfordshire, London, Hampshire and Hertfordshire after the couple were held along with four other suspects. Her lawyer, Stephen Parkinson, recently said evidence given by Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers at the Leveson Inquiry had brought 'much prejudicial material' into the public domain. Mrs Brooks' relations with top police officers and politicians have been called into question in recent weeks after it emerged that she 'fostered' a police horse when it retired from active service in 2008. She paid food and vet bills until the animal, called Raisa, was rehoused with a police officer in 2010, months before fresh investigations began into illegal activities at the News of the World. The number of people arrested in Operation Weeting, which has been running since last January when police reopened investigations, stands at 22 . A total of 22 people have been arrested under Weeting, which has been running since January last year, Scotland Yard said. Born on May 27 1968, Ms Brooks grew up in Warrington, Cheshire, before heading off to Paris for a stint studying at the Sorbonne. Returning to her home county, she landed a job as a secretary at Eddie Shah's Messenger Group and soon persuaded those in charge to let her loose reporting. She then got a job working on the News of the World's Sunday magazine. Her passion for News International was ignited and she remained at the Rupert Murdoch stable.

While there have been reports of TSA agents stealing valuable items from travellers bags, it was one agent's extra-curricular activity that got him arrested on Wednesday. Bryant Jermaine Livingston, 39, was arrested during his shift at Washington, D.C.'s Dulles airport for his alleged involvement with a prostitution ring. Court documents say that he was the mastermind behind a group sex tryst that took place in a Maryland hotel room the day after Valentine's Day. Arrested: Bryant Livingston, 39, was charged with five counts relating to prostitution after he was caught organizing a group sex event on February 15 . The manager of the Silver Spring Crowne Plaza Hotel became suspicious when Livingston repeatedly came down to the lobby- as he was the only one with key card access to the elevator- to get groups of men who were waiting there. This raised a red flag for the manager because she recognized Livingston from prior visits to the hotel and 'because this behavior is not typical of Crowne Plaza Hotel guests,' according to the affidavit. The manager then called police to report suspected prostitution activity, and they escorted to the room Livingston had rented out. When he opened it, he denied that prostitution was taking place and invited officers inside.Instead, he said that he had posted an ad on Craigslist for a swingers party. There, they found 11 people including 'three naked females and four males attempting to get dressed'. 'Multiple people were laying on the two beds, and other people were sitting in chairs and standing in the room,' the report states. Work: Since 2002, Livingston had worked for the TSA at Dulles International Airport just outside of Washington, D.C. Upon questioning, one of the men said that he paid Livingston $100 to participate in the tryst. Though he was promptly fired and denies the charges, it is not the first time that Livingston, who worked for the TSA since 2002, has received a prostitution-related complaint. It is not clear whether any charges were filed following the 2009 incident, but a TSA official told police that the 'very similar' complaint 'alleged that Livingston was operating a prostitution ring and charging individuals $25 for sexual acts'. Again, Livingston denies any wrongdoing, saying that the TSA is out to get him and he plans to file a racial discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Unusual behavior: A manager at the Silver Springs Crowne Plaza Hotel called police because she suspected something when Livingston kept going down to the lobby to collect waiting men . The TSA said in a statement that they were cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation. 'The allegations against this individual are unacceptable and in no way reflect the integrity and professionalism of the more than 50,000 security officers who strive every day to ensure the security of the traveling public,' they said in the statement. Regardless of his plans, Livingston stands charged with five counts relating to prostitution and is due to appear in court on May 8.","Bryant Livingston, 39, initially told police he posted an ad on Craigslist and it was a swingers event ."

A newly-released investigative report has found that George Zimmerman passed two lie detector tests given to him on the night Trayvon Martin was shot dead, backing up his version of the events. An hour-long interrogation video released this week captured Zimmerman as he described the events leading up to the moment when Trayvon Martin was shot with a single bullet to the chest. As he spoke, his voice levels were being measured with a Computer Voice Stress Analyzer (CVSA), and was found to be telling the truth. Scroll down for video . Interrogation: Zimmerman is questioned by a police detective on the day after the Trayvon Martin shooting . Probe: Zimmerman gestures in an interrogation video released this week along with new evidence that indicates he passes two lie detector tests after the shooting . However, the results of such tests are usually not admissible in court. Sanford detective Chris Serino said . Zimmerman verbally confronted the unarmed 17-year-old before the . physical brawl that ended when Zimmerman shot and killed Martin. Zimmerman claimed he was acting in self-defence when he shot the teen, who was returning to his father's girlfriend's house from a 7-Eleven store with an iced tea for himself and Skittles for his little brother on the night of the NBA All-Star Game. A second report that was also released today said Zimmerman would have been able to defuse the confrontation if he would have identified himself as a neighborhood . watch captain. The two got into a fistfight and the 28-year-old Zimmerman maintains that Martin attacked him and was beating him up before he fatally shot him. Questions: Zimmerman, pictured in court in April, will next appear at a bond hearing set for June 29 . He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Serino wrote in his report that . Zimmerman and witnesses said the defendant who was in his car avoided . Martin when he first saw him because, as he told investigators, 'was . afraid of Martin.' Serino also said that later in the encounter, Zimmerman got out of his SUV and followed Martin. 'His actions are inconsistent of those of a person who has stated he was in fear of another subject,' Serino wrote. Based on his investigation, Serino recommended a charge of manslaughter to the state attorney. Today, it emerged that Serino, the lead detective in the case, has been reassigned to the patrol division at his request. A Sanford Police Department statement said Serino made the reassignment decision 'of his own volition.' He will begin his new assignment in July. He did not have a listed number.

An interrogation video also released . this week shows Zimmerman being questioned about the shooting by . detectives from the Sanford Police Department. In video released last week by his attorney, Zimmerman told investigators his side of the story about the shooting. He told them he grabbed his gun from a . holster on his waist before Martin could get it, and shot the teenager . once in the chest. After firing, Zimmerman said thought he missed because Martin didn't immediately fall over. Zimmerman said Martin had been on top of him, slamming his head against the ground and smothering his mouth and nose with his hand and arm. The tape shows two butterfly bandages on the back of Zimmerman's head and another on his nose. There are red marks on the front of his head. Before attack: Surveillance footage shows Martin at a local 7-Eleven store where he went to buy a snack . Last sighting: He is seen buying a bag of Skittles and a can of iced tea, and pays the cashier . 'It felt like my head was going to explode,' he says in the video. Zimmerman claims he shot the teen in self-defense, under Florida's 'stand your ground' law. Martin's parents have said Zimmerman was the aggressor. They said Martin was walking back from a convenience store through the gated community in Sanford when Zimmerman spotted the black teenager and started following him. They claim their son was racially profiled. Zimmerman's father is white and his mother Hispanic. The latest release of documents in the case have come on the heels of unflattering telephone calls capturing Zimmerman and his wife talking in code about using money collected for a defense fund to pay credit cards. Fears: The documents come about a week after the release of Tracy Martin's heartbreaking call to police to report his son missing.

Obsessed Margaret Harvey, 73, blamed Julia Bridgewater for causing the death of her husband Graham in 2004 despite the fact that it happened two years before she got the job. Harvey would plague Mrs Bridgewater with late night phone calls, turn up outside her home and even hired a private detective in her bid to track down her Bridgewater’s whereabouts. Stalking widow Margaret Harvey holds a photo of her dead husband Graham refusing to apologise for her behaviour and adamant that his death is the fault of Julia Bridgewater . Harvey said after the hearing at North Staffordshire Magistrates Court that she did not regret her actions and refused to apologise. She said: ‘Mrs Bridgewater doesn’t answer my questions. I didn’t feel like I had any other options than to hire a detective.’ Lisa Newman, prosecuting told the court how Mrs Harvey had continued to pester Mrs Bridgewater even after a court letter was sent to her asking her to stop.

Lisa Newman said: ‘Harvey told the police about the death of her husband and said she felt the only person who could answer questions, despite the inquiries being held, was Mrs Bridgewater. ‘She admitted contacting her on numerous occasions.’ Harvey’s complaint against the hospital dates back to 2004 when her husband Graham died from a heart attack. Shaun Kellett, defending, said Harvey could not accept the hospital was not to blame for her husband’s death. He said: ‘She alleges that the hospital was negligent and she has pursued the matter for eight years. ‘She is seeking some answers and obviously can’t accept the answer she has been given.’ Harvey was released on bail and was ordered to return to court next month for sentencing. After the hearing, Harvey vowed to continue to pursue the hospital for answers. She said: ‘I don’t regret what I did. I believe if my husband had been given proper treatment he would have had another 10 years of life or more. ‘It’s unbelievable what they have put me through. ‘ I’ve had a heart attack, I’ve been put in handcuffs and been in prison at 3am. ‘I want answers about why he wasn’t treated earlier. I want the hospital to admit the care was not good enough and I want the people responsible held to account. ‘I’m not interested in money, I want justice for Graham. ‘I have been fighting for eight years now.

A man murdered the mother of his children and then took his toddler son to the police station to confess to the killing. Joaquim Marrafa had his two-year-old son in a pushchair when he told officers he wanted to report a crime - and then demonstrated how he had strangled girlfriend Sandra Maralhas. Marrafa denied murder and tried to claim his actions were the result of mental impairment. However a jury did not believe his version of events and unanimously convicted Marrafa of murder. A judge at Reading Crown Court told him he must serve at least 14 years of a life sentence for throttling mother-of-six Maralhas. Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Dave Hubbard, said: 'Sandra Maralhas was the mother of six children, aged between one and 20, who have been left devastated, confused, shocked, and heartbroken by her death. 'Even though Marrafa admitted he had killed her, he refused to plead guilty and put her son and others through the ordeal of giving evidence in court. 'I am pleased with the verdict and sentence handed down today, which reflects the fact Marrafa has shown no remorse for his terrible crime.' Jurors were told the victim had left home because of emotional abuse and physical violence but that she had continued to see her unemployed killer - to pay him some of the benefit money she received for their children. She had also had an abortion just four days before she died but she had kept that and the fact that she was pregnant from Marrafa. The 46-year-old defendant told startled police he had left his girlfriend's body in the bedroom of the home he had once shared with her. He also confided with them that he had not called an ambulance and nor did he know if she were alive or dead. Just hours before her death Marrafa had left a doctor's surgery with his former partner where he had been prescribed medication after complaining of being depressed. Floral tributes: Flowers left outside the house where Sandra Maralhas was found . When police forced their way into the flat in Coronation Square, Reading, Berkshire, they found the body of 38-year-old Ms Maralhas slumped at the foot of the bed and although police and paramedics tried to revive her, there were unable to. A post mortem examination showed that she had been strangled and that her killer could have had his hands tightly around her neck for as long as three minutes. The couple had met in 1998 in their native Portugal when Ms Maralhas already had three children from a previous relationship. They moved to the UK in 1999, initially living with Ms Maralhas' sister Rute. Ms Maralhas worked as a cleaner and later at a newsagent, and although Marrafa had found work in the building trade he was unemployed at the time of his partner's death. A psychiatrist acting for Marrafa's defence team has said that he was suffering from a depressive disorder which caused an abnormality of his mental function, which would reduce his responsibility for the killing.","Joaquim Marrafa had his son, 2, in a pushchair when he showed police how he throttled girlfriend .

Fight for justice: A Metropolitan Police team is to fly to Libya to continue the investigation into the murder of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher 28 years after her death . The killer of police officer Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984 was never convicted, but now 28 years on there are fresh hopes that her family may finally see justice. A Metropolitan Police team is to fly to Libya to continue the investigation into the murder of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher. David Cameron said the visit was a 'really positive step forward' in the inquiry into the 1984 killing of the officer, who was shot dead as she policed an anti-Gaddafi demonstration outside the Libyan Embassy in London. Her killing triggered an 11 day police siege of the embassy in St James's Square and the UK cut all diplomatic ties with the Middle East nation. Ms Fletcher's mother Queenie, father Tim and sister Sarah Parsons have been hoping to see justice for their daughter ever since. In 2009 the family and friends of Yvonne gathered at a memorial in her honour at St James's square, the spot where she was killed, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death. Mr Cameron made the announcement as the north African state's interim Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib visited 10 Downing Street. Mr El-Keib promised that his country would 'work very closely together' with the UK to resolve outstanding questions about the killing of the 25-year-old Wpc Fletcher, who was part of a team of 30 officers sent to St. James's Square to keep the peace during a demonstration by Libyan dissidents opposed to the rule of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. It is believed she was hit by a shot fired from within the People's Bureau. Mr El-Keib worked with the opposition while in exile during Muammar Gaddafi's dictatorship, and said he knew some of those involved in the demonstration. He told Mr Cameron: 'The Fletcher case is a case that is close to my heart personally. I had friends who were demonstrating that day next to the embassy.' 'It is a sad story. It is very unfortunate that it has anything to do with the Libyan people. Changing Times: David Cameron said allowing British police to fly to Libya investigate Wpc Fletcher's killing was a really positive step. Diplomatic relations were cut with Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi, right, following the incident in 1984 . 'I am here to tell you that we will work very closely together to resolve anything related to that issue.' Hopes of finding the killer of Wpc Fletcher were first raised following the revolution which toppled the dictator last year. But so far, plans to send a police team to Libya had been frustrated by a failure to secure approval from local authorities. Officers from New Scotland Yard and Home Office Minister James Brokenshire met Mr El-Keib today to discuss the Fletcher case.Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism . Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism said he was determined to get justice for Ms Fletcher. He added: 'We have never lost our resolve to solve this murder and achieve justice for Yvonne's family. We see today's announcement as significant.' Detectives remain in regular contact with Wpc Fletcher's family and update them on developments. Mr El-Keib said Libya wanted to be 'long-term friends and partners' with Britain, and paid tribute to the role which the UK played in the international military mission to protect civilians from Gaddafi's forces during last year's uprising. Tragic: The killing of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher sparked an 11 day police siege of the Libyan embassy in St James's Square . Addressing Mr Cameron he said: 'You took a bold decision when it was very difficult for many to even consider supporting the Libyan people. You took that decision which inspired many of us.' Mr Cameron said: 'I am very proud of the role that Britain played to help secure a successful outcome in Libya and the support we gave through the Nato mission. 'I am very much looking forward to hearing about the progress towards a full democracy in Libya and the elections which you hope to hold before Ramadan this year.' Mr El-Keib was appointed interim prime minister of Libya in October last year. Elections for a national assembly for Libya are expected in June or July, though no date has yet been set. Mr Cameron and Mr El-Keib were also thought to be discussing the reconstruction of the country following last year's revolution. And just days after the death of the only person convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, they may also discuss whether any further evidence relating to the atrocity has emerged in the wake of the downfall of the Gaddafi regime. Mr El-Keib spent much of his life working abroad as an academic and businessman in the United States and UAE, and played no part in Gaddafi's administration.","Cameron in talks with interim Libyan Prime Minister .

Our ancestors may have ended up on two legs rather than four simply because it meant they could carry more food. This helped to ensure their survival when resources were scarce, say scientists. Anthropologists studying chimpanzees found the great apes walk upright and free their hands for carrying when they need to monopolise hard-to-find food. Chimpanzees - our closest relative - usually walk on four feet, but rise to two feet when fighting for food, leading researchers to speculate that our ancestors could have evolved the stance to steal food . They can grab more with a single swipe in the face of fierce competition from other apes. The team from the University of Cambridge and Japan’s Kyoto University believe the benefit of ‘first-come, first-served’ and getting a bigger share of scarce food supplies could, over a long period of time, have led some of our earliest ‘hominin’ ancestors to evolve into bipedal primates – walking on two legs permanently instead of four. Professor William McGrew, of Cambridge’s department of archaeology and anthropology, said: ‘Bipedality as the key human adaptation may be an evolutionary product of this strategy over time. 'Ultimately, it set our ancestors on a separate evolutionary path.’ A sculptor's rendering of the hominid Australopithecus afarensis: The creature is thought to have been one of man's earliest ancestors to walk upright on two feet - and may have evolved the trait to hold on to food . The research, published in the journal Current Biology, suggests our earliest hominin ancestors may have lived in shifting environmental conditions where certain resources were not easy to come by. The scientists conducted two studies of chimpanzees in Bossou Forest in Guinea, west Africa, finding that when supplies of highly prized coula nuts were scarce, the chimps were more likely to walk on two feet in an attempt to carry off more in a single trip. They also found that when the chimpanzees went crop raiding, 35 per cent of their activity involved some sort of bipedal movement, and ‘once again, this behaviour appeared to be linked to a clear attempt to carry as much as possible in one go’. By studying the behaviour of chimpanzees, they believe that over time, intense bursts of bipedal activity in early hominins may have led to anatomical changes that in turn became the subject of natural selection where competition for food or other resources was strong.","Chimps run on two feet when fighting off competition .

Devastating nuclear reactor meltdowns like those at Chernobyl and Fukushima could happen every decade, according to a disturbing new study. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, fear similar catastrophes could occur around the world every ten to 20 years - 200 times more frequently than previously thought. And they said people in Western Europe have a higher risk than anybody else in the world of being affected by radioactive fallout from such a disaster. Warning: Devastating nuclear reactor meltdowns like those at Fukushima (pictured) could happen every ten to 20 years, according to a worrying new study . The researchers based their gloomy predictions on the operating hours of all civil nuclear reactors and how many meltdowns there have been. They also warned that half the radioactive caesium-137 produced, which was released following the Chernobyl and Fukushima meltdowns, would spread over an area reaching as far as 1,000 kilometres (about 620 miles) from the reactor. Western Europe is likely to be contaminated once every 50 years, according to the research team led by Jos Lelieveld, director of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. The International Atomic Energy Agency designates an area as 'contaminated' if it has a reading of more than 40 kilobecquerels of caesium-137 per square metre. Prof Lelieveld said Germany needed to carry out an 'in-depth and public analysis of the actual risks of nuclear accidents'. Global risk: The map shows the annual probability in per cent of radioactive contamination by more than 40 kilobecquerels per square metre . And he added: 'In light of our findings I believe an internationally coordinated phasing out of nuclear energy should also be considered.' Accidents at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania, in 1979 and Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 made nuclear power a politically toxic issue. Radioactive contamination spread across much of Europe following the meltdown at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant. The meltdown at Japan's Fukushima plant following the March 2011 tsunami triggered a worldwide debate on the future of the energy source, leading to Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022. Before the crisis, Japan provided almost a third of its electricity from 54 reactors. But earlier this month it closed its last nuclear reactor on the island of Hokkaido for maintenance - leaving the country without electricity from atomic energy for the first time in more than four decades. Worldwide, there are currently 440 nuclear reactors in operation, with 60 more planned. The team in Mainz found German citizens in the densely populated southwestern part of the country run the highest risk of radioactive contamination in the world because of the numerous nuclear power plants near the borders between France, Belgium and Germany and the prevailing westerly wind. Disaster: Radioactive contamination spread across much of Europe following the meltdown at the Soviet Union's Chernobyl plant in 1986 . If a nuclear meltdown happened in Western Europe, an area with a population of around 28 million people would be contaminated, they said. This figure would be even higher in southern Asia, due to the dense populations. A major nuclear accident there would affect around 34 million people, while in the eastern USA and east Asia this would be 14 to 21 million people, said the German scientists. Prof Lelieveld, who is an atmospheric chemist, said: 'Germany's exit from the nuclear energy programme will reduce the national risk of radioactive contamination. 'However, an even stronger reduction would result if Germany's neighbours were to switch off their reactors.' Aftermath: Officials scan people for radiation, 60km (37 miles) west of the nuclear power plant in Fukushima on March 18, 2011 .","German scientists say meltdown could happen 200 times more often than previously calculated .

Tony Blair will face the Leveson Inquiry on Monday, three days before embattled Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt takes the stand, it was announced today. Calls have been growing for the former Prime Minister to answer allegations that News International had 'unique access to Downing Street' during Labour's 13 years in power. MP Tom Watson told the the probe into press ethics this week that Mr Murdoch even tried to halt his anti-phone hacking campaign by asking Tony Blair to 'call him off'. Close? Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, right, and Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation Chairman and CEO, left, speak during a news conference held in conjunction with the Atlantic Council's 2008 annual awards dinner in Washington . And last week Peter Mandelson admitted that Mr Blair and Mr Murdoch had become 'closer than was wise'. He denied, however, there was a 'Faustian pact'. Labour's former chief spin doctor Alistair Campbell also sought to douse claims there was a cosy relationship between News Corp and the party, telling the inquiry: 'I don't think on policy anything was ever traded with Rupert Murdoch or with any other media owner.' Unfazed: Jeremy Hunt put on a show of confidence this morning when he went for a jog near his London home . The inquiry will seek to uncover the degree of contact between News International and the Labour Party in the run up to the 1997 general election in which Mr Blair took power for the first time after The Sun famously switched its allegiance from the Tory Party. In one of the most crucial - and potentially explosive - weeks of the inquiry so far, Mr Hunt will on Thursday respond to damaging allegations surrounding his own links to News Corp during its controversial takeover bid of BSkyB last year. He will also be challenged over whether his cheerleading for the £8-billion bid was entirely impartial since he was bestowed quasi-judicial powers by Prime Minister David Cameron. Today, Mr Cameron defended his decision to hand responsibility to Mr Hunt, who is facing fresh calls from Labour to resign over his handling of the bid. 'I don't regret giving the job to Jeremy Hunt, it was the right thing to do in the circumstances, which were not of my making,' Mr Cameron told ITV's This Morning. 'The crucial point, the really crucial point, is did Jeremy Hunt carry out his role properly with respect to BSkyB and I believe that he did.' No date has been set for the Prime Minister's appearance at the inquiry, but he said he was 'looking forward to giving evidence', as was Mr Hunt, so 'all of this will be out in the open'. It emerged yesterday that Jeremy Hunt privately urged David Cameron to back Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB takeover bid just weeks before the Prime Minister put him in charge of ruling on the issue, it emerged last night. In a bombshell email, the Culture Secretary lavished praise on the bid. Mr Hunt said it would allow Mr Murdoch’s son James to create ‘the world’s first multi-platform media operator’ and insisted that if it was blocked the ‘media sector will suffer for years’. The Premier will now face tough questions over why he gave Mr Hunt responsibility for the bid, despite knowing that he had been privately cheerleading for the Murdochs. Critics will also question the wisdom of Mr Cameron joining Mr Murdoch and News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks for a cosy Christmas lunch just a month later where the bid was discussed. I can't wait: David Cameron said he was 'looking forward to giving evidence' so 'all of this will be out in the open' while appearing on ITV1's This Morning . Controversial: David Cameron, right, today defended his decision to put Jeremy Hunt, left, in charge of dealing with BSkyB bid after Vince Cable lost the role . Harriet Harman led the charge against Mr Hunt today telling BBC Breakfast the evidence of his wrongdoing was 'absolutely massive', arguing that instead of judging the Murdochs’ bid, he was backing it. 'There are two bits of evidence, actual straightforward evidence, that Jeremy Hunt was not impartial, he was meddling before he even took over the bid and was on the side of the Murdochs,' she said. Admission: Adam Smith revealed that Mr Murdoch's fixer 'bombarded' him with information about the media giant's bid to take over BSkyB . 'The first was that he had to be warned off by the civil servants not to have any more meetings with Rupert Murdoch but he kept up the contact through his special adviser, and secondly he wrote a memo to the Prime Minister.' The Culture Secretary’s message, revealed in evidence to the Leveson inquiry into media standards yesterday, told Mr Cameron it would be ‘totally wrong to cave in’ to critics of the bid, including BBC director-general Mark Thompson, Channel 4 and the Guardian newspaper. Mr Hunt said James Murdoch was ‘pretty furious’ that Business Secretary Vince Cable had referred the bid to media regulator Ofcom. He asked for a meeting with Mr Cameron, Mr Cable and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to discuss the handling of the deal. The disclosure appears directly to contradict Mr Hunt’s insistence to MPs last  month that he had made ‘absolutely no interventions seeking to influence a quasi-judicial decision that was at that time the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Business’. It piles pressure on both Mr Hunt and Mr Cameron in the row over the Government’s handling of the BSkyB bid, which other media organisations argued would hand the Murdoch empire an unassailable dominance in Britain. Revelations: Mr Hunt said James Murdoch, left was ‘pretty furious’ that Business Secretary Vince Cable, right, had referred the bid to media regulator Ofcom . Downing Street admitted that the then Cabinet Secretary Gus O’Donnell was not made aware of the private message when he was asked to determine weeks later whether Mr Hunt could act as an impartial judge of the deal, given his previous statements of admiration for Mr Murdoch. Challenge: Harriet Harman led the charge against Mr Hunt today telling BBC Breakfast the evidence of his wrongdoing was 'absolutely massive', arguing that instead of judging the Murdochs' bid, he was backing it . Mr Cameron handed Mr Hunt responsibility for determining the bid after Mr Cable, who had previously been in charge of the issue, was caught on tape boasting that he had ‘declared war’ on News Corporation. The Culture Secretary’s representations had already been the subject of legal warnings from his own department, according to the counsel to the Leveson inquiry, Robert Jay. He said the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s legal director had advised that although it was not illegal for him to attempt to intervene, to do so would be ‘unwise’. A picture of the cosy relationship between the Murdoch empire and the department emerged at the inquiry yesterday, with evidence that News Corp’s chief lobbyist Frederic Michel exchanged more than 1,000 phone calls, emails and texts with the Culture Secretary’s team during News Corp’s BSkyB takeover bid . Most were to and from Mr Hunt’s special adviser Adam Smith, who has already had to quit, admitting his contacts with News Corp went beyond what had been authorised by the Culture Secretary. Also giving evidence in one of the most crucial weeks of the inquiry will be Business Secretary Vince Cable, who was stripped of the role of deciding whether the bid could proceed last December after he was secretly recorded saying he had 'declared war' on Mr Murdoch. After that, Education Secretary Michael Gove and Home Secretary Theresa May will appear on Tuesday and Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke, after Mr Cable, on Wednesday.

Investigators search in the front yard of a home where the bodies of the woman and children were discovered . Grim discovery: A man in this red car was found in Cottage Grove, 80 miles away from the burned home . The woman and children were discovered early on Tuesday when Salem firefighters responded to a house fire  located in the 2800 block of Fisher Road Northeast. 'As firefighters were attending to the fire in the residence, they located the three young children and the woman and removed them from the house,' said Lieutenant Dave Okada, a spokesman for the Salem Police Department, told journalists earlier this week. 'Evidence located at the scene indicated that the victims died as a result of homicidal violence and firefighters requested the Salem Police Department respond.' A neighbour reported awaking about 5:30 am to the fire. Dan Grove told the Salem Statesman Journal that he 'saw dark, black smoke pouring out of the house. I heard people screaming and yelling. It was for real.' About five hours later, the father was found dead in a vehicle about 80 miles south of Salem, in Cottage Grove. Salem, the state capital, is about 50 miles south of Portland along Interstate 5. Firefighters who came to the house found evidence of violence, said Salem police Lt Dave Okada. An hour before that, Okada said, a driver making deliveries found the body of a sixth person on the street a quarter mile north of the house. But Okada wouldn't say whether that death was related to those in the house. 'At this point we're treating that as an entirely separate investigation,' Okada said. He said authorities were arranging for autopsies and police blocked off much of the neighbourhood. News of the investigation spread rapidly through the tight-knit community. 'I'm really sorry for them,' said Sergey Shcherbakov, who described the family as quiet. 'And I'm surprised and actually, I never expected they'd fall in this situation.' Other residents were simply shocked that their neighbourhood had become a crime scene. 'I just think it's awful,' neighbour Dan Grove said. 'He seemed like a really nice guy.' Clara King, who lives in an apartment about 50 yards from the home that burned, said she was awake in the middle of the night and heard a woman screaming, 'like she was being hurt.' Findings: Police said that the four victims died of 'homicidal violence' and did not burn to death . 'I thought it was the neighbour lady having a party or something,' said Ms King. 'I went out there to say something, but nobody was there.' Some residents spoke about the area being a rough neighbourhood. Ms King said it's not unusual to hear screams or fights in the middle of the night. One mother was appalled at the deaths of the three children. Investigators search a car in the front yard of a home where the bodies were found . 'It's morbid; it's absolutely morbid,' said Katie Guzman who lives nearby. 'My heart goes out to the kids. That's awful, she said to Wave3.Com . 'Just to imagine what they went through.' She said she had never suspected there were any problems at the home. 'You'd see mom and dad and baby out front,' she said. 'She'd be sitting on the porch... dad (was) fixing stuff in that yard. Other than that, they were quiet. 'You'd never suspect anything.' Authorities said the wife and two of the children had been shot, and an infant asphyxiated. Other neighbours were shocked too. 'We're worried because we don't know what happened inside,' said Magdiel Perez, who lives two doors down from the home that burned. On the lime-green home where the children and their mother died, black soot coated the edges of window frames earlier this week. The family was quiet and kept to themselves, said Jose Quiroz, who lives across the street. The father would frequently play with the children in the yard, and last summer, the kids splashed in a pool on the lawn, Quiroz said. There were no outward signs of conflict between the couple, he said. 'It's unbelievable that someone could hurt their own kids,' Quiroz.","Police identify man at the centre of a murder-suicide investigation in Salem, Oregon, involving five family members as 27-year-old Nikolai Lazukin .

Town bosses hope ground-breaking Noxer blocks will help clean the air by absorbing nitrogen oxide from traffic in Highgate. Town bosses hope ground-breaking Noxer blocks will help clean the air by absorbing nitrogen oxide from traffic in Highgate . Noxer paving uses sunlight and a titanium layer to trap fumes. It is being installed this May as part of Kendal Regeneration Partnership’s £345,000 revamp plans for the street. Halifax-based company Marshalls will add the inconspicuous concrete, already used in Tokyo, while builders add traditional-style street lights and new seating to spruce up Kendal’s main thoroughfare. The nine weeks of building work are expected to start in the first week of May and will see parts of Highgate go down to one lane. Kendal town councillor John McCreesh said the paving was welcomed in order to help the street, which is currently failing EU air quality standards.South Lakeland District Council could be prosecuted by the Government if air quality does not improve. Mr McCreesh, a member of SLDC’s Air Quality Monitoring Group, said although it would be difficult to measure the effect of the paving, which has been installed for the price of the traditional concrete variety, it could not hurt.

However, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says there is ‘limited evidence’ the paving makes a long-term difference to air quality. A spokesman said laying new paving was ‘not the answer to air problems’. ‘The councils should be focusing on improving cycle routes and public transport, and encouraging the public to use cars less,’ said the spokesman. Regeneration manager Joanne Golton said overall plans to revamp Highgate, funded by SLDC, Cumbria County Council, and Kendal Town Council, would help bring the street up to the standard of the recently-updated Kirkland area.

Jeremy Hunt's former special adviser was told his job was safe hours before being ordered to fall on his sword after damaging emails between the Government and the Murdoch empire were revealed. Adam Smith said the Culture Secretary had assured him over evening drinks that the aide was only doing his job that he should not worry. But the following day Mr Hunt spent the morning in meetings before calling his assistant in and telling him 'everyone thinks you need to go', Mr Smith said. Fallen: Adam Smith told the inquiry that Mr Hunt told him to quit after highly damaging emails revealing the close relationship between his department and the Murdoch empire were released . After the emails were published, Mr Smith told the Culture Secretary that if the pressure became so great that it would help if he resigned he would 'not hesitate to do so'. He said he could not remember verbatim what Mr Hunt had said in response. ""It was something along the line ""It won't come to that"",' he added. Mr Smith told his boss the emails were one-sided and 'in many cases exaggerated' and Mr Hunt accepted the explanation. The pair then went for a drink with other special advisers in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and he was told not to worry. The Leveson Inquiry also heard that Mr Smith told a News Corporation lobbyist that the media giant's BSkyB takeover bid would go ahead once plans to make Sky News a separate company were signed off. But Mr Smith said he did not remember telling Fred Michel it would be 'game over' for opponents of the buyout after the proposal to make the news channel a separately listed company was announced. Unfazed: Jeremy Hunt put on a show of confidence this morning when he went for a jog near his London home . He did, though, admit that he had been 'too flippant' in the text messages and email exchanges with Mr Michel. He said: 'In hindsight, the tone of the language that I used was not appropriate. 'But I think, in terms of the content, what I said to Mr Michel had either been expressed to Mr Murdoch through meetings and letters, or was known to Mr Michel from the correspondence they were having with Ofcom and the OFT.' During the bidding process, other media groups criticised News Corp's intention to buy the 61 per cent share of BSkyB it did not already own, alleging it would concentrate too much power in Rupert Murdoch's hands. Mr Michel, News Corp's former director of public affairs in Europe, sent an email to fellow executives on January 23 last year based on a conversation with Mr Smith. He wrote: 'His (Mr Hunt's) view is that once he announces publicly he has a strong UIL (undertaking in lieu, namely the Sky News spin-off plans), it's almost game over for the opposition.' Mr Smith, who quit as Mr Hunt's special adviser last month after admitting he got too close to Mr Michel, said much of the lobbyist's email was factually accurate but disputed its tone. He told the inquiry: 'I think that that's a sort of colourful explanation of the process. 'If you have an undertaking in lieu that Ofcom (the broadcasting regulator) and the OFT (Office of Fair Trading) say satisfied the plurality concerns that Ofcom had identified, then the whole point of that is that then there are no plurality concerns. So the deal would go ahead. 'I don't remember saying 'game over for the opposition', but I can imagine we had a conversation along those lines about the process and talking around what happens.' Mr Michel's email said Mr Hunt was 'keen to get to the same outcome' as News Corp. Controversial: David Cameron, right, today defended his decision to put Jeremy Hunt, left, in charge of dealing with BSkyB bid after Vince Cable lost the role . But Mr Smith disputed this: 'I wouldn't have said that ... They didn't have the same outcome. Mr Hunt's aim was to follow the process, whereas I'm sure Mr Murdoch's aim was to acquire the remaining shares.' Robert Jay QC, counsel to the Leveson Inquiry, suggested: 'The wider objective was the same outcome, namely the securing of the bid for News Corp, because he thought in policy terms that was desirable.' But Mr Smith insisted: 'That wasn't his objective. Now his objective is to carry out his legal and statutory duties.' The Leveson Inquiry today released 67 texts sent between the two men from June 21 2010 until July 3 2011, the period when News Corp was seeking to take over satellite broadcaster BSkyB. Jeremy Hunt addressed a senior News Corporation lobbyist as 'daddy' and 'mon ami' in dozens of jokey and intimate text messages sent at all hours of day and night. Fred Michel responded with flattering comments about the Culture Secretary’s 'stamina' and 'great' performances in TV interviews and the Commons. Mr Hunt also assured Mr Michel, then European director of public affairs for Rupert Murdoch’s media empire, there was 'nothing u won’t like' in an upcoming speech. Making plans for a meeting in Davos, where politicians and business leaders gathered in January 2011, Nick Clegg's aide Lena Pietsch said Nick Clegg would be at a reception hosted by the Duke of York. Mr Michel responded: ""Most people of power and influence try to avoid duke of York at all costs!"" The inquiry was yesterday shown a memo Mr Hunt sent Prime Minister David Cameron arguing the case for News Corp to take over BSkyB, just weeks before he was given quasi-judicial oversight of the bid. Email: Mr Smith said he did not remember telling Fred Michel, pictured, it would be 'game over' for opponents of the buyout after the proposal was announced . The note, dated November 19 2010, warned that Business Secretary Vince Cable's decision to refer the bid to regulator Ofcom could leave the Government 'on the wrong side of media policy'. Mr Smith said the Culture Secretary and his department knew he was in contact with Mr Michel, who 'bombarded' him with information about News Corp's BSkyB takeover bid. 'I would have thought on the odd occasion that I did mention to Mr Hunt one of the issues that I thought was worthy of his attention, I would I think almost certainly have said, 'Fred's told me X, Y or Z',' he said. 'They generally knew I was in touch. On some certain issues they certainly knew. But I don't think they knew the volume or extent.' The inquiry heard yesterday that Mr Michel exchanged 191 telephone calls, 158 emails and 799 texts with Mr Hunt's team between June 2010, when News Corp announced its bid, and July last year, when it abandoned the plan amid outrage over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. Of these, more than 90 per cent were exchanged with Mr Smith, who himself sent 257 text messages to the News Corp lobbyist between November 2010 and July last year. Mr Smith said today 95 per cent of his contact with Mr Michel was via his mobile phone, with only a 'handful' of calls made using his office landline. Mr Smith said he did not feel he was speaking for Mr Hunt on the details of the BSkyB takeover process in his conversations with Mr Michel. He told the hearing: 'I wouldn't have been doing my job if I had had to run and check what Mr Hunt thought about every stage of the process. 'In this particular bid, I would argue that I was actually just being more of a buffer and a channel of communications rather than representing Mr Hunt's views to anybody.' The former special adviser said he 'wasn't that fussed' about whether News Corp's BSkyB takeover went ahead, but thought it should go ahead as long as no new issues were thrown up by a period of consultation. He said: 'On the wider issue, I looked at if from the point of view of the consumer not probably being that concerned because they get their news or watch their TV, and don't really mind too much about where that comes from.' Tragic: stabbed seven times, and subjected to a gruesome sexual assault when she was dead or dying outside her home in Blenheim Crescent, Croydon, in September 2005 . Lewis Sproston, the boyfriend of murdered model Sally Anne Bowman, has become the latest to sue over the phone hacking scandal. Sproston, dropped Miss Bowman, 18, off at her home in the early hours of the morning, and was initially arrested after her murder before DNA evidence quickly eliminated him as a suspect. Now Sproston, a plasterer, is demanding damages from News Group Newspapers, publishers of the now defunct News of the World, and disgraced private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, High Court listings reveal. News Group Newspapers is part of News International, the media empire headed by Rupert Murdoch. Pub chef Mark Dixie, 42, was later jailed for at least 34 years after being convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in February 2008. He had denied the killing, saying he had come across her dead body outside her home, and explained the presence of his DNA by saying he had had sex with her although she was dead. She had been stabbed seven times, and subjected to a gruesome sexual assault when she was dead or dying outside her home in Blenheim Crescent, Croydon, in September 2005. Dixie had a string of previous convictions for sex offences, and was arrested by change nine months later after a minor fracas in a pub. His DNA was taken and matched to the murder when it was put on the police national computer. Mulcaire, 41, a former professional footballer nicknamed Trigger, was jailed for six months in January 2007 after pleading guilty to illegally intercepting phone messages, while the News of the World’s royal editor Clive Goodman was given four months. News International has already settled many claims brought by individuals who claimed their mobile phone messages had been intercepted.","Adam Smith tells Leveson that Hunt told him to fall on his sword .

A 65-year-old man has told how he was dragged off a toilet by a black bear while on a camping trip in Canada. Gord Shurvell, from Winnipeg, was on a camping and fishing trip with a friend near Ontario on Saturday when he went to visit the outhouse. Mr Shurvell said he had left the door open to enjoy the view when the bear came in. Terrifying: Gord Shurvell shows his scars after being mauled by a black bear while using the toilet on a camping trip in Canada . Started screaming: Mr Shurvell (left) was in the outhouse when the bear grabbed hold of his shoulder and started dragging him outside towards the bush. She suffered claw and bite marks on his body (right) 'I'm sitting on the throne and my feet are sort of up on the 'poopstool,' we call it,' he said. 'So I'm kicking at him to get away, but he grabbed my pants that were down around my ankles. And that was the start of it, and he just kept coming.' The bear grabbed hold of him by the shoulder and began dragging him outside towards the bush. 'I’m screaming for my buddy to come with a gun,' he said. Daniel Alexander, Mr Shurvell's camping partner, came running with a gun. Lucky escape: Mr Shurvell's friend of 55 years, Daniel Alexander, eventually managed to shoot the bear (not pictured) dead before it was too late . 'I could see Gord's head,' said Alexander, who decided against taking a shot at the bear because of the risk to his friend.

But such high-profile controversies will soon be confined to the past after it was revealed that goal-line technology is one step closer to being introduced to top-level football. The Hawkeye system will be used at Wembley for England's friendly against Belgium on June 2 - Roy Hodgson's first home game in charge of the national team. The move comes after a season of controversial decisions that have seen goals awarded when replays show the ball did not cross the line - and not given when they clearly have. Over the line? If goal-line technology had been in place Frank Lampard's goal against Germany in the last World Cup would have stood . In Chelsea's FA Cup semi-final win over Tottenham last month, Juan Mata was awarded a goal even though the whole of the ball was not over the line. While in Scotland, Hibernian's Paul Hanlon 'scored' against Dunfermline even though his shot clearly bounced down off the crossbar half a foot in front of the goal line. Conversely, in the Premier League this season QPR defender Clint Hill was denied a goal after his header went over the line at Bolton. Calls for goal-line technology have grown louder in recent years after a string of high-profile errors. In the 2010 World Cup match between England and Germany, Frank Lampard was denied a valid goal after his shot came back off the bar and over the line. The goal would have made it 2-2, and England went on to lose 4-1. However, if there are any close calls during next weekend's game only the scientists monitoring the system will know the results - the referee will not be informed. Testing: Hawk-Eye made its live match debut in the Hampshire FA Senior Cup final at Southampton's St Mary's Stadium on May 16 . Checking the results: EMPA officials test the Hawk-Eye Goal Line Technology system which uses seven cameras pointed at each goalmouth . It will be the final live test for the Hawkeye system and follows a previous test during the Hampshire FA Senior Cup final at Southampton's St Mary's Stadium on May 16. It works by using seven cameras pointed at each goalmouth. If the ball crosses the line, a radio signal is sent to the referee’s wristwatch. It is believed the technology would cost around £250,000 to install at each stadium. Those examining the new system will be keen to see how it copes with a higher roof, electronic advertising hoardings and a much larger crowd. Another system, called GoalRef, is being tested in the Danish Super League. Juan Mata celebrates his 'goal' against Tottenham during the FA Cup semi final match against Tottenham. Replays showed the ball did not cross the line . GoalRef inserts an aerial, described as three bands, inside the ball and creates a magnetic field between the posts . All the tests are being monitored by officials from EMPA, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. A vote on whether to allow the technology to be rolled out across all matches will be held at a special meeting of the International Football Association Board on July 2 in Kiev. If it goes ahead it could be in place for Premier League matches next season. The latest move comes two years after Frank Lampard was denied a 'goal' during England's Second Round World Cup game against Germany in South Africa and brought the debate to the top of the agenda. System in place: How the Hawk-Eye cameras look mounted on the roof of the stadium . FIFA president Sepp Blatter wants to ban penalties . FIFA President Sepp Blatter has asked German great Franz Beckenbauer to find an alternative to the 'tragedy' of penalty shootouts. Blatter told the FIFA Congress on Friday that football 'loses its essence' when matches are settled by penalty kicks. Football 'can be a drama, even a tragedy, when we go to penalty kicks,' Blatter said. 'Football should not go to one to one, because when football goes to penalty kicks, it loses its essence as a team sport.' Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in a shootout last weekend to win the Champions League after the German side had dominated a game that finished in a 1-1 draw after extra time. Beckenbauer, the former Bayern captain and president, heads FIFA's Task Force Football 2014 panel which Blatter created in 2010 to improve football before the next World Cup in Brazil. 'Perhaps Franz Beckenbauer with his Football 2014 group can present us with a solution, if not today then tomorrow.' The task force has met several teams, but has shown little public interest in scrapping penalty shootouts. FIFA said in a statement: 'Such tests could lead to the International Football Association Board (IFAB) approving the introduction of GLT at its special meeting at the beginning of July. 'Only the EMPA observers, IFAB and FIFA representatives at Wembley will have access to the GLT system readings. 'Therefore, should a goal-line incident occur at this or any of the 'test' matches, the system will not be utilised by the match officials. It means the GLT system will have no influence on the outcome of the matches in which the system is being tested. 'FIFA would like to place on record its sincere thanks to the Football Association for their willingness to support the live match tests, a critical part of Test Phase 2 for goal-line technology.' FA general secretary Alex Horne said: 'We remain committed to the introduction of goal-line technology on the basis that it is accurate. We are in an intensive phase of testing and are delighted we can help FIFA by using our stadium at Wembley. 'We look forward to considering the results at the next meeting of IFAB.' Geoff Hurst, England v West Germany, 1966The most famous goal-line controversy of them all. It was extra-time in the World Cup final at Wembley with the scores level at 2-2 when Hurst turned and fired in a shot, which hit the bottom of the crossbar and bounced down toward the line. With referee Gottfried Dienst uncertain, linesman Tofik Bahramov from Azerbaijan signalled a goal. Hurst went on to complete his hat-trick, England won the World Cup and the debate over the decision has never stopped. Right call: England's controversial third goal scored by Geoff Hurst (not shown) in the World Cup Final on July 30, 1966 at Wembley . Frank Lampard, England v Germany, 2010England trailed 2-1 in their World Cup second-round match when Lampard's 20-yard shot beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, hit the underside of the bar and bounced clearly over the line. The goal was not given, though, and Germany went on to claim a comprehensive 4-1 victory to knock England out of the tournament. Pedro Mendes, Manchester United v Tottenham, 2005There was just a minute to go at Old Trafford when Mendes tried to beat Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll with an audacious lob from just inside the opposition half. The effort should not have troubled the Northern Irishman, but he spilled the ball over the line before diving to scoop it out. Despite the ball dropping two yards over the line, the goal was not given and the match ended 0-0. Luis Garcia, Liverpool v Chelsea, 2005In a Champions League semi-final, Liverpool's Luis Garcia sent his side through when his hooked effort was awarded by referee Lubos Michel, despite Chelsea defender William Gallas claiming he had cleared it from under the bar. Liverpool progressed to win the final, with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho left to say: 'It was a goal from the moon or the Anfield Road stand, I don't know where.' Clint Hill, Bolton v QPR, 2012In a battle between two struggling sides, Clint Hill thought he had given QPR the lead when he headed a Joey Barton cross in. Goalkeeper Adam Bogdan scrambled behind his line to save and, although replays showed Hill had scored, linesman Bob Pollock assured referee Martin Atkinson he had not and Bolton went on to win. Juan Mata, Tottenham v Chelsea, 2012Chelsea hammered their London rivals 5-1 in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley, but they were helped on their way by a Juan Mata goal which did not cross the line. The Spaniard put the Blues two up when referee Martin Atkinson awarded a goal even though replays showed his shot was blocked on the line. Jonathan Howard v Middlesbrough, 1997Premier League Middlesbrough, boasting a line-up of internationals, were down to ten men and trailing 2-1 to Second Division Chesterfield in the FA Cup semi-final when Howard's close-range shot came crashing down off the crossbar and over the line. The goal would have put the game beyond Middlesbrough. But it wasn't given, the game ended 3-3 after extra time and Boro went on to win the replay 3-0.","Hawkeye system will be used at Wembley for England's friendly against Belgium on June 2 .

Murdoch fixer Fred Michel launched a relentless campaign of schmoozing to win influence with David Cameron’s most senior advisers. During the Murdoch empire’s bid for BskyB Mr Michel sent and received 799 text messages to individuals in the Culture Department, as well as 191 telephone calls and 158 emails. Relations were so warm between No 10 and the Murdoch empire that the Prime Minister’s director of communications Craig Oliver enjoyed a social dinner with Mr Michel just two days after it emerged that the News of the World hacked the phone messages of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Contacts: Hunt aide Adam Smith, left, and News Corp lobbyist Frederic Michel, right, told the Inquiry they had exchanged more than 1,400 texts, emails and calls . Details: Adam Smith arrives at The Royal Courts of Justice to give evidence to The Leveson Inquiry today as questions are asked about his dealings with News Corp . Mr Michel also revealed that Mr Cameron’s press secretary Gabby Bertin sent text messages to News International boss Rebekah Brooks on the same day. Evidence submitted by Mr Michel, the former News Corporation director of public affairs, shows he bombarded special advisers in Downing Street, the Treasury and the Department of Culture with more than 1,000 text messages. Mr Michel revealed that he was also in touch with Mr Cameron’s former communications director Andy Coulson, his policy gurus Steve Hilton and Rohan Silva and he also admitted lobbying Chancellor George Osborne’s special adviser Rupert Harrison for favours. Robert Jay, counsel for the inquiry, revealed that Mr Michel had sought a meeting at a ‘discreet location’ with Mr Oliver and News International troubleshooter Will Lewis. Mr Michel said: ‘The dinner was going to be with the wives. There were two locations floated and we ended up in a location which was not discreet at all.’ Downing Street was forced to step in last night amid claims that Mr Oliver should have declared the meeting under the civil service code of conduct. Mr Cameron’s official spokesman revealed that ‘the meeting was on July 6 last year’ but did not have to be declared since Mr Oliver and Mr Michel split the bill and civil servants only have to declare hospitality, not meetings, with media figures. ‘Craig Oliver’s contact with Fred Michel was entirely appropriate. It was a social occasion and originally had been for Craig to meet Will Lewis, Fred Michel and their wives but Will Lewis dropped out because his wife had given birth. They paid for their own meals.’ But the timing of the meeting raises questions about the wisdom of a senior No 10 figure meeting with a Murdoch envoy as the Milly Dowler hacking scandal had erupted. The Leveson Inquiry heard that Mr Michel sent a text to Gabby Bertin on 6 July 2011 saying: ‘Thank you for your messages to Rebekah last night.’ Scandal: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) with Adam Smith, his former special adviser, who will appear later today . Inquiry: Lord Justice Leveson called Michel and Smith to shed light on the Government's handling of News Corp's £8 billion bid . Mr Michel told the Inquiry: ‘I don’t know what the message contained. I only knew that Rebekah told me she had got messages from Gabby.’ Mr Jay said the messages might be ‘the indirect communication’ from Mr Cameron that Mrs Brooks revealed when she gave evidence. But Miss Bertin said last night that she was not passing on messages from the Prime Minister. ‘They were personal texts to Rebekah. I was not an emissary. I didn’t send anything on behalf of the Prime Minister.’ Friends said she told Mrs Brooks that she had fought hard for the families of murdered children when she was editor of the News of the World, including another murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne. The Inquiry also heard that Mr Michel unsuccessfully sought two favours from George Osborne’s most senior aide Rupert Harrison. In November 2010, Mr Michel texted him to get the Chancellor to lobby Business Secretary Vince Cable, who was then in charge of the BskyB bid, to push it through. ‘It would be helpful if George were to send a letter to Vince on our Sky merger and its economic importance separate from the Ofcom process. Do you think it’s a possibility? I can of course help with the content. Best, Fred.’ In July the following year, when the Dowler scandal was raging, he asked for a senior politician to condemn hacking but insist on a police investigation – an apparent attempt to prevent a public inquiry into the hacking. Neither request led to results. Mr Michel confessed that he was a ‘text obsessive’ and was also in touch with Nick Clegg’s senior aides Lena Pietsch and Jonny Oates. Mr Michel often exchanged messages in cod French and provoked the same response in others. When he praised one performance at the despatch box, the Culture Secretary responded: ‘Merci. Large drink tonight.’","Murdoch's lobbyist Frederic Michel tells Leveson Inquiry he was 'never told' to halt contact .

"By . Craig Mackenzie . UPDATED: . 03:30 EST, 17 October 2011 . His poignant story reads like a Hollywood film script, but for Dewey Bozella it was a real-life nightmare. He spent 26 years in New York's notorious Sing Sing prison for a murder he did not commit. But today he is feted by President Barack Obama and has finally fulfilled his dream of boxing professionally - at the age of 52. Scroll down for video . Victory: Dewey Bozella, 52, raises his arm after defeating an opponent 22 years younger than him in his first professional fight after serving 26 years in jail . Big hit: Bozella lands a punch on Larry Hopkins on his way to a points victory. In Sing Sing he was the prison's light-heavyweight champion . He won his first and last fight by a unanimous decision despite giving away 22 years in age to his opponent. 'This is the greatest moment of my life,' said Bozella who fought with a simple message: 'Don't give up.' For more than a quarter of a century he knew daily despair as he battled to clear his name over the brutal killing of a 92-year-old woman. He could have become a free man FOUR times if he had pleaded guilty. Each time he refused, maintaining his innocence. Young fighter: Bozella fell in a life of petty crime before taking up boxing and training at ex-champion Floyd Patterson's gym . Bozella found comfort in boxing, training daily in the prison gym and studying at night for his bachelor and master's degrees. Finally In October 2009, Bozella was formally . cleared. This summer he was honoured by ESPN as its 2011 Arthur Ashe Award winner for his . courage. Legendary boxer Bernard Hopkins heard Bozella's story and offered him the chance to fight  against 30-year-old Larry Hopkins on the undercard of his own championship bout. Hopkins told the Los Angeles Times last week 'This is not a charity case. This man is fulfilling his dream.' Born in Brooklyn, Bozella was nine . years old when he saw his father beat his pregnant mother to death. Later one brother was killed in a stabbing and another shot in the head. Jail inmate: Bozella pictured in Sing Sing where he served 26 years for a murder he did not commit . Bozella became a petty criminal, but tried to start a new life by . moving to upstate Poughkeepsie and taking up boxing at a gym run by . former heavyweight champ Floyd Patterson. But at 18 he was arrested for a local woman's murder. Seven years later he was convicted of the killing. Champion: Bernard Hopkins invited Bozella to fight on the undercard of his own bout . Bozella said he had been bicycling far from the scene, but two convicts claimed he was the murderer in return for their own freedom. He received a sentence of 20 years to life. 'Every day I had to ask myself, 'How do I survive this nightmare, Sing Sing,' a place where hate and anger are the order of the day,' Bozella told ESPN earlier this year. 'I didn't merely want to survive, I wanted to thrive. Boxing awakened me. I felt free during my workouts for the first time. I was no longer a prisoner.' In 1990, Bozella won a second trial. The prosecutor offered him a deal - admit the crime and go free. Stubbornly, Bozella refused. And then the jury convicted him. He said: 'I'd die before I would tell you I did it. I can't, I can't. You are not going to make me say something I didn't do. I’m not a murderer.' Bozella had to spend 19 more years at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining  where he became the prison’s light-heavyweight boxing champion. He fell in love with a woman who was visiting another inmate, and got married. He said: 'I learned to take myself from the bad position and make it a better position. If I have to die in prison, that's just the way it is.' Bozella wrote the same letter to the Innocence Project week after week, asking them to take up his case. Five years after receiving the first letter, the Innocence Project agreed, but  police had destroyed all of the physical evidence in the case. The deal Bozella refused: He would not plead guilty to the crime to get his freedom . The law firm WilmerHale eventually took on the case and tracked down the senior detective who investigated the murder. It was to be a vital breakthrough. Arthur Regula had kept the only copy of the case file and had taken it home with him after he retired. He told ESPN: 'I had figured some day someone would come knocking on my door. There were certain things in the case that made me have doubts. I just could never throw it away.' The file revealed that prosecution witnesses had lied, and that another suspect had confessed to the crime - information withheld from Bozella's lawyers all those years. On Thursday, as Bozella prepared for his first professional fight, President Obama telephoned him . Mr Obama said: 'I heard about your story and wanted to call and say good luck in your first professional fight. 'Everything you have accomplished while you were in prison and everything you have been doing since you got out is something that I think all of us are very impressed with.' Bozella told ABC New York station WABC-TV about the dream that kept him going through the years. He said: 'My message is to never let fear define who you are, and never let where you came from determine where you are going. 'When I was in prison, they were telling me, 'You can't do this, you can't do that, it's never going to happen.' And now look. It was something I believed in my heart would happen.'","President Obama phones to wish him good luck .

The businessman tangled up in the sensational investigation of his wife’s murder has now been arrested for allegedly trying to hire someone to kill a witness in the trial. Bob Bashara of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, who is a person of interest in his late wife Jane Bashara’s murder, was allegedly caught on tape trying to hire a hit man to take out handyman Joe Gentz. Gentz, who confessed to strangling Mrs Bashara, has been in jail since March. Bashara was allegedly plotting to have him killed while behind bars. Scroll down for videos . Bated breath: In an exclusive video, Clickondetroit.com captured Bob Bashara behind bars, breathing onto the glass of his cell . Strangled: Jane Bashara, left, was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 - eight miles away from their Grosse Point Park home - a day after her husband Bob, right, reported her missing . The Detroit Free Press first reported the latest bizarre development in a murder case marked with bizarre twists at every turn. Bashara was arrested yesterday around 6pm outside his commercial rental property – the same place, the Free Press notes, where he was said to have a sex dungeon. He could be arraigned as soon as Wednesday. An exclusive video from Click Detroit shows Bashara in a jail cell, breathing onto the glass, and wiping away precipitation with his finger. His lawyer, David Griem, told reporters that he was arrested on a charge of solicitation to murder a witness, and added that he is speechless at the arrest. ‘Who in their right mind would arrange a hit inside a prison?’ he asked outside of the building. ‘I think he believes this was all part of a set-up,’ he told the Free Press. Gentz is undergoing a competency evaluation to determine whether he is fit to stand trial. Jane Bashara, was reported missing by her husband on January 23. The next day, her body was found behind the wheel of her Mercedes SUV, which was parked in an alley in Detroit. The 56-year-old had been strangled to death, and bruises on her body and broken finger nails proved she 'fought for her life', according to police. While police have long considered Bob Bashara a person of interest in his wife’s murder, he has not been charged - but reports say that may soon change. Gentz, a local handyman who admitted in January that he was hired to kill Mrs Bashara by her husband, was arrested in March and charged with the murder. Gentz also faces charges of conspiracy, an indication that authorities believe more than one person was involved. Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to Detroit . Fear: Bashara insists he has no reason to kill his wife of 26 years and is petrified of spending his life behind bars . Since his wife’s murder, Bob Bashara has vehemently denied being involved, but Gentz tells a different story, saying Mr Bashara promised him money and a used car if Gentz killed Mrs Bashara. In an email to Ohio’s The News-Herald, Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney spokeswoman Maria Miller said: '[The case is] still under investigation’. However, the paper reports that word from the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office indicate Bashara will be brought in either this week or next week to face charges. In an appearance on Good Morning America in February, Bob Bashara, 54, with his daughter Jessie proclaimed his innocence in the case.In the meantime, The News-Herald reported that Bob Bashara has collected about 24 letters from character witnesses to use in court if he’s charged with the murder in an effort to secure a release from jail on bond. He said: 'I did nothing wrong. I didn't commit murder. I didn't pay to have my wife killed. I'm going to see this through to the end. And I'm innocent. 'And all the badgering, and all the bad words, and all the negativity, I'm going to have to live through'. Police again searched the Bashara's Grosse Pointe home in February and found blood in the garage - something they said they missed in their initial extensive search of the property and the surrounding area. Arrested and charged: Joe Gentz, right, stood with his attorney Don Aubrey last month when he was charged for his role in Jane Bashara's murder . Bob Bashara said he finds it 'fishy' that it's the first time they found it despite extensively searching the home two weeks ago. On the day of Jane's memorial service, Gentz, a man known to the family, turned himself into police and said Bashara pointed a gun to his head and made him kill his wife, something he said he was paid $2,000 for. It also emerged that Bashara was having an affair with a woman called Rachel Gillette and was planning on buying a house with her. But he told GMA he had 'no reason' to kill his wife of 26 years and that he loved her very much: 'We had a very good, open relationship. I'm frightened about this. To know that I could spend the rest of my life in jail for a crime I didn't commit is a very scary thing.' The 54-year-old said he came home to find his wife missing and the lights and TV left on in their home. Mr Bashara said he last spoke to his wife when she was driving home from work but phone records showed no such phone call took place. The local businessman admitted he and Gentz, 48, had a dispute over a $600 bill and Mr Bashara's attorney believes Gentz may have showed up at his home and demanded money from  Jane before getting into a struggle with her. Deceit: Though they had been married for 26 years, Mr Bashara was said to be having a relationship with a woman who he was planning on buying a house with . Her husband told police that Gentz's version of events was absurd and said he does not even own a firearm. He told GMA the allegations are a 'sick assessment' that 'shows how deranged he is'. 'I do believe he's the one that did it. He wanted more money from me. He badgered me. And yes, I do believe he's capable of it,' Mr Bashara said. It has been reported that Gentz has the IQ of a third grader. He told police he turned himself in as he did not want to be wholly implicated in the crime but that Mr Bashara was the mastermind behind it all. Investigators also confirmed they found an 'S&M sex dungeon' in the basement of a bar Mr Bashara owned called the Hard Luck Lounge. A Detroit dominatrix named Lady Geanna told WXYZ-TV that Mr Bashara hosted S&M sex parties there. She said: 'Several of my clients or slaves have called me today. Since this has come out I've had like over 20 phone calls. 'They are all people who have been to his parties and asked if I was involved with them,' she said on Friday. Some of them were worried there might have been hidden cameras, things like that'. Sources confirmed the room was filled with whips, chains and a bed and that Mr Bashara had been drinking at the Hard Luck Lounge the night his wife was murdered.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:16 EST, 14 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:07 EST, 14 May 2012 . Barack Obama's latest campaign gambit follows a familiar line of attack as it uses Mitt Romney's private equity past to cast the Republican candidate as  greedy, job-killing corporate titan with little concern for the working class. The President is not the first of Mr Romney's opponents to try and paint the former governor of Massachusetts as a heartless uber-capitalist - even his Republican rivals used the same tactic during the heated primary battle. But Mr Obama's campaign seems to have been particularly unoriginal - as his attack ad is almost identical to one produced by Ted Kennedy for his Senate campaign against Mr Romney in 1994, featuring unemployed workers complaining about Bain Capital, the firm founded by Mr Romney. The timing of the Obama assault on private equity is also unfortunate, as on Monday night the President attended a fundraiser hosted by Democratic supporter Hamilton E. James, chief operating officer of the Blackstone Group, which is believed to be the world's largest private equity firm. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . Lost jobs: Joe Soptic (left) and Jack Cobb (right) are both featured in the Obama ad about Bain Capital's role in the closure of the GST steel plant in Missouri in 2001 . At work: Mr Romney was one of the co-founders of Bain, a private equity firm that specialized in consulting . Mr Obama is opening himself up to . criticism with the attack ad, given how similar it is to the message put . out by Mr Romney's other opponents over the years - but the message has . proved effective in the past, as it goes right to the heart of the . candidate's much-touted business credentials. The same message - that Mr Romney is concerned only with profits and not with the well-being of those people whose jobs he cut - was echoed by his gubernatorial competitor Shannon O'Brien in 2002, and then even by his Republican opponents Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich earlier this year. Familiar face: One of the men who lost his job at the hands of Bain Capital who was shown in Senator Ted Kennedy's 1994 attack (above) tells a similar tale to those in Obama's ad . At the center of the Obama camp's push - the . president's most forceful attempt yet to sully Romney before the . November election - is a biting new TV ad airing on Monday that recounts . through interviews with former workers the restructuring, and ultimate . demise, of a Kansas City, Missouri, steel mill under the Republican's . private equity firm. ‘They made as much money off of it as they could. And they closed it down,’ says Joe Soptic, a steelworker for 30 years. Jack Cobb, who also worked in the . industry for three decades, adds: ‘It was like a vampire. They came in . and sucked the life out of us.’ The . ad, running for an unusually long two minutes, will air in five . battleground states: Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado. The . campaign declined to describe the size of the ad buy though it's in the . middle of running a $25million, month-long ad campaign in nine states. A . longer version of the ad was being posted online Monday. The commercial will . be coupled with a series of events Mr Obama's campaign is holding this . week in Florida, Missouri, Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina to highlight . Mr Romney's role at Bain Capital, a company he co-founded. It's . unclear whether Mr Obama, himself, will criticize his Republican rival . on the subject when the president appears at events in New York on . Monday or whether he'll leave the skewering to campaign surrogates as he . prepares to meet with foreign leaders during the G-8 and NATO summits . later this week. Also this . week, Vice President Joe Biden holds two days of events in Ohio, where . he's expected to discuss Mr Romney's role as a corporate buyout . specialist. Under fire: The ad focuses on Bain Capital's work with GST Steel beginning in 1993, and eventually the company filed for bankruptcy in 2001 . Lasting impact: About 750 workers lost their jobs, and were left without any health benefits and reduced pension . The Romney campaign did not comment on the ad early Monday. The . former Massachusetts governor was spending the day in Boston, with no . public events scheduled, after delivering a commencement speech in . Virginia on Saturday. Mr Obama's new ad, which reprises . criticism leveled at Mr Romney during the Republican primaries, focuses . on one of those unsuccessful companies, GST Steel. Bain . was the majority shareholder in GST Steel beginning in 1993. The . company eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2001, which was a period in . which the U.S. steel industry was roiled by a flood of cheap steel . imports. About 750 workers lost their jobs, and . were left without any health benefits and reduced pensions. The federal . government was forced to infuse $44million into the company's . underfunded pension plan. Bain . received $12million on its $8million initial investment and at least . $4.5million in consulting fees, according to a January report by . Reuters. Mr . Romney has accused Mr Obama of attacking free enterprise and called the . criticism of his business background an attempt by Democrats to distract . voters from the president's record. Both candidates were entering a new week in the campaign seeking to shift the focus back to voters' No. 1 issue- the economy- from social issues that dominated after the president announced his support for gay marriage. The two campaigns contend that in a nation where unemployment is hovering around 8 per cent, voters will choose between Mr Obama and Mr Romney based on economic arguments. Obama is trying to convince voters to stick with him as he heralds an economic rebound, as sluggish as it is. Mr Romney counters that Mr Obama has had enough time, and only he - with his deep background in business - knows how to jumpstart the nation's job market. Mr Obama, hosting his first campaign rally earlier this month in Columbus, Ohio, gave a preview of the new line of attack, saying Mr Romney had ‘drawn the wrong lessons’ from his business experience at the helm of Bain. Commencement speaker: Mr Obama addressed the graduates of Barnard College while on a trip to New York today . Business savvy: Mr Romney has based the large part of his campaign on his business experience, arguing that it gives him a unique position to help fix the economy . ‘He doesn't seem to understand that maximizing profits by whatever means necessary - whether through layoffs or outsourcing or tax avoidance or union-busting - might not always be good for the average American or for the American economy,’ Mr Obama said then. Mr Romney, a multimillionaire, left Bain . in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympic Games but maintained a . financial interest in the company after departing. Driven: Mr Romney kept a financial stake in the firm after he retired . He has said that his firm had a strong overall track record, creating jobs in prominent companies like Staples and Sports Authority, while acknowledging that some companies Bain invested in were unsuccessful. Mr Obama's new ad, which reprises criticism leveled at Mr Romney during the Republican primaries, focuses on one of those unsuccessful companies, GST Steel. Bain was the majority shareholder in GST Steel beginning in 1993.

The commercial . shows interviews with former workers at the Kansas City plant who said . Bain's role led to job losses and slashed benefits. It . intersperses their claims with clips of Romney promoting his business . background and empathizing with the jobless during campaign events. There also are images of a closed factory, run-down buildings and a road sign that says ‘Dead End.’ Inspecting: Mr Romney spoke with North Carolina Senator Richard Burr on a foundry tour in Charlotte . Consulting: Mr Romney's time at Bain Capital, a private equity firm that he co-founding is coming under question . ‘Bain Capital walked away with a lot of money that they made off this plant. We view Mitt Romney as a job destroyer,’ said steel worker John Wiseman. David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr Obama's campaign, said Mr Romney wants to ‘create the illusion that somehow his experience equips him to lead the economy but there's nothing about the record that would support that.’ ‘His central premise is that he's an economic wizard who can really get this economy moving and if that's the only claim he is making for this office, that's a premise worth examining,’ Mr Axelrod said. During a commencement address at Barnard College, a private women's college, President Obama urged the graduates to fight for their place at 'the head of the table' and help lead a country still battered by economic woes toward brighter days. Obama said 'I believe that the women of this generation will help lead the way. Women, young people and gay voters all made up crucial voting blocs for Mr Obama in the 2008 election. And with the president locked in a close race with Republican rival Mitt Romney, his campaign is focused on rallying support among those groups once again. The president's choice of Barnard as his first commencement address of the spring underscored the intense focus both candidates have placed on women. An Associated Press-GfK poll conducted earlier this month showed Mr Obama with a sizable advantage over Mr Romney with women voters, 54 per cent to 39 per cent. Mr Obama acknowledged that today's college graduates are entering a shaky job market. But to those who say overcoming the nation's challenges isn't possible, Obama said: 'Don't believe it.' He told the graduates that if they ever despair, they should think of the country's history and what young generations before them have achieved. 'Young folks who marched and mobilized and stood up and sat in from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall they didn't just do it for themselves, they did it for other people,' Mr Obama said. 'That's how we achieved women's rights, that's how we achieved voting rights, that's how we achieved workers' rights, that's how we achieved gay rights, that's how we've made this union more perfect.'

Fake electronic parts are widespread in key U.S. military systems and threaten national security, with China the top source for bogus gear, a U.S. Senate investigation has concluded. The year-long probe by the Senate Armed Services Committee found counterfeit electronic parts from China in the Air Force's C-130J cargo plane, in assemblies for Special Operations helicopters and in the Navy's Poseidon surveillance plane, the panel said in its report released on Monday. The investigation found 1,800 incidents of bogus parts in the Department of Defence supply chain in 2009 and 2010. Compromised: Fake electronic parts are widespread in key U.S. military systems and threaten national security, a Senate report claims . Staggering: There were more than 1million counterfeit parts reported . The total number of suspected fake parts in those cases topped 1 million, it said. The failure of a single electronic part can leave a soldier, sailor, airman or Marine vulnerable at the worst possible time, the report said. Unfortunately, a flood of counterfeit electronic parts has made it a lot harder to prevent that from happening. Besides creating national security and safety risks, the fake parts drive up costs. The price tag for replacing a bogus memory device in a Missile Defence Agency missile, for example, was $2.7million. The probe found that reporting into a Defence Department program set up to identify fake parts was severely lacking. Costly: Besides creating national security and safety risks, the fake parts drive up costs to replace the bogus parts . Made in China: China was the source for 70 per cent of the more than 100 incidents of bogus equipment the committee traced back through the supply chain, followed by Britain and Canada . Only 271 reports of suspect counterfeit parts were filed with the program in the 2009-2010 period that the Armed Services Committee examined. China was the source for 70 per cent of the more than 100 incidents of bogus equipment the committee traced back through the supply chain, followed by Britain and Canada, the Senate panel concluded. China has failed to take steps to halt counterfeiting and the Pentagon did not know the scope and impact of fake parts, it said. The defence industry's reliance on unvetted distributors raises risks for national security and for U.S. service personnel, it added. President Obama signed into law in December a bill designed to stop the importation of counterfeit electronic parts and shore up weaknesses in the military parts system.","Yearlong investigation by U.S. Senate reveals counterfeit parts topped 1m .

Rise: Transport Secretary Justine Greening said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the rise in fuel duty . Motorists will almost certainly have to pay 3.02p more for their fuel at the pumps to help pay-off Britain's debts, a senior minister has admitted. Transport Secretary Justine Greening said she was not prepared to stand in the way of the rise in fuel duty expected to come into effect in August. It means already cash-strapped families will have to fork out more than £1.40 a litre for petrol - most of which is tax. The move also sparks fears that the country could see a repeat of fuel . protests similar to those seen in September 2000 when petrol pumps ran . dry during a series of rolling blockades on the country's motorway . networks. Miss Greening she said wants to focus on pushing petrol companies to slash the cost of fuel at the pumps, to bring it in line with the falling cost of oil globally. Former Treasury minister Miss Greening told the Daily . Telegraph said: 'The taxes that we get in fund the public services that . we all rely on. 'Surely it’s better to challenge the petrol retailers to . pass on reductions to motorists and actually I think that’s probably the . most important thing to do.' At present, 57.95p is taken in fuel duty for every litre bought on diesel and unleaded. VAT adds another 20 per cent - around 24p at current prices. If the fuel duty rise is rubber stamped, it will mean almost 61p out of every litre of bought will go in duty. Fuel duty and VAT has kept petrol prices artificially high despite the falling cost of crude oil, although petrol prices have fallen this month by 4p for the second month running. Also, today three supermarkets, Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco vowed to . slash the price of fuel at the forecourt passing on savings to customers . from falling oil prices. Breakdown of the cost of fuel from August when a 3.02p increase will be applied . Miss Greening said it was important . that the Treasury focus on cutting the deficit in light of what is . happening to some countries in Europe. Ministers will be left to find . £1.5billion to plug the income gap if the fuel duty rise is pulled. However, the Prime Minister is under pressure . to ditch the fuel price rise from senior ministers who have voiced . concern that it will damage support for the Tories from poorer voters. Ideas under consideration include cutting the 3p . rise to 1p or 2p, or deferring part or all of the rise until next . spring. Going up: How the price of petrol and diesel keeps rising even although for the past year the cost of brent (crude) oil has fallen, but prices have remained high . As of just a few days ago, 50 MPs, including seven Tories, . have now signed a Commons motion calling for the price rise to be . scrapped. Supermarket Asda is cutting the price of petrol. From tomorrow customers at Asda’s 196 filling stations will pay no more than 127.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 132.7p a litre for diesel. Asda said this was the lowest price for a litre of fuel since February 2011. The latest cut means Asda has shaved 14p off the cost of a litre of fuel since the end of April, reducing the cost of filling up a family car by almost £10. Sainsbury’s said it was reducing its fuel prices too, with petrol and diesel coming down 'by up to 2p per litre' from tomorrow. The AA said the 14p Asda reduction since April was welcome. While Asda had dropped its petrol price largely in line with wholesale, the UK average was down 10.5p a litre since the record high in mid-April. Tesco is also dropping prices, with its petrol and diesel coming down by up to 2p a litre from tomorrow. They were joined by leading businessmen, with the . boss of Asda also demanding the tax hike is cancelled. This week, the SNP will also try and . force the Coalition to scrap the duty rise by forcing a vote as the UK . budget complete the final stages of its passage through Westminster. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce has backed cross-party action to scrap the hike. Chief Executive Liz Cameron said it would be 'a welcome boost for . businesses which are having to contend with high transportation and . utility costs at a time when domestic demand remains subdued'. But Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has played down hopes of progress. He said last week: ‘Right now, taxation on fuel is 10p a litre less than it would have been if Labour’s plans had been in place. 'But given the huge issues we have . with public finances, we also need to make sure  that we’ve got the . money coming through the tax system, and the increase in fuel duty is . part of that.' June's AA Fuel Price Report shows that, since mid-May, average UK . petrol prices have fallen 4.63p a litre, from 138.40 to 133.77.

Even so, the overall . 8.71p-a-litre reduction in the pump price petrol since the 142.48p . record on April 16 is still short of where it should be, the motoring . group said. Under government pressure to make pump prices . transparent, the fuel industry will have to prove in the future that UK . drivers are paying a fair price for fuel, the AA said. In the past month, the average pump price of diesel has fallen 4.99p a litre, from 144.30p in mid May to 139.31 now. But UK diesel costs at least 4p a litre more than in Europe.","Justine Greening wants to push petrol companies to slash the cost of fuel at the pumps instead .

The mother of newborn twins who died following an overdose at a scandal-hit hospital has described their deaths as 'totally avoidable' after a coroner said there were failings in their care. Alfie and Harry McQuillan, who were born 13 weeks premature, died on November 1 2010. An inquest into their deaths heard they had been given an 'excessive' dose of morphine hours after their birth at Stafford Hospital on October 30. Grieving: Phillip David Mcquillin and Ami Dean who said her twins' deaths had been 'avoidable' The University Hospital of North Staffordshire, where the twins died after being given an 'excessive' dose of morphine, an inquest heard . The twins' mother Ami Dean, 25, from Stafford, said: 'I could have coped with them dying from prematurity, as that would have been nobody's fault. However, their deaths were totally avoidable. They were down to human error, which is something I cannot cope with.' Both babies were described as being in a 'good condition' after their births but they were injected with morphine to stabilise their fragile bodies before they were transferred to a maternity unit. But staff were confused over the dilution of the drug which led to Alfie being given 600mg while Harry was injected with 850mg - compared to a prescribed dose of 50mg.

Maggie Oldham at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stafford Hospital, said: 'Our deepest sympathy remains with Alfie and Harry's parents' Recording a narrative verdict, South Staffordshire Andrew Haigh said: 'There were failings in the care the twins received but I do not find these to be gross. 'I do not therefore propose to include a rider of neglect.' However, he added that he believed the morphine was likely to have played a role in the children’s deaths and therefore they did not die of natural causes. He continued: 'I realise that what happened was distressing for all involved. 'I’m pleased that the parents of the twins did manage to attend the hearing and I hope it was helpful to them. 'The circumstances of the deaths were particularly tragic and I’m sorry this happened to them.' Mr Haigh said he would also make a report to Stafford Hospital advising them to introduce pre-filled syringes of specific doses of morphine to prevent similar tragedies in the future. Maggie Oldham, chief operating officer at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stafford Hospital, said: 'Our deepest sympathy remains with Alfie and Harry's parents and their loved ones. 'We are very sorry that the care we provided was not good enough.This has been a long and difficult process for their entire family and our thoughts remain with them at this time.'

Disgust: William Lockard, 50, (pictured left) and his brother James, 39, were charged with neglect after their bed-ridden mother was found covered in feces and blood at the home in Windsor Locks, Connecticut . Police had originally gone to the home on April 30 after an emergency call was made that the elderly woman was spitting up blood. When police and paramedics arrived, they were faced with an unbearable stench and rotting food strewn across floors. In an upstairs bedroom, they found Mrs Lockard with human feces on her body and filthy bedsheets covered in waste and blood. Rotten food covered the floor of the room, according to the officer who witnessed the scene. 'The odor in the room was completely intolerable and the living conditions were one of the worst that I have seen in 12 years I have been employed with the Windsor Locks police department,' Officer Andrew Dzierzgowski wrote in an affidavit, obtained by Courant.com. House of horrors: The two adult brothers could offer little explanation to police as to why they had left their mother in such a deplorable condition at the Connecticut home . Mrs Lockard was taken to St Francis Hospital in Hartford where she died on May 7. The cause of death has not yet been confirmed. Officer Dzierzgowski asked the brothers why they had left their mother in such squalid surroundings. William Lockard simply shrugged his shoulders and offered no answer. His brother James said he was 'extremely busy' and could not find the time to look after the 84-year-old. The brothers, who also had poor hygiene, said they had changed their ill mother's bedding and bathed her about two weeks before. Police had previously visited the home in 2010 and recommended that the welfare department investigate living conditions at the home. It was unclear whether any action had been taken.

A foreign surgeon who mistakenly injected a four-year-old boy with a massive overdose of a toxic chemical has been suspended. Hungarian Dr Gyorgy Rakoczy had trouble speaking English and communicating with other staff, a General Medical Council (GMC) hearing heard. The boy was left with a hole in his spine and needed 30 operations. He now needs to be fitted with a colostomy bag. He was found guilty of serious misconduct after the incident at Manchester Children’s Hospital, which left the child fighting for life. The boy was treated at the hospital in 2009 for a small haemorrhoid, which Dr Rakoczy removed. He then injected the child with a carbolic acid 16 times the correct dose and four times a potentially lethal dose. The highly-corrosive liquid burned away parts of the boy’s body leaving him with a hole down to the bone at the base of his spine. He was rushed to intensive care and doctors warned his parents he was unlikely to survive. He did pull through, but was left severely injured and has since undergone over 30 operations. The Hungarian  was suspended from his job for three months. His ability to practise medicine was judged to be impaired by the GMC . The parents of the boy welcomed the decision and revealed that they fought to haul Dr Rakoczy before a disciplinary panel after he had continued to work following the incident. The boy’s mother, who wished to remain anonymous, revealed the toll Dr Rakoczy's actions had had on their family: 'It is hard to begin to describe how this has affected our son,' she said. 'In a picture two days before it happened, he’s got a big smile on his face. A week later, after the operation, and he’s become gaunt and sad. 'It was so sad seeing him start school with a colostomy bag. The mother and father of the boy, who have asked not to be identified. The mother said: 'It is hard to begin to describe how this has affected our son.' 'His injuries still mean even doing ordinary things like going to the park or a birthday party are very difficult.' 'I just hope that what has happened at the GMC makes Dr Rakoczy realise just how serious his errors were.' The hearing was told Dr Rakoczy currently had a high workload. But the panel ruled aspects of his work were of ‘a very poor standard’ and a suspension was essential to ensure that the public did not lose confidence in doctors. Panel chairman Professor Michael Whitehouse told him: 'Your careless approach to a number of basic aspects of clinical practice and catastrophic mistake are in breach of your professional duty. 'Your actions in administering a potentially fatal bottle of phenol and your admission of reading each line of text on the bottle is most serious in nature. 'Public confidence in your profession would be damaged if your fitness to practise was not judged impaired.' The boy was injected at Manchester Children's Hospital . The family are now taking legal action against Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital. Their solicitor, Jenny Unwin, of law firm Pannone, said: 'No amount of money is going to properly compensate but it will help his parents provide for his future needs and any future treatment he needs.' A spokesman for the trust said: 'We wish to offer our sincere apologies to the boy and his family for the obvious distress this incident has caused.'","Life-threatening injection was 16 TIMES correct dose .

A new mother infected by a flesh-eating virus is clinging to life following seven operations to try to save her. Lana Kuykendall fell ill shortly after being released from hospital following the birth of her twins on May 7, being readmitted just 13 hours later. The 36-year-old has been kept 'intubated and sedated' her brother said, at a hospital in Greenville since May 11, as she battles necrotizing fasciitis. Scroll down for video . Torn away: Lana Kuykendall can't take care of her newborn twins because she is fighting for her life with a tube in her throat . The brother, Brian Swaffer, told CNN that the babies, Ian and Abigail, are doing well and are in the care of relatives, adding that their mother still has 'a long road ahead'. 'She does respond sometimes, you can see in her blood pressure,' he said. 'She has opened her eyes a little bit at times but that's about it. 'We don't know what the next day is going to bring, so we're just trusting the Lord. We're taking it one day at a time.' The infection began as a small bruise on Kuykendall's leg, though it began growing rapidly -- about one quarter of an inch an hour. The mother from Upstate, South Carolina, is now in critical condition at a hospital in Greenville. Mrs Kuykendall, 36, is the second woman in the South to contract a rare bacterial infection called necrotizing fasciitis, which can spread rapidly as it kills flesh. Aimee Copeland, 24, a graduate student at the University of Georgia, has last one leg, both her hands and her remaining foot after she was infected when she cut herself after falling from a homemade zip line. On Monday her family was offered hope after she was taken of her ventilator and breathed on her own for the first time. A third victim of the bacteria has been identified as 32-year-old Bobby Vaugh who became infected when he fell out of a tree and cut his side. Early detection: Mrs Kuykendall quickly recognized something was wrong because she is a paramedic. Her husband, Darren, is a firefighter . Critical condition: Within 90 minutes of arriving at the hospital, doctors rushed Mrs Kuykendall into surgery to removed the infected tissue . Vaugh as lost two pounds of flesh from his groin and back since catching the aggressive bug. He went to the doctor after the infection site grew from the size of a peanut to that of a grapefruit and is recovering from five surgeries. Mrs Kuykendall is a trained paramedic, who knew something bad had happened when she spotted the spot on her leg and began experiencing pain that wouldn't go away, the Greenville News reported. She had been home from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she gave birth to Ian and Abigail, for just 13 hours. Her husband took her to the hospital and within 90 minutes, she was in emergency surgery. Doctors removed the dead, infected flesh on her leg in the hopes that they could stop the bacteria from spreading. Before she went into surgery, Mrs Kuykendall and her husband Darren watched in horror as the infection visibly spread throughout her leg. Lana Kuykendall was back in hospital less than 13 hours after being released following the birth of her twins . 'And the longer she sat there, the bigger that spot got. It was initially the size of a 3-by-5 index card. But it got bigger and bigger,' Mr Kuykendall, a firefighter, told the newspaper. 'It moved a quarter of an inch in half an hour. Then the high-risk OB physician had a suspicion of what it was.' Mrs Kuykendall is currently in the intensive care unit of Greenville Memorial Hospital, breathing through a tube. And she's missing out on some of the most important early days of her newborns' lives.

Television talent shows will be forced to apply for licences to feature child stars to protect them from producers who want to 'push the boundaries'. The biggest shake-up of performance rules for 40 years was ordered by ministers amid concerns that the current regulations are 'archaic, complex and irrelevant'. Proposals published today - whoch also cover reality TVs hows - say that producers will be expected to gain a licence if a child is going to be put in an 'artificial situation, which may have been contrived for artistic, editorial or dramatic effect'. Changes: TV talent shows will be forced to apply for licences to feature child stars under new proposals. Britain's Got Talent was criticised three years ago when Hollie Steel, pictured, started crying after struggling to complete a song . This includes programmes that are billed as observational or factual, but actually put a child into a contrived situation. Rules on including children in performances, including TV, radio, film or theatre, were last reformed in 1968 - a time when there were just three television channels and a small number of radio stations. Those rules stated that a licence was needed for under-14s who would be singing, dancing, acting or taking part in musical performances. But there have been suggestions that this left a grey area between factual programming and entertainment shows that is not covered by the rules, and has left some producers unsure if they need a licence. Worry: Last month, the Children's Minister Sarah Teather voiced concern after Malakai Paul, 9, pictured, broke down in tears while singing for the judges on Britain's Got Talent . In the modern age, the rules are unclear and no longer fit for purpose, ministers suggested. Children's Minister Sarah Teather raised concerns last month after Malakai Paul, 9, started crying while singing for the judges on Britain's Got Talent. The show was also criticised three years ago when Hollie Steel started crying after struggling to complete a song. Children's Minister Tim Loughton said: 'We want to nurture not just the big stars of the future but help all children realise their talents by being able to perform. 'Everyone should have the chance to act, sing, dance and play sport - giving them memories for life. 'The current rules get in the way of that. They are outdated, complex, confusing and not fit for purpose. New proposals: Children's Minister Tim Loughton, pictured, said current rules are outdated, complex, confusing and not fit for purpose . 'They come from an age when there were just three television channels and bear no relation to the broadcasting or performing industries in the 21st century. 'The rules are incredibly complex, bureaucratic and patchily applied - meaning that many amateur dramatic groups simply do not involve children in their plans, which is ridiculous.' The proposals say that a parent must take responsibility for their child's activities, and producers will have to show they have strong safeguarding measures in place before they apply for a licence. Under the last Labour government, then schools secretary Ed Balls ordered a review of child performance rules amid fears that youngsters were being exploited by reality TV. At the time, Mr Balls said he was not attempting to stop children from appearing on talent shows, on stage or in documentaries. But he added there were concerns that some programme makers were determined to 'push the boundaries' to provide a shock value and push up ratings. His review was ordered shortly after concerns were raised about the Channel 4's 2009 show Boys And Girls Alone, in which a group of 20 children aged eight to 11 were left to their own devices in isolated cottages in Cornwall.","Concerns raised last month after nine-year-old Malakai Paul started crying on Britain's Got Talent .

Warning: Greeks are being urged to keep their money in the nation's banks and not to stash their cash at home (file picture) Greeks are being urged to keep their money in the nation's banks and not to stash their cash at home - as thieves continue to profit from the country's economic uncertainty. Police say brazen burglars are making off with hundreds of thousands of euros, on an almost daily basis, as they raid homes where money is hidden in cupboards or under the mattress. Andreas and Emilia Karabalis, both 80, are just one of the many victims targeted by unscrupulous robbers. The couple took out €80,000 and hid it in their home, on the island of Lefkada, because they thought their bank would collapse. But days later thieves came in the night. Emilia said: 'We were sleeping. The two masked burglars came to our bed and tied us up. They hit us. They robbed us - they didn't leave anything, it was torture.' Husband Andreas added: 'Our life is black now. They took our life's savings. We lost everything.' No-one knows exactly just how much cash lies stashed in Greek homes, secreted in cupboards, at the back of the ice-box, beneath the floor or under the mattress. But by any guess it is well in the billions, and burglars are after their share of loot which is both highly portable and virtually impossible to recover. Greece's debt crisis has plunged it into five straight years of economic contraction, thrown half of its young people out of work and may see it ejected from the eurozone. Civil disorder: As well as the targeting of homes, there has also been violence on the streets of Greece in recent months . In the past two years, Greeks have withdrawn from banks more than €72billion - or close to €7,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. And much of that has been taken in cash. Police say gangs who may have once eyed 'hard targets', - like the banks themselves, or jewellers - are now going after homes of ordinary people, where there is far less risk and often large stashes of cash freshly withdrawn from savings accounts. 'Many people have withdrawn their money from the banks fearing a financial crash, and they either carry it on them, find a hideout at home or in storage rooms,' said national police spokesman Thanassis Kokkalakis. He said: 'We urge people to trust the banking system, leave their money there, or at least in a safe place, not hide it at home, where they must anyway take the basic security measures. Little wonder: But with shares in Greek firms plunging, and the nation's banks having to be bailed out, many think keeping their money at home is the sensible option . 'Some people don't even lock their doors and windows.' The unexpected bonanza is attracting foreign crime networks, he said, including two from ex-Soviet Georgia which police dismantled in recent months, blaming them for 300 burglaries. Crime is just one hazard for people storing unusually large hoards of cash, most of which are not insured. Carpenter George Psychogios, 30, withdrew his savings of €8,000 and kept them in his house at Arta, a small town 200 miles from Athens and known principally for its Byzantine stone bridge and a 13th-century church. He said: 'I hid the money in two different places before leaving for a trip. When I came back it was all gone. They broke into the house through a balcony door and they took it all. 'We used to sleep outside with the doors unlocked. Now we don't feel safe even when we lock up. They break into homes, shops, businesses. There is a surge in robberies here.' In Iraklion, a working class neighbourhood of Athens, local people say some thieves have become so brazen they often prowl in broad daylight, even when a family is in. 'We were sitting on the front veranda chatting when they jumped from the roof to the back yard and got into the house,' said pensioner Mattheos Michelakakis, 61. Before he realised what had happened, they had made off with his family's gold. 'Burglars hear that people are scared and withdrawing money and they hit homes randomly hoping they will be lucky,' he said. 'I feel like I've been naive. We always used to leave all the doors open; we had nothing to worry about.' There are tales of savings going up in smoke in fires or, as in one case, being lost when a pensioner withdrew his life savings - then died suddenly, before telling his family where they were hidden. Theft, though, seems the biggest risk and the crime wave has spread far beyond the big cities into rural areas where robbery was little known. According to the central bank, Greeks withdrew €72billion from bank accounts between January 2010 and March 2012, leaving just €165billion behind. Since then, withdrawals have accelerated further after an inconclusive May 6 election led EU leaders to talk openly of Greek exit from the single currency. Some of that money was wired abroad and some spent, but much of it was hidden in homes, either in cash or converted to gold. If Greece leaves the common currency area, any money left in Greek banks would probably be turned into drachmas worth a good deal less. Euros stashed in a box at home would still be euros. 'People have already taken their money out of the bank. The rest are doing it now because they are afraid we will be kicked out of the eurozone,' said one police officer. Among cases he said he had come across in the past week: a man reported €30,000 in cash and gold stolen from a storage room next to his house and an elderly woman had her life savings of €100,000 stolen from her apartment. That woman's home also happened to be packed full of cartons of long-life milk and boxes of pasta - in case, she explained, the economic crisis led to food shortages. Stashing cash is as old as Greece. The countryside is dotted with archaeological sites where the ancients squirreled away their silver drachmas to hide them from marauding armies. Greek museums are rich in treasure whose owners never made it back. 'Hiding valuables - small or larger amounts of coins, golden, silver, even bronze - was very widespread in antiquity, especially in times of war, crisis or difficulty,' said George Riginos of the Association of Greek Archaeologists. 'Sometimes the owner would perish and this is how they reached us, hidden in the ground, in holes in the wall, small vases under the floor or leather bags.' Future archaeologists may yet stumble on some of the buried treasure of the euro zone crisis of 2012. A senior banker tells the story of a family on the island of Rhodes who recently visited their local branch, trying desperately to figure out how much their late father had withdrawn before he died. Not trusting the bank, the old man had taken out his life savings. But he hadn't told anyone where he hid it. His children were searching everywhere, tearing down walls in the house trying to find it, but with no luck.","Andreas and Emilia Karabalis, both 80, had €80,000 taken from island home .

Fashion Week, and by night to . attend the Matthew Williamson after-party by night. First to wear the shoes though, . naturally, was Charlotte Dellal, the designer behind the Charlotte . Olympia label (and elder sister of model Alice Dellal). She paired hers with a cutesy collar, loose shorts, a chunky knit and fishnet tights - the antithesis to SJP's dressed-down . boyfriend jeans and jumper look. In doing so, Charlotte proved that this is one kitty who can . roll with the fashion punches. The versatile shoe is ideal for 'day to night', the Charlotte Olympia website suggests, thanks to its bold gold heel (the 0.5mm heel is embellished with a metallic finish). This burgeoning trend for a high fashion low heel will be a blessed relief for many women who are fed up of the ever-increasing heel height imposed upon them by designers - who are usually male. Thankfully for womankind - and her bunions - this season has seen a proliferation of flats that are slowly taking over from the six inch heels shoe shops have been slaves to for the past few years. The shoes - available from the Charlotte Olympia website in either black or leopard print - are fast selling out - net-a-porter have reported they are down to their last few pairs - so if you're keen to join team feline, get in quick.

'The government ought to find a . solution for the problems with the police and should not confuse their . action with our march,' he added, from their encampment 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) north of the capital. Divided people: A police officer in civilian clothing burns the poncho of a Morales supporter during Monday's protest . Emotional: Police demanding salary increases to put them on a par with the army shout slogans in front of the palace . Anger: Police officers protest at Murillo square in La Paz outside Evo Morales's presidential palace . Wives and widows of striking policemen wait at the Plaza de Armas for the results of the negotiations . Reiterating the government line that . police are setting the stage for a coup, communications minister . Amanda Davila declared on public radio that the mutiny 'is not . just any kind of movement.' 'They have the power of weaponry, of . tear gas, and of all the tools' that are now being turned against the . state, he said, citing alleged explosive attacks on Congress and on a . radio station as evidence. In further evidence of the growing tensions, the governors of eight of Bolivia's nine departments - all except Santa Cruz - put out statements of support for Mr Morales, apparently prompted by his officials. Governor of the La Paz department, Cesar Cocarico, said: 'We reject and condemn the aims and objectives of conspirators and rebel groups that are causing violence and whose actions are aimed at destabilising the democratic process by promoting a coup.' As police representatives entered a new round of talks with three federal ministers, teachers joined hundreds of officers - normally their adversaries - to protest in La Paz's main square. Determined: Indigenous people head for La Paz after a long journey from the natural reserve of Tipnis . The strike presents a significant challenge to Mr Morales as it follows months of social unrest from miners, doctors, indigenous people and other groups frustrated with their low standard of living. The Secretary General of the Organization of American States regional bloc, Jose Miguel Insulza, yesterday expressed growing concern over events in La Paz and called for a rapid solution. In a written statement issued in Washington, he said: 'The strike by the armed body charged with guarding the public order generates, in and of itself, a sensation of uncertainty. 'But when a legitimate union demand appears to become confused with destabilising political objectives, that should worry us much more.' Mr Insulza had 'known evidence of messages exchanged between people close to the strike, that utter threats against government ministers and make allusion to a possible coup,' the statement said. A group of wives, mothers and widows of low-ranking police officers camped out on cardboard and straw mats in front of the riot police headquarters provide a visible symbol of the strike movement defying the government. Act of faith: Bolivian natives show support for Mr Morales at the anniversary of the farmers union as the mutiny rages on . Francisca, the wife of a police sergeant, said: 'We sleep here, in the street, we have some blankets; it is very cold at night and all my bones are bad.' The mother to six children aged between six and 20 added: 'My husband earns 1,200 bolivianos (£110) a month. Before I earned good money as a maid but now my hands are too bad and I can no longer work.' The police are campaigning for a minimum pay hike to 2,000 bolivianos (£183), from the current average of £125 a month. They also are demanding full pay upon retirement, a police ombudsman and the overturning of a law that bans them from publicly expressing their opinion.","Officers demonstrating outside palace in capital La Paz are calling for hike in £125-a-month average pay .

The arrest of a teenager in a Chinese town triggered pitched battles between hundreds of migrant workers, local people and riot police. Violence erupted in Shaxi, in the southeastern province of Guangdong, one of China's major coastal manufacturing areas and continued for two nights. Authorities in the nearby city of Zhongshan said the fights involved locals and workers predominantly from Sichuan province, which borders Tibet to the west of China. Tensions high: Chinese migrant workers rioted and clashed with police this week in a fresh outbreak of social unrest in the economic powerhouse of Guangdong . Hundreds of officers guarded government buildings after the rioting, the latest in a series of clashes in an area where tensions are running high between locals and workers brought in from elsewhere in China. The BBC reported that around 30 people were injured and two police cars smashed in the rioting in Shaxi, which is just across the water from Hong Kong. Police said 20 suspects were detained. In recent years, claims of discrimination and abuse by authorities have triggered strikes, clashes and rioting by migrants, who are on low pay and do not have the same rights as town dwellers. Going in: A column of dozens of Chinese riot police march along a street in Shaxi, a manufacturing town in Guangdong province . Pitched battle: A swarm of people can be seen running along a Shaxi street in this chaotic scene captured on film . The latest clashes in Shaxi involved about 300 migrants, who hurled rocks after a fight between a 15-year-old migrant and a student, a government spokeswoman told the Associated Press news agency. Other reports said the teenager had beaten up a primary school pupil on Monday. Security personnel intervened and beat the young migrant, infuriating a group of relatives and others migrants who rioted, the Global Times, an English-language Chinese newspaper, reported. Police are said to have tied up the boy, who suffered facial injuries.

The South China Morning Post reported that authorities sealed off Shaxi on Tuesday and people . were told to stay indoors. For now, the violence has subsided, but riot police were said to still be guarding government buildings yesterday. Last June, thousands of migrant workers, also largely from Sichuan province, rioted and clashed with police in the Guangdong city of Zengcheng, torching cars and ransacking government buildings, over the treatment of a pregnant street hawker. Guangdong's party secretary Wang Yang, who is expected to be elevated to China's elite politburo standing committee in a leadership transition this year, has acknowledged a need to mitigate simmering social unrest by stressing a more equitable and balanced 'Happy Guangdong' campaign. The number of 'mass incidents', as such outbreaks of unrest are known, recorded by the Chinese state grew from 8,700 in 1993 to about 90,000 in 2010, according to several government-backed studies, but some believe the true figures are higher.

A 13-year-old boy whose friend was accidentally shot dead as they played with a gun covered the body with a blanket and fled his family home, police said yesterday. The panic-stricken teen did not tell anyone what had happened and spent Wednesday night elsewhere, leaving his cousin to come home and find 14-year-old TyJuan Woodard lying dead on a futon. But the man initially assumed the figure under the blanket was his sleeping cousin and did not disturb him, according to police in Little Rock, Arkansas. The skyline of Little Rock, Arkansas, the city where TyJuan Woodard was accidentally shot dead on Wednesday . It was not until a few hours later that the 13-year-old's relative took a closer look and realised he did not recognise the boy on the futon. He picked TyJuan up and noticed he was not breathing, having been shot in the chest. Someone called the emergency services and when officers arrived, they found the boy lying face-up on the floor, according to the police report. There was blood on his face and chest, and as medics lifted his shirt, they found what looked like a bullet wound. Police said everyone in the home said they didn't know the boy or what had happened. TyJuan lives elsewhere and had previously run away from home, according to police spokesman Lt Terry Hastings. Lt Hastings said officers talked to the other boy on Thursday morning. A woman who said she was the 13-year-old's grandmother said he stayed with his aunt on Wednesday night. 'He said he was scared, but I wish he had told me, just told me something,' she said. She had never seen TyJuan before he was found lying on the floor of her home. 'All I could see was blood on his nose,' she added. The woman is not being named so as not to identify her young grandson. Lt Hastings said he wasn't sure how the boys got a hold of the gun, which belongs to one of the 13-year-old's relatives. He said they were playing with the firearm in a bedroom when it went off and a bullet hit the 14-year-old in the chest. No charges have been filed, but Lt Hastings said the case will be forwarded to the prosecutor. One of the prosecutors, John Johnson, said his office is yet to receive the case file.","Man who discovered body of TyJuan Woodard, 14, initially thought it was his sleeping cousin ."

Carmen Bejan, 23, was jailed for 20 years together with her medical student boyfriend Sergiu Florea for the murder of a pensioner . A medical student who murdered a man then cut up his body is suing prison officials in Romania claiming her baby was stillborn because they wouldn't let her out to satisfy her pregnancy cravings. Carmen Bejan fell pregnant last year following a relationship with another inmate and gave birth to a stillborn daughter with deformities, including no hands, this week. However, she claims she did not receive correct care throughout her pregnancy and claims this amounts to the child in effect being 'murdered.' Lawyers for the 23-year-old revealed she is planning to sue the prison believing the link between her not being allowed to fulfill her cravings and the stillbirth to be 'substantial'. In March she spoke about how it was 'pure torture' waking up with cravings for everything from bananas on toast through to cheese flavour crisps - none of which were possible to satisfy in jail. She said: 'These cravings are a way for a woman's body to tell her what foods are needed to satisfy the mineral and vitamin requirements of the unborn child. 'By denying me access to those foods they are causing mental torture to myself and physical risk to my unborn child. 'The cravings make me really sick because I can't get the food I crave for unless I get visits from my family, and the only thing I can do is keep on suffering. What pains me most is that my child is in pain also - I fear I could lose the baby because of these cravings, but I have the feeling nobody cares.' Bejan's baby was conceived during one of the 'intimate visits' allowed under Romanian law. The father is her husband, Claudiu Stratan, a convicted drug dealer that she met while on remand. Doctors had previously said the child was developing normally. Sorin Prisca, a medic from the Arad penitentiary who took care of the pregnant woman, says the malformations were due to stress. He said an investigation was currently being carried out to see if there had been a medical error somewhere during the pregnancy. Bejan claims she had nightmares throughout her pregnancy of giving birth to a monster. This week, Stratan said: 'She had eight ultrasound scans during the pregnancy. Each time she was told everything was okay.  But I don’t think they were looking at the scans properly. The first time they said the baby was a boy. Bejan has told prison officials that it was 'pure torture' waking up with cravings for everything from bananas on toast through to cheese flavour crisps - none of which were possible to eat in jail . 'Then they said it was a girl. I don’t think they even bothered to look at the scans properly. It was all just superficial. How can it be that the baby was allegedly fine and is then born with no hands and died shortly after delivery?' When Bejan was told her baby was born she repeatedly shouted out 'They killed my baby' Romanian daily Cancan reported today. It was also reported Bejan went into a deep shock before dissolving into floods of tears. The medical college in Timisoara, Romania, where Bejan and her medical student boyfriend Sergiu Florea murdered a pensioner she'd promised to sleep with for money . (File picture) Timisoara, Romania, where the pair murdered 65-year-old Trifu Schroth . Bejan was  jailed for 20 years in 2009 together with her medical student boyfriend Sergiu Florea for the murder of a pensioner she'd promised to sleep with for money. She had lured her victim back to their bedsit at Timisoara medical college, Romania, where they both killed and robbed him. Afterwards, they used their surgical equipment to slice 65-year-old Trifu Schroth's body into small pieces to make it easier to dispose of. They were caught when they were spotted loading the body parts in plastic sacks into the boot of their car by another student who called police. The pair who were both found guilty tried to blame the gruesome killing on each other. After hearing the news of the loss of the baby the widow of the murder victim Trifu Schroth, Lucretia said: 'God has punished her for what she did.' During her last appeal for freedom during the pregnancy she said: 'I do not believe that words can convey how much suffering this is causing. I believe if I am not released I will not live to see the birth of my child.' Earlier in an appeal hearing a prosecutor said: 'It is quite plain that she deliberately became pregnant just to get out of her sentence. It is outrageous,' If she had won her appeal she could have been freed throughout her pregnancy and for the first year of her child’s life.","Carmen Bejan was jailed for 20 years in 2009 for the murder of a pensioner whose body she cut up with her boyfriend .

Outrage: Stephanie Rice poses in the designer bikini deemed 'too revealing' An Australian Olympic swimmer has been criticised for posing in a bikini deemed 'too revealing' - but has started a copycat craze of people wearing the outfit. Triple gold medalist Stephanie Rice posted the picture of her in a two-piece designer swimsuit on Twitter earlier this week. The bikini - known as the 'tomb raider' - had been given to her as a birthday present from the designer Ellie Gonsalves. But critics blasted for the sports star for showing off in the costume which some claimed was 'too sexy'. One fan tweeted: 'Stephanie Rice posting a photo of herself in swimwear has brought disgrace to the Australian swim team and she should be dropped.' Despite the public backlash, Miss Rice left the photo on her Instagram page. There were also claims that by posing in the swimsuit she could have breached a sponsorship contract with Speedo. However, her management denied that she had broken any rules. A spokesman said: 'No, Stephanie isn't an ambassador for Ellie Gonsalves, she just loves their stuff. 'She doesn't have any relationship with Speedo anymore so there are no restrictions there.' Despite some criticism, the picture sparked a string of spoofs with men posting pictures of themselves in the same costume. Many of the them were supporting the swimmer. Radio presenter Ryan Fitzgerald contacted the makers of the bikini and was sent one to wear. He put the picture online of him and friend Michael Wipfli wearing the swimsuit. The outfit's designer Ellie Gonsalves also posted a picture of herself in the costume to show support for her athlete friend. Ellie Gonsalves label director Vanessa Bryce said that sales of the bikini have soared since Miss Rice's picture was made public.'We've had inquires from all over - the US, Singapore. We've sold an extra 60 since the photo ran and sales of other swimwear has also gone up,' she told the Herald Sun.

The step-brother of England ace Jermain Defoe escaped with a fine today after he was caught with cannabis and a lock-knife. Shane Defoe was a passenger in a car when police pulled him over in Bishopsgate, central London, on April 22, last year. After searching him, officers found a small quantity of cannabis and took the jobless 25-year-old to a police station to be strip-searched, City of London Magistrates' Court heard. A six-inch knife, which had been hidden in the waistband of his boxer shorts, fell to the ground as he was being ordered to undress. Maha Sardar, a privately-instructed defence barrister, said Defoe had previously given up smoking cannabis following another conviction a year ago. 'But after his father became ill with cancer - as is widely known - he would smoke cannabis to relieve the stress,' she said. 'It was a small amount of cannabis and it was for personal use.' She added he had been handed the knife by another passenger in the car just seconds before it was stopped. England ace: Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe was part of the England squad that got to the quarter-finals of Euro 2012 . 'This article was not in use to threaten or cause fear in any way,' she said.

"By . Sam Greenhill and Jason Groves . UPDATED: . 16:37 EST, 3 March 2012 . A cabinet minister has lost a High Court bid to hush up revelations that her rugby-playing son took banned steroids. Caroline Spelman’s son Jonny, who has played for England under-16s, last night issued an apology saying he was ‘very sorry’ for taking the drugs. The millionaire Environment Secretary, who obtained a gagging order to keep the public in the dark about ‘private matters’, abandoned her controversial injunction yesterday after a judge ruled in favour of a right to know. Revealed: Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman took out the injunction for her 17-year-old son who had taken banned steroids after suffering a leg injury when playing rugby . Mrs Spelman decided not to appeal the . ruling and instead issued a statement explaining why privately-educated . Jonny, 17, had taken the steroids. She pursued the injunction despite . senior Tories warning her it was folly. They said her legal battle would . only succeed in giving the story wider publicity. Jonny, who has played . for his country in under-16 matches against Italy and Wales, is . understood to have ordered a consignment of banned drugs over the . internet to aid his recovery from a sporting injury. He took the steroids for four weeks before being caught by his school at the end of last year. When the Spelman family learned the . Daily Star Sunday newspaper was planning to publish the story, the . minister applied to the High Court to have it suppressed. High Court: The injunction remained in place until 4pm today to give Jonathan, who was suing through his mother and father Mark, an opportunity to ask the Court of Appeal for permission to challenge the judge's decision . The Spelmans were granted an interim . injunction last month but yesterday they were counting the cost of . £60,994 in legal bills after Mr Justice Tugendhat refused to continue . the order. He said it was ‘not necessary or proportionate’. The tabloid newspaper had argued its . story was strongly in the public interest. But Mrs Spelman’s lawyer said . its ‘real purpose’ had been to launch a ‘political attack on Mrs . Spelman, using her teenage son’s private information as a weapon’. A source close to the Spelman family . said Jonny had been ‘devastated’ after suffering a serious injury during . a school rugby match in September, tearing the cruciate ligament in his . left leg. The injury ruled him out of trials . for England’s under-18 squad, while doctors advised he would have to . wear a leg brace and could be out of the game for at least nine months. The source said: ‘He thought he may . have lost the chance of pursuing his dream of a professional rugby . career. He then did something very stupid and took some banned . substances to try and speed up his recovery. ‘He’s a teenage boy and he is not the first to do something stupid, but he is extremely sorry about it.’ The source insisted the Spelmans had . taken out the injunction to protect their son from greater pressure, . claiming: ‘This was not about trying to gag the press, it was about . trying to protect their son.’ In a joint statement, Mrs Spelman and . her husband Mark, a senior executive at the management consultancy firm . Accenture, said: . ‘Our son knows that taking a banned substance can . never, ever be right and he is deeply sorry for the mistakes he has made . and is determined to learn from them. ‘We will do everything we can to . support him as he faces the consequences of his actions. He is still . very young and we hope he can be given space to do that.’ Gareth Morgan, the editor of the . Daily Star Sunday, said it was ‘a great victory for press freedom’, . adding: ‘The use of banned substances by an elite athlete is a matter . that is in the public interest and an injunction to hush up the facts . should never have been sought. ‘We remain bitterly disappointed the . Spelman family went down this route and attempted to silence the press . using their wealth and influence, an option unavailable to ordinary . members of the public.’ Mr Justice Tugendhat warned his . decision not to continue the injunction was not a ‘licence’ for the . press to publish whatever they chose.","Spelman got an injunction last month to prevent the story appearing in a Sunday newspaper .

A father died in front of his wife and son after having a suspected heart attack during his first solo parachute jump. Gareth Vaughn, 59, plummeted to the ground after apparently losing control of his parachute at around 1,500 feet. Witnesses told how the South African businessman's wife and son watched in horror from below as he missed the designated landing spot and smashed into a wall. Tragic: A father died in front of his wife and son after having a suspected heart attack during his first solo parachute jump. This is a file picture . Police spokeswoman Joey Jeevan today confirmed an investigation had been launched into the tragedy, which happened at around midday yesterday near the port city of Durban. She said: 'This was the victim's first solo parachute jump, which was organised by an established company. 'At the moment all we know for certain is that the man landed incorrectly as he hit the ground. 'He had started the jump okay but at around 1,500 feet he apparently appeared to lose control of the parachute and stopped doing what he had been taught to do. 'He was due to land in a designated area which was marked by flags but instead he drifted over and hit a wall. 'We believe it is possible that he suffered some kind of attack in the air - either a heart attack or an anxiety attack which left him unable to respond to instructions. Accident: Witnesses said everything had seemed normal ahead of the routine leap at the Durban Skydive Centre in the village of Eston in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province . 'Sadly he suffered serious head injuries on impact and died at the scene.' Lieutenant Jeevan said a post-mortem would be conducted to establish the cause of Mr Vaughn's death. She said: 'We cannot say for sure what killed him, or whether he was alive or dead when he hit the ground. 'All we know is that he appeared to be unresponsive from around midway through the jump. 'The post-mortem should reveal what happened and we are investigating the incident.' South Africa's Daily News newspaper today reported that Mr Vaughn had signed up for yesterday's parachute after harbouring a long-term dream to complete a skydive. The novice jumper completed a full day's training on Saturday before the static-line jump yesterday morning. Skydive instructor Vernon Kloppers told the newspaper everything had seemed normal ahead of the routine leap at the Durban Skydive Centre in the village of Eston in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province. But he told how Mr Vaughn became unresponsive after he leaped from the plane at 3,500 feet. Mr Kloppers said: 'He jumped at 3,500 feet and his parachute automatically opened through the static line. 'He was seen controlling the parachute until about 1,500 feet. 'At this point, he became unresponsive under the canopy. 'We do not know what happened.' Paramedics confirmed Mr Vaughn was examined at the scene of the accident and declared dead before being taken to hospital. The family man's friend Paul Raglan-Smith told the Daily News doctors said they believed he had suffered a heart attack in mid air. The shocked friend added that Mr Vaughn had put parachute jumping on his 'bucket list' of things to achieve before he died. Mr Raglan-Smith told the publication he finally decided to do so yesterday to mark Mother's Day, which happened yesterday in South Africa. He said: 'Yesterday was Mother's Day and he decided the time was right to make his dream come true. Unfortunately, it ended tragically.' He added: 'Doctors at the hospital said they suspected he suffered a massive heart attack soon after he jumped.' Mr Raglan-Smith said Mr Vaughn's family had been left devastated by the tragedy. He added that his wife and son were in a state of shock after watching the horrific accident unfold. A spokeswoman for the Durban Skydive Centre today confirmed the incident was being investigated by the Parachute Association of South Africa. Static line parachute jumps allow novice skydivers to make solo leaps with less training than is required by normal jumps. The skydiver is attached to the plane by a line which automatically opens their canopy as they leave the plane. The parachutist must then use the knowledge they gained in training to control their descent to the ground. According to the website of the British Parachute Association, static line jumps carry a risk of around one in 170 of being injured and one in 40,000 of being killed.","Gareth Vaughn, 59, plummeted to the ground after  losing control of his parachute at around 1,500 feet .

Two of Surrey Police's most senior officers are being investigated over claims they turned a blind eye to allegations News of the World reporters were hacking schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s phone. A probe has been launched by the police watchdog in to Deputy Chief Constable Craig Denholm, who was the senior investigating officer on the Dowler case in 2002, and temporary Detective Superintendent Maria Woodall, who took over as senior investigating officer in 2006. The Independent Police Complaints Commission's investigation will focus on the senior officers’ alleged knowledge that Milly’s phone was hacked by the News of the World in 2002 and any actions taken, the watchdog said. Probe: Deputy Chief Constable Craig Denholm, left, and Temporary Detective Superintendent Maria Woodall, right, are accused of turning a blind eye to claims News of the World reporters hacked Milly Dowler's phone . Mark Lewis, the Dowler family’s lawyer, said: ‘The Dowler family welcomes the proper investigation of what happened at Surrey Police 10 years ago. ‘They regret that the passage of time means that some individuals can now no longer be investigated. The News of the World admitted hacking the phone of 13-year-old Milly Dowler, pictured . ‘The family have no further comment to make at this time.’ An . IPCC spokesman said: ‘The IPCC investigation is considering whether Mr . Denholm was aware during Operation Ruby that the NOTW (News of the . World) had accessed Milly Dowler’s voicemail in 2002 and his handling of . that information.’ He added that the watchdog was also examining information provided by Ms Woodall to Surrey Police during the internal inquiry into the force response to allegations that Milly’s voicemail had been illegally accessed in 2002. Neither officer has been suspended and both remain on duty, a joint statement by the force and the police authority said. Chief Constable Lynne Owens and Assistant Chief Constable Jerry Kirkby have also met the Dowler family to inform them of the referrals to the IPCC, it added. The two referrals to the police watchdog come after it found in February that there was no evidence to support allegations that a Surrey police officer gave information to journalists during Operation Ruby, the investigation into Milly’s disappearance in 2002. The now defunct News of the World admitted hacking the 13-year-old’s mobile phone but it remains unknown whether two missing messages were deleted deliberately, as previously suggested, or were removed from her message box automatically. Trusted: Deputy Chief Constable Craig Denholm, seen second left, has close contact with the parents of Milly Dowler, Bob, third right, and Sally, right . The Leveson Inquiry into press standards . has heard that Milly’s mother Sally phoned her daughter repeatedly in . March 2002 after she vanished while walking home in Walton-on-Thames, . Surrey. The teenager’s voicemail message was a generic automated response when her message box was full but when a message had been deleted the greeting reverted to her personal greeting. The Dowlers told the inquiry they were given ‘false hope’ by hearing the change of greeting - thinking their daughter might still be alive and had wiped a message. In May, MPs on the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee raised concerns about Surrey Police’s decade-long delay in informing the Metropolitan Police that they had evidence that Milly’s phone was hacked.",Watchdog to examine claims the senior officers failed to act on reports as early as 2002 that News of the World journalists had listened to murdered schoolgirl's voicemail .

Nine students testified on Monday that their teacher took photos of them in her classroom and during a pizza party at her home in their underwear and also allowed them to be secretly videoed while changing. The students, aged eight to 11, took the witness stand in Pottawatomie County District Court during a preliminary hearing for former McLoud teacher Kimberly Ann Crain of Shawnee and retired professor of early childhood development Gary Doby of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. At the end of the proceeding, Special Judge Dawson Engle ordered both to stand trial on 18 counts of sexual exploitation of a child under 12, one count of conspiracy to commit sexual exploitation and one count of lewd molestation. Abused trust: Former professor Gary Doby and third grade school teacher Kimberly Crain face life in prison . School: The FBI and local police are investigating allegations of inappropriate relationships between a McLoud Elementary School teacher and her students . He also bound Crain over on 11 counts of possession of juvenile pornography. Both could face up to life in prison. Prosecutors allege that Crain, 49, took photos of as many as 14 young girls while they were changing clothes in her classroom and at her home and that she shared the images with Doby, 66. Crain and Doby have pleaded not guilty to numerous porn-related charges in the case. Formal arraignment was set for June 27. The students testified that Crain took photos of them in her classroom and during a pizza party at her home while they were wearing tank tops and underwear. A nine-year-old old girl testified that Crain told her to open her legs and do various dances that Crain then photographed. 'There was so much I can't remember,' the girl said when District Attorney Richard Smothermon asked her how many photographs were taken. In another incident, the girl said that Crain drew smiley faces on the chest of a shirt the girl was wearing. The girl said she also talked to Doby via computer in Crain's classroom. 'He would say ""you are beautiful"",' the girl said. 'Sometimes he would have a shirt on, sometimes he wouldn't.' Smothermon asked the girl if she wanted to change clothes at Crain's home. 'I really didn't, because I felt uncomfortable,' the girl replied. Among the evidence introduced in the case was copies of photographs Crain allegedly took of the girls, including photos Smothermon said were taken by a hidden video camera that showed the girls naked as they changed clothes. Accused: Parents said five girls in the third and fourth grades were invited to a female school teacher's home and were secretly videoed by Gary Doby, pictured left . Predator: The allegations are against third grade teacher Kimberly Crain at McLoud Elementary, and they have sexual undertones. Residents said the allegations are spreading through the town like a wildfire . Another former student testified that she and other students went to Crain's home around Christmas for a pizza party where they changed into panties and bras, then hid behind a couch when the pizza deliveryman arrived. 'We covered ourselves up so he couldn't see us,' the girl said. Several of the students said Crain told them not to tell their parents what they had done. A ten-year-old girl said she reported what had happened to her parents and that her mother cried when she heard. 'She went to the bathroom and cried,' the girl said. FBI Special Agent Andrew Farabow testified that he examined laptop computers used by Crain and Doby and found images of child and adult pornography. The lewd molestation charge involves an allegation that Crain invited one of her students to look at a computer screen that showed Doby exposing himself. Crain, wearing a black and white striped prison uniform, sat quietly at a defense table in the courtroom as the girls testified while Doby, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit and shackled at the ankles and wrists, sat next her. They did not speak to each other during the hearing and said nothing as they were led from the courthouse by sheriff's deputies. They are each being held on $1 million bond. Crain's attorney, Craig Webb, declined comment, but Doby's attorney, Karen Byars, expressed concern for the young girls. 'If they are able to prove that a crime was committed by my client, I sincerely hope that the press and the DA's office will make a sincere effort to protect these young girls,' Byars said. Smothermon told reporters it was difficult for the girls to testify while Crain and Doby sat nearby at the defense table. 'I was very proud of them,' Smothermon said of the girls. Smothermon said authorities do not know whether the exchange of photographs of the girls was confined to Crain and Doby.","Former McLoud elementary school teacher Kimberly Crain and former professor Gary Doby face life in prison .

"By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED: . 16:46 EST, 26 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:51 EST, 26 May 2012 . No one knows exactly why this magnificent 1920s racing car was carefully dismantled, piece by piece, and buried under a shed. But the amount of time and effort put into the job is likely to pale in comparison to the painstaking task of rebuilding it to its former glory. After having been laid to rest for potentially more than half a century, the 1928 MG MK IV has not only been restored to its former grandeur but has also scooped the Best Vintage Car award at the British Classic Car Show. The resurrected MG, similar to this 1924-27 MG, is the only survivor in the country that displays the correct coachwork . It took Fred Body, from Cheddar in Somerset, more than a year to piece together all the parts of the two-seater car. But almost everything he needed was there. 'When it was found it was completely taken apart, laid out flat and covered in gravel and one or two inches of concrete,' said car enthusiast Body who bought the parts of the car when they were put up for sale. Speculating on why it was buried in such as way, he told the BBC: 'I think what must have happened was the war was coming and someone thought 'they're not taking my car for scrap'. 'They carefully took it apart and buried it thinking they would come back and put it together again.' The vehicle was discovered in 1999 under a cowshed on a farm in Gloucestershire. Prior to this date, nobody knows anything about the car's history, or its previous owner. The two-seater car, similar to this 1927-1929 MG, was found in pieces under a cowshed in Gloucestershire . Only 135 examples of this model of MG were made in 1928, according to the Early MG Society, and Body's restored model is the only survivor in the country that displays the correct coachwork. Despite spending most of its days underground, most of the parts were in good order. It even had all its identification including Guarantee plate and original number plates. Surprisingly, some of the original leather from the seats and paintwork was also preserved, meaning Body could restore it as close as possible to its original colours. The only parts that did not survive were those made from aluminium, which had corroded. The instruments were also missing - the most difficult parts to find - which Body speculated may be adorning someone's fireplace. The MG was completed early this year and won the vintage car award at the end of April. Commenting on the MG's resurrection, a spokesman for the Early MG Society said it was one of only a few genuine MGs that have come to light in the last 25 years.",Car enthusiast Fred Body spent more than a year piecing together the parts .
"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 03:18 EST, 19 July 2011 . Concerned relatives of September 11 victims are asking the FBI to brief them on its probe into allegations that News Corp journalists hacked into terror victims' phones. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into claims that journalists from News of the World bribed New York police officers for phone records of families of those who died in the 9/11 attacks. Sally Regenhard, whose firefighter . son Christian was killed in the attacks, said today she has been inundated with phone . calls from concerned family members of victims. She says there's a lot . of confusion and the families want an update on what investigators know . so far. Backing: The Wall Street Journal has dismissed the phone-hacking scandal as a row blown out of proportion by its business competitors and defended News Corp owner Rupert Murdoch, pictured on Monday in London . U.S. authorities have acknowledged they are looking into a report by Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, which cited an . unidentified source, . The report has yet to be independently verified but already . has fuelled U.S. emotions over the wider phone hacking scandal that has . consumed Britain and rocked Rupert Murdoch's News Corp media empire. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, has released a . bulldog defence of its owner Rupert Murdoch and slammed the . phone-hacking scandal as a row blown out of proportion by its business . competitors. Estimates from Barclays Plc and Gabelli & Co suggest . News Corp is still worth $62billion to $79billion when its businesses . are valued separately, even though it is currently a $41billion company on the market. This shows News Corp is trading at almost a 50 per cent . discount to its units, reported Bloomberg. Virginia analyst Michael Morris calculated News Corp is worth . around $25 a share, which values it 60 per cent higher than the company’s closing . price last week of $15.64. ‘There’s just sort of this generic Murdoch discount, which . encompasses the concern that he will make decisions that are not consistent . with other shareholder interests,’ he told Bloomberg. But Mr Murdoch has denied News Corp is all about him, after . saying last week the company is ‘the collective creativity and effort of . many thousands of people around the world’. America’s end of the embattled News Corp . is reeling from accusations of journalistic malpractice from across the . Atlantic and is desperately trying to distance itself from the News of . the World. It follows criticism of the media mogul . for trying to tame the mounting crisis after he tried to save the BSkyB . deal, protect News International CEO Rebekah Brooks and close the . tabloid newspaper. News Corp’s value crashed 13 per cent . last week following the closure of the News of the World after reports . employees had intercepted the voice mail of murdered UK schoolgirl Milly . Dowler. 'We trust that readers can see through the commercial and ideological motives of our competitor-critics,’ a Wall Street Journal editorial said in today’s newspaper as it tried to defend itself. The editorial criticised The Guardian - referred to as a publication that ‘give(s) Julian Assange and WikiLeaks their moral imprimatur’ - for its ‘lectures about journalistic standards’. ‘They want their readers to believe, based on no evidence, that the tabloid excesses of one publication somehow tarnish thousands of other News Corp journalists across the world,’ it said. ‘Politicians and our competitors are using the phone-hacking years ago at a British corner of News Corp to assail the Journal, and perhaps injure press freedom in general’. The paper said it was ironic so much moral outrage is being directed at one media company when the British press is known for buying scoops - but claimed it ‘doesn't pay sources for information’. News Corp’s fiercest critics suggest the company has not been apologetic enough for the scandal, which has now engulfed two of Britain’s top policemen - Sir Paul Stephenson and John Yates. Former News International chief Rebekah Brooks was backed by Mr Murdoch until last week and was arrested yesterday in London. Controversial: The Wall Street Journal editorial criticised The Guardian - referred to as a publications that 'give(s) Julian Assange and WikiLeaks their moral imprimatur' - for its 'lectures about journalistic standards' ‘The shell of invulnerability that Rupert Murdoch had around him has been cracked,’ Boston University professor James Post told the Washington Post. ‘His credibility and the company’s credibility are haemorrhaging.’ News Corp's widely traded Class A . shares fell 69 cents, or 4.4 per cent, to $14.96 in early afternoon . trading on Monday. The shares are down 15.5 per cent since the end of . June, compared with just 1.7 percent for the S&P 500 index. Mr Murdoch, 80, and his son, James, 38, are preparing for a UK parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday, when they will be questioned on their roles and responsibilities in the phone hacking scandal. News Corp’s recent slump has cut more than $6billion off the combined value of the shares that give the Murdoch family control over the company, reported the Washington Post. Some News Corp directors have suggested Mr Murdoch, company chairman and CEO, is in denial over the fallout from the scandal and does not realise how much it has destroyed what he has built. His allegations received little traction at the time and they were never properly substantiated. Resurfacing: Dan Cooper, former Fox News executive, made allegations about a 'Brain Room' But now suggestions by a former . executive of Fox News that it had a ‘Brain Room’ in its New York . headquarters where employees could easily view private telephone records . are re-emerging. Dan Cooper wrote in 2008 that his own . phone records had been hacked by the TV station and Fox News chief . Roger Ailes was running a room for counter-intelligence efforts and . other ‘black ops’. His . allegations have resurfaced this week after the phone-hacking scandal . that has dragged the name of News Corporation through the mire and . caused huge problems for Rupert Murdoch. ‘Most people thought it was simply the research department of Fox News,’ he wrote in a blog post. ‘But . unlike virtually everybody else, because I had to design and build the . Brain Room, I knew it also housed a counterintelligence and black ops . office. So accessing phone records was easy pie.’ Just . two months ago his allegations were mentioned by journalist Tim . Dickenson in Rolling Stone magazine, who said Mr Ailes had created a . ‘brain room’ which required security clearance to get in. Down we go: This graph shows how News Corp's share price has plummeted since the start of July . Together: Former News International chief Rebekah Brooks, right, was backed by Rupert Murdoch, left, until last week and was arrested yesterday in London . ‘People’s faith in the family’s management is diminished,’ media expert Claire Enders told the Washington Post. ‘That too may be very hard to restore quickly.’ ‘The shell of invulnerability that . Rupert Murdoch had around him has been cracked. His credibility and the . company’s credibility are haemorrhaging' Boston University . professor James Post . A New York Times piece today said News Corp uses ‘blunt force spending to skate past judgment, agreeing to payments to settle legal cases and, undoubtedly more important, silence its critics’. It added that people are unlikely to see the scandal as ‘an aberrant byproduct of the world of British tabloids’ and ‘the damage is likely to continue to mount’. It pointed out the company’s liquidity is still looking good, with $11.8billion in cash on hand - but that ‘when you throw money onto a burning fire, it becomes fuel and nothing more’. Children: Rupert Murdoch's son James, left, is preparing for a parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday, and his daughter Elisabeth, right, will be concerned about how the scandal will impact on the family name . News Corp said in April it would settle lawsuits and offer compensation to some public figures who had sued the company, following a phone-hacking lawsuit battle with celebrity publicist Max Clifford. The Guardian alleged at the time that the company paid him $1.6million to drop his case in 2010. News Corp has paid more than $600million to settle cases in which it was accused of unfair competition over the last three years, reported the Washington Post. The company said in February it would pay $125million to Insignia Systems over a case relating to U.S. in-store advertising and $500million to marketing firm Valassis Communications last year. Earlier this month as the phone-hacking scandal exploded, he abandoned a bid for BSkyB, shut the 168-year-old News of the World and lost the support of all three major political parties in Britain.","U.S. authorities verify probe into Daily Mirror report NOTW offered to pay for private phone records of terror victims .

"By . Victoria Wellman . UPDATED: . 04:33 EST, 2 March 2012 . People often play at naming children way before they even conceive a baby and now, thanks to Twitter, the game just got more fun. A recent trending topic using the hashtag #uglybabynames, has set the social networking site on fire with amused users eager to share their ideas of the most unfortunate names parents could call their offspring. Suggestions range from old-fashioned monikers like Phyliss and Ronald to the more obscure Tyquasia, Sausagea (pronounced Saw-sage-uh according to the tweet) and Nevaeh which is 'heaven' backwards. The name game: Twitter users voted Blue Ivy, Beyonce and Jay-Z's baby's name (left), and 'whatever Snooki calls her child' (right) among ugliest baby names . Beyonce Knowles and Jay-Z may not be as entertained by the list, that Babble.com rounded up alphabetically, seeing as Blue Ivy featured a number of times. A blogger on Babble's Strollerderby blog published a summary, keeping faithful to the website's mission statement that recognizes parenting as: 'Rapturous, backbreaking and hysterically funny.' You ugly: Blue Ivy features on Babble.com's round-up of the list . Not included in the US-based parenting website's list was the popular idea that whatever name . reality star Snooki chooses for her baby, will win the prize for the . ugliest. Perhaps the most inventive is La-a which is pronounced, La-dash-a, according to a user named Girl's Got Issues who explains: 'The dash don't be silent.' Some Twitter enthusiasts aren't impressed by the idea of calling out ugly names however. A few have responded to the trend by sticking up for the babies themselves and saying that they're all beautiful no matter what they're called. No doubt they would have something to say to one user who claims all babies are 'useless' and therefore the concept of the trending topic is similarly pointless. Interestingly Babble has erred from listing any of the alternative, bohemian names that are popular nowadays among young, cosmopolitan parents but that some users claimed were their least favourite. Names like Autumn and Apple were included in the tweets but left off the round up by the award-winning parenting resource. Perhaps this is no surprise given the names of the founders' own children.

Murder convict John Massey, who escaped from Pentonville Prison on Wednesday, was arrested today in Faversham, Kent . One of Britain’s longest serving murderers, who escaped from Pentonville prison in north London two days ago, has been arrested in Kent, police said. John Massey, 64, was captured at an address in Faversham this afternoon following an 'intelligence-led operation', according to the Metropolitan Police. Massey, who had broken out of jail twice before, accomplished his most . dramatic escape using a makeshift rope to scale the walls of the . Victorian-built prison. Both of Massey’s previous escapes were . to see ailing family members and this time he acted after his ill 86-year-old mother appealed to see him. Friends of his family said he had . learned only a few days ago that his mother May, who has Alzheimer’s . disease, had been calling out his name at a care home in Kent. Yesterday armed police kept . watch on the home as a huge manhunt continued to search for the . ‘potentially  dangerous’ killer. The escape on Wednesday is a huge . embarrassment for the authorities, not least because it is the third . time Massey has slipped from their grasp. A friend of his mother . said: ‘May is getting very old now, she is in her eighties, and she has a . touch of Alzheimer’s. She has been crying lately and asking for John.’ Massey was sentenced to life in 1976 . for shooting bouncer Charlie Higgins, 36, with a sawn-off shotgun after . being thrown out of an East London pub for fighting. He was also . convicted of attempting to shoot a policeman dead after being chased in . his Aston Martin getaway car. An Old Bailey judge jailed the . carpenter for a minimum of 20 years but he has become one of the . country’s longest serving prisoners because of his repeated escapes. Lifer: Massey (above) was jailed in 1976 for murdering a bouncer outside an Essex club after a drunken row . Daring: Massey climbed over a wall at Pentonville Prison using a makeshift rope . Pentonville Prison has held some notorious inmates down the years. The jail houses Category B and C prisoners - and not the most serious Category A cases. Oscar Wilde spent time inside Pentonville before being transferred to Wandsworth in the late 19th century. More recently, Pete Doherty spent six weeks inside for possessing cocaine last year, while Boy George and George Michael have also been held there. In 2008, Blake Fielder-Civil, Amy Winehouse's then husband, was jailed at Pentonville for causing grievous bodily harm. The prison, in Islington, north London, holds up to 1,250 inmates and has been used since 1842. Convicted arsonist Julien Chautard escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of the security van he arrived in three years ago. His latest break-out took place at . category B Pentonville Prison, in Islington, and appeared . to have been carefully planned. Massey is suspected of hiding in the . roof of the gym building as other inmates returned to their cells on . Wednesday afternoon. He then used a makeshift rope – . believed to have been strung together out of sheets – and a pair of . heavy  duty gloves to scale the high  prison wall. Guards monitoring CCTV cameras saw the . rope and raced to the perimeter wall at about 6.30pm but were too late. They suspect he was assisted by someone outside. A source said: ‘The guy went to the gym and then hid in the roof and  just waited and then escaped from there.’ Prison staff have been banned from . speaking about the escape, but one added: ‘He’s done this before, he’ll . be back.’ Massey’s first escape was in 1994 during a home visit when he . calmly walked out of a social club while his guards played pool and . drank. He fled to the Costa Del Sol and spent three years on the run before being caught and returned to  a Britain. In 2007 he was released on parole but . was told he must live in South London and could not stay with his . family. But he broke the conditions by travelling to stay with his . father, Jack, 82, who was dying at the Royal Free Hospital, in North . London. Afterwards, Massey said: ‘My dad had . travelled the length and breadth of this country a thousand times in 30 . years in order to visit me in various god-forsaken and dingy prisons. ‘I could not fail him or my mother. To do so would have buckled my shoulders with guilt of unspeakable things to come.’ Two years ago he absconded from Ford . open prison in West Sussex after being refused permission to visit his . terminally ill sister Carol, who was in the same hospital where his . father died. Murdered: Bouncer Charlie Higgins seen with friend Patricia Clark before he was shot dead by John Massey . She died two weeks later but rather than hand himself in Massey went to live with his mother and was not caught for ten months. Last night, the sister of Massey’s victim said she was disgusted at his escape. Mother-of-three Carol Spooner, 64, of . Braintree, Essex, said: ‘I was stunned to hear it was the third time he . had escaped. It is disgraceful. ‘As far as I am concerned, a life . sentence should mean just that. 'He should die behind bars. ‘I was very . close to my brother and went to each day at court during the trial. I . can still remember the jeers of  his family, saying “At least ours is . still alive”.’ Pentonville was described by prison inspectors as one of Britain's most . challenging jails to run last year, but the inspection also found 'no . obvious problems with physical security'. In 2009 a convicted arsonist escaped from Pentonville by clinging to the underside of a security van. Julien . Chautard was sentenced to seven years in jail at Snaresbrook Crown . Court in February 2009, but spent just minutes inside Pentonville before . slipping out underneath the van he had arrived in.

A 67-year-old man has described the terrifying moment his boat started sinking off the coast of Mexico after a collision with a whale so powerful that the stern of the 22-ton vessel was lifted out of the water. Max Young returned home to Sacramento on Friday, ten days after the breaching whale slammed onto the bow of his 50-foot boat during a solo voyage. Mr Young, was on the final leg of a journey from the East Coast to Emeryville, California, when the 55-foot-long whale hit the boat just after dark on June 12. Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Max Young (pictured) was described by the US Coast Guard as a 'seasoned sailor' 'The head of that whale would have . had to have cleared at least 12 feet (from the water) before he came . down on the boat,' said Mr Young. 'I could . see its head. It must have been a young whale because he only had a few . barnacles.' Mr Young was not hurt in the collision, . but the steep angle of the boat sent him sliding down the deck toward a . pile of sea bags. He said he was only about 10 feet away from the whale . at the time of impact. Within a few seconds the whale slid . back into the water, but not before causing severe damage to the . sailboat and leaving behind evidence that it had been injured in the . encounter. 'I saw a piece of rubbery type of material,' he said. 'It was skin from the whale.' But Mr Young had other things to worry . about. Water was gushing in through what he later discovered was a . massive crack, the boat's steering was damaged and any possible help was . hours away. Mr Young said he was about 40 miles off . the western coast of Mexico, or about 400 miles southwest of San Diego. While the boat's bilge pumps struggled to pump out the ocean water, he . went to work trying to get the boat back on course. Whale of a tale: Max Young of Sacramento, 66, was rescued on Wednesday after his sailboat was hit by a whale . Rescuer: Lieutenant Amy Kefarl, of the US Coast Guard, (pictured) reassured Max Young he would be rescued . Young activated an emergency beacon, . which alerted the U.S. Coast Guard.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 13:52 EST, 1 August 2011 . Illegal migrants will find it 'even easier' to enter the EU if Turkey is allowed to become a member before its border controls are strengthened, MPs have warned. They fear the country could be used as a gateway into the union and raised concerns about people trafficking and drug smuggling. In today's report the influential Commons Home Affairs Select Committee called for Turkey to be made to demonstrate it has met stringent border control rules set by Brussels before accession. Easier: It will be simpler for illegal migrants, such as these trying to board a lorry in Calais, to get into the EU if Turkey becomes a member state, MPs have warned . Turkey's membership would extend the EU's external border up to Iran, Iraq and Syria. The report said the land border between Greece and Turkey constitutes the main loophole for irregular immigration into the EU. It added that thousands of migrants are entering the EU through Turkey every month, many aiming to reach the UK. But the committee said it believed that the risks posed in relation to organised crime were 'considerably outweighed' by the potential benefits of Turkey joining, mainly because of the opportunities it would bring for increased cooperation. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: 'It was clear from our visits to Turkey and Greece that, despite the willingness of the authorities to tackle the problem of illegal migration into the EU through this region, much more needs to be done. Easy: The report said the land border between Greece and Turkey constitutes the main loophole for irregular immigration into the EU . 'In particular, we require a collective commitment from Greece, Turkey and the European and international law enforcement agencies to share intelligence and work together to bring down the criminal gangs who are responsible for bringing thousands of migrants into the EU each month. 'I am concerned that, if action is not taken now, it will become even easier for migrants from countries such as Afghanistan and Iran to enter the EU once Turkey is a member. 'The UK Government and its EU partners must therefore do everything they can to assist Turkey in tightening its border controls.' EU border agency Frontex has helped to reduce the number of irregular crossings, but is unable to turn back migrants. MPs called on Brussels to make special arrangements for Turkey to take on some of the attributes of EU membership prior to full accession, in order to tackle organised drug and immigration crime more effectively. Worry: MPs fear Turkey could be used as a gateway into the union . The report said up to 80 per cent of the heroin trafficked from Afghanistan to western and central Europe comes via Turkey and seizures in Turkey of cocaine bound for the EU are increasing. The committee also called on the Home Office to carry out an impact assessment of the likely scale of legal migration of Turkey nationals to the UK following EU accession. It said forecasts for the whole EU had varied widely at between 500,000 and 4.4 million arrivals in the period up until 2030. The committee said it was cautious about allowing Turkish citizens full freedom of movement and backed the Government's commitment to applying 'effective transitional controls as a matter of course' for all new member states. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: 'There has been a significant drop in the number of illegal immigrants attempting to evade border controls over the past year, so the message is getting through - if you're not legal you're not welcome. 'We are working with other governments to increase their capacity to deal with illegal migration and to raise awareness among potential illegal migrants about how dangerous and unsuccessful these attempts are. 'We are committed to controlling migration to the UK. This government will apply transitional controls for all new EU Member States as a matter of course in the future.'","Turkey's border controls are not strong enough, report warns ."

Kidnapped: Sahil Saeed was seized by four armed men while visiting his grandmother's home in Punjab . A married couple have been convicted of kidnapping a British boy snatched by an armed gang in Pakistan. Muhammed Zahid Saleem, 36, and his wife Monica Neruja, 26, were jailed for 10 years each by a court in Spain. Four masked men carrying assault rifles and hand grenades seized Sahil Saeed, five, in March 2010 while he was visiting his grandmother's home in Punjab. Saleem and Neruja, who negotiated a £100,000 ransom and travelled to Paris from their home near Barcelona to pick up the cash, were arrested along with a friend following a dramatic police operation spanning four countries. Three judges who tried them in the city of Tarragona an hour's drive south of Barcelona acquitted them of belonging to a criminal organization. They had been accused of masterminding the kidnap of Sahil, found wandering along in a field following a 13-day ordeal. But the judges concluded four men who swooped on the house in Jhelum where Sahil's family were staying ahead of their return to Oldham, had planned a robbery and kidnapped the youngster as an afterthought to secure more money. In a 78-page written sentence released today they concluded: 'The accused Muhammed Zahid Saleem and Monica Neruja assumed the role of negotiators for the ransom payment and sent at least part of the money to Pakistan after taking off commission. 'But there's not enough proof that they plotted with the armed robbers an assault on the house where Sahil Saeed was staying as well as the illegal detention of the people inside that house.' The friend arrested with them in Spain, Muhammed Sageiz, was acquitted of kidnap. In the dock: Muhammed Zahid . Saleem (right) and his wife Monica Neruja (left), shown hiding their faces in court at the trial's opening, were jailed for 10 years each. Muhammed Sageiz (centre) was acquitted of kidnap . State prosecutors had claimed all three suspects had planned, organised and carried out Sahil's kidnap with four people of Pakistani origin. They told the court in Tarragona Saleem travelled to Pakistan at the end of 2009 and in February 2010 to plan the snatch. Sahil was snatched on March 4 2010, . as his family were preparing to return to their home town of Oldham . after a holiday in Pakistan. The . court in Tarragona heard a gang of four men beat the family, gagged . them and tied their hands and legs, pointed a pistol at Sahil's father . Raja Saeed, 28, and told him: 'We know you are a businessman and you and . your family have a business in the United Kingdom. 'We are taking your son. If you try to contact the police or involve them, we will kill him.' The . gang stole 1,900 rupees, jewellery and two mobile phones belonging to . the family, fleeing with the boy in the early hours of March 4. A . series of ransom demands were then made from phoneboxes around north . east Spain demanding a ransom for the Sahil's safe return.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said America is ready to support Kofi Annan's push to find a diplomatic solution to Syria's war. Speaking at the start of a European visit focused heavily on the Syrian bloodshed that has killed around 15,000 people, Clinton said she supported the former UN secretary general's efforts to 'prepare for a democratic transition that leads to a post-Assad Syria.' 'I've been in close consultation with special envoy Kofi Annan about the prospects for a meeting that would focus on a roadmap for political transition in Syria,' Clinton said during a visit to Helsinki. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton meets with Finnish Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen in Helsinki at the start of her visit which will focus on the Syrian bloodshed . Annan today confirmed talks between world powers would take place in Geneva on Saturday, but plans have been beset by differences between the United States and Russia on the need for political transition. Washington, facing a domestic outcry over human rights atrocities committed by the Syrian army, has pressed for an immediate end to the violence and for President Bashar al-Assad -- never an ally of the West -- to step down. Russia, which has ties to Syria's military and the ruling Ba'ath Party that stretch back to the Soviet era, has stressed the need for Syrians to decide their own future and has not ruled out Assad staying in power. Clinton said she had spoken with Annan 'three times in the last 24 hours'. He 'has developed his own very concrete roadmap for political transition, he has been circulating it for comments and when I spoke to him yesterday I conveyed our support for the plan that he has put forward'. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is in Finland ahead of a conference set to take place in Geneva on Saturday . 'We think it embodies the principles needed for any political transition in Syria that could lead to a peaceful, democratic and representative outcome reflecting the will of the Syrian people.' Top State Department officials have previously insisted Clinton would only attend the meeting if all parties agreed on the need for political transition in Syria. 'If we can meet on the basis of that roadmap, with everyone agreeing before we arrive in Geneva that this will be the document we are endorsing by our presence, then this makes a lot of sense and we support it,' Clinton said today. 'But we want to make sure any country that participates firmly supports the envoy's transition plan and his original six point plan,' she added. Clinton said there was 'great hope that this perhaps can be a turning point in the very tragic circumstances affecting the Syrian people'. If an agreement were to be reached at the meeting, 'that's the first time that the international community will really evidence a direction that I think Assad will have to respond to,' she said. 'If (Annan) is able to pull off such a meeting and if he is able to get people there who up until now have either been on the sidelines or actively supporting or protecting the Assad regime, then that gives heart to the opposition. It also disheartens a lot of the regime insiders.'","Clinton was speaking at the start of a European visit focused heavily on the Syrian bloodshed .

With a beautiful sunrise coming over the horizon, it seems a shame to stay indoors - but that doesn't apply if you're looking through the cupola windows of the International Space Station.

Earlier this month, an astronaut noticed a sunrise while the Station rolled over the South Pacific, 240 miles northeast of the Marshall Islands - and pulled out a camera to capture the moment . 'The International Space Station was over the central South Pacific about 240 miles northeast of the Marshall Islands when one of the Expedition 31 crew members positioned on the station's Cupola captured this image of the sun coming up,' says a Nasa spokesperson. Expedition 31 is the current Space Station mission, which began on April 27 this year after the previous crew left for Earth on board a Soyuz TMA-22 re-entry vehicle. The mission is scheduled to continue until July 2013. The Station recently docked with Space X's unmanned Dragon capsule, which was the first commercial space flight to dock with the station. Incredible: Astronaut Don Pettit took these pictures 240 miles above Earth from the International Space Station . Known as ‘star trail’ pictures, they are taken over a period of 10-15 minutes by cameras mounted inside the station. However, Pettit found that using the latest digital cameras meant that he had to combine several images to create the effect. 'My star trail images are made by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes,' he said. Star-trail images: Pettit achieved the pictures by taking a time exposure of about 10 to 15 minutes then combining several images on top of one another . 'However, with modern digital cameras, 30 seconds is about the longest exposure possible, due to electronic detector noise effectively snowing out the image. 'To achieve the longer exposures I do what many amateur astronomers do. I take multiple 30-second exposures, then 'stack' them using imaging software, thus producing the longer exposure,' the astronaut explained.

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 10:49 EST, 25 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:34 EST, 26 June 2012 . Postponed: A Ukrainian court on Monday adjourned the tax evasion trial of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko (file photo) In a move that will spare Kiev further negative publicity during the Euro 2012 soccer tournament, a Ukrainian court postponed the high-profile tax evasion trial of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko until mid-July. Western outrage over Tymoshenko's prosecution - which she says is a politically-motivated witch hunt - has already prompted some European politicians to boycott matches at the football championship, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland. In a hearing in the city of Kharkiv, Judge Kostyantyn Sadovsky adjourned further hearings into the tax evasion case until July 10 at the request of state prosecutors, ordering a medical examination of Tymoshenko, 51, in order to establish whether she is fit to attend her own trial. Receiving treatment for a spinal condition in a state-run hospital in the same city, the co-leader of the country's 2004 Orange Revolution has said she is not well enough to be present. The decision by some politicians to boycott the Ukrainian segment of the football tournament was prompted by a Kiev court, which in October sentenced Tymoshenko to seven years in jail for abusing her powers in 2009 when prime minister, a charge she denied. That conviction - an unexpectedly harsh punishment - triggered international condemnation. The latest case involves tax evasion and embezzlement charges dating back to the 1990s. According to an official list of charges published in the Kommersant Ukraine newspaper on Monday, Tymoshenko's now-defunct gas trading company caused damages equivalent to about $4 million to the state, while she personally evaded paying $85,000 in taxes. Protests: Supporters of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko are seen in a protest tent camp in central Kiev today . Outrage: An England soccer fan walks past a placard put up by supporters of the jailed opposition leader while  a protestor holds a placard displaying a photograph of jailed former Ukrainian Prime Minister . Twice prime minister, Tymoshenko denies wrongdoing. Tymoshenko was not present at the brief hearing today, but dozens of her supporters rallied outside the building chanting ""Free Yulia!"". Former European Parliament President Pat Cox and former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski visited Tymoshenko on Sunday in a hospital. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, the man she accuses of orchestrating her persecution in revenge for her political opposition to him, has repeatedly said he hopes the Euro 2012 football tournament will help boost Ukraine's international image and attract inward investment. Any fresh legal moves against Tymoshenko during the event would have been certain to attract unwanted publicity and analysts say the court is reluctant to rule until after the championship finishes on July 1 when the country is out of the media spotlight. Watching: Former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski attends the hearing at a court in Kharkiv today -he visited Tymoshenko on Sunday in a hospital where she is being treated for a severe spinal condition . The European Union has already shelved landmark agreements on free trade and political association with the former Soviet republic in response to Tymoshenko's prison sentence. Brussels sees the case as an example of selective justice and has urged her release, but Ukrainian prosecutors have instead heaped more charges on Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko helped lead the 2004 Orange Revolution protests which derailed Yanukovich's first bid for the presidency, but narrowly lost the 2010 presidential election to him. She and a number of her opposition allies have since faced corruption-related charges which Tymoshenko has dismissed as politically revenge. Separately, hearings in her appeal against the initial abuse-of-office conviction will resume on Tuesday in Kiev.","Western outrage over Tymoshenko's prosecution has already prompted some European politicians to boycott matches at the football championship .

"By . Beth Stebner . UPDATED: . 06:25 EST, 1 January 2012 . A jealous lover charged with murdering nursing student Michelle Le sent her progressively angrier and threatening text messages about her baby’s father, telling him that Miss Le ‘dug her own grave’ and ‘would not be around much longer.’ Giselle Esteban’s texts all stemmed from jealousy that Miss Le was having an affair with her ex-boyfriend, the prosecution said. Transcripts presented in court Friday showed a chilling timeline in the months preceding Miss Le’s disappearance of the San Francisco student who was later found in a makeshift grave in a canyon. Tragic end: It was revealed in court that Michelle Le's (pictured) convicted murderer sent threatening text messages in the months following her disappearance . Scott Marasigan, who has a child with Esteban, continually denied any affair with Miss Le, but never believed him, prosecutor Butch Ford told Mercury News. He said Esteban became ‘so enraged that she began essentially to hunt down Michelle.’ Marasigan told the jury that he began saving Esteban’s crazed text messages to protect himself after he himself faced domestic violence charges earlier. He said Esteban had taken a knife out and threatened to kill herself and their unborn child if he didn't leave Miss Le. While Mr Marasigan testified that he did in fact date Miss Le several years ago, their relationship was never sexual in nature, and he said they were nothing more than friends. Incriminating evidence: Esteban texted her baby's father telling him 'your wh*** will get what she deserves' Esteban’s text messages – which began February 10 with the message ‘I hope you find what you are looking for in someone as disgusting as her’ - grew increasingly antagonistic throughout the months. 'I'm not sorry for the consequences your actions have brought on you both.. You have dug your own graves.' -Text message Giselle Esteban sent to Scott Marasigan . She demanded that he cut her out of his life completely ‘for our family’s sake. 'It’s the only thing that will . convince me you are trying to be better. Otherwise, be prepared to be . held accountable for your bad actions and decisions,' she wrote. On . March 2, Esteban texted: ‘Michelle has dug her own grave by being a . home wrecker and wh*** … She won’t be an issue for much longer.’ On May 29, two days after Miss Lu disappeared, she texted Mr Marasigan: ‘Where’s Michelle?’ Miss Le was reported missing in May after she failed to return from a break during her shift at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Centre in Hayward. Devastated family: Michael Le (left) Michelle's brother and cousin Krystine Dinh (right) at a news conference in September after Esteban was convicted of killing Miss Le . Her white Honda SUV was later seen driving out of the garage by video surveillance later that evening. The vehicle was found abandoned a few blocks away and it was unclear whether the student was driving it or not. Police believe an assault happened at the hospital’s car park as CCTV shows Esteban at the scene before and after Miss Le’s disappearance. Detectives said they found traces of Miss Le’s blood inside her SUV, as well as on one of Esteban’s shoes during a search of Esteban’s home. Convicted: Giselle Esteban, 27, of Union City, was convicted in September for Michelle Le's murder after her body was found in a makeshift grave . Esteban told KGO-TV at the time that she hated Miss Le because she was friends with the father of Esteban’s young daughter. But Esteban insisted she had nothing to do with her disappearance. Esteban’s ex-boyfriend, who had custody of their daughter, got a restraining order against her three days before Miss Le’s disappearance. Friday's testimony didn’t go into the specifics surrounding Miss Le’s death, but evidence placed Esteban’s DNA on a stain on Miss Le’s steering wheel. Miss Le’s DNA was found on a bloodstain on Esteban’s shoe. Esteban is scheduled to be in court next on January 20, when she is to be arraigned. February 10: 'I hope you find what you are looking for in someone as disgusting as her. I wish I had a kid with a better man.' February 17: 'Cut her out for our family's sake. It's the only thing that will convince me you are trying to be better. Otherwise be prepared to be held accountable for your bad actions and decisions.' February 18: 'If you aren't sorry for anything you have done with that wh*** and are not willing to make things right for (our daughter's) sake, then no, I'm not sorry for the consequences your actions have brought on you both. ... You have dug your own graves.'February 25: 'FYI, you pushed me into insanity with you putting wh**** before your own family. You should have loved (their daughter) and I more, but you loved sex and attention more. Those two are exactly what you are going to get now.

Otherwise you bring your own hell on you and all you love.'February 28: 'I was loving and open and took care of you and Michelle, and you two lied to me, not once but three times. It's only fitting you pay for your mistake. So will she.'March 2: 'And Michelle has dug her own grave by being a homewrecker (sic) and a wh***. ...

This followed a difficult year for the chain, which saw a 10 per cent drop in sales over the course in the 49 weeks up to January 7. Game, which has 610 stores in the UK and Ireland, saw its share value plunge more than 24 per cent after it announced its sales figures. Despite the weak performance, Game still outperformed the overall games . market, which was down 13.1 per cent for the 49-week period. The group, which has 1,300 stores worldwide trading under the Game and .

Game will close 39 stores this . year and the company is on track to have gone from 610 to 550 stores in the UK by . 2013. The company has become renowned for its big budget TV adverts - hiring high-profile actors, singers and sportsmen for its campaigns. Another campaign last summer featured high-profile Hollywood stars, Green Lantern actor, Ryan Reynolds and Transformers actress Rosie Huntington-Whitely . But M&S said its expectations for full-year profit remain unchanged despite the impact its decision to invest in promotions will have on gross margins as the company plans to offset this with additional savings and 'tight management' of costs. M&S chief executive Marc Bolland said the company had 'performed well in a challenging trading environment'. The group reported a 1.1 per cent increase in clothing sales across all-stores, reported its biggest ever quarter for childrenswear, as well as strong sales of menswear and sleepwear. M&S said food sales benefited from an increased range of products as the company introduced 600 new lines. The company's website also saw sales increase 22.4 per cent, which was boosted by a move to extend the next-day delivery deadline and the launch of its Christmas Food to Order service online, which contributed to a 12 per cent increase in orders. Total group sales, which include 300 international stores, increased 2.4 per cent excluding VAT, driven by continued growth in India and China, as well as good start to its newly opened flagship store in Paris. But there was no update on the progress . of the group's £600 million revamp of it stores which it hopes will make . its outlets easier to shop in and boost sales of its own brands.

He said: 'Although not yet evident, . management are making progress on the new strategy, and we soon expect . to see some benefits flow through to sales and profit from enhancement . to the stores, the brand segmentation, and the navigation.' A surge in sales in the final week before Christmas helped department store chain Debenhams weather tough autumn trading today. The . company, which has 170 stores in the UK, Ireland and Denmark, said . warmer weather throughout October and November impacted sales until a . record Christmas week left trading for the 18 weeks to January 7 level . on a year ago. Shares jumped 8 per cent after investors expressed relief at . the trading performance, which compared with some forecasts for a . decline of up to 2 per cent. Debenhams rolled out drastic discounts across its stores of up to 40 per cent in a . week-long promotion in November to try and boost its festive season sales. The strategy paid off after Debenhams said like-for-like sales including VAT improved by 6.5 per cent in the five weeks to December 31. Chief . executive Michael Sharp said he was pleased with the performance: ""We . traded well despite the difficult environment as evidenced by strong . sales in December, including record sales in the week before Christmas."" Much of the growth came from the internet after online trade jumped by 35% in the 18 weeks to January 7. Elsewhere, department store Debenhams . said like-for-like sales excluding VAT in the 18 weeks to January 7 were . flat as unseasonably warm weather in October and November hit sales and . uncertainty in the wider economy affected consumer confidence. But the company, with 170 stores in the UK, Ireland and Denmark, said a last minute surge in sales in the final week before Christmas helped the department store chain weather the tough autumn trading and left trading for the 18 weeks to January 7 level on a year ago. Meanwhile, video games retailer Game warned today that it is set to breach a banking agreement after a dismal Christmas recorded a 12.9 per cent decline in like-for-like sales in the eight weeks to January 7. This topped off a difficult year for the chain after a 10 per cent drop in the 49 weeks to January 7, . Game, which has 610 stores in the UK and Ireland, saw its share value plunge more than 24 per cent following today's update.

An ex-Army officer who pocketed £36,000 in disability handouts after claiming he could barely walk was caught playing golf with his old comrades. Eric Roper, 64, from Liverpool said he struggled to walk further than 20 yards and couldn't even climb a flight of stairs. But following an anonymous tip-off, investigators from the Department of Work and Pensions secretly recorded him teeing off during a regimental reunion.

Officials who were hidden in the trees at the golf club saw Roper walk around the course without difficulty, playing out of bunkers and putting on the green. He eventually came third in the King's Regiment Annual Golf Day Out . The former Army officer seen leaving Liverpool Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to three offences of making false representation to obtain benefits over an eight year period . Officials who were hidden in the . trees at a golf club saw Roper walk around the course without . difficulty, playing out of bunkers and putting on the green. He subsequently came third in the King's Regiment Annual Golf Day out in Formby, Merseyside. At . Liverpool Crown Court, Roper, of Mossley Hill, Liverpool, wept as he . pleaded guilty to three offences of making false representation to . obtain benefits over an eight year period. He was given a suspended prison sentence after it emerged he had repaid £30,000. Earlier . the court heard how Roper had served in the armed forces from a young . age, spending nine years in the First Battalion and a further 15 in the . Lancastrian Battalion before becoming a warrant officer in the King's . Regiment of the Territorial Army. After . being made redundant in 2000 from his administration job, he suffered a . heart attack and had to sign up for disability benefits - legitimate for . the first two years. But when his condition improved in . 2002, instead of informing the DWP of his increased mobility and . improved health, he told them on three separate occasions how his . conditions kept him from walking more than 20 yards. Prosecuting Miss Martine Snowdon said . 'He made a claim for disability living allowance for a number of years . on the basis he was incapable of work due to his illness. 'Roper said after his coronary artery . bypass graft he suffered from unstable angina, back problems, . osteoarthritis in his right shoulder, deafness, dizzy spells and . breathlessness, among other symptoms.' Miss Snowdon told how in June 2010, an anonymous tip-off triggered a DWP investigation into his claims, made in April 2004, April 2006 and June 2010. She said: 'He was seen to be playing golf. 'Since 2002 he'd been a member of a golf club and had been seen to be playing without discomfort and walking further than he said he could.' Following the investigation, he was questioned and admitted his crimes in interview, initially claiming to have been confused by the nature of the criteria but accepting responsibility for the deceit. The total amount taken between October 2002 and 2010 was £36,241. Defending Miss Rebecca Blaine said the father-of-four was a man of previous good character who had made 'full and frank admissions' when questioned. 'He feels deep regret and he is deeply ashamed of his actions and of letting his family down. He is a man who from the very outset has been wholly remorseful.' Ms Blaine said the proceedings had had a negative effect on his health and he had been invited to make further claims, albeit at a lower level than before. Ms Blaine spoke of his contribution to society and told how he had repaid £30,000 of what he owed. 'He liquidated his life savings and sold the family vehicle and that's how he has been able to repay the money. 'This is not a man who lived a life of luxury.' Judge David Swift recapped the details of the case and noted that for the first two years the claim had been legitimate before his condition improved. He told Roper: 'Over a period of six years you continued to receive the benefits notwithstanding that there had in fact been a significant improvement in your condition. 'The disability and mobility problems at that time were not legitimate problems, not as they had been in years gone past.' Roper wept as he was told he would avoid prison with a four month custodial sentence suspended for 18 months, concurrent on each count and included an 8pm to 8am curfew. Speaking after court, DWP fraud manager Steve Sneade said: 'Benefit fraud is not a victimless crime. It's stealing money from the taxpayer, intended for the most vulnerable in our society and the message today is that if you commit benefit fraud you will be caught.' DWP Minister for Welfare Reform, Lord Freud, said: 'It's cases like these that show us why welfare reform is needed. 'We have a duty to the taxpayer to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them.'","Eric Roper, 64, said filmed coming third in a golf competition ."

Education officials are investigating claims that a school broke rules to coach pupils in advance about a crucial national curriculum exam. The Mail on Sunday has seen dozens of examples of coursework from children attending Eastbury Primary School in Barking, East London, which suggest they were told in advance about the contents of the Standard Assessment Tests (SATs) writing paper recently taken by ten and 11-year-olds across the country. Schools can open the exam paper only one hour before the test is due to begin, and teachers are forbidden from coaching children. The Mail on Sunday has seen dozens of examples of coursework from children attending Eastbury Primary School in Barking, East London, which suggest they were told in advance about the contents of the SATs . A complaint was first investigated by the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham in March and the school was cleared. Now another claim is being probed by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA), the executive body of the Department for Education and Skills which is responsible for the SATs exams. Copies of work from children’s exercise books, which were passed to Mail on Sunday by a source, reveal they were asked to complete several pieces of creative writing both in classrooms and as homework from March this year. The exam paper – which the pupils sat on May 15 – contained instructions to complete similar pieces of work. The allegations are particularly harmful because the school’s headmistress, Carole Thomas, is training to be an inspector with the schools’ regulator, Ofsted. The source said: ‘Teachers were told to let pupils watch YouTube videos on very specific subjects and to prepare Powerpoint presentations for them so they were fully informed.’ The first allegations were investigated by the London Borough of Barking. A spokesman said: ‘A thorough investigation of a previous allegation of “coaching”  very firmly concluded that  there was absolutely no substance to the claims and no case for the school to answer. 'The headteacher at Eastbury is someone in whom the local authority has real confidence.’",Claims are particularly damaging to the London school as the headteacher is training to be an inspector .

Choice words: Yesterday David Cameron warned that Syrian president Bashar Assad was 'bent' on plunging his country into a full scale civil war . Yesterday David Cameron warned that Syrian president Bashar Assad was ‘bent’ on plunging his country into a full scale civil war. A deadline to withdraw troops from populated areas has been widely flouted amid fresh reports of violence. Speaking at a press conference in . Jakarta, Indonsesia, Mr Cameron said 1,000 people have died this week, . with 300 killed over the Easter weekend alone. Former United Nations secretary . general Kofi Annan has been pushing Damascus to withdraw its troops from . cities and halt violence. But Mr Cameron said the bloodshed was . continuing, adding: ‘Far from fulfilling their commitments, the regime . is cynically exploiting the window of diplomatic negotiations to crack . down even harder on its own people. ‘With increasing refugee flows across . international borders, Assad’s actions are now threatening regional . peace and security. We want to achieve a negotiated end to the Syrian . crisis and avoid full-scale civil war. But Assad seems bent on doing . precisely the opposite.’ Mr Cameron urged the UN Security . Council – and particularly Russia – to bear down on Syria. He warned: . ‘It is clear that the world needs to redouble its efforts to stop the . killing and intensify our support to those who oppose Assad’s savagery. Cramped: Thousands of refugees have fled their homes to escape the fighting in this makeshift camp in in Kilis, just across the Syrian border in Turkey . ‘This is a decisive moment. The UN . Security Council now has a clear responsibility to throw its full weight . behind Kofi Annan’s plan and to insist that it is implemented in full.’ Tony Blair joined in the criticism saying Assad and other undemocratic regimes in the Middle East had a ‘very clear choice’ between accepting evolutionary change, or facing revolution. He told Radio 4’s World at One programme: ‘They are given chance upon chance to come to a realistic way forward, which is a transition to a democratic form of government, which is what their people want. On each occasion they are given that chance they make promises and then they break those promises. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would renew efforts to persuade Russia to apply pressure on Assad to stop the violence. Safe: Children play behind the fence in the compound having fled their homes as fighting shows few signs of calming . Makeshift city: As these dramatic aerial photographs show, life is a squeeze for these forgotten victims of a conflict that has already claimed countless lives . Make do: Those who now live in the camp have no idea when they will be able to return to their homes . The Prime Minister will today urge Muslims around the world to inflict the ‘greatest defeat’ on ‘dead-end’ Islamic extremists by embracing democracy. Mr Cameron will point to nations such as Indonesia as proof that Islam and democracy can ‘flourish’ against ‘dangerous foes’. In a speech to students at a university in Jakarta, he will say that extremists feed ‘prejudice, persecution, terror and violence’. ‘These extremists try to turn Islam into a closed and warped ideology that is opposed to democracy,’ he will say. ‘What Indonesia shows is that in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, it is possible to reject this extremist threat and prove that democracy and Islam can flourish alongside each other.’ Following the Bali terrorist bombings in 2002, Mr Cameron will say: ‘Some around the world even questioned whether Indonesia might face a bleak dead-end choice between extremism on the one hand and a return to dictatorship on the other. ‘Indonesia is showing us that it is possible to develop a democracy and a modern economy that neither compromises people’s security nor their ability to practise their religion. Meanwhile damning photos have emerged . showing the makeshift cities that reveal the true scale of the . humanitarian crisis sweeping across conflict-ravaged Syria. Refugees have flocked in their thousands to camps like this in Kilis, just across the Syrian border in Turkey.

On Tuesday UN Middle East envoy visited another camp in nearby in Hatay before flying to Iran to beg for in solving the deepening crisis as bombs continued to fall across the war-torn nation. In . a desperate friend-finding mission to Tehran, special envoy Kofi Annan . said Iran could play a vital role in halting Syria from slipping into . all-out civil war. His plea came as activists reported fresh violence a day before an international cease-fire is supposed to take effect. Iran is one of Syria's strongest . allies, and former U.N. chief Annan went there to bolster support for . his faltering plan to stop the country's slide toward civil war . 'Iran, . given its special relations with Syria, can be part of the solution,' Annan said during a news conference with Iran's Foreign Minister Ali . Akbar Salehi.

Most of us knew because there . was no pressure for Bashar Assad to actually stop the killing. We think . it's going to require military action on the ground to get him to . leave.'

"By . Jason Groves . UPDATED: . 04:08 EST, 22 February 2012 . The Leveson inquiry into Press standards has created a ‘chilling atmosphere’ that threatens free speech in Britain, Michael Gove warned yesterday. In an outspoken defence of the Press, the Education Secretary cautioned against allowing ‘judges, celebrities and the establishment’ to set the boundaries of free speech because they had a vested interest in shackling the media. Mr Gove, one of David Cameron’s closest allies, also appeared to question the Prime Minister’s decision to set up the inquiry last year, warning there was a danger it would produce ‘a cure that is worse than the original disease’. The Leveson inquiry into Press standards has created a 'chilling atmosphere' which threatens free speech in Britain, Michael Gove warned . Addressing a Westminster lunch, Mr Gove acknowledged the need to investigate alleged wrongdoing at the News of the World. But he said there were already laws to prevent reporters ‘going rogue’, including specific offences of intercepting voicemail messages and bribing public officials. Gove warned there were 'dangers' in the wide-ranging inquiry chaired by Lord Justice Leveson . Mr Gove, a former senior journalist at The Times, said there was a natural temptation for politicians to ‘succumb’ to demands for an inquiry by ‘establishment’ figures in the wake of a major scandal. But he warned there were ‘dangers’ in the wide-ranging inquiry chaired by Lord Justice Leveson. He said: ‘There is a danger at the moment that what we may see are judges, celebrities, and the establishment, all of whom have an interest in taking over from the Press as arbiters of what a free Press should be, imposing either soft or hard regulation. ‘What we should be encouraging is the maximum amount of freedom of expression and the maximum amount of freedom of speech.’ He added: ‘Journalists should be more assertive in making the case for Press freedom, and politicians should recognise that we have nothing to gain and everything to lose from fettering a Press which has helped keep us honest in the past and ensured that the standard of debate in this country is higher than in other jurisdictions. ‘The big picture is that there is a chilling atmosphere towards freedom of expression which emanates from the debate around Leveson. Michael . Gove was born in 1967 in Edinburgh and was educated at Robert Gordon’s . College, Aberdeen and then Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University. He has been a journalist since he left university, working for local and national newspapers, radio and TV. His career began as a trainee reporter for The Press and Journal in Aberdeen. He . joined The Times in 1996 as a leader writer. He also held the position . of comment editor, news editor, Saturday editor and assistant editor. Mr . Gove has also worked for the BBC's Today programme, On The Record, . Scottish Television, and was a regular panelist on BBC Radio 4's The . Moral Maze and has appeared on Newsnight Review on BBC 2. In addition he is also a published author and has written books including a biography of Michael Portillo. He . was first elected as an MP for Surrey Heath in May 2005. Following the . 2010 General Election he was appointed Secretary of State for Education. He is married to Sarah, a journalist at The Times. 'I think that there are laws already in place that we should respect and principles already in place that we should uphold that are central to ensuring that this country remains free.’ Mr Gove said previous inquiries into national scandals had produced reports that ‘give birth to quangos, commissions, and law-making creatures that actually generate over-regulation, over-prescription, and sometimes a cure that is worse than the original disease’. He said the Food Standards Agency, which was born out of the BSE crisis, had gone from being a ‘body that was responsible for governing the safety of our food to one that became yet another meddlesome and nanny organisation that was telling us what we should eat and in what proportion’. And he said 800 pages of guidance produced in the wake of the deaths of Victoria Climbie and Baby P was ‘impenetrable and has still not ensured that our children are safer today than they were two, three or five years ago’. He acknowledged that he had sometimes been ‘irritated’ by Press coverage of his own conduct, but insisted that the media had a key role to play in holding politicians to account. Sources close to the Education Secretary last night said he supported the decision to set up the inquiry but was concerned about the direction it had taken. Downing Street said the Prime Minister stood by his decision to order the inquiry, but insisted he valued the role played by the media. His official spokesman said: ‘He has made very clear on a number of occasions since how important he thinks it is that we have a free Press and free media that is able to challenge governments and others.’ “One of the things that struck me over the past few months is that a new set of stereotypes every bit as misleading and caricatured as those about politicians, have grown up around journalists and about the media and the way in which it operates. I am thinking in particular about the Leveson inquiry and the debate that has surrounded it.“One the things that struck me about politics is that there is a particular tendency to which all politicians are tempted to succumb. In the aftermath of a specific crisis, when an undoubted wrong has been done, there is a desire to find a judge, a civil servant, a representative of the great and the good, inevitably a figure from the establishment, to inquire into what went wrong, and to make recommendations about what might be put right.“It is a natural thing for politicians to do, but there are dangers associated with it. Sometimes the recommendations of that report may be modest, proportionate and sane. But sometimes they give birth to quangos, commissions, and law-making creatures that actually generate over-regulation, over—prescription, and sometimes a cure that is worse than the original disease.“If we look back at government’s response to various crises in the past, there have been some profound crises that have affected all of our consciences. And because they have affected our consciences, people have wanted to be seen to act. So for example in the immediate aftermath of BSE and the problems associated with the quality of our food, the Food Standards Agency was quite rightly set up,“But one of the problems is that the Food Standards Agency morphed over time from being a body that was responsible for governing the safety of our food to one that became yet another meddlesome and nanny organisation that was telling us what we should eat and in what proportion.“The same thing applied to the vetting and barring scheme and also to the Every Child Matters agenda in the wake of the tragic deaths of Victoria Climbie and subsequently Baby Peter. In both cases the tragic death of two children led to an attempt to ensure that we more effectively policed those that worked with young people but the result of that was a situation where Phillip Pullman had to apply for a Criminal Records Bureau check in order to go into a school to read to children.“In the same way we developed guidance which is 800 pages long, is impenetrable and has still not ensured that our children are safer today than they were two, three or five years ago.“I see the same dangers in the Leveson inquiry and in the way in which the debate on press regulation are moving now. It is undoubtedly the case that there were serious crimes which were committed, but we know those crimes were serious because they broke, if the allegations are proven, the already existing criminal law. There are laws against the interception of messages, there are laws against bribery, there are laws that prevent journalists like any other professional, going rogue. Those laws should be vigorously upheld, vigorously policed. However, there is a danger at the moment that what we may see are judges, celebrities, and the establishment, all of whom have an interest in taking over from the press as arbiters of what a free press should be, imposing either soft or hard regulation. What we should be encouraging is the maximum amount of freedom of expression and the maximum amount of freedom of speech.""The reason why I say there is a particular danger at the moment is that because we all know that newspapers are under threat, under threat from the pressure of advertising migrating online, under threat from a variety of new news sources, that is why whenever anyone sets up a new newspaper, as Rupert Murdoch has done with the Sun on Sunday, they should be applauded and not criticised, and that is why journalists should be more assertive in making the case for press freedom, and politicians should recognise that we have nothing to gain and everything to lose from fettering a press which has helped keep us honest in the past and ensured that the standard of debate in this country is higher than in other jurisdictions.”“The big picture is that there is a chilling atmosphere towards freedom of expression which emanates from the debate around Leveson. I think that there are laws already in place that we should respect and principles already in place that we should uphold that are central to ensuring that this country remains free.”","He said there was a danger it would produce a 'cure that is worse than the original disease'

Claims by four of Wall Street's main market makers against Nasdaq over Facebook's botched IPO are likely to exceed $100million, as they and other traders continue to deal with thousands of problems with customer orders. A technical glitch delayed the social networking company's market debut by 30 minutes on Friday and many client orders were delayed, giving some investors and traders significant losses as the stock price dropped. The exchange operator is facing lawsuits from investors and threats of legal action from brokers. Faceplant: Nasdaq may lose the Facebook listing entirely after having just obtained it . Four of the top market makers in the Facebook IPO - Knight Capital, Citadel Securities, UBS AG and Citi's Automated Trading Desk - collectively have probably lost more than $100million from problems arising from the deal, said a senior executive at one of the firms. Knight and Citadel are each claiming losses of $30million to $35million, potentially overwhelming a $13 million fund the exchange set up to deal with potential claims. Nasdaq also has to contend with the outside prospect that it could lose the Facebook listing entirely after having just obtained it. Facebook shares ended regular trading on Thursday up 3.2 per cent at $33.03, about $5 short of their offering price. Mishap: A technical glitch at Nasdaq delayed Facebook's market debut by 30 minutes on Friday and many client orders were delayed, giving some investors and traders significant losses as the stock price dropped . Action on the stock, however, has essentially become secondary to the fallout from the IPO - its price, its size, its execution and questions about selective disclosure of its financial prospects. Regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin are now looking into how the IPO was handled. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is also reviewing the matter.BROKERS UP IN ARMSAdvisers familiar with the situation said many investors are now finding out, nearly a week after the fact, that their orders were not executed at the prices they thought. Fidelity, in a statement, said it was working with regulators and market makers on its clients' issues 'and we will continue to do so until we are confident that Nasdaq has done everything it can to mitigate the impact to our customers.' Decline: One prominent plaintiffs lawyer said what happened with Facebook was reminiscent of the dot-com bubble . Morgan Stanley is also still tending to trade orders placed by brokerage customers on Friday, two people familiar with the situation said. Nasdaq has said all orders were returned by 1:50pm EDT last Friday, but a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney source said it did not get trade information in a 'systemic, orderly way. Late Thursday, the company held a call with its brokers and told them adjustments would be made to thousands of trades so that no limit orders would be filled at more than $43 a share for stock from the IPO day, a person familiar with the call said. While brokerages may have received confirmation of trades made on Friday, many were still handling customer disputes over what price they received on the trades, officials said. The question is 'who is going to eat the cost' of compensating those investors, said Alan Haft, a financial adviser with California-based Kings Point Capital LLC, which has $200 million in assets. One prominent plaintiffs lawyer said what happened with Facebook was reminiscent of the dot-com bubble. 'This is just another spin on the same game of unfair treatment of individual investors,' said Stanley Bernstein of Bernstein Liebhard. He chaired the plaintiffs' committee in an IPO class-action suit challenging the role of investment banks in more than 300 IPOs between 1998 and 2000. The litigation ended in a $586 million settlement in favor of the plaintiffs.MARKET MAKERS LOOMThe claims by market makers Knight and Citadel could end up dwarfing some of the brokerage issues, though. 'They are certainly facing the specter of some significant lawsuits if this pool is not enough,' a source familiar with Knight's situation said of the Nasdaq claims pool. Citadel has sent its losses to Nasdaq for potential compensation, a source familiar with the matter said. Citadel's hedge fund was not affected. The head of trading at Instinet said it still had no idea when Nasdaq would respond to requests for accommodation - essentially, compensation for the order problems - or if those requests would be honoured. Cleaning up: Facebook's IPO has caused a mess that is currently being investigated by two congressional panels . 'Were gonna be looking at a loss on our books' if Nasdaq does not honor the requests, Mark Turner said. 'We basically made most of our clients whole because Nasdaq told us to go through the process and file for accommodation. If Nasdaq does not accommodate us we're going to end up taking a loss.' 'I don't know that I want to put a dollar amount on that but it's not nearly as significant as Knight's ($30-$35 million),' he said. Citadel and Knight, as market makers to the Nasdaq, honor their clients' buy, sell and cancellation orders. The orders are supposed to be processed by the exchange within milliseconds, but there was a nearly two-hour delay in processing Facebook orders at the Nasdaq. During that time, market makers had no idea where their orders stood. And in reality, the price clients bought or sold at was sometimes different than the price they actually got. For example, Facebook shares began trading with an opening cross price - the first price at which those not in on the IPO could buy or sell - of $42 per share. If an order to sell 10,000 shares at $42 went in at that time, but wasn't filled until later in the day when shares were trading at around $39, a market maker like Citadel or Knight would make up the difference - in this case, at a cost of $30,000.FEWER PROBLEMS ELSEWHERESeveral analysts who cover exchanges said Nasdaq's legal liability should be limited, though. According to the analysts, securities rules give Nasdaq wide discretion in determining what, if any, compensation it should pay to customers who claim that they suffered losses due to trading execution. Under exchange rules, Nasdaq's liability regarding client losses from certain trading issues is limited to $3 million a month. Market makers will be arguing that Nasdaq was so grossly negligent that its actions during the IPO opening override the limits, said a source with knowledge of Knight's situation. Zucked: Mark Zuckerberg saved $174 million by cashing out tens of millions of shares of Facebook stock early Friday when the price was above $38 a share . Other firms said they did not have similar problems to those of Knight, raising questions about the scope of the losses. 'The problems were where people were trying to cancel orders; we didn't have that,' said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. 'Because we didn't have a problem doesn't mean there weren't problems.' E*Trade Financial Corp said its market making operations realized losses of 'well under a million dollars.' Charles Schwab Corp had a 'small number' of the 'tens of thousands of clients' who traded Facebook whose issues still have not been resolved, a spokesman said. 'Each one requires some analysis to resolve, which can be time consuming.' Shares of Nasdaq fell 1 cent to $21.80 on Thursday. As of Thursday's close the stock was down 5.2 per cent from its last close before the Facebook debacle. Over the same period NYSE Euronext is down just 0.1 per cent. The slide in the shares is adding to the pressure on Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld, who defended the exchange's performance at its annual meeting last Tuesday.

"By . Graham Smith . PUBLISHED: . 09:48 EST, 29 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:38 EST, 29 May 2012 . A three-year-old boy left paralysed after being struck down by a rare immune disorder has made an amazing recovery. As Owen McLoughlin - then two - lay in hospital, his parents were warned he might never walk again. But the toddler stunned doctors by fighting back and taking his first steps. Full recovery: Owen McLoughlin, pictured with his parents Taflyn and Sean, was left paralysed after being struck down by rare immune disorder Guillain-Barre Syndrome . His mother Taflyn McLoughlin, 35, said: 'My biggest fear was him not recovering and being paralysed for the rest of his life. 'To look at him now, you wouldn’t know how ill he was. He has fought through it. 'He’s a miracle. That’s the only way I can describe it.' Owen was paralysed from the neck down after falling ill in February last year. Guillain-Barre Syndrome - pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray - is a rare serious disease of the peripheral nervous system, a nerve network that controls the body's movements. The body's immune system attacks these nerves causing inflammation. This causes pins and needles and can lead to temporary paralysis. Around one in four will need a ventilator to help with breathing but most recover between a few weeks and a few months. Around 1,500 people in the UK develop the condition each year. The exact cause is unknown but more than half of sufferers have a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before they develop the syndrome. Mrs McLoughlin and her husband Sean, 40, from Solihull, West Midlands, first realised something was wrong when their son started limping. The couple took him to their local GP who thought he might have an infection in his hip and referred him to Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham. Owen was kept in hospital for a couple of days while doctors ran tests, which came back clear. They then thought a virus could be to blame and Owen was allowed home, but his parents soon took him back in after his limp worsened. Mrs McLoughlin said: 'He was refusing to sit or stand and was crying out in pain. 'He was up all night screaming and very uncooperative. He was shouting: ""Get off me"". We didn’t know what it was. It was terrifying.' Doctors were baffled and ran a succession of further tests over the next week. An MRI scan and a painful lumbar puncture revealed Owen had Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a disorder where the body’s immune system attacks the nervous system by mistake. His parents, who kept a vigil at their son’s bedside, were warned the disorder could be life threatening if his breathing muscles became affected. Poor outlook: As Owen - then two - lay in hospital, his parents were warned he might never walk again . Immediately, doctors have Owen a high dose of immunoglobulin to reduce the attack on his nervous system but his condition deteriorated until he was paralysed from the neck down. For seven weeks, he could not move and would not eat, causing him to rapidly lose weight. Mrs McLoughlin said: 'He was very weak. He couldn’t even hold his head up. 'I kept thinking why was it happening to us? It was devastating. I was shattered by it. 'I asked the medical staff if he would walk again and they wouldn’t answer me. I tried not to be negative but I knew that wasn’t a good sign. 'I was frightened he would be paralysed for the rest of his life.' Owen was in so much pain he needed the strongest dose of painkillers allowed for a child of his age. Mrs McLoughlin said: 'He was in and out of sleep. They were pumping painkillers into him. It gave him half an hour of relief then he started screaming again. 'He wouldn’t let us touch him. It was awful not being able to hold and comfort my child.' Inpirational: Owen, pictured with his older sister Alys, amazed doctors by making a full recovery . After a second course of treatment, Owen slowly started to respond and he moved for the first time. His mother said: 'One day, he brought his hand up to reach his toy dog. It was just a huge relief. I remember phoning everybody.' With the help of intense physiotherapy, Owen finally regained enough strength to leave hospital and go home to be with his parents and four-year-old sister Alys. He still could not walk or sit up unaided and continued to have rehabilitation at home and in the hospital. Mrs McLoughlin, who is an occupational therapist, said: 'He was like a seven-month-old baby. We had to back through every single milestone. 'We never knew if he was going to do it. It was an emotional rollercoaster. I was in tears the first time he walked. 'We really pushed him. I did whatever therapy I could to make him better.' Now, a year on after his life-threatening battle with the disorder, Owen is back to full health and has started nursery. Mrs McLoughlin said: 'Today, Owen is like a normal little boy. He’s really well. He’s always running around and loves playing on his scooter. 'I look back at the photos all the time. Owen doesn’t remember it but I’ll show them to him when he’s older. It’s important for him to know and understand. 'It shows his strength of character.'

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . UPDATED: . 11:18 EST, 8 February 2012 . A baby who survived major organ surgery died after being transferred to a hospital where 'bad failings' proved fatal, an inquest heard yesterday. Ethan Cross was born with his organs outside his body, and underwent corrective surgery aged just a few days old. Two months later he was on the road to recovery but a hearing was told that his brain was fatally starved of oxygen when a breathing tube was inserted incorrectly. Tragic: Ethan Cross, who was recovering well after major organ surgery, died after 'bad failings' by hospital staff an inquest heard . At the inquest, deputy coroner Andrew Cross described that staff at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth 'failed collectively' to save Ethan's life. He also noted a lack of experience and confidence in a new doctor who was expected to take charge of the emergency. Mr Cross said: 'In my view there were failings, bad failings even. There was not, however, a total and complete failure. 'Individually competent people failed collectively in this critical situation.' Ethan was born on September 7, 2009 at a specialist hospital in Bristol because doctors . were aware some of his organs were growing outside his body. Aged just a few days old he underwent a major operation to place his organs back inside his body. The inquest heard that, despite a number of minor incidents, he was no longer considered to be in a life-threatening condition and was transferred to Derriford Hospital, Plymouth on November 6 and put on a ventilator. However the two-month-old died on November 14 2009 when a breathing tube that had become dislodged was replaced too slowly. A spokesperson for Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust described that a series of robust changes have now been made at Derriford Hospital . Staff in the neonatal intensive care unit that night included an experienced staff nurse who was tasked with giving Ethan one-to-one care, and a ward sister who had worked on the unit for ten years. There was also two new doctors, a specialist registrar in charge of the ward and a senior house officer. A consultant was on call for the ward when the the 'critical event' happened at around 4am on November 7. Mr Cox said the 'likely trigger' was that Ethan’s breathing tube became displaced from his windpipe into his oesophagus. He noted that staff’s initial response was 'appropriate', including Ethan being given oxygen and increased ventilation and that the consultant, who was telephoned at about 4.15am, was called at the right time. However, before the consultant arrived, the registrar failed to provide 'confident clear leadership'. He described staff had relied too heavily on listening to Ethan’s chest to check whether the tube was in place - a method an expert witness had described as 'notoriously difficult'. Mr Cox said the registrar’s actions demonstrated 'little experience' of the specialist skills required. The tube was finally removed on the advice of the consultant, who was travelling to the hospital. He arrived shortly afterwards and replaced it, but by that time it was too late. Mr Cox recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. Ethan’s mother Shelley Cross, 29, attended the inquest but declined to comment. Robert Antrobus, who represented the family during the inquest, said: 'The family are grateful to the coroner for his thorough review of the events leading up to Ethan’s death. 'Sadly the coroner, delivering a verdict of misadventure, has found evidence of substandard care which has played a significant part in baby Ethan’s death. 'The family does however acknowledge that the Trust have undertaken a full investigation which highlighted problems with Ethan’s care through its serious untoward incidents (SUI) procedure. 'The family sincerely hope that the lessons learned in this tragic case result in other families not having to go through what they did.' The hospital has since apologised, stating that they are 'extremely sorry that there were failings in the care'. A spokesperson for Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We offer our sincere sympathies to the parents and family of baby Ethan. 'This was a very sad case and we are extremely sorry that there were failings in the care given to Ethan. 'As the coroner noted during the inquest, we had undertaken a full investigation into what happened and, as a result, we have made a series of robust changes within our neonatal intensive care unit during the past year.'","Two-month-old Ethan Cross was recovering well from major organ surgery just after birth .

Mother Lisa, 40, of Cottam, Preston, said: 'Jordan has been taken away from us and why, we will never know. 'He was fit as a fiddle. He had said . he was feeling tired but with exams, his driving lessons and new job, we . just put it down to exhaustion. 'John and the paramedic kept on working on him for half-an-hour, but there was nothing. 'It was like switching a light off.' Jordan collapsed during a car journey on Saturday morning and his father immediately drove home instructing his wife Lisa to call an ambulance, while he carried out . CPR. Paramedics arrived, but were unable . to revive the student, who was a football fanatic and dreamed of forging a career as a sports journalist. The family were informed by medics that Jordan had suffered a sudden cardiac arrest.

Under pressure: Jeremy Hunt leaves his home yesterday morning, where he told reporters he would be releasing all emails and texts to his adviser . Beleaguered minister Jeremy Hunt is to hand over all private texts and emails sent to his shamed special adviser in a bid to save his job. By giving them to the Leveson Inquiry, the Culture Secretary said yesterday he believed that his contacts with Adam Smith would show that he handled the BSkyB takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp empire with 'total integrity'. It came as pressure was mounting for a Whitehall inquiry into claims Jeremy Hunt broke ministerial . rules in his dealings with the Murdoch empire. 'I will be handing over all my private texts and emails to my special adviser to the Leveson Inquiry and I am confident that they will vindicate the position that I handled the BSkyB merger process with total integrity,' he told reporters outside his London home yesterday morning. A Westminster sleaze watchdog has this afternoon called for a proper and swift investigation into the case. Sir Christopher Kelly, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the 'obvious' way for this to be done would be for Prime Minister David Cameron to call in his independent adviser on the Ministerial Code, Sir Alex Allan. His intervention increases pressure on Mr Hunt and on the Prime Minister, whose official spokesman has repeatedly made clear that judgments on breaches of the ministerial code is a matter for Mr Cameron only. 'There can be no doubt that the allegations that have been made about the boundaries and behaviours of ministers, special advisers and the civil service need to be properly investigated,' Sir Christopher said. 'It is important for public confidence in the integrity of government and also in fairness to the individuals concerned that this is done - and done reasonably quickly.' Getting on with it: PM David Cameron has so far resisted an inquiry and left a school in his constituency today with cup cakes the children made for him . Yesterday Jonathan Stephens, the Culture Secretary’s most senior civil servant, refused ten times to confirm his version of events when he appeared before MPs. And as Downing Street continued to stand by Mr Hunt, a Tory grandee broke ranks to insist the Prime Minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests, Sir Alex Allan, should look into the affair. Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Commons public administration committee, backed Labour’s demands for the case to be referred to Sir Alex. He said: ‘There was clearly something of a breakdown of good process and good governance. ‘We have a new Cabinet Secretary and he should demonstrate his independence and advise the Prime Minister. If he thinks there has been a prima facie case of a breach of the Ministerial Code, it should go straight to the independent adviser.’ There were also questions over why the affair has been left solely in the hands of the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics. Labour’s culture spokesman Harriet Harman said: ‘Lord Leveson’s inquiry is of huge importance, but it is not in its terms of reference to look into breaches of the Ministerial Code. ‘That is the job of the independent adviser and the Prime Minister will not allow him to look into this.’ Mr Hunt is fighting for his political life after evidence emerged of emails and texts between Adam Smith, his special adviser, and a Murdoch lobbyist during discussions over whether to allow News Corporation’s BSkyB takeover bid. Business Secretary Vince Cable said Mr Hunt should be able to set out his side of the story 'as soon as possible.' But he refused to be drawn on whether he backed the call from Mr Hughes for the case to be referred to Sir Alex. Threat: Rupert Murdoch, who appeared at the Leveson Inquiry this week, questioned Vince Cable saying he was not a fair judge of the bid . 'Jeremy Hunt has made it very clear that . he wishes to state his side of the story. It is absolutely right that . he should be given that opportunity as soon as possible,' he told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One. Mr Cable also insisted he dealt with the BSkyB takeover bid 'fairly and properly' while it was his responsibility. The case was passed to Mr Hunt in 2010 after Mr Cable was secretly recorded telling reporters he had 'declared war' on company chairman Rupert Murdoch. Mr Murdoch told the Leveson Inquiry on Thursday that he expected Mr Hunt to be a 'fairer' judge of the bid than the Business Secretary. Mr Cable retorted: 'As far as my own role in that whole case is concerned, I dealt with that case fairly and properly and when I go before the Leveson Inquiry, I will take the inquiry step by step through the process and explain exactly what happened and the public will then be fully aware of it.' On Thursday night, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes joined calls for an inquiry into whether the Culture Secretary breached the ministerial code of conduct. The senior figure said he could not understand why Prime Minister David Cameron had ruled out referring the controversy over the actions of Mr Hunt’s special adviser to a regulator. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has backed the No 10 stance but Mr Hughes questioned why there should not also be an probe by Sir Alex Allen. Pressure: Text messages sent between News . Corp lobbyist Frederic Michel, left, and Jeremy Hunt were revealed, . mounting pressure on PM David Cameron to launch an inquiry . 'What I cannot understand is why the matter of the ministerial code of conduct, which is to do with do you take responsibility for your special adviser, is not something the Prime Minister should immediately refer to the person who has been given the job of doing that, Sir Alex Alan,' he told BBC1’s Question Time. Asked whether David Cameron agreed with Mr Hughes that an inquiry into potential breaches of the ministerial code was needed, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'No. The Prime Minister made very clear on Wednesday that he has full confidence in the way Jeremy Hunt handled the BSkyB bid.' Responding to the announcement that Mr Hunt plans to hand over emails and text messages relating to the BSkyB bid to Lord Justice Leveson, the spokesman said it was for the Culture Secretary to prepare and present his own submission. 'Incredible': Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was 'incredible' Mr Hunt was still Culture Secretary . A spokesman for Mr Clegg said: 'Jeremy Hunt has made his statement to Parliament and will provide more information to the Leveson Inquiry. That process should be allowed to happen.' Labour claim the Ministerial Code was breached three times as Mr Hunt was supposed to be acting in a ‘quasi-judicial’ role determining whether or not to allow the £8billion bid. Mr Smith resigned on Wednesday insisting his contacts with News Corp lobbyist Frederic Michel went far beyond what Mr Hunt had authorised. The Culture Secretary is confident that emails and texts between himself and Mr Smith demonstrate he did nothing wrong, and is ready to hand them over to the Leveson Inquiry as he tries to clear his name. But there was confusion yesterday over his assertion that the senior civil servant at the Culture Department authorised Mr Smith to act as a ‘point man’ with the Murdoch empire. As he appeared before the public accounts committee, Mr Stephens repeatedly refused to confirm that version of events. Later the department issued a statement saying he had not felt it appropriate to provide further information ahead of its evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. A spokesman added: ‘The Permanent Secretary was aware that Adam Smith was among a small number of individuals in the department who were in contact with News Corp and was content with that arrangement. ‘The content and extent of his contact was done without authorisation, and were contrary to the clear requirements set out by Jeremy Hunt and the Permanent Secretary.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was ‘incredible’ that Mr Hunt was still Culture Secretary and accused Mr Cameron of using him as a ‘firewall’. He said: ‘Why is Jeremy Hunt still in his job? Because David Cameron has questions to answer, and Jeremy Hunt is, if you like, acting as a firewall, and if he goes the questions will then move to David Cameron’s conversations with Rebekah Brooks, with James Murdoch and others.’ While former Labour deputy leader Lord Prescott this morning backed Mr Miliband and told the Today programme: 'Hunt must answer in Parliament not to the Leveson Inquiry.' But former Tory leader Lord Howard responded in the radio debate that Mr Hunt will now be called early by Justice Leveson and should then be given the chance to explain himself.","Releasing his contacts with his adviser will prove he broke no rules in dealing with Murdoch empire, he said .

A young man who thought he had a common cold had in fact contracted a rare and incurable disease and now has just a 20 per cent chance of living beyond the age of thirty. David Tyzak, 20, from Barnstaple, Devon, contracted Wegener’s granulomatosis in December. It is an autoimmune disease where the body's own immune system turns on itself after being triggered by a bacterial or viral infection. It affects just one in 70,000 causes inflammation of the blood vessels. The nose, throat, lungs and ears usually become swollen and inflamed. The kidneys can be involved, too, while for some people it affects the . eyes and skin. David who dreams of a career in the . film industry nearly died after being admitted to North Devon District . Hospital on New Year’s Eve. What he thought was a common cold soon developed into a life threatening condition. He . saw a number of different doctors and was misdiagnosed with the flu, . pneumonia, meningitis and tuberculosis, before his symptoms were . recognised as Wegener’s. By this point, he was practically blind and deaf, coughing up blood and running a 40-degree fever. His arms were in such agony he was virtually paralysed. David said: 'The pain in my arms was unbearable, it felt like someone had shattered all my bones right from my shoulders down to my fingers; I couldn’t even move them. 'I was completely delirious - I was convinced I was being chased by Russians.' Mr Tyzak is taking a break from university while he recovers . He was put on a strong course of steroids and chemotherapy, the only treatment known to force the disease into remission. But he reacted badly to the medication and advice was sought from Cambridge-bused Dr David Jayne the UK’s leading expert on Wegener’s as David underwent a life-saving plasma exchange. He is now out of hospital but receiving treatment at the home he shares with his parents and sister Rebecca. But the disease has transformed the fun-loving young man who is now practically housebound and unable to see much of a future. He said: 'The disease never leaves you; it could re-emerge at any time. 'If I so much as catch a cold it could be life threatening,' he said. With treatment people can recover, with the disease going into remission or at least kept in check. However, there is a 50 per cent chance of a relapse even with the use of immunosuppressant drugs and corticosteroids to control inflammation. Frequent hospital checks are required as the disease can also lead to kidney failure. David, who has suffered complications in his lungs, has had to put his return to film studies at Bournemouth University on hold as a result. But he and his family are determined to help raise awareness of the disease and give something back to the charity which offered them support. David’s mother, Barbara Tyzak, said Wegener’s charity Vasculitis UK had been extremely supportive. She said: 'Vasculitis UK got us through a really tough time; when I was sat by my son’s bedside not knowing if he was going to live or die they were there for me. 'We want more people to know about this disease and raise awareness because if David had waited any longer for diagnosis and treatment it would have been too late.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:11 EST, 5 April 2012 . A state investigation has found no . evidence of child abuse by a Kennedy heir who tried to take his newborn . son from a maternity ward, a family lawyer said today. Attorney Robert Gottlieb said Douglas . Kennedy, son of the late Senator Robert F Kennedy, received a letter from . New York's child protection agency declaring that a report of child . abuse had been determined to be unfounded. On January 7, he tried to take the . newborn boy from the maternity ward at Northern Westchester Hospital in . Mount Kisco, more than 30 miles from Manhattan. Nurses objected, and the . hospital reported the incident to the state. Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with wife Molly and their son Bo, or 'Boru', was charged over the fracas . The Office of Children and Family Services investigated after Kennedy was charged with child endangerment in February. Susan Steele, an agency spokeswoman, said today by email that confidentiality laws prohibit her from commenting. Gottlieb said the agency's . investigation is separate from the criminal prosecution and doesn't . negate the endangerment charge against Kennedy, but he hopes prosecutors . will take it into consideration. 'It is our fervent hope that the . Westchester district attorney will continue to evaluate this case, and . we remain hopeful that the DA will ultimately dismiss that charge,' he . said. Hospital: Douglas Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk outside . 'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy . Gottlieb said the probe covered the hospital encounter and a home visit. 'They investigated everything,' he said. He said the agency's finding was 'the first glimmer of reason that has surfaced in this case since it erupted in the press.' The finding has nothing to do with charges of physical harassment against Kennedy stemming from the same encounter. One nurse says Kennedy twisted her arm as she tried to keep him from leaving with the baby, and another says he kicked her. Anna Margaret Lane and Cari Maleman . Luciano told MSNBC they were involved in a vicious scuffle with the 44-year-old after he tried to get in a lift with his son. Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7 . Kennedy, 44, has said he was . protecting the child as the nurses tried to grab him. ‘We kept saying to him: “We need to . step out of the elevator, we need to get the baby to your room”,’ Ms . Luciano said, adding that Mr Kennedy replied: ‘I don't have to listen to . you. It's my child.’ Mr Kennedy claims that as he was . leaning against a door to back out of the maternity ward, a nurse came . toward him, he lifted his left knee and it came into contact with the . nurse to protect his son. That . nurse, Ms Luciano, fell backwards and Ms Lane then accused Kennedy of . twisting her arm. But Mr Kennedy denies this. He returned the baby to . the maternity ward rather than go outside. ‘I . still have pain in my arm,’ Ms Lane told MSNBC. Ms Luciano added: ‘I . wanted to make sure the baby was safe and secure and he brought his leg . up and kicked me. I went flying through the air.’ Fox . News reporter Mr Kennedy, who is married to Molly, is the son of late . politician Robert ‘RFK’ Kennedy - brother of former president John ‘JFK’ Kennedy. RFK was fatally shot in 1968. ‘It is sickening to think that our . simple desire to take our son outside for fresh air has been warped into . a charge of child endangerment,’ Douglas and Ethel Kennedy said in a . statement. Lucian Chalfen, spokesman for the . district attorney, wouldn't comment. Douglas Kennedy, a reporter for Fox . News, is due in Mount Kisco Court on April 12.

A fly-tipper who illegally dumped more than a million used tyres – earning £2.5million in the process – has been told by a court to pay back just £122. The derisory sum was said to be the only ‘available asset’ left in a bank account linked to Carl Steele’s now defunct company, FCM Logistics (Tyres). Steele, 34, had left a ‘trail of destruction’ on the countryside by renting land and blighting it by storing hundreds of thousands of tyres without permission. He made his fortune through . undercutting business rivals who would have had to pay a charge of 80p . per tyre to use official waste sites. When the 34-year-old was caught and jailed for 15 months in November, environmental campaigners celebrated. But their joy was short-lived when . last month the businessman – dubbed the Million Tyre Man – was released . less than a third of the way into his sentence. Now they have been further angered by the proceeds-of-crime hearing. Steele was even given six months to pay the £122 by Lincoln Crown Court. He refused to comment when he left the . hearing, but a friend said afterwards: ‘He’s happy and relieved. It is a . bit of a result but he’s served his time and hasn’t got any money to . give them. What else do they want?’ Landscape blighted: Steele dumped more than a million tyres . Victims, however, were shocked by what they saw as soft justice. Peter Steward, a member of Crouch . Conservation Trust, which retrieved fly-tipped tyres from the River . Crouch in Essex, criticised the ruling. ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous they can only get such a small amount of money back. ‘They need to investigate it further . to find out where all the money has gone. Dumping tyres, whether it’s in . a river or on land, causes major pollution.’ Steele lives in a four-bedroom . farmhouse on a sprawling rural site in Deeping St Nicholas, . Lincolnshire, where his parents also reside. He is understood to drive a . white van. Between October 2009 and January 2010 . he hired land in five counties – Essex, Norfolk, Yorkshire, . Worcestershire and Lincolnshire – and used the spots to store the tyres. One site at Full Sutton Airfield, . Yorkshire, where more than 125,000 were left, drains into a tributary of . the River Derwent, which is a source of drinking water. Despite . warnings from the Environment Agency on 20 occasions, Steele failed to . register the operation. When legal action began against him he simply . rented new sites. Environment Agency officials found . 3,000 tyres at the Lincolnshire site and said the number grew to 400,000 . as their investigations continued. Four other sites, with a further . 800,000 tyres, were found later. Landowners have been left a bill of £260,000 to clear the mess. Steele admitted six charges relating . to the illegal storage and treatment of waste and was jailed at Lincoln . Crown Court on November 7. His business had a turnover of £2,540,768. The judge at Lincoln Crown Court could only order Carl Steele to hand over £122 . Judge Sean Morris said at the time: . ‘You have left a trail of destruction for other people to pick up. I am . quite satisfied that your motive was the long-term prospect of making . big money.’ Steele was set free on March 15 on licence under the early release programme. The Environment Agency refused to . speculate yesterday as to whether Steele had moved his proceeds abroad. But it insisted it had a confiscation order for £2.5million, which would . apply to any future money he came into. A spokesman said: ‘Having proven his . guilt, we took him to court again to take away his illegal profits. The . £2.5million confiscation order can be revisited in the future.’","Carl Steele released after serving just a third of his 15 month jail sentence .

Influential: Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, has been asked to take on an unpaid role advising civil servants . One of the co-founders of Wikipedia has been asked to advise the Government on how Whitehall can make policy decisions more transparent, it emerged today. Jimmy Wales, 45, will become an unpaid adviser across all government departments, helping civil servants develop 'innovative' new technology. Mr Wales is expected to also advise civil servants on how the public can be better engaged through the internet as part of 'open government' initiatives. Mr Wales co-founded Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that can be edited by anyone, in 2001 with philosopher Larry Sanger. According to the latest figures, Wikipedia is now the world's sixth-most visited website, with more than 400milllion people viewing it every month. A Whitehall source told the Daily Telegraph last night that Mr Wales was one of a number of unpaid advisers being brought into advise civil servants. The Florida-based former futures trader will 'help to deliver new ways that we can (harness) the internet and technology' the source added. It is unclear how long he will be an advising civil servants for, or who appointed him to the role. The announcement of the advisory role for Mr Wales follows several online 'crowdsourcing' initiatives launched by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. Not long after taking office, ministers revived the e-petitions website launched under the previous government. Other initiatives have included Number 10's Red Tape Challenge, which asked people to nominate regulations for disposal, and a 'crowdsourcing' exercise asking public sector workers to submit suggestions on how to reduce wasteful spending as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review. The Government is also working on placing all its services and data on to a single site dubbed www.gov.uk. Success story: Since its launch in 2001, Wikipedia has become the sixth-most visited website, with more than 400milllion people viewing it every month . Mr Wales's appointment was announced by Rohan Silva, a senior Downing Street aide to Prime Minister David Cameron, last night at the South by Southwest technology conference in Austin, Texas. In a talk, Mr Silva, reportedly told the audience that the government wanted to 'usher in the age of open source government'. '(We) must use new technology to recast politics for the 21st century,' he said in a lecture entitled the Open Source Government, Enterprise and Innovation. The appointment comes just days after it was revealed that MPs and their staff are tweaking their Wikipedia pages in bid to hide embarrassing information. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism discovered almost 10,000 individual examples of people inside the Houses of Parliament directly editing Wikipedia articles. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which carried out the investigation on behalf of the Independent, found that nearly one in six MPs have had their online Wikipedia entries changed from within Parliament. Dozens of the alterations appeared to be attempts to erase embarrassing or disputed allegations made during the 2009 expenses scandal.

A U.S. Air Force pilot has told how he attacked people at random after taking prescribed amphetamines, as new figures reveal that the number of active-duty troops taking sedatives and antidepressants has increased eightfold since 2005. Last year, Patrick Burke was flying a B1 bomber from the Persian Gulf back home to South Dakota, while taking a tablet of Dexedrine every four hours during the 19-hour journey. After landing the aircraft, the father-of-one attacked a fellow crewman at random, striking him in the . head and yelling incomprehensible phrases about being kidnapped, . according to the Los Angeles Times. Exonerated: Patrick Burke, center, pictured with his wife Elise, left, and son Jackson, right, was found not guilty of various charges after military psychologists found he suffered from 'polysubstance-induced delirium' He then directed his anger at their female driver, wrestling her to the ground, and telling her: ‘Me and my platoon are looking for terrorists.' He grabbed her keys, drove away and crashed the car into a guardrail. Burke was charged with auto theft, drunk driving and two counts of assault. But - in an unprecedented ruling - he was found not guilty 'by reason of lack of mental responsibility' after four military psychologists concluded the young lieutenant suffered from 'polysubstance-induced delirium', caused by alcohol, lack of sleep and the 40 milligrams of Dexedrine. 'Three drinks over an entire evening is not enough to black somebody out, but I don't remember 99 per cent of what happened over the rest of that evening,' Burke told the newspaper. 'It was kind of like I was misfiring on the cylinders.' Questions: Staff Sgt. Robert Bales is accused of murdering 17 Afghan civilians but his lawyers would like to find out if her was taking any medication . The rare ruling comes as new figures obtained by the Los Angeles Times reveal that more than 110,000 active-duty Army troops last year were taking prescribed antidepressants, narcotics, sedatives, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety drugs. Chad Eric Oligschlaeger, . a Marine corporal based at Twentynine Palms, began showing symptoms of . Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after his first tour in Iraq. Despite military doctors recommending that he receive in-patient treatment, he was sent on his second tour. There he displayed more pronounced . symptoms of PTSD including, nightmares and hallucinations, and was . prescribed 12 different types of medication. Two months before the 21-year-old was due to return home, he was found dead on the floor of his room in the barracks. An autopsy concluded that the death was accidental due to multiple-drug toxicity, or interactions among too many drugs. Pfc. David Lawrence was just 20 years old when he shot a Taliban commander in the face during a schizophrenic episode. Just weeks before the incident, he . had been flown to a Combat Stress Clinic where he was prescribed two . psychotropic drugs, Trazodone and Zoloft, and returned to his . base. His condition worsened, with the voices inside his head, and his hallucinations, intensifying. Lawrence's prison sentence was . later reduced from 12-and-a-half to ten years after it was shown that he . suffered from schizophrenia and PTSD. Psychiatric . experts concluded that he was 'unable to appreciate the nature and . quality or wrongfulness of his conduct at the time of the alleged . criminal misconduct.' Moreover, nearly 8 per cent of the Army is now on sedatives and more than 6 per cent is on antidepressants, reflecting an eightfold increase since 2005. Bart Billings, a former military . psychologist, told the newspaper: 'We have never medicated our . troops to the extent we are doing now.... And I don't believe the . current increase in suicides and homicides in the military is a . coincidence.' This had led many military lawyers and psychiatrists to link their clients' aberrant behavior to the prescription medications they are taking. In the most recent case, the attorneys of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who was accused of murdering 17 Afghan civilians, have asked for a list of all the medicines the 38-year-old was taking. But US military officials claim that the use of drugs in the army is comparable to that by the civilians, arguing that prescribing medications is a calculated - but, at times, necessary - risk. 'It's not that we're using them more frequently or any differently,' Col. Carol Labadie, a pharmacy consultant for the Army surgeon general, told the newspaper. 'As with any medication, you have to look at weighing the risk versus the benefits of somebody going on a medication.' David Rudd, director of the National Center for Veterans Studies, believes medication is necessary in many cases. 'I will tell you that we currently run a treatment program at Fort Carson where we're treating suicide attempters, and medicines are critical sometimes early in the process of treatment. 'Now, I will tell you that we don't want people to be on medications for indefinite periods of time, but I certainly have seen medicine save lives,' he told Public Radio International.","More than 110,000 active-duty Army troops took antidepressants, sedatives and other prescription medications last year ."

Technology patents are big business as giants such as Apple and Amazon battle to ban each others products - and Microsoft may have laid hands on the H-bomb of the 'patent wars'. The Windows giant beat Facebook, Amazon, eBay and other tech heavyweights to buy AOL's patent 'trove' for more than $1 billion. AOL said it was selling more than 800 patents related to advertising, search, e-commerce and mobile to Redmond, Washington-based company, surprising investors with the size of the deal and sending AOL shares up more than 40 percent. Spokesmen for Google, Facebook, eBay and Amazon were not immediately available for comment. A final buyer was selected late on April 5, Armstrong said. The sale includes technology rights from AOL's current and former businesses, ranging from Netscape, ICQ and MapQuest to CompuServe, Advertising.com and others, according to a source close to the matter. The sale process, which AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong described as a 'full-blown dynamic auction,' started last fall after board approval. Armstrong said he made a call to Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer alerting him of the decision to sell the patents. The auction included e-commerce companies Amazon and eBay, both of which have been largely absent from the recent patent wars, as well as Google and Facebook, according to the source. Technology companies in recent years have sparked a frenzy for patents, bidding up prices in a defensive move to keep competitors at bay. The AOL deal is one of the larger patent auctions in recent times, representing roughly $1.3 million per issued patent, according to the source. An employee of South Korean mobile carrier KT holds a Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet (front) and Apple Inc's iPad tablet: The two companies have been involved in a bitter international battle over alleged similarities between the two devices . AOL's share price has risen 40% after news of the deal . That compares with the bankrupt Nortel Networks patent auction last year - considered a blowout $4.5 billion sale of its 6,000 patents - for roughly $1.05 million per issued patent, the source said. The Nortel deal sparked a wave of patent sales and litigation and played a part in AOL's decision to launch a patent auction. Google is in the process of buying Motorola Mobility Holdings for $12.5 billion mainly for its intellectual property. Google also acted as the stalking-horse bid for Nortel Networks' wireless patents. Microsoft was part of the group led by Apple Inc that won the Nortel patents.

Former French President Francois Mitterrand was given a fatal intravenous injection to end his suffering at his own request, a new book revealed. Mitterrand,  the only socialist President of the Fifth Republic from 1981 to 1995 and an opponent of euthanasia, died in his eightieth year in 1996. He had been suffering from cancer for fifteen years but his illness remained a closely guarded secret whilst he was alive. His personal doctor Claude Gubler revealed in a book named ‘The Great Secret’ published after the President’s death that Mitterrand had suffered cancer during the whole of his Presidency and that in his last year in power he was ‘incapable of carrying out his Presidential duties’. Dr Gubler also maintained that he had been forced to falsify the President’s health bulletins giving him a clean bill. The book was banned and Gubler was later struck off, given a suspended jail sentence and publicly dishonoured on the orders of succeeding President Jacques Chirac. Claims: According to the new book current French president Nicolas Sarkozy, left, takes pills which have not been . given 'authorisation by public health authorities' while former President Chirac suffered a secret stroke while in office . According to the latest revelations in a book by  two French journalists Denis Demonpion and Laurent Léger, the fatal injection that ended Mitterrand’s life was administered in the presence of a mystery woman who afterwards informed the President’s doctor. Incendiary: The new book about the health of French presidents . Mitterrand’s son Gilbert was quoted in the book as saying that ‘ only one person knows what happened and she will say nothing about it’. ‘She just told us that his death had occurred peacefully’, he said. Francois Mitterrand’s widow Danielle died last November at Verdun aged 87. In their book Demonpion and Léger also claim that Nicolas Sarkozy, standing for relection to the Presidency in 11 days, also ‘ takes pills which have not been given ‘authorisation by public health authorities’. The authors  do not specify the exact nature of the pills but claim they are intended to restore 'aplomb' or self- possession. Other claims are that Jacques Chirac suffered a stroke whilst in power in 2005 and his wife Bernadette and daughter Claude took pains to prevent news of it leaking out and that former Prime Minister Edouard Balladur suffered from intestinal cancer after his premiership.","Mitterrand was a staunch opponent of euthanasia .

David Cameron will pay a historic visit to Burma this week – the first by a Western leader since decades of military rule ended last year. The Prime Minister will signal Britain’s support for the political thaw in the former colony by meeting with Nobel Prize winner and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, 66. Miss Suu Kyi, who spent 15 of the past 22 years locked up by the former junta, won a seat in parliament for the first time in by-elections a week ago, seen by the Foreign Office as a step in the right direction for the repressive regime. First meeting: Prime Minister David Cameron, left, is making a first . visit in decades by a Western leader to Burma. He will meet former . Burma opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi during the trip . Mr Cameron will also meet reformist president Thein Sein, who sanctioned elections in which Miss Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, won 43 of the 44 available seats. His visit follows confidence-building visits by Foreign Secretary William Hague, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell. The Prime Minister is expected to tell Burma’s rulers that Britain will argue for economic sanctions on the country to be gradually lifted – but only if they continue their transition to a democracy. Important meeting: Mr Cameron will meet reformist president Thein Sein, . who sanctioned elections in which Miss Suu Kyi's party won the majority . of seats . The country is now run by a nominally civilian government, but it is heavily stacked with former military personnel, many of whom are opposed to further liberalisation. Downing Street had hoped to keep the visit secret until Mr  Cameron’s arrival but information was released yesterday by the Burmese Government and the NLD. The trip will cap a week-long trade mission to the Far East in which the Prime Minister will try to get his premiership back on track. Changing times: National League for Democracy supporters cheer during a political rally ahead of the recent parliamentary elections . Mr Cameron, who is being  accompanied by 35 British leaders, will today look to boost trade  during talks in Japan with Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. He will announce new Japanese investment deals, including one with Nissan worth more than £200million, creating almost 1,500 new jobs in the UK and safeguarding thousands more.

Frantic 911 calls made seconds after a Navy fighter jet crashed into a retirement community reveal the frantic reactions of those who had just witnessed the plane fall out of the sky. The two-seater F-18 jet crashed into the Mayfield . Mews apartment complex, about a mile from the Atlantic Ocean and . Virginia Beach, on Friday, after suffering a 'catastrophic . mechanical malfunction' during a training flight. The plane plunged into an apartment . building, destroying at least three buildings and damaging more than 65 of the housing units - but incredibly no-one was killed. As nearby residents rushed to the burning wreckage to try and help, others made calls to the emergency services to ask for rapid response. One caller pleads for assistance: 'Oh my God - all those old . people. Oh my God, you need to hurry up and get help here. There's a . terrible fire - oh my God, something's exploding... The whole thing is . on fire.' Scroll down for videos of the fire and the 911 phonecalls . Flames: Callers flooded 911 following the sudden impact of the jet into the apartment complex in Virginia Beach . Inferno: Though the pilots expelled most of the fuel before crashing, the fuselage caught ablaze as people called for help . 'Hello, yes we've just had a jet . explode on Birdneck' says one caller, leading the incredulous operator . to double-check what he has heard. 'A what explode?', he asks. 'Do you know if anybody is injured?' 'I have no idea, the place is on fire, I don't know - get everyone up here,' she pleads. One caller says she keeps calling and . calling, but no-one has arrived yet - except the pilot, who is sitting . on her porch. She says: 'There's no-one here, there's the pilot waiting on my patio.' 'The pilot is on your patio?', the operator replies, with a quick double-take. 'Yes and no-one's here and I keep calling and calling and there's no-one answering.' The pilots ejected from the plane and are credited with . saving lives by dumping their fuel seconds before impact. Concerns: There are no known fatalities from the dramatic crash, but three elderly residents who lived in the apartment block are unaccounted for . Wrecked: An aerial view of the apartments shows the roofs of several buildings completely destroyed . As the plane still burns, the 911 operators deal with more and more calls for assistance. As one caller complains how long it . takes to get through, the 911 operator responds: 'Ma'am, we've got 47 . calls in the queue to be answered.' Another caller witnessed the plane as it struggled to keep control. He told the operator: 'A Navy plane just went down on 24th . Street. 'I saw the pilot bail out, he did bail out - but it hit the . apartment complex. The apartment building is on fire. The apartment . building is completely destroyed.' Five civilians, as well as the two . pilots, who were a student and an instructor, were taken to hospital to . be treated, but their injuries were not serious and all but one, a . pilot, had been released by Friday evening. Three elderly people were unaccounted for in the hours after the crash, but everyone had been accounted for by Saturday morning. Fire department spokesman Tim Riley said three . buildings were destroyed, and two more had significant damage. Dr. Thomas Thames of Sentara Norfolk General Hospital told WAVY-TV that six . people were brought to the hospital, including the two pilots. Two . people were treated for smoke inhalation, one fainted at the scene and . the other person was a police officer hurt at the scene, he said.

It crashed shortly after . takeoff at a site near the base at about 12:05 p.m. Take off: The F18 is seen taking off from Naval Air Station Oceana in its ill-fated flight . Bruce Nedelka, the Virginia Beach EMS . division chief, said that it seemed like the pilots were dumping the . jet’s fuel prior to the crash. That action likely prevented a . massive fireball upon impact, he said. ‘He mitigated what could have . been an absolute massive, massive fireball. With all of that jet fuel . dumped, it was much less than what it could have been.’ George . Pilkington also witnessed the disaster, and told CNN the timeline of . events, . describing a few large explosions after the initial crash. He said: ‘It . was emptying out fuel and the tail end was down. They (the crew members) must have ejected before they came down.’ Mr Pilkington also said the engine sounded like it was ‘straining and stressing’. One witness said that when the . pilot came down he was still strapped to his ejector seat and had to be . pulled out of the wreckage - when he immediately said sorry for the . crash. Retired Virginia .

Britain is lagging behind Croatia and Turkey in the number of road improvements carried out in the last year, a damning new international league-table of highway upgrades and maintenance across Europe reveals today (Fri) Analysis across 30 European countries by map and sat-nav experts TomTom show that 115,994 new roundabouts, carriageway lanes and one-way streets were created in the UK over the last 12 months. But this only places the UK at seventh place in the European league table, behind sixth place Turkey (118,352 improvements) and fifth place Croatia (129,301) which was part of the former Balkan state of Yugoslavia. A carriageway across the Krka Bridge in Croatia, which was ranked higher than the UK for road improvements . France topped the list with 263,409 road improvements, followed by Germany (169,111), Spain (145,641) and Italy (144,571). The damning data emerged after TomTom recorded more than 1.5 million road changes across Europe in the past year - the first time that such detailed road change information has been mapped. It comes just days after Government announced controversial plans to privatise the major road system, and in the wake of a highly critical ‘ALARM’ report on the parlous state of the nation’s increasingly potholed and crumbling highways. But the TomTom report says: ‘Despite the huge growth in population and car ownership, it seems that investment in the UK’s road infrastructure is lagging behind other European countries.’ Earlier this week Prime Minister David Cameron announced controversial Government plans to privatise England’s motorway and major trunk roads which could be run and maintained by private sector firms and investors, as well as allowing them to charge pay-as-you drive tolls on new roads or lanes which they create. The UK was ranked just seventh in a list of EU countries for its road improvement rating . The aim is to improve the biggest and busiest roads on the UK’s ailing 362,598 mile road network. Traffic congestion costs the UK economy about £7bn a year according to Government estimates. TomTom managing director Corinne Vigreux said:’The road network is constantly changing. New roads are built and the layout of older roads adapted, with extra roundabouts, lanes and one-ways added in. We need to ensure that every single change is tracked so that drivers are up to date. ‘TomTom has used its own unique methodology to measure and quantify all of these map changes and state the numbers are accurate.’ She added: ‘Given the huge number of . road changes in the UK every year, it is vital that drivers update the . map on their satnav device when new maps become available. Otherwise . it’s like driving round with last year’s road atlas.’ TomTom . used detection systems to record map changes country by country . throughout 2010 and 2011. In addition to satellite imagery and mobile . mapping vans, geographic analysts used field surveys plus national and . local source material to capture the changes. The map statistics also come hard on the heels of the Government’s ‘satnav summit’ designed to encourage local authorities and mapping companies to work more closely on communicating changes to the road network. TomTom said its mapping teams work around the clock to track down every single change across the globe so that their sat-nav systems are completely up to date. It also consults with local Governments and transportation authorities to build a real-time map. Prime Minister David Cameron announced plans earlier this week to privatise motorways and major trunk roads . Motorists are already enduring a ‘pothole pandemic’ as a £10billion backlog in crumbling road repairs is tackled by short-term and expensive patch-and-mend hole-filling, a major report revealed last week. The authoritative dossier backed by the AA reveals that the number of potholes filled in across England and Wales has nearly doubled in five years to almost 1.7 million. But the millions spent is a ‘ridiculous waste’ of taxpayers’ money as it fails to tackle the underlying problems and is simply ‘plastering over the cracks,’ said the Annual Local Authority Road maintenance (‘ALARM’) report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA). It is also ‘at least 20 times more expensive’ to patch and mend’ than to plan proper road maintenance, it says. The last three winter cold snaps alone have added an estimated £1.34billion to the nation’s repair bill, it notes. Critics said it was ‘a disaster’ and ‘putting lives at risk.’ Council chiefs admitted they were filling potholes ‘at a rate of one every 18 seconds’ but ‘chasing their tails’ on patching up roads rather than fixing them properly. Even as things stand it will take English councils 11 years to clear the road maintenance backlog, while Welsh councils will take 17 years, said the report. And some roads will go for nearly 100 years without being resurfaced at all, it reveals. Councils in England and Wales have a total annual road maintenance funding shortfall of nearly £800million, with the average for each English council being £5.3million. Road maintenance budgets fell by an average of 13 per cent last year to a total of £2.5 billion. As a result, one in five (20 per cent) of local roads have only five years of live left in them - dropping to 1 in 4 (27 per cent) in London.","France, Germany and Spain top list of road improvements made in past 12 months ."

A mother who had a suspicious feeling after she dropped off her toddler at a home day care yesterday returned to the house a few minutes later to make a grisly discovery of three adults shot dead. The woman's child was unhurt and no other children were in the day care at the time. DeLois Brown, 59, was killed in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, along with her elderly parents James, 83, and 81-year-old Clover Bolden who had moved to the area only a week ago. Police had yet to make an arrest but were seeking a suspect in his mid-20s, believed to have fled on a BMX bicycle. The motive for the brutal killings was unknown. 'It's a tragic day for the city of Brooklyn Park,' Brooklyn Park Police Chief Michael Davis said. 'We are going to bring whoever is responsible for this to justice.' Two nearby community colleges were . locked down for several hours after the shootings were reported at . 6.30am. Both re-opened on Monday afternoon after police spent the . day canvassing the area and using police dogs to search for the suspect. The day care, called Visions and Butterflies Child Care, was licensed to care for as many as 12 children. Mrs Brown, 59, whose husband Joseph died in February, was listed in state . records as the license holder in good standing. The license was valid until February 2013. Scroll down for video . Gunned down: James and Clover Bolden had recently moved to the area to be cared for by their daughter Ms Brown, who ran a day care from her home . Tragedy: Mrs Brown had moved her elderly parents into her home a week before to care for them . Police Inspector Todd Milburn said the mother dropped off her child at the day care but as she was leaving, she saw a man near the house on foot, and something about him raised her suspicions. 'There was some reason for her to call back to the home,' the policeman said. The woman called the day care and was talking to someone at the house when the line went dead. She returned to the home and found . three people had been shot. She grabbed her child and called 911. Police . confirmed the victims were dead on their arrival. No one else was inside the home when the woman returned, according to police. He said the woman saw the same . suspicious man nearby, on a bicycle, when she returned to the day care. Police said they had no information on . how many children were typically cared for at Brown's home, or when . they were normally dropped off. Unexplained: There were few clues as to why the gunman attacked the suburban home in Missouri . Armed response: A SWAT team member checks a house while searching the area for a suspect in a shooting that killed three family members . Ron Brown, DeLois Brown's brother-in-law, said her husband Joseph had died in February. Mrs Brown had just moved her parents to Minnesota from the St Louis area so she could take care of them. 'She called us a week ago today, to say they made it back safe and sound with a truckload of furniture,' Ron Brown said. Mr Brown added that DeLois and Joseph didn't have any children together but DeLois had children before the pair were married. A neighbor, Lisa Johnson, said that since Joseph died, the house had been busier, with more people coming and going. Johnson said she saw a moving van outside Brown's home a week ago. Attack at dawn: Police taped off the scene where three people were shot and killed at an in-home day care in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota . A neighbor, Hakeem Hughes, 18, said he . heard screaming coming from the direction of the house around 6.30am . but didn't pay much attention because children often played outside the . home. When he went to catch his bus to school, he said police told him to go back inside because a gunman was on the loose. 'I'm just shocked about it,' Mr Hughes said. 'They are good people.

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 08:01 EST, 29 February 2012 . Scientists have found evidence of flu in bats for the first time - and warn it could pose a threat to humans. U.S. health officials say they found genetic fragments of a never-before-seen virus in some Guatemalan bats. Flu bugs are common in humans, birds, pigs and a variety of other mammals, but this is the first time one has been documented in these winged mammals. Carrier: The influenza virus has recently been detected in the yellow-shouldered bat in Guatemala . 'Most people were fairly convinced we had . already discovered flu in all the possible' animals, said Ruben Donis, a . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist who co-authored . the new study. Scientists suspect that some bats caught . flu centuries ago and that the virus mutated within the bat population . into this new variety. Scientists haven't been able to grow the new . virus in chicken eggs or in human cell culture, as they do with more . conventional flu strains and it is not clear if, or how well, it spreads. However, it still could pose a threat to . humans. If it mingled with more common forms of influenza, . it could swap genes and mutate into something more dangerous, a scenario . at the heart of the global flu epidemic movie 'Contagion.' The research was posted online Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The CDC has an international outpost in Guatemala where researchers collected more than 300 bats in 2009 and 2010. The research was mainly focused on rabies, but the scientists also checked specimens for other germs and stumbled upon the new virus. It was in the intestines of little yellow-shouldered bats. These bats eat fruit and insects but don't bite people. Yet it's possible they could leave the virus on produce and a human could get infected by taking a bite. A health worker in Vietnam sprays disinfectant at the site of a suspected outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu virus among ducks. The virus has killed 345 people since 2003. A bat flu strain could theoretically also spread to humans . 'It's conceivable some people were infected with the virus in the past. Now that scientists know what it looks like, they are looking for it in other bats as well as humans and other animals', said Mr Donis. However, Richard Fulton, a bird disease researcher at Michigan State University, said more evidence was needed. He said all they had found was a segment of genetic material and not a fully-fledged virus. Mr Donis said work is going on to try to infect healthy bats, but noted there are other viruses that were discovered by genetic sequencing but are hard to grow in a lab, including hepatitis C.","U.S health officials have found influenza in Guatemalan bats .

Gevin Allen Prince, 15, of Douglasville, was arraigned on charges of malice murder and four counts of aggravated assault. Prince answered politely when asked by the judge if he understood the charges against him. Scroll down for video . Gruesome attack: Gevin Prince, 15, appeared in court for the first time today to face charges in the brutal attack that killed his great-grandmother . Police say the boy stabbed his 77-year-old great-grandmother after he reportedly was told to stop playing a video game. His grandmother, 55-year-old Laura Prince, is recovering from wounds she suffered on her arm during the same attack. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported he was slapped with the other two assault charges for allegedly chasing two neighbours with the sword. District Attorney David McDade said those neighbours, both juveniles, were not physically injured. Mr McDade said: 'They saw what happened. The psychological impact is immeasurable.' Authorities in Douglasville, Georgia, had to taser the boy in order to arrest him, after he shot at them with a pellet gun during a stand-off. Crime scene: Police on the lawn of the Douglasville property where the 77-year-old great-grandmother was found stabbed to death . Police said it was the third time in the last three months the teen had been arrested. They had already confiscated another sword off him. The local sheriffs department responded to a . call at 5pm on Monday to find the grandmother, in her 50s, barricaded . inside a room and the great-grandmother lying dead on the ground outside . the home. Stand-off: Douglas County Sheriff Phil Miller said the boy waved the sword around and shot at police with a pellet gun . Douglas County Sheriff Phil Miller said when deputies arrived at the family's home in the 3400 block of Spring Ridge in Douglasville, the teen was standing in the doorway with a 'full-sized sword' and a pellet rifle. 'He came out with a pellet gun and shot two windows out of a patrol car that was sitting there. He was shooting at us with the pellet gun and swinging the sword around in the air,' said Sheriff Miller. Deputies showed a lot of restraint and did not shoot the teen, CBS Atlanta reported. Instead, they distracted him with an explosive device. 'It got his attention,' said Sheriff Miller. 'We sent a K-9 unit in and he hit the K-9 dog with the butt of the pellet gun. At that  point, we tased him then took him into custody.' History of violence: The 14-year-old had been arrested twice before this year, once having a different sword confiscated . Sheriff Miller said the incident on Monday was the third time this year deputies were called about the teen being violent. He said: 'We've arrested him on two different occasions. Once in June where he had another sword, which is in evidence. This is not the same sword. He cut his grandmother on the foot with it that time.' Police arrested him again on July 29. Neighbour: Pam Mayercik, who lives across the street, said the boy would wave at her but seemed a little different . 'We almost had to hog tie him to not hurt him,' said Sheriff Miller, adding that each time deputies arrested the teen, they took him to the hospital for evaluations and doctors released him. 'Obviously he was a danger to himself, a danger to his family and a danger to this community,' said Sheriff Miller. Pam Mayercik lives across the street from the family. She told CBS Atlanta she often saw the teen in the neighbourhood. 'I used to wave to the kid all the time,' she said. 'He seemed like he was a little bit different. He's just a little kid with glasses and kind of shy.'","15-year-old Gevin Allen Prince appears in court for first time since grisly murder .

When they arrived, the baby had no pulse and was turning blue. ‘It was lifeless, it was limp, it had no muscle tone, blue skin colour,’ FDNY paramedic Carl Gandolfo told reporters at a press conference. He explained: ‘I immediately opened the airway, gave two rescue breaths, and the baby began to cry.’ He said his partner then arrived with an ambulance. The newborn was taken to Kings County Hospital and is said to be in good condition. First responders: Three paramedics quickly arrived at the scene and were able to save the child . Mr Gandolfo said this case hit home for him. ‘I have a 15-month-old of my own at home. It definitely hits home when you get a pediatric call, especially when you find out you have a newborn who’s not breathing, that’s blue. 'This baby is going to die out here in the street. The baby is in a thin blanket. This baby’s umbilical cord is at least over a foot long. This thing was not born in no d**n hospital.' ‘You want to do everything you can,’ he said. Amina DeLeon also placed a call to 911 after she encountered Muhammad in a nearby grocery store, NY1 reports. She convinced a UPS delivery man to call 911 from his phone to alert the EMS. Muhammad disappeared after abandoning her daughter in Ms Romero’s arms with a few Pampers and some toys. She was arrested March 16, officers said. The 27-year-old mother was charged with acting in a manner injurious to a child. Watch video here: .","Shoshannah Muhammad, 27, allegedly left newborn daughter at neighbour's front door .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:20 EST, 5 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:26 EST, 5 April 2012 . Controversial District of Columbia Councilman Marion Barry has sparked outrage for disparaging remarks about Asian-owned businesses in his poor, majority-black ward. Following his decisive election to Ward 8 on Tuesday, Barry declared at the victory party, 'We got to do something about these Asians coming in and opening up businesses and dirty shops. ... They ought to go. I'm going to say that right now. But we need African-American businesspeople to be able to take their places, too.' Causing an avalanche of criticism to come his way, Barry, 76, drew ire from across the political spectrum in Washington D.C following the remarks which were picked up by WRC-TV. Scroll down for video . Controversial Ward 8 D.C. Councilman Marion Barry said Thursday that he was not trying to insult the city's Asian community . 'It’s regrettably inappropriate. I’m hoping he misspoke,' said Susan Au Allen, the president of the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce, who admitted that Barry’s comments had concerned her. 'We should be keeping our focus on how to make life better for everybody.' Barry's fellow D.C. Council members did not line up to support him either. 'I strongly disagree with the recent remarks made about Asian American business owners in the District,' said council Chairman Kwame Brown in a news release. 'Statements like that are divisive, destructive, and have absolutely no place in our city.' However, following the mountain of concern aimed at Tuesday's statement Barry apologised for his comments today. 'I want to express my deep apology for offending some members of the Asian community and the D.C. community,' Barry said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'I have a solid record of relationships with the Asian community.' Inflammatory: Councilman Marion Barry said  'We got to do something about these Asians coming in and opening up businesses and dirty shops' The former mayor won the Democratic primary for his Ward 8 council seat with 73 percent of the vote, all but assuring him of another four-year term. Mayor Vincent Gray, Council Chairman Kwame Brown and some of Barry's council colleagues criticized the longtime D.C. politician on Thursday. A group of Asian-American lawmakers in Maryland also condemned Barry's remarks. 'I am deeply disappointed by Council-member Barry's comment,' Gray said in a statement. 'There is no room in this wonderfully diverse city for comments that disparage anyone on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation.' Serving four terms as mayor of the District of Columbia in Washington, Marion Barry was the first notable member of the civil rights movement to be elected to become the chief executive of an American city . Barry served consecutive terms as mayor from 1979 to 1991 and again from 1995 to 1999 . In January of 1990 Barry was videotaped smoking crack cocaine and arrested by FBI officials on drug charges . He served six months in prison from October 1991 to April 1992 . In March 2006 he was sentenced to three years probation for failing to pay federal and local taxes and failed a drugs test for which he underwent drug counseling. The Washington Post has claimed that 'To understand the District of Columbia, one must understand Marion Barry' Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the district in Congress, said she was 'stunned by the offensive nature of the comments.' Norton called Barry and reminded him of the values they shared while working together in the civil rights movement, she said, adding that she was pleased that he would apologise. Barry, 76, served four terms as mayor, a tenure interrupted by his six-month term in federal prison on a drug charge. Since his return to the council in 2004, he has developed a reputation for racially charged statements. During . a recent radio appearance, he said he didn't like the architectural . firm recommended to build a new public high school because it was . 'all-white.' And with . Gray and Brown under federal investigation for possible campaign . misdeeds, he has suggested that black politicians are more heavily . scrutinised than their white counterparts. Washington has long been a majority-black city, but the white and Asian populations are growing. African-Americans made up just 50 . percent of the district's population during the 2010 Census. The city is . 34.8 percent white and 3.5 percent Asian. The four time mayor of Washington D.C later apologised for any offence to the Asian community caused by his comments . Tensions have long simmered between blacks and Asian merchants in many urban communities. Korean . shopkeepers were subject to violence during the 1992 riots in Los . Angeles that followed the police beating of motorist Rodney King. Washington Mayor Vincent Gray, right, listens as DC Council member Marion Barry speaks . Barry told AP that he was wrong to single out Asians but said he was referring to merchants who don't sell healthy food and don't engage with the community or hire local residents. 'We need businesspeople who'll be a part of the community, not exploit the community, give jobs to those of us in the community, and to contribute to the well-being of our community, have fresh vegetables and fruits and et cetera,' Barry said. Barry, however, did not back away from his claim that some Asian-owned convenience stores and carryout restaurants don't 'respect' the residents in his ward. 'Ward 8 residents are spending their hard-earned dollars in these stores because they are the only stores in the immediate neighborhoods; my constituents want respect, too,' he said in a statement. 'It is to these less-than-stellar Asian-American businessmen in Ward 8 that my remarks were directed.' Ward 8 D.C. Councilman Marion Barry (centre) said Thursday that he was not trying to insult the city's Asian community . Furthermore the former mayor claimed took to Twitter to claim that his comments were misconstrued. 'I'm very sorry for offending the Asian American community. Although . taken out of context by many about the conditions of some W8 carryouts,' said Barry on Twitter. 'The comment was meant to convey that some stores need better service to . and engagement with the community than what is provided now.' Barry noted that during his time as mayor, he created the city's Office of Asian-Pacific Islander Affairs and established a sister-city relationship with Beijing. Soohyun 'Julie' Koo, the director of that office, said she was glad that Barry had apologized. 'Marion Barry has been very supportive of our community, so I was very surprised by his statement,' she said.","Ex-Washington D.C mayor condemned for his disparaging remarks .

"By . Toby Harnden . PUBLISHED: . 13:14 EST, 10 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:52 EST, 11 April 2012 . Rick Santorum has abruptly suspended his White House bid, effectively ending the battle for the Republican presidential nomination and allowing a victorious Mitt Romney to focus solely on defeating Barack Obama in November. The former US Senator for Pennsylvania won 11 states but had dropped to a very distant second place in the delegate count. He did not mention Romney once in a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, site of the historic Civil War battle, in which he announced his candidacy was over, fuelling Republican fears that there could be continued disunity in the party. Dropping out: Surrounded by his family, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum announced on Tuesday that he is suspending his campaign for the Republican presidential candidacy . 'We made a decision over the weekend that, while this presidential race for us is over, for me, and we will suspend our campaign effective today, we are not done fighting,' he said at a news conference hastily arranged instead of a planned rally. Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul officially remain in the race but have no hope of denying Romney, who now becomes the presumptive Republican nominee before being formally anointed at the Republican convention in Tampa in August, which party bosses had feared might degenerate into an ugly fight. Santorum, 53, had looked like he would be an also-ran for most of the Republican campaign but surged to a very narrow – though belatedly announced – victory in first-voting Iowa in January. After a stunning triple win in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri in February he briefly looked like he could topple Romney, 65, the long-time establishment favourite. He displaced Gingrich as the main . conservative threat to Romney but his failure to win in the battleground . states of Michigan and Ohio meant his challenge quickly faded. When . Santorum suffered three defeats last Tuesday in Wisconsin, Maryland and . the District of Columbia, his presidential hopes for 2012 were all but . over. Emotional: Santorum embraced his wife Karen, who had struggled to contain her tears, after the speech . Stubborn: Santorum did not endorse frontrunner Mitt Romney - or even mention him - in his departure speech . His daughter Bella, three, who suffers from a rare and usually fatal genetic disorder, was hospitalised on Friday, prompting Santorum to leave the campaign trail. In his speech, Santorum said that Good . Friday was 'a passion play' for his family because of Bella’s illness of . Bella and Easter weekend then became 'a time for prayer and thought' about his campaign. Bella, who was also hospitalised in February, returned home yesterday. Santorum opened the press conference . on Tuesday with news of his daughter, and how consideration for her had . been part of his decision to step down. He . said of Bella: 'She is a fighter, she is doing exceptionally well and . we are looking forward to spending a lot of great time with her. 'But it did cause us to think as the role we have is parents in her life. This was a time for prayer and thought this weekend. We were very concerned about being the best parents we possibly could to our children.' Referring . to his initial prospects and the fact that most commentators had . dismissed his chances, Santorum described his presidential bid as being . 'as improbable as any race you’ll ever see for president'. Tough competition: It is believed that the move leaves the way open for frontrunner Mitt Romney to stand almost unopposed to take on President Obama later this year . Family: Santorum is pictured with his three-year-old daughter Bella, who was hospitalised last week . For months, Santorum had pounded Romney for being insufficiently conservative and a weak candidate to face Obama. In his speech, he talked of fighting to . ensure Republicans held the House of Representatives and won back the . Senate but did not mention the White House. 'This game is a long, long, . long way from over,' he said. Just after the announcement, Romney . issued a somewhat tepid statement: 'Senator Santorum is an able and . worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran. 'He . has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the . nation. We both recognise that what is most important is putting the . failures of the last three years behind us and setting America back on . the path to prosperity.' Catalyst: During the speech, Santorum said he was committed to being the best parent to Bella he could be . Fighter: Santorum's daughter is now out of hospital, where she was being treated for pneumonia . Santorum telephoned Romney before . his speech to inform him of his decision. The former senator’s . spokesman Hogan Gidley later told MSNBC that the Romney campaign had . asked for a meeting about an endorsement and that Santorum would be . 'open' to this. Rival Ron Paul congratulated Santorum on his 'spirited campaign', while Newt Gingrich called his fight 'remarkable'. Gingrich vowed to remain in the until the convention to give conservatives 'a real choice'. Although . best known as a strong social conservative with outspoken views against . abortion and gay marriage, Santorum also campaigned as a foreign policy . hawk and emphasised his blue-collar roots. He . hinted at sore feelings towards Romney, who had defeated him partly . with the aid of a huge war chest that enabled him to buy some . devastating negative ads. Competition: For months, Santorum had pounded Romney for being insufficiently conservative and a weak candidate to face President Obama . 'We . weren't out there trashing anybody…We painted a hopeful, positive . vision for our country,' he said. Santorum also pointed out that he won . 'more counties' that the other Republican candidates combined, an . indication of his strength among rural voters. But despite his wins in 11 states, . Santorum’s vote tally was 3.2 million votes compared to Romney’s  4.6 . million . In the one measure that really counted, Santorum netted 285 . convention delegate compared to Romney’s 661 thus far. A candidate must . get 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination. Santorum’s exit came as the Romney . campaign was preparing to air a barrage of negative ads against him in . Pennsylvania. It took senior Republicans by surprise, though a number . had counselled that he had to avoid losing in Pennsylvania at all costs. Having begun his candidacy as a second . or even third tier prospect, Santorum is young enough to look forward to . being a front-rank contender in 2016, should Romney lose to Obama, or . 2020. Rivals: Paul (L) congratulated Santorum on his 'spirited campaign'. Gingrich (R) called it a 'remarkable' fight . Support: Santorum had enjoyed wins in Iowa, Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri during the campaign . 'We are not done fighting,' he said. 'We are going to continue to fight for those voices…. There’s a lot of greatness, a lot of greatness in this country.' His campaign, he emphasised, had begun with a discussion around the family’s kitchen table and had ended the same way. 'It was a love affair for me, going from state to state and seeing the differences, but seeing the wonderful, wonderful people of this country,' he said. By ‘suspending’ his campaign rather than formally ending it, Santorum can continue to collect contributions to pay off his campaign debts. Stepping down ahead of the Pennsylvania primary in two weeks, . which could have proved a humiliating defeat on his home turf, Rick Santorum has left . the campaign at a high point. Having collected 11 states and thousands of voters, the . former Pennsylvania senator is now well-placed to manipulate his popularity to . further his career – whether it be in politics or elsewhere. A comparison can perhaps be drawn with Mike Huckabee, the former . governor of Arkansas and a candidate in the 2008 Republican presidential race, eventually . won by John McCain. Like Santorum, Huckabee enjoyed early success in Iowa, followed . by wins in Louisiana, Kansas and West Virginia. But he bowed out in early March . as it became increasingly clear it would be tough to forge a win in Texas. Following his campaign, Huckabee has courted controversy yet has . also enjoyed success, publishing a New York Times bestseller and writing another, non-political book. In June 2008, he . was hired by Fox News as a political commentator and contributor for their . election coverage. He now hosts a weekend show called Huckabee on Fox News . Channel. Other one-time candidates, such as Alan Keyes, have also enjoyed relative success as talk show hosts and commentators after their failed bids. For many other candidates - both those who have enjoyed success and those who have not - returning for later presidential elections is a theme. Two candidates who took part in the 2008 bid for Republican presidential candidate - Ron Paul and today's front-runner Mitt Romney - returned this year. Arizona Sentor John McCain came back from second place in 2000 to take the candidacy in 2008. Other names such as Herman Cain, Steve Forbes and John Edwards crop up over more than one year, signalling Santorum could be back in 2016 - providing Romney is not at the helm. Remaining in politics is an option, as is lobbying. Looking further back to 2004 - and therefore jumping sides to a Democratic battle - candidates who bowed out turned towards lobbying. Dick Gephardt, . a man mentioned as possible vice president in five separate campaign . years, was considered a strong candidate when he entered the race, . eventually won by John Kerry. Dropping out after finishing in fourth . place, he went on to set up a consultancy and lobbying group, and has . lobbied on behalf of pharmaceutical companies and Boeing - to mixed . reactions. Whatever Santorum decides to do, he has business to attend to first. Following his announcement on Tuesday he immediately appealed to supporters to help pay off his campaign debt. 'I am planning to do everything in my power to bring a change about in the White House,' he wrote in a campaign email. 'But our campaign has debt, and I cannot be free to focus on helping defeat him with this burden.'","Decision follows Santorum's three devastating defeats last week .

These pictures reveal the headquarters of Scientology's higher order where members pledge their allegiance for one billion years - and which may have cost Tom Cruise his marriage. The prospect of sending six-year-old Suri to the Sea Organisation, or Sea Org as it is known, is what is said to have been the final straw for Katie Holmes before she filed for divorce. The clergy like group is run like a military clique from the Scientology Gold Base in California which has a sniper-style nest bunker on the site. Enclave: Gold Base, the Scientology camp on a 500-acre compound at San Jacinto in Riverside County, California . All aboard: The masts of a ship-like structure next to a swimming pool at the isolated Gold Base compound in the Californian wilderness . Headquarters: The Scientology base in California has a church, mansion, golf course accommodation and swimming pool . Members are banned from having children, are paid just $50 a week and can be punished for simply looking at somebody the wrong way by being thrown in ‘The Hole’ - two trailers set aside for punishment. It has been investigated by FBI agents looking into human trafficking and one member claimed he was locked in a ship’s hold for 18 hours a day with no food. Holmes is also said to have been alarmed at her daughter being pushed into an academy partly paid for by Will Smith which acts as a feeder to a school popular with Scientologists. And according to interviews with former Scientologists and former Sea Org members, her fears appear to be well founded. Sea Org is the Scientologist equivalent of a religious order and is thought to be around 6,000 strong. In recent years ex-members including Oscar-winning director Paul Haggis have spoken out about the brutal regime which operates inside. The one billion year pledge is supposedly to ‘symbolise their eternal commitment to the religion' but is made by children as young as 10, something Haggis likened to the treatment of ‘child slaves in Haiti’, he has told the New Yorker. Members are paid just $50 a week and banned from leaving their base or they are tracked down by a special team who use emotional pressure or physical force to make them come back. Spiritual home: The $9.4million mansion which former members claim was built for the return of L. Ron Hubbard who died in 1986 . Keeping watch: The Gold Base compound has razor-tipped fences, motion sensors and what appears to be a heavily camouflaged sniper-style nest bunker that over looks the entire property (pictured) Devout: The religious technology center at the gated compound which sits in arid foothills, 90 miles from LA . Former Scientology security chief . Gary Morehead has claimed that he tracked down more than 100 Sea Org . members who left in his 13 years on the job using what he called a ‘blow . drill’, referring to the techniques he employed to hunt people down. If Sea Org members try to leave they . are also given a ‘freeloader tab’ which is a bill for all the work they . have received, and can run into six figures. Under the influence of Scientology . ‘elders’, Sea Org members are convinced to ‘volunteer’ for punishments . which can include being given poor quality food, sleep deprivation or . being banned from talking to anyone, ABC news has reported. They can also involve manual labour, wearing black clothes to mark you out from everybody else - and can go on for years. Then there are the alleged beatings . at the hands of leaders and The Hole, two trailers which can hold up to . 100 people forced to do group confessions all night. In one episode detailed in an piece . in the New Yorker, those put in The Hole were told that they had to play . a game of musical chairs and only the person who won would be allowed . to stay. As the Queen hit ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ boomed out of the stereo, it took until 4am before there was a winner, . by which time things turned violent with one chair being ripped in two. Battle: Katie Holmes has filed for divorce from husband Tom Cruise and . has asked for sole custody of daughter Suri. The actress reportedly . dislikes and distrusts Scientology to which her husband is devoted . Faithful: An aerial shot shows members at Scientology HQ Gold Base - where it has been claimed that members are paid just $50 a week and tracked down if they try to leave . Sea Org has also been dragged through . the courts and in 1985 former member Lawrence Wollersheim sued for . $25million after claiming he had been kept for 18 hours a day in a . ship’s hold. Left in the hold with no food and unable to sleep, he alleged that he suffered ‘emotional injury’ as a result of his ordeal. He was awarded $30million though this was reduced to $2.5million on appeal. In 2009 former Sea Org members Claire and Marc Headley sued the church after joining in their teens and falling in love. She claimed to have been pressured . into having two abortions because rules state she could not have . children, although they lost the case. Sea Org dates back to 1966 when . Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard sought to take his followers on sea . breaks to continue his research into the ‘upper levels of spiritual . awareness’. He bought several small ships and . staffed them with a young crew of Scientologists and reportedly went . looking for treasure he had hidden in a previous life. Rough terrain: Members are allegedly banned from leaving the isolated base, according to former members . Fun and games? Leisure facilities on the compound include basketball courts . Former Sea Org member Janis Grady has . claimed that she was once on a boat with Hubbard who showed her a map . with crosses on it and claimed there was buried treasure under each . cross. Sea Org is run out of Gold Base, . which is the Scientology HQ located 90 miles east of Los Angeles in . Gilman Hot Springs, California. The 500-acre compound has a film studio called Golden Era Productions on which Cruise supposedly does some of his work. The security measures are extreme and . include motion sensors, razor tipped wire and what appears to be a . camouflaged nest bunker with clear sightlines over the entire property. There is also a golf course, . accommodation blocks, education buildings and the $9.4million mansion . which former members claim was built for the return of Hubbard, who died . in 1986.

Donation: Will Smith, with wife Jada, gave $1.2million to the New Village Leadership Academy . But while it is secular, multiple . reports across media organisations in the US and the UK claim it does . have ties to Scientology and uses ‘study technology’, which was created . by Hubbard. It also feeds into the $42,000 a year . Delphian School in Oregon where as many as half the pupils are . Scientologists, the Independent reported. Among the pupils there are Connor and Isabella Cruise, 17 and 19, Cruise’s children with ex-wife Nicole Kidman. Marty Rathbun, a former senior . executive in Scientology told the Independent: ‘Suri is coming to an age . where she gets educated enough to get locked into the faith. ‘That's why there's almost certainly truth in the consideration that schools have started coming into play in all this.’ Since announcing her divorce, Holmes has reportedly enrolled Suri in a Catholic school in New York. Scientology spokesmen have denied the claims in the New Yorker article. The organisation has also claimed that Suri is too young to join Sea Org, even though Cruise is its most high profile member.

A property developer who strangled his solicitor girlfriend hours after she had breast cancer surgery had previously throttled his ex-wife. John Doyle, 54, was jailed for life yesterday for killing partner Sian Rees in a drunken rage when she ended their relationship. He was caught after he put her dead body in the passenger seat of his van and crashed while driving to an unknown location to dispose of the corpse. History of violence: John Doyle, 54, was today found guilty of killing his partner Sian Rees, 50, in June last year. Following the verdict it was revealed he had been convicted of a similar attack on his estranged wife in 1989 . Yesterday it emerged that Doyle had been accused of trying to throttle his ex-wife more than 20 years ago. The jury which convicted him of the . ‘brutal’ murder was not told of the previous case, which was also said . to be motivated by jealousy. Doyle, who killed Miss Rees in June last . year, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 16 years. The couple had argued after Miss Rees . was forced to drive them home from hospital, even though she had had an . operation for breast cancer, because Doyle was drunk. Investigation: Police survey the scene in Hatherleigh, Devon where the strangled body of Sian Rees was found dead last year . After the 1989 attack, John Doyle's estranged wife Gina gave police a vivid description of her ordeal. She . said: 'He grabbed me around the throat and started squeezing and I . managed to say ""don't kill me"". I kicked at John and got him in the . stomach. 'I was on my last . breath and thought I was going to pass out when he let me go and went. He held my throat fairly hard and at one point I thought he was going to . kill me.' Doyle's stepdaughter Michelle said in a statement: 'I heard Mum screaming ""help, help, he's going to kill me"". 'Mum . was on the bed with Dad standing over her with his hands around her . throat, trying to choke her. She kicked him in the stomach and he ran . off. Doyle was arrested soon afterwards and told police: 'I grabbed Gina around the throat. Yes, I admit I was angry.' He . insisted he hit her five times, as opposed to the 20 blows on the face . or body which she reported, but accepted he was responsible for her . injuries, which included a black eye. Doyle admitted causing his ex-wife actual bodily harm and was punished with community service. The . judge told him: 'You forced entry to the granny flat and attacked a man . and a woman there. You punched your wife repeatedly about the head and . body and she says you were choking her.' After she told him their 14-year . relationship was over, Doyle stabbed her and then strangled her with a . bra, which was found in the van. He left her body lying in their kitchen between the butcher’s block and a Rayburn cooker. The next day he put her corpse in his . van and drove a short distance from their home, near Hatherleigh in . Devon, before crashing into a traffic island, puncturing a tyre. He was desperate not to stop but . eventually lost control and crashed into a hedge, attracting help from . passers-by – one of whom was a nurse who realised Miss Rees was dead. Judge Graham Cottle described Doyle’s claim he was acting in self-defence as ‘preposterous’. He said: ‘I have no doubt you stabbed . her. You intended to cause her death with that knife but in fact it did . not strike any vital organs. Thereafter you strangled her to death.’ The jury at Exeter Crown Court was told the couple rowed about Doyle’s lack of progress on renovations to their home. He was also jealous of an aeroplane flying dentist Miss Rees was speaking to online. The jury was not told of Doyle’s . attempt to strangle his first wife Gina 23 years ago at her home in . Wanneroo, Western Australia. On New Year’s Day 1989 he broke into . her flat, attacked her boyfriend and punched her 20 times in the face . before starting to throttle her. He fled after the attack was interrupted by his stepdaughter Michelle and a teenage babysitter staying at the house. Gina Doyle told police at the time: ‘He held my throat fairly hard and at one point I thought he was going to kill me.’ Doyle admitted causing his ex-wife actual bodily harm and was given community service. Miss Rees died of heart failure induced by asphyxia and pressure on her carotid artery. She also had 40 other injuries. A statement from her friends said: . ‘Sian was a loving, compassionate, generous, clever and funny friend and . colleague whose untimely death leaves a huge gap in the lives of those . who knew her.’ Close-up: Partner John Doyle was driving with one slashed tyre when he crashed his van here.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:42 EST, 27 January 2012 . A fire captain has been turned in to police by his wife after she allegedly found explicit messages on his mobile phone from a 14-year-old. The wife of Saul 'Abe' Fiszer from Houston, Texas found he had repeatedly called a number on his cell phone - so posed as him and texted it. A 14-year-old girl from Casper, Wyoming responded, referring to the 49-year-old grandfather as 'Daddy', according to the criminal complaint. Charged: Abe Fiszer allegedly swapped images with a 14-year-old girl online. His wife tipped off police, who allegedly found child porn on his computer . She wrote she 'was upset with 'Daddy' because he had not contacted her in awhile', according to the Houston Chronicle. When the youngster discovered she was texting Fiszer's wife she apologised and begged her not to contact her parents, the paper reports. When the wife, believed to be called Sandra, confronted him, he admitted he had been chatting to the teen online and trading pictures with her. She tipped off police, who allegedly found more than 450 images of child porn, as well as videos, on his computer, the Houston Chronicle reported. Caught: Fiszer, pictured with his daughter, tried to kill himself after the discovery . Family: Fiszer, pictured with his sisters, has been charged with three counts of possession of child pornography. He could face 30 years in jail if convicted . The photographs and footage allegedly showed boys and girls as young as four years old. Authorities seized his laptop and storage devices, as well as a computer from the girl's home in Wyoming. After the discovery, Fiszer's wife said the Houston Fire Department captain started talking about suicide.

A baby giraffe born with 'back-to-front' feet has walked unaided for the first time after wearing special customised shoes for more than a year.

In a pioneering move, zoo vet, Dr Joseph Kamer, fitted the newborn giraffe with fabricated shoes made from plywood. Red shoes on: Hope gets to grips with his boots at the Topeka Zoo, Kansas, soon after being fitted with them . The shoes featured extended heels and . an artificial tendon, which he glued to the bottom of her rear hooves - . the first time the procedure has ever been carried out on a giraffe. The . shoes and casts kept her legs straight and stretched the front tendons . and for almost a year Hope used the customised shoes to walk. Now . enough tension has been created in Hope's rear tendons allowing the . shoes to be removed and the giraffe to walk unaided for the first time. Hope springs up: The giraffe was born wth a rare deformity called hyperextended fetlocks - meaning each rear foot was bent forwards . A spokesman for the zoo said: ‘We were shocked when we first saw Hope. ‘Her . feet were bent in such a way that if she were to stand up it would have . been the equivalent of our feet bent so far forward we would be walking . on our ankles and not our heels. ‘At birth, Hope's front tendons were too tight while the rear tendons in her legs were stretched out too much. ‘The . idea of the shoes was that they could continue to offer some support to . the legs while at the same time allowing her body to begin to use those . legs in a more normal manner. Animal magic: Thanks to the brilliance of zoo vet Dr Joseph Kamer, Hope received treatment that eventually gave her the freedom to roam around with her family . ‘Right from the beginning her mum . Dolly was so supportive. We had to separate Hope from her mum while the . procedure was carried out but she watched over the fence the whole time. ‘It is fantastic to see Hope walking completely normally now.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:55 EST, 11 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:04 EST, 11 April 2012 . Bonuses offered by the U.S.'s biggest securities companies to recruit top brokers are reaching their loftiest levels since the financial crisis, and none of the big firms are retreating from the bidding war. The brokerage arms of banks such as Morgan Stanley, UBS AG, Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America are offering high-end U.S. brokers two to three times the commissions and fees they produced in the previous year, up from about one times those earnings previously. The bonuses, which can approach $15million for some teams over several years, have steadily escalated and include perks such as prime parking spaces and the hiring of brokers' sales assistants, recruiters say. Recruitment: Morgan Stanley is among one of the banks offering commissions two to three times past commissions and fees to U.S. brokers . The bonuses reflect how eager big firms are to manage the assets of the very wealthy, who tend to be more loyal to their advisers than to the advisers' firms. In addition, fees from wealth management, as the brokerage business is known today, are dependable, while revenue streams from trading and investing are volatile and becoming less profitable under regulatory and market pressures. The big companies also are eager to attract big brokers and assets at a time when investors are still fearful of investing and cutting down on trades. So despite the costs, big firms keep bidding up the pay. 'Clearly they want the deals to go away, but no one can afford to make the first move and lose market share,' said Alois Pirker, research director of Aite Group, a wealth management consulting firm in Boston. The high payouts mean brokerages often won't recoup their largesse for at least two years, and often more than five, according to brokerage executives who declined to be identified. And if brokers who are sated on fat bonuses or uncomfortable with their new firm lose their sales zeal, the payback can extend years beyond that. 'They should absolutely stop doing it, but nobody wants to give up their competitive advantage,' said Pirker. 'If they go cold turkey, they lose.'Just two years ago, brokerage executives said they understood the folly and were going to end it. Huge payout: Wells Fargo, is among the banks offering bonuses that can can approach $15million for some teams over several years for high-end brokers . 'I truly believe the industry is moving toward a more rational recruiting model,' James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley and the former head of retail brokerage at Merrill Lynch, told investors in January 2010 after the company reported a 2009 loss of $960million. But Morgan Stanley, the biggest broker, with more than 17,100 advisers, continues to compete. Rick Peterson, a recruiter in Houston, said he heard of a team of advisers leaving Merrill Lynch for Morgan Stanley in 2011 for a potential payout of about $25 million. He declined to identify the team and spokespeople at Morgan Stanley and Merrill, which is owned by Bank of America, declined to comment.UBS Wealth Management Americas has been particularly aggressive recently as it tries to recover from tax and other scandals of 2009 and 2010, recruiters said. Bidding: James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley, said the industry is going toward 'a more rational recruiting model, but the bank continues to compete . Its compensation costs last quarter totaled 91 per cent of its net income, compared with 65 percent for its wealth management businesses globally, according to company reports. In at least one case, it last year dangled a bonus equivalent to 3.8 times the trailing 12-month revenue of one brokerage team, said Peterson. Spokespeople at UBS did not respond to several requests for comment. Wells Fargo, for its part, said it is 'committed to attracting top industry talent and we do aim to be competitive in our offers. Most new advisers join because of 'the culture of the firm' and the strength of Wells Fargo's name, said Erica Van Ross, a company spokeswoman. 'Eager': The bonuses from companies like Bank of America are a reflection of how much firms want to manage the finances of the wealthy . Deals offered by big companies are variable but inevitably include an upfront signing bonus and a 'loan' made over several years that is forgiven if the broker stays productive and in place for seven to 11 years. A typical high-end broker with a clean regulatory record who generates $1million of annual revenue and oversees about $150million of client assets generally gets an upfront cash payment of 1.25 to 1.50 times trailing 12-month revenue. The multiple rises with stronger production and asset levels. The back-end bonus is tied to hitting asset-gathering goals that rise from about 70 per cent of what brokers oversaw at their old employer within the first year to 150 per cent within five years. Like all advisers, they receive ongoing payouts for new business. Top brokers at companies such as Merrill, Morgan Stanley and UBS retain between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the fees and commissions they produce, meaning a $2million producer gets a payout of $1million a year. Perks: In addition to big bonuses, banks offer top brokers other incentives, like prime parking spaces and hiring of their sales assistants . That is a pittance compared with the $235million that AR magazine calculated as the median income for the top 25 hedge fund managers in 2011, but retail advisers can count on a more consistent return than traders, whose pay gyrates dramatically from year to year. The top 25 hedge fund managers of 2010, for example took home $400million each. Even up-and-coming brokers with less than five years of experience who are generating $500,000 of revenue can attract hefty bonus deals, said Peterson. The bonuses persist because well-connected advisers have access to the assets of the very wealthy, the lifeblood of wealth management companies. And while brokerage executives may grouse about what it takes to move an elite broker - only a few hundred migrate a year at the upper levels, according to recruiters - they remain confident that the bonuses will ultimately pay off. 'Wealth management firms make the bulk of their profits on the top 10 per cent of their producers,' said Steven Eckhaus, a compensation attorney at Katten Muchin Rosenman whose clients include brokers and top securities firm executives who receive bonuses much higher than retail brokers. 'If the deals didn't make economic sense, they wouldn't do it.'","The bonuses can reach $15million for some teams over the course of years .

PUBLISHED: . 15:17 EST, 8 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:18 EST, 8 April 2012 . India and Pakistan’s leaders have vowed to heal the damaging rift between their countries. The pledge came at the first visit of a Pakistan head of state to India in seven years. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and visiting Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari held their first meeting in nearly three years in India's capital New Delhi – and said it was friendly and constructive. Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, left, shakes hands with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh . Mr Singh said: ‘Relations between India and Pakistan should become normal. That’s our common desire.’ Mr Zardari said: ‘We would like to have better relations.’ Tensions hit a new low after Pakistani terrorists slaughtered 166 people in Mumbai, India, in 2008. The nations remain at loggerheads over their rival claims to the Himalayan region of Kashmir.

Before Sunday, the two had not seen each other since June 2009, when they met in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. 'We have a number of issues, but we are willing to find practical and pragmatic solutions to all those issues,' Singh said. 'That’s the message President Zardari and I would like to convey.' Although Zardari was in India on what was called a private religious trip, the visit gave him a chance to meet Indian leaders amid a thaw in relations between the two countries.

He later left for Ajmer Sharif, a revered Muslim shrine in India’s western state of Rajasthan. Zardari’s visit to India is the most visible sign that the two countries have put behind them the enmity that followed the 2008 attacks in the Indian financial capital of Mumbai in which 10 Pakistani terrorists killed 166 people. India has blamed the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group for the Mumbai attacks and demanded that Islamabad crack down on the militants. Indian Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai told reporters that during their 40-minute meeting, the two leaders agreed to take a step-by-step approach to resolve the many long-standing problems that have dogged their countries’ relationship. Singh told Zardari that 'it was imperative to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice and prevent activities aimed against India from Pakistani soil,' Mathai said. However, both sides remain far from resolving their conflict over the Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim. Zardari was accompanied by about 25 family members, including his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who has been anointed his political heir.","The politicians chatted over lunch about healing relations between the two countries .

A ban on Christians claiming ‘God can heal’ has been challenged by a Tory MP who says he was cured  by prayer. Former Government Minister Gary Streeter spoke out after advertising watchdogs outlawed leaflets claiming God could cure people of back pain, depression and other ailments. The Advertising Standards Authority condemned material handed out by the Healing on the Streets group in Bath as misleading after a complaint was made by an atheist. The authority, chaired by former Labour Culture Secretary Lord Smith, also warned that the leaflets could deter sick people from seeking essential medical attention. But Mr Streeter cited his own religious ‘healing’ experience to challenge the ASA ruling. The MP, who was born with a painful condition in his right hand, claimed it had been cured after his wife Janet and other Christians prayed for him. Mr Streeter, MP for Devon South West, said: ‘It troubled me all my life. As soon as I got kicked or hit in the wrong place playing sport, it would be very painful.’ But the MP told The Mail on Sunday that since attending a church meeting in 1983, he had been pain-free. Demand: Mr Streeter also challenged Lord Smith to say if his authority would now rebuke football fans who have been praying for footballer Fabrice Muamba, pictured recovering from a heart attack in hospital . He said: ‘Towards the end of the service, we were asked if anyone was in need of healing. My hand had been causing a lot of pain for a long time. I just stood up, my wife put her hand on my back and prayed for me and job done. ‘Unfortunately, it stills look a bit funny but it hasn’t hurt since.’ Evidence: Mr Streeter has now called on Lord Smith to say 'on what scientific research or empirical evidence' the ASA based its decision . Mr Streeter, chairman of Christians in Parliament, said he suffered from a vascular problem, and added: ‘Basically, in my wrist, two arteries go into one where they shouldn’t.’ He has now called on Lord Smith to say ‘on what scientific research or empirical evidence’ the ASA based its decision. He also challenged him to say whether his authority would now rebuke the tens of thousands of football fans who have been praying for Fabrice Muamba, the Premiership player who suffered a heart attack in the middle of a game. Mr Streeter said: ‘It’s a pretty remarkable thing that the ASA can make such a statement, especially at the same time as we are all supposed to be praying for Fabrice Muamba.’ The MP, who served as a Minister in John Major’s Government in the Nineties, also launched a stinging attack on secular Britain as well as the commercialisation of Easter. He said: ‘We are living in an age of unbelief. It’s important from time to time for people to actually express what mainstream Christianity is  all about. It’s not about bunnies and painted eggs – it’s about issues of life and death.’ Mr Streeter’s comments come after David Cameron issued a rallying call for Christians to fight back against attempts to ban the wearing of crosses and town hall prayers. The Prime Minister used a pre-Easter meeting with Church leaders to say Britain needed the ‘values of the Bible’ more than ever. The ASA last night confirmed the Healing on the Streets group had appealed against the ruling.","Gary Streeter spoke out after advertising watchdogs outlawed leaflets claiming God could cure people of back pain, depression and other ailments .

Salute: Breivik gestured as he entered the courtroom, but was asked to stop doing it because he was offending his victims' families . The self-styled anti-Muslim militant . also demanded to be set free on the final day of the 10-week . proceedings, but it's unclear whether it helped the main point of his . defence: trying to prove he is sane. Final arguments revolved around the question of whether he is a lunatic or not with his defence lawyer stating in closing . arguments that Breivik was sane and had the ‘basic human right’ to be . punished for what he believed was a political act. If the judges agree with the prosecution . that Breivik is insane, he will be destined for a mental institution . instead of a prison. While some of Breivik's comments prompted laughter in the Oslo court, a serious atmosphere returned when he reiterated his motive for bombing the Norwegian capital's government headquarters, killing eight, and hunting down teenagers at the Labor Party's youth camp. Sixty-nine people were dead and dozens more injured in one of the worst peacetime shooting massacres by a single gunman. 'History shows that you have to commit a small barbarism to prevent a bigger barbarism,' the 33-year-old Norwegian said. 'The attacks on July 22 were preventive attacks to defend the indigenous Norwegian people,' he said. 'I therefore demand to be acquitted.' Carnage: The aftermath of the Oslo car bomb planted by mass killer Breivik . Blast: The Oslo bomb left scores injured on July 22 last year . Breivik claims the governing Labor Party has betrayed the country by accepting Muslim immigrants and must be stopped before turning Norway into what he called a 'multiculturalist hell'. Earlier today, defence lawyer Geir Lippestad had tried to prove his client is sane - the key issue to be resolved in the trial since Breivik admits the attacks. The killer shouted 'I will kill you all' and 'you shall die' as he took down his victims on the island . Lippestad also formally entered a plea for acquittal, but it was made out of principle, without any realistic chance of success. Also today, relatives of some of those killed tried to put their loss in words. Kirsti Loevlie, whose 30-year-old daughter Hanne was killed by the bomb, moved the court room to tears when she described the shock of finding out her daughter was dead, the grief of cleaning out her room and the first Christmas without her. Still, Loevlie said she felt a need to attend the trial, seeing Breivik in a position where he couldn't hurt anyone anymore. 'I am not going to be afraid of this man,' Loevlie said. 'I decided I would go to court. I felt I owed it to Hanne.' The court room burst out in applause and audible sobs as she finished her statement. Breivik remained motionless, his face blank. Lippestad tried to prove to the court that Breivik's claims of being a resistance fighter in a struggle to protect Norway and Europe from being colonised by Muslims are not delusional, but part of a political view shared by other right-wing extremist. Testimony: Ulrik Fredrik Malt, a professor of psychiatry, testifies in the case against terror and murder charged Anders Behring Breivik at a court in Oslo . Deliberation: Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen listens to arguments today as legal teams debate the sanity of Breivik. The defendant himself has instructed his lawyers to fight that he is sane . 'He realised that it is wrong to kill but he chose to kill. That's what terrorists do,' Lippestad said. 'The ends justify the means. You don't understand this if you don't understand the culture of right-wing extremists.' 'When Breivik talks about a civil war he's not fantasizing about tanks and soldiers in the forest, but referring to a low-intensity struggle he believes will last for 60 years', Lippestad said. 'None of us know what Europe will look like in 60 years,' Lippestad said. 'Who would have thought 10 years ago that a right-wing extremist party in Greece would get 10 per cent in the election now?' Two teams of psychiatrists reached opposite conclusions about Breivik's mental health. The first team diagnosed him with 'paranoid schizophrenia', a serious mental illness. Force: This photo shows members of the Norwegian Special Forces land by boat on the shore of the island of Utoeya during Breivik's shooting spree . Tributes: . The Norwegian killed 77 people on July 22 last year, first detonating a . car bomb in Oslo, then going on a shooting rampage at a camp on Utoya . Island (background) The second team found him legally sane, saying he suffers from a dissocial and narcissistic personality disorder, but is not psychotic. Prosecutors on Thursday called for an insanity ruling, saying there was enough doubt about Breivik's mental state to preclude a prison sentence. The five-judge panel will announce its ruling on August 24, chief judge Wenche Elisabeth Arntzen said. If deemed mentally competent, Breivik would likely be given Norway's maximum prison term of 21 years. A sentence can be extended beyond that if a prisoner is considered a menace to society.  If declared insane, he would be committed to a mental institution for as long as he's considered sick and dangerous to others. Prosecutors suggested Thursday that could mean he would be held for the rest of his life.  Lippestad's otherwise focused statement ended on a confusing note when he asked the court for the most lenient possible prison sentence for his client. After being corrected by Breivik, Lippestad said the defense asks for an acquittal or a lenient sentence, but primarily wants the court to reject the insanity claim. The trial, which started on April 16 in a purpose-built courtroom, started with Breivik crying on the first day. It was the only time he showed any emotion during the trial and came as prosecutors showed a YouTube video he posted online before the attacks. Breivik shot 69 people, most of them teenagers, at the ruling Labour Party's summer camp on Utoya Island, pictured with rescuers last July . It outlined his perception that Muslims are colonising Europe and that Christian Europeans will rise up in armed revolt.Breivik's defense lawyer Geir Lippestad said that he was moved by being reminded of his self-imposed mission to 'save Europe from an ongoing war'. For the first two days Breivik greeted the court with his own version of a fascist salute, but stopped after his lawyers told him that the victims' families found it offensive. On the penultimate day, after prosecutors asked for an insanity ruling that he rejected, the salute was back.Defiantly, Breivik thrust out his right arm with a clenched fist. This time he directed it straight at the prosecutors. Survivors of his rampage gave harrowing accounts, but the most gruesome testimony was from the gunman himself. Sparing no detail, he took a shocked courtroom through his killing spree on Utoya, victim by victim, bullet by bullet. His voice never cracked. His facial expression remained blank. Breivik's utter lack of emotion and empathy was seen by some psychiatrists as a symptom of a deep mental illness. He said he had prepared himself to keep his composure through meditation. The only outburst of anger during the entire trial came when an Iraqi man, whose brother was killed on Utoyam took off his shoe and tossed it at Breivik on May 11, hitting one of his defence lawyers. The hearing was briefly suspended as the man was led out of the court, crying. Besides that incident, the relatives of victims kept remarkably calm, saying they wanted to respect the judicial process. Some said Breivik must not have any opportunity to claim he didn't get a fair trial when it's all over. The five-judge panel will announce its ruling on . August 24. VIDEO: Sane or not?!

A survey of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion & Public Life comes as the former Massachusetts governor fights to keep his GOP front-runner status. The campaign moves next to the January 21 primary in South Carolina, where evangelical voters are key. Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, who is Mormon, is also seeking the Republican nomination. Front-runner: Mitt Romney's campaign has been emphasising values that Mormons and conservative Christians share . LDS church leaders have long . complained that critics take obscure or outdated Mormon teachings and . describe them as core doctrine. The church cast aside the teaching of . polygamy in 1890, and in 1978, abolished the barrier that kept those of . African descent from full participation in the church.

About 77 per cent of Mormons in the . survey identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, and most hold . much stronger conservative views than the general public.

Specialist search dogs are today being used to help officers check isolated land outside Castlederg, County Tyrone, where the teenager lived with her family. 'The sites to be covered in this phase of the search strategy have links to the overall investigation into Arlene’s disappearance and murder,' police said today. 'Searches will continue to be conducted on a planned roll-out, depending on weather conditions, availability of resources and operational commitments. 'Police would again thank landowners, in the public and private sectors, for their co-operation with the search operations,' the spokesman added.

A foreign doctor who failed to tell his NHS and police employers about his conviction for the 'mercy killing' manslaughter of a patient in Spain acted dishonestly, medical watchdogs found today. Dr Marcos Arel Hourmann worked for Dyfed Powys Police for more than two years despite being under investigation and subsequently convicted of manslaughter in Spain, the General Medical Council (GMC) has heard. He injected a cancer-riddled patient already at death’s door to 'rid her of the unbearable suffering' and end her life while working at a hospital in Spain in 2005, the GMC was told. Dr Marcos Arel Hourmann worked for Dyfed Powys Police for more than two years despite being under investigation and subsequently convicted of manslaughter in Spain, the General Medical Council has heard . Within a year, Dr Hourmann, 52, had come to the UK and started to work for the West Suffolk NHS Trust before getting another job with Carmarthenshire NHS Trust and going to work for the police as a forensic medical examiner. But he failed to tell any of his new employers about the continuing police investigation in Spain or the subsequent court case. Today, a fitness to practise panel of the GMC, sitting in Manchester, found that Dr Hourmann, who is not represented or present at the hearing in Manchester, acted dishonestly. The panel will now have to consider whether his actions amount to misconduct and, if so, whether the doctor should face punishment, such as being struck off. Within a year, Dr Hourmann, 52, had come to the UK and started to work for the West Suffolk NHS Trust before getting another job with Carmarthenshire NHS Trust and going to work for the police as a forensic medical examiner . The panel is not expected to give a decision until next week. In a letter to the panel, Dr Hourmann stated he was unfamiliar with medical rules that state if a doctor has been cautioned, charged or convicted of a criminal offence, anywhere in the world, they must declare this to the profession’s regulatory body - namely, the GMC. His explanation was not accepted by the GMC panel. The doctor also told the panel in writing that he was 'afraid' to lose his freedom and his job. The medic, who qualified as a doctor in Argentina and now lives in Spain, has been suspended from working as a doctor by the GMC. Earlier, the GMC heard that on March 28 2005, Dr Hourmann was working at the Mora D’Ebre district hospital in Tarragona, Spain, when an 82-year-old 'extremely ill' cancer patient, referred to only as CR, was admitted. The patient had advanced cancer of the colon and internal haemorrhaging and her family consented to her treatment by Dr Hourmann for 'sedative and palliative' care. In June 2007, applying for a job with Carmarthenshire NHS Trust in the A&E department at the Prince Philip Hospital (above), Dr Hourmann denied there were past, present or pending prosecutions on his record . When the patient became unconscious, he injected her with 60mg of potassium chloride, a lethal dose. Spanish court papers said the patient was 'begging for her suffering to be brought to an end' and Dr Hourmann may have thought, incorrectly, 'she was begging him to end her life', the GMC heard. It took four years for the case to be resolved in Spain, when Dr Hourmann was convicted at the provincial high court in Tarragona under Spanish law of 'involuntary manslaughter' and 'attempting to co-operate in the suicide of a seriously ill person whose death is imminent'. He was sentenced to one year in jail, which was suspended, and a further sentence of four months, 15 days' jail, substituted by him paying a fine of 1,620 euro (£1,359). But less than a year after killing the woman - by February 2006 - he lied to get a job with the West Suffolk NHS Trust. In a self-declaration form, he denied being under investigation, and in June 2007, applying for a job with Carmarthenshire NHS Trust in the A&E department at the Prince Philip Hospital, he again denied there were past, present or pending prosecutions on his record. Dr Hourmann then applied for a job with Dyfed Powys Police in April 2008. He was required to fill in forms, with one section asking whether he had any impending prosecutions or if he was the subject of a police investigation. In fact he left that part of the form blank - and it appears no one at the force checked the form. He worked for the force from May 2008 to October 2010 until his past history came to light, uncovered by the press. The GMC has now found his non-disclosure to both the NHS trusts and the police amounts to dishonesty. The hearing in Manchester continues.","Dr Marcos Hourmann worked for Dyfed Powys Police for more than two years .

Mrs Klemovich said her husband hasn't been talking much about his friend who died and that she did not know whether Mr Szabo has any close relatives. 'When I first talked to him I could tell he'd been through an ordeal,' she said. 'When he called back, he sounded pretty good.' She said she would wish her husband of 48 years a 'happy belated anniversary' after he missed their special date yesterday.","James Klemovich found in car by military on training exercise in Nevada .

Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire has lost a Supreme Court fight to keep the identity of the person who instructed him to intercept messages a secret. Mr Mulcaire, who intercepted mobile phone messages while working for the News of the World, failed to persuade the UK’s highest court that he should be able to rely on privilege against self-incrimination in civil phone-hacking proceedings. The announcement follows three arrests this morning of a prison officer and two . other people in connection with the police probe . into corrupt payments to officials by journalists. Two men aged 46 and 37 and a woman aged 50 were held this morning at addresses in south-east London, Surrey and Kent. They are being questioned at separate south London police stations, Scotland Yard said. It has been reported that one of those arrested is a former journalist for the Mirror - but this has not been confirmed. Mr Mulcaire had asked five Supreme Court justices to rule on whether he must disclose who instructed him. He said his lawyers advised him that he should not have to give 'potentially incriminating answers' to questions asked in civil litigation at the High Court, and the appeal was made to protect his 'legitimate legal interests'. Five years ago Mr Mulcaire and former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman were jailed after the Old Bailey heard that they plotted to hack into royal aides’ telephone messages. At the Supreme Court today, the five justices unanimously dismissed his appeal. Ruling: Mr Mulcaire had asked five justices at the Supreme Court (pictured) to rule on whether he must disclose who instructed him . Mr Mulcaire says he is at risk of being charged with criminal offences, and faces damages claims at the High Court, many of which have been brought by celebrities. He fears he may incriminate himself if he answers questions in the civil proceedings. Mr Mulcaire appealed to the Supreme Court after losing fights in the High Court and Court of Appeal. His battle began after Nicola Phillips, who was an assistant to public relations consultant Max Clifford, claimed her voicemail had been unlawfully intercepted. Judges in the High Court and Appeal Court ruled that Mr Mulcaire should disclose information relating to Ms Phillips’s claim. Mr Mulcaire was again arrested in December following the launch of a new police investigation, the Supreme Court was told at a hearing in London in May. A lawyer told the judges Mr Mulcaire had been released on bail without charge pending further inquiries. Mr Mulcaire said in a statement released before the start of the Supreme Court hearing: 'The police have all the relevant documents from me since 2006 and I have already faced criminal proceedings, been convicted, and served a prison sentence. 'All the steps taken by my legal team in respect of the civil claims against me are to protect my legitimate legal interests.' Today’s ruling was made by Lord Hope, Lord Walker, Lord Kerr, Lord Clarke and Lord Dyson. Nicola Phillips former employee of Max Clifford . Lord Walker, announcing the decision of the court, said the appeal 'arises out of what has become known as the phone-hacking scandal'. After the hearing, in a statement issued through his lawyer, Mr Mulcaire said: 'I will comply with the Supreme Court ruling to answer questions in Ms Phillips’ case. 'I will consider with my lawyers what the wider implications of this judgment are, if and when I am asked to answer questions in other cases.' In a statement issued through her lawyer, Ms Phillips said: 'This judgment will benefit a significant number of claimants who seek similar information.' Her solicitor, Mark Lewis, said: 'The Supreme Court judgment is a significant milestone in the phone-hacking scandal. 'The Supreme Court has ruled that Glenn Mulcaire cannot hide behind his right to silence. 'He will now have to serve a witness statement answering questions about the News of the World journalist or journalists who gave him instructions and the nature of that information.' He added: 'The Nicola Phillips judgment will have wide-ranging consequences in relation to all the phone hacking claimants and beyond.' Mr Lewis said he expected Mr Mulcaire would serve a statement to Ms Phillips’ legal team within the next three weeks. Lord Walker said during 2005 and 2006 Mr Mulcaire worked as a private investigator, 'often engaged by staff on the News of the World Newspaper then published by News Group Newspapers Ltd (NGN)'. In January 2007, Mr Mulcaire and Mr Goodman pleaded guilty to offences relating to the interception of voicemail messages of the Royal Household and were sentenced to six and four months’ imprisonment respectively. Lord Walker said during 2008-2010 'a large number of civil claims were brought by individuals against NGN and some against Mr Mulcaire, claiming that messages on their mobile phones had been unlawfully intercepted'. Investigation: The announcement follows three arrests in connection with the Scotland Yard police probe into corrupt payments to officials by journalists . In May 2010, Ms Phillips began proceedings against NGN in relation to voicemail messages left on her mobile phone. Part . of her case was that the contents of voicemail messages left by clients . on her mobile included 'factual information, some of which is private . information and some of which is commercially confidential information. She . applied to add Mr Mulcaire as a defendant and for an order that he . serve a witness statement disclosing information under several heads, . including the identity of the person instructing him to intercept the . messages. He opposed the . order for disclosure, relying on privilege against self-incrimination, . on the basis that he could not be required to disclose that information . as to do so would tend to expose him to prosecution. The arrests were made this morning between 6am and 8am following inquiries made by officers from . Operation Elveden, which is investigation allegations of inappropriate . payments to police and public officials. All three were arrested on suspicion . of corruption, conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to cause . misconduct in a public office.

"By . Charles Walford . PUBLISHED: . 04:20 EST, 7 February 2012 . Sixty years ago, as the Queen was preparing to accede to the throne, distillers on her Balmoral estate were taking care of preparations of their own. And yesterday, as Her Majesty celebrated 60 years of her reign, the final touches were put on a whisky especially produced to mark the anniversary. The blended malt and grain 'Diamond Jubilee' whisky, which was distilled in 1952, was finally bottled at the Royal Lochnagar distiller. Only 60 bottles  were made at the distillery on the Balmoral Estate in Ballater, Aberdeenshire. One will be gifted to the Queen and the others will be sold around the world for £100,000 each. Scroll down for video . The whisky was bottled by John Walker & Sons to mark 60 years to the day since The Queen's accession . Jim Beveridge, master blender at John Walker & Sons with one of 60 decanters of Diamond Jubilee produced at the Royal Lochnagar Distillery on the Balmoral Estate . The design of the bottle to mark the anniversary was revealed last June . The whisky’s creation was overseen by master blender Jim Beveridge at John Walker & Sons.He said: 'The whisky was first distilled in 1952 and there was a great deal of care and attention at that stage. 'It was then stored in our distilleries until about the beginning of last year when we started to think about what whiskies we would use in the project. 'We tested the whiskies and we felt it would be good to marry the blends in a special oak cask, and the process will be completed today when we decant the whisky into the glass.' Mr Beveridge, who has worked at Royal Lochnagar distillery for 30 years, said it was a 'privilege to be involved in such a unique project'. He added: 'It’s a very special blend and all the craftsmen that have been involved in the creation of the project and all the things that surround the whisky are really very special as well.' Each crystal decanter is accompanied by two hand-engraved lead crystal glasses, enclosed in a wooden cabinet made from oak and pine from the Queen’s Sandringham and Balmoral estates. All the profits fromt he sale of the remaining 59 bottles will go to the . Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust (Qest), a charity which provides . grants and training to craftspeople in the UK. Some of the craftsmanship is the work of former Qest scholars. Qest chairman Richard Watling said: 'The creation of this beautiful work, a monument to the skills of its craftspeople and the definitive tribute to 60 years of Her Majesty’s reign, is of enormous significance to Qest. 'Someone asked how we define craft, and I said, ""Look at the royal wedding and Westminster Abbey; take out all the things that would not be there were there not a craftsman to do it, like the pews, the dresses and the uniforms, and you are left with nothing"". Yesterday pupils at Dersingham Infant and Nursery School in Norfolk welcomed the Queen as she marked 60 years to the day since becoming monarch . The decanting process marked the final stage in the project which began 60 years ago . 'Craft has a really important role in . the culture and success of our country and someone has to make all . these things that we all see and enjoy, and it’s these people we aim to . help.' The charity provides around 15 scholarships each year across the UK. The price of the whisky means, however, that few people can enjoy it. David Gates, who grants the Royal Warrant for Johnnie Walker, said interest among buyers was high. He said: 'Apart from people who have a few spare pennies, the kind of people who will be interested in this will want to buy a piece of history. They will be getting something completely unique and very rare. 'We are talking to people all across the world, whisky lovers and people with an affection for the Royal Family. The level of interest has been quite extraordinary.' Smiling, he said: 'As Royal Warrant holders, we are not allowed to talk about the supply or consumption of whisky in the Royal Family. But I think you can expect that our products are well received in the household.' The Queen attends the State Opening of Parliament in 1952, the year she acceded to the throne - and the year that the Diamond Jubilee whisky was distilled . A blender at John Walker & Sons oversees the meticulous final steps of the bottling process . Meanwhile, another whisky specialist is selling an £8,000 60-year-old single malt to mark the Queen’s Jubilee. Gordon & MacPhail in Elgin, Moray, has produced 85 bottles called Glen Grant 60 Years Old which were distilled on February 2, 1952, four days before the Queen acceded to the throne. It was bottled on February 2 this year, making it exactly 60 years old. This drink is described as having . aromas of Cox’s Pippins and Granny Smith apples, laced with cinnamon and . root ginger.

Urszula Nowozeniuk arrives at court to give evidence in the trial of her husband, masseur Daniel Pytlarz . The wife of a masseur accused of sexually assaulting 18 women yesterday said she didn’t have the ‘smallest concern’ about her husband’s behaviour. Urszula Nowozeniuk, 32, was sitting in the reception of the upmarket spa that she owns with Daniel Pytlarz as he allegedly groped his clients in a nearby room. But giving evidence for his defence, she told Southwark Crown Court: ‘I have never had any doubts in his professionalism or his work. ‘I’ve never, never seen anything that gave me even the smallest concern that something wasn’t right. 'I still regard myself as in a relationship with him. I still regard myself as married to him. I still feel the same way about him.’ Pytlarz was arrested last year after being accused of intimately touching women at the spa, including a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney who received a free massage at the Violet Clinic Body and Skincare Spa in St John’s Wood, north-west London. Miss Nowozeniuk, who has been married to Pytlarz for nearly two years, said that she chatted with her after her massage finished and that she ate some of the ginger cookies that she had just baked. She said: ‘We had a small talk. I asked her if she knew someone from a PR agency as we were thinking to promote the salon and try and get more celebrity clients. She said she would give me a number. She seemed completely normal.’ That evening she got a call from Sir . Paul’s daughter, Mary McCartney, who is also a client of Pytlarz, . cancelling the singer’s massage because their plane had got stuck in . snow in Switzerland. 'No concern': Urszula Nowozeniuk, pictured with husband Daniel Pytlarz in Mauritius, says she is standing by him after he was accused of sexually assaulting 18 women . Pytlarz, 35, had several other celebrity clients including Nancy Dell’olio and members of the Saudi royal family, the court has heard. His wife said: 'It’s always important for every business to have celebrity clients and people in the media. 'But they all came by recommendation. We haven’t called anyone.’ She . told of the struggle to build up their joint-owned Violet Clinic Body . and Skincare Spa in St John’s Wood, north west London often working long . hours for seven days a week. Full support: Miss Nowozeniuk (left) said she would have raised any concerns she had about her husband (right) if she felt 'something wasn't right' But Miss Nowozeniuk who has been with Pytlarz for eight years and married to him for nearly two, said she was standing by her husband because she believed in him, not because she had to. She said: 'I can always go home and my parents always welcome me in the family business. 'I could find a job as a beauty therapist all over the world. We had a good relationship. We really supported each other.' One of Sir Paul McCartney's former employees, who has accused Pytlarz of sexual assault, received a free massage from him the day before Pytlarz was due to give the Beatle and his partner Nancy (pictured) a massage at their London home . As she left the witness stand, she smiled at her smartly dressed husband, who blew her a kiss from behind the glass fronted dock. Pytlarz earlier told the court he would have been 'insane' to have me sexually abused women in his clinic as his wife was waiting next door. He said: 'I have got beautiful wife, I’m happily married and we wanted to have a child together. 'I’ve built a business, I’ve got myself up on my feet, why would I do anything to destroy that?’ Pytlaz, from St John’s Wood, denies 21 counts of sexual abuse.

Police are examining the camera and computers at the home of Dave McMillen after the shocking discovery in his class at a junior high school. Police believe the 51-year-old used the camera to take 'upskirt' photos and have launched an investigation into alleged voyeurism. Science teacher: Police are examining the camera and computers at the home of Dave McMillen after the shocking discovery in his class at a junior high school . McMillen resigned from his job at Selah Junior High School in Selah, Washington, after police launched the investigation. School officials have given no reason for the teacher's resignation. McMillen was put on administrative leave earlier this month after students in his ninth grade class reported the hidden camera. Police said the miniature device was no more than two inches wide. It was discovered by accident when a student knocked it loose. Chief Stacy Dwarshuis said they are awaiting the results of an analysis of the camera's content. He also confirmed that computers had been seized from McMillen's home. Chief Dwarshuis said McMillen had taken the right option by resigning while the investigation continues.

Disturbing footage has emerged allegedly showing Syrian troops beating an anti-government rebel in the suburbs of the country's capital, Damascus. The mobile video, which came to light yesterday, has not yet been verified. It shows a man lying face down on a dusty floor, his hands behind his back as three others - two of them wearing fatigues -  stand on his neck and back, kicking him and hitting him with a small club. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Frames from the mobile video footage uploaded to YouTube, which allegedly shows members of the Syrian government forces beating a rebel in the suburbs of Damascus . The clip was uncovered by news agency AFP as a UN-brokered peace deal for Syria appeared to collapse. President Bashar Assad's government made a new last minute demand that its opponents provide 'written guarantees' to lay down their weapons before regime forces withdraw from cities - a call swiftly rejected by the country's main rebel group. It came amid claims that heavy fighting during the past week has led to 1,000 deaths. The deal, brokered by UN and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan, was due to take effect on Tuesday, paving the way for negotiations to end the country's year-old crisis, which the UN estimates has killed 9,000 people. Mr Annan said last week that the Syrian president had accepted the plan and its call for government forces to pull back from urban centres. But yesterday Syria's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jihad Makdessi, placed a new condition - that the opposition agree in writing 'to halt violence with all its forms and their readiness to lay down weapons.' The commander of the rebel Free . Syrian Army, Riad al-Asaad, said his group was prepared to abide by the . Annan agreement, but rejected the government's new unilateral demand. The . Free Syrian Army does not recognise the regime 'and for that reason we . will not give guarantees,' he said, adding the government should . withdraw its forces to bases and remove checkpoints from streets. Mr . Annan's deal calls for government forces to withdraw from population . centres on Tuesday, to be followed by a full ceasefire by both sides by . 6am on Thursday. Even before the setback, expectations were low that the Assad regime would honor the agreement. Fighting: An armoured vehicle belonging to the Syrian army is seen in the Al Qusoor district of Homs yesterday . On the brink: A peace deal is close to collapse as demonstrators protest against President Assad's regime in Kafranbel, near Idlib yesterday . Russia, an Assad ally that supports . the cease-fire plan, may now be the only one able to salvage it. The . rest of the international community, unwilling to contemplate military . intervention, has little leverage over Syria. However, in recent days, Syrian . forces have stepped up shelling attacks on restive towns, and activists . say scores of civilians have been killed daily - at least 100 on . Saturday alone. Mr Annan said in a statement that 'the present escalation of violence is unacceptable'. He . also reminded the government 'of the need for full implementation of . its commitments,' though it was unclear whether his statement was issued . before or after Damascus imposed new conditions for complying with the . truce. Activists said at least 21 people were killed in violence yesterday. Fighting: A building is damaged in the Al Qusoor district of Homs in this newly-released picture from Friday following reports of a crackdown by Assad forces . In addition to demanding written . guarantees from the opposition, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad . Makdessi said Syria also wants assurances from Annan that Qatar, Turkey . and Saudi Arabia - Assad's most active critics - halt 'financing and . arming of terrorist groups.' Qatar and Saudi Arabia are said to be . creating a multimillion pound fund to pay rebel fighters, while Turkey . has floated the idea of creating buffer zones for refugees in Syrian . territory, near the Turkish border. Many had expected the Assad regime to . stall and create new obstacles to a truce because it has little to fear . from the international community, said Peter Harling, an analyst at the . International Crisis Group think tank. 'Nothing seems to have a price tag,' he said, noting that regime has been accused of shelling whole . neighborhoods, exacting collective punishment and driving people out of . their homes. Burnt out: Another YouTube clip uploaded earlier this week shows the debris of a destroyed vehicle (left) and a burning car allegedly caught in shelling by Syrian government forces in Qusur . Mourning: Yet more YouTube footage from this week shows Syrians carrying the coffins of people allegedly killed by regime forces in Duma, near the capital Damascus . The regime might also be reluctant to move forward for fear of losing control. While Annan's plan calls for eventual negotiations between the government and the opposition over Syria's political future, anti-regime activists say huge numbers of protesters would probably flood the streets and quickly topple Assad if he were forced to halt his yearlong crackdown. Makdessi, the Syrian official, suggested that a truce without guarantees would give rebels the upper hand. He said Syria will not allow a repeat of what happened during the Arab League's observer mission in Syria in January, when Assad pulled back his forces, only to see rebels flood the vacated areas. The Syrian foreign minister is expected in Moscow on Monday, but it is not clear whether Russia will step in to try to salvage the Annan plan it had supported enthusiastically. Activists said rebel fighters shot down a Syrian army helicopter with a heavy machine gun in northwestern Idlib province yesterday. Running battles: Smoke rises from a building in the Al Qusoor district of Homs yesterday . Some of the heaviest fighting of the day was in Homs, where government troops attacked several rebel-held neighborhoods, said Badrakhan, the local activist. In the Khaldiyeh neighborhood, 40 bodies were piled in a room in a makeshift hospital because the constant shelling has prevented burials, he said, adding that activists are aiming fans at the corpses so they won't decompose quickly. 'We might have to bury them in public gardens,' he said. Near the capital of Damascus, government troops raided the suburbs of Darya, Douma and Beit Jin. The grass-roots Local Coordination Committees put the day's death toll on the opposition side at 45, including six children. It said nine people were killed in Homs and 13 in Hama province, among them seven members of one family. The Observatory reported at least 21 civilians killed in fighting and shelling by government forces, along with seven rebel fighters and 12 soldiers.

The girlfriend of the 28-year-old New York City police officer who killed himself was on the phone with him seconds before he killed himself. Maria Stuart says that she was trying to tell her fiancé Terrence Dean, who worked as a cop in Queens in the 111th precinct, to go get help because she felt he was suicidal. 'Fine, I'm going to kill myself,' he responded immediately before pointing his gun at his head and pulling the trigger. Fatal: Investigators look for evidence after a police officer, 28, shot himself on the job in Queens after a fight with his girlfriend . Ms Stuart, 28, called her mentally unstable fiancé minutes after calling his precinct to leave an anonymous tip leaving a vague warning that one of the force’s officers was suicidal. She didn’t mention Dean by name, instead asking hypothetical questions about what actions would be taken with an officer who was suicidal and whether or not he would lose his gun. On Thursday around 10pm, Dean was responding to a car burglary and was still at the scene with his police partner and the two men whose car was robbed when he killed himself. More...

In the days leading up to the suicide, Dean had threatened to kill himself and those around him a number of times. Ms Stuart said that part of the reason why he was depressed was because he felt that his family had pressured him into becoming a police officer instead of pursuing his dream of being a fire fighter. On Wednesday, the day before he died, Dean threatened to kill himself by putting his gun in his mouth while at home with Ms Stuart. That same day, he stormed out of the house after the couple had a fight because Ms Stuart had left her engagement ring at work. Dean stormed out of the house and shot the windows of his car. Investigation: Officers gather at the scene where a colleague committed suicide while out responding to a call . His father, Avery Dean, came to the Queens house to meet with his son in the garage that afternoon, and while they were talking, the younger Dean threatened to kill himself again. After these violent outbursts, Ms Stuart feared for her safety and the safety of her five-year-old daughter, which is why she called the police station Thursday to see if his gun would be taken away if he declared himself suicidal. She was the last to speak to Dean before he killed himself, and insists that the couple was not fighting. At the time he was responding to a complaint by 27-year-old Daniel Ben-Jacob who told the officers that someone had broken into his car and stole some PlayStation games and his radio, his brother Zeev told the Post. While Dean’s partner was speaking with Mr Ben-Jacob, Dean himself was outside on his cell phone. The Mr Ben-Jacob asked if Dean could dust for prints, which apparently annoyed Dean who responded by saying ‘Can’t you see I’m on the phone?’ Zeev said that Dean then pulled out his gun and pointed it at Daniel before turning it on himself. 'He puts the gun in his mouth and fires,' a police officer told the New York Daily News on Friday. Those nearby thought the disturbance was merely a large garbage can, as residents of the affluent neighbourhood had never heard gunshots. The officer who took Dean’s girlfriend’s warning call will not face any disciplinary proceedings, as they acted in accordance with NYPD rules.","Terrence Dean, 28, shot himself in the head late Thursday night while responding to an car burglary .

"By . Eleanor Harding . UPDATED: . 03:24 EST, 8 March 2012 . Middle class retired people could be £1,000 better off every year under proposals to exempt them from paying income tax on their state pensions. The Treasury’s tax advisers have suggested scrapping the levy because many pensioners consider it unfair. The Office for Tax Simplification made the proposal in a report that condemned the current tax rules for retired people as 'confusing’. Better off? Current tax rules for retired people were condemned in a report as being 'confusing' According to HM Revenue and Customs estimates, almost 5.6million people receiving the basic state pension pay income tax. Often, they do so because private pension payments and savings interest take their total income above the tax threshold. More than 1.5 million of them have to fill in a self-assessment form. The report to Treasury ministers pointed out there was a ‘patchwork of allowances and rules which many in their later years find very confusing’. It added that making people pay tax on the basic state pension made the system significantly more complex. Official figures show that less than 50 per cent of all retired people are even aware that their state pension income is subject to tax. Almost 5.6million people receiving the basic state pension pay income tax - and more than 1.5million of them have to fill in a self-assessment form (pictured) The report states: ‘Many of those who do understand that it is taxable feel that this is unjust, given that they have contributed through the national insurance system through their working life.’ And among the options considered in the report is: ‘exempt the state pension from tax altogether’. Quantitative easing has increased the shortfalls in corporate pensions, industry experts have warned. In an attempt to drive down interest rates the Bank of England resumed its gilt purchases in October. But the move has added £90billion to pensions shortfalls, according to the National Association of Pension Funds. 'Businesses running final salary pensions are being clouted,' said Joanne Segars, chief executive of NAPF. 'Deficits that were already big now look even bigger because of [QE's] artificial distortions.' She added that while NAPF was in favour of measures to stimulate the economy, QE had wreaked havoc on both personal and company pension schemes. A full basic state pension is worth £5,311 a year, so pensioners would be £1,060 better off without paying the 20 per cent income tax on it. The report stressed the advisers, an independent body set up by the Chancellor, George Osborne, had not yet reached a conclusion on the issue. They will now study the implications of full tax exemption before producing recommendations for ministers in a second report expected later this year. Another option they are considering is making all state pension payments through the PAYE system, so that they are taxed at source. This could reduce the number of older people who suddenly find themselves burdened with self-assessment. The report adds: ‘For some, the arrival of a combination of their state pension and a limited income from their savings and investment can mean for the first time that they need to complete a self-assessment tax return, just when they thought that life was getting easier.’ The Revenue and the Department for Work and Pensions could also do more to explain pension tax rules to the public, it added. A Treasury spokesman said that ministers would respond to the report in the Budget later this month, but did not expect formal recommendations until later this year.","Treasury's tax advisers suggested scrapping the levy because pensioners consider it unfair .

"By . James Salmon . UPDATED: . 04:32 EST, 28 February 2012 . The boss of HSBC has been forced to forfeit £1.3million of his bonus after the bank was embroiled in two of the biggest episodes of mis-selling affecting thousands of customers. The decision to strip Stuart Gulliver of the financial award was yesterday described as a symbolic gesture of remorse by Britain’s biggest bank. HSBC is also clawing back shares and cash from several senior employees. Bonus surrender: Stuart Gulliver is being stripped of £1.3million from his bonus - but he will still take home an extra £5.9m on top of his £1.25m basic salary . However, on the day it posted a profit of just under £14billion for last year, it emerged Mr Gulliver will still receive a £5.9million bonus on top of his basic salary of £1.25million for his 2011 performance. Critics welcomed the decision to claw back the money and encouraged other banks to follow suit, but conceded it is unlikely to make a major dent in the pay package of some the UK’s richest bankers. The five highest paid staff at the bank shared pay and perks worth £27.7million – an average of £5.5million each. Some 192 HSBC staff will take home around £1million each. The bank, like others in the UK, was caught up in the mis-selling of payment protection insurance – policies sold to maintain loan repayments in case of illness or redundancy. Thousands of elderly and frail customers were also persuaded to put life-savings into risky investments that would never come to fruition while they were alive by employees of HSBC’s Nursing Home Fees Agency. Top results: HSBC posted profits of £14billion last year. Following the results, 192 staff will take home bonuses of at least £1m . Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘It’s great that they are finally being hit where it hurts – in their pockets. The only thing I regret is they aren’t being told to give up more of their bonuses.’ Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which? said: ‘It is good to see action being taken and the pressure is now on for the other banks to follow this lead.’ The news comes just days after Lloyds Banking Group ‘adjusted’ payouts to 13 directors, reducing them by £2million to reflect the scandal of mis-sold insurance. HSBC said last night it has increased to £396million the amount it has set aside for PPI compensation pay-outs. The bank refused to reveal how many of its top staff would be affected by the claw back. But those whose share windfalls are understood to have been affected include Mr Gulliver’s predecessor, Michael Geoghegan. Group finance director Iain Mackay has also been penalised but still receives a package of £2.5million, including a £1.1million bonus. The bank said cuts were not about penalising individuals but that the compensation bills meant it had ‘overstated’ previous profits.","Stuart Gulliver will STILL receive £5.9m bonus on top of £1.25m basic salary .

Laura Johnson, pictured outside Inner London Crown Court, sent a gangster flirtatious messages hours before they embarked on a looting spree during last summer's riots, a court heard yesterday . The daughter of a millionaire was seen ‘laughing and joking’ with three men she claimed forced her to drive a getaway car on a two-hour looting spree, a court heard yesterday. Laura Johnson, 20, was one of hundreds of teenagers who scurried ‘like wild rats’ around an under-siege retail park on the ‘worst night’ of the London riots. The grammar school pupil was spotted by a motorist loading a flat-screen TV into the boot of her car amidst the ‘mayhem’ as her accomplices ran back and forth with stolen goods, a jury heard. University student Johnson, then 19, claims she was so scared of her passengers that she drove them around South-East London as they looted a haul of electrical goods, alcohol and cigarettes. But a jury at Inner London Crown Court has heard that the company director’s daughter had been in a ‘intimate’ relationship with one of the men - a crack cocaine dealing robber called Sylar. The prosecution has also dismissed Johnson’s claims, saying she ‘knew what she was doing’. The motorist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court yesterday that he saw the straight-A student three times in the early hours of August 9, driving her distinctive black Smart car. One of these was at a petrol station, where he said one of her balaclava-wearing passengers waved a foot-long knife at him. Describing the first time he spotted Johnson, on the Stone Lake retail park in Charlton, he said: ‘There were a couple of hundred people running backwards and forwards to a retail park. ‘They had TVs in their hands and boxes and all sorts. I had never seen anything like it. It was like wild rats running around.’ He said he saw a white woman sat in the car and three black men running backwards and forth to put stolen goods in it. Watched by Johnson’s parents Robert and Lindsay, who run direct marketing company Avongate, he added: ‘The white female got out of the car within two minutes of me being there and I saw her bring out a flat-screen TV. 'It was unboxed. She went over to Currys and PC World, she was gone for about one minute, then she put the TV in the back of the car.’ The car drove off, but the witness later saw it at two separate petrol stations. One of these, a Shell Garage, in nearby Eltham, was being used as a ‘meeting point’ for rioters, he said. The witness added: ‘I saw the same girl I had seen already. A black man was behind her. He held a knife up to me. He had a balaclava on.’ Later on, he spotted the group at another nearby petrol station. ‘The girl was in the front and she was laughing and joking,’ he added. Frenzy: Johnson's trial heard how hundreds of rioters scurried 'like wild rats' around Stone Lake Retail Park in Charlton (above) When Johnson was later arrested at another retail park, police found three LCD televisions, alcohol and cigarettes in her car. The items were said to have been looted from a Currys store, a Comet and a BP garage. Earlier . in the trial, the jury was told how Johnson had been treated for . anxiety and depression at a psychiatric hospital before the riots. She . later told police that she had been a ‘bit concerned’ by the acts of . that night, but that she had driven the car as the three men were ‘not . the sort of people you say no to’. Privileged upbringing: Johnson was accompanied to court by her mother Lindsay (centre) and father Robert (right), who run direct marketing company Avongate . Family home: Johnson has been bailed to her parents' large, detached house in Orpington . On trial: Johnson at court in September, a month after the riots .

The weekend before she would have started her freshman year of high school, 14-year-old Alicia DeBolt bounded out of her house shortly before midnight, ready to party. She never came back home. The next day, her family reported her missing, setting off a search that ended three days later when her charred body - with traces of duct tape on her ankles and face - was found at an asphalt plant just south of town. On Monday, almost two years later, Adam Joseph Longoria will stand trial in her killing. Brutally murdered: The charred remains of Alicia DeBolt, 14, were found at a Kansas asphalt plant in 2010 . Facing life: Adam Joseph Longoria, 38, is charged with capital murder, attempted rape and criminal solicitation of a minor, and will stand trial March 26 . Prosecutors hope a trove of hundreds of text messages, surveillance photos from the convenience store where he bought a half gallon of gas the night of her disappearance, gruesome crime scene photos and DNA evidence are enough to win a conviction. The community of Great Bend was so shaken by the cheerleader's August 2010 death that more than 2,000 people attended a vigil to remember the teen known as 'Babygurl.' Attorneys face a daunting task to find jurors who have not heard about the high-profile case in Barton County, a western Kansas community of 27,674 people. Judge Hannelore Kitts has rejected defence efforts to move the trial, despite defence team arguments that a university survey it commissioned of 400 local residents found that all were familiar with the case and that most thought Longoria was guilty. The judge instead sided with prosecutors who argued the people of the county deserve the opportunity to have the case heard at home, contending the court should not assume jurors would not set aside any opinions and decide the case on its merits. En masse: The community of Great Bend was so shaken by the cheerleader's August 2010 death that more than 2,000 people attended a vigil to remember the teen known as 'Babygurl' Disbelief: Friends and classmates of Ms DeBolt exchanged hugs and cried during the vigil . A town in shock: Mourners held candles at the August 29, 2010 vigil for Alicia DeBolt in in downtown Great Bend . Longoria, 38, was arrested after he was found driving an SUV stolen from the asphalt company where he worked and where the girl's body had been found days earlier. Prosecutors have portrayed him as being immediately obsessed with Alicia after seeing her at a July 2010 birthday party for his live-in girlfriend, Eva Brown. 'He began to woo Alicia by fawning over her and providing her with mixed alcohol drinks. He wanted Alicia to be `his girl,'' prosecutors wrote in one filing. 'He began to woo Alicia by fawning over her and providing her with mixed alcohol drinks. He wanted Alicia to be ""his girl.""' 'When another male took her home at the end of the party, the defendant became upset, later accusing this individual of blocking his attempts to have sex with Alicia.' Longoria and the girl began texting the day after that party, exchanging 55 messages on July 18, 2010. Longoria called Alicia 'miss shy' and 'hot stuff' and asked her to send him a picture, which she did. Prosecutors say Longoria attempted unsuccessfully on four other occasions to get Alicia in the car with him. The state contends that on Aug. 21, 2010, Longoria's 'depraved fantasy' came true when he finally lured Alicia into his vehicle, took her to an isolated area, attempted to rape her and killed her. Fatal attraction: Longoria, left, allegedly seduced the teen through text messages and had a 'depraved fantasy' Appearing in court: Adam Longoria was seen in court March 22 of last year . Employees at Venture Corp., the asphalt company, initially thought they had found a mannequin on the property, until they noticed flies around the burned figure and called police. The body was so badly burned and decomposition so advanced that the specific cause of death remains unknown. All officials can say for sure is that they don't think she was burned alive. Longoria has vigorously denied the charges of capital murder, attempted rape and criminal solicitation of a minor. He has a lengthy criminal record, and was released from a Texas prison where he had been serving a seven-year sentence for aggravated robbery just three months before Alicia was killed. The state is not seeking the death penalty, but if convicted of capital murder Longoria could be sentenced to life in prison without parole. He has claimed that he did not see Alicia on the night she disappeared, saying someone else took his car and cell phone that night. His attorney has tried unsuccessfully to suppress inconsistent statements Longoria made to investigators about his whereabouts at the time. He also faces charges for vehicle burglary and theft of property relating to that stolen vehicle.Prosecutors likely plan to show the jury texts exchanged on the day she was killed. An hour before Alicia left her house, Longoria allegedly texted the girl's phone: 'I can pick up and we can go out and party we will have fun.' Another text message 21 minutes later read, 'I have 5 bottles and 5 cases of beer an (sic) 1 house and there will be lots of people.' She replied, 'K.' A few minutes later she texted him saying she was ready and gave him her home address.At 10:59 p.m., Longoria texted her again: 'B there in 3 mins.' A minute later, came the reply: 'I'm here.' The last signal picked up from Alicia's phone was at 11:40 p.m. At 12:57 a.m., Longoria texted the girl's phone one last time: 'There isn't going 2 b a party never mind.'","Adam Joseph Longoria, 38, allegedly seduced 14-year-old Alicia DeBolt with text messages and promised her alcohol .

The footage was shot outside a West Hollywood nightclub and shows a man laying face down on the pavement, while one man, whop is believed to be a bouncer, shouts a homophobic remark at him as well as punching him twice. One of the pair frequently shouts at the man to stay still, although the victim is not struggling and with his hands pulled behind his back, he is powerless to move. Outrage: A video posted online of a 'gay man being held down and punched' outside a West Hollywood nightclub has caused fury across the internet . One of the men, who is thought to be a bouncer, appears to shout a homophobic remark at the victim - he frequently shouts at the man not to move, but the victim is quite still with his hands . pulled behind his back . The incident, on Santa Monica Boulevard and North Edinburgh Avenue, is reported to have taken place on February 25, across the street from the famous Voyeur nightclub, a spot popular with celebrities. Bouncers . do not have any more rights than citizens - if someone has done . something wrong they can hold the person until the police arrive, which . is essentially a citizen's arrest, but they can not physically assault someone, as this video appears to show. In the short clip, the bald-headed man and another man hold down the victim while one of them accuses him of starting a fight. 'Look at my face man - they f***ed me up,'  the victim protests. One of two men holding him down shouts: 'F**k your face. I don't give a s**t about your face.' To which the victim replies 'Trust me please I didn't start the s**t. I was with my boyfriend. I'm a gay boy.' At . that point the victim is punched once in the back of his head and again to the back of his head. 'Stop resisting,' one of the men says. 'Stay still motherf***er.' Beating: At one point the victim receives a punch to his back and head by the man in black . A man, who is thought to be a security guard, walks up at the end, and one of the men says to him, 'Hey can we get some cuffs please' Then one of the pair yells: 'Stop f***in' moving you c***sucker.' Seconds later, a man, who is thought to be a security guard, walks up, and one of the men says to him, ‘Hey can we get some cuffs please.’ 'Stay where you are motherf***er,' the victim is told. 'Shut up.' One user who watched the video commented:  'Ah, the magical cry of 'stop resisting' as someone lays on the ground with their arms held﻿ tight, which allows a beating to be administered.' Another user wrote 'It looks like private security. They are NOT skilled in detaining and cuffing someone at all. It is a disturbing video though. Language and physical hits were not necessary.' Detective Mike Berbiar of the West Hollywood sheriff's station, told LA Weekly Blogs, the only person who was arrested at the scene was the man who was held down on the floor. The man, identified as Timothy Reyes, is alleged to have assaulted five people inside Fubar, which is further along the street, before he was taken out and taken to the ground. As Mr Berbiar understands it, a fight erupted over a jacket that the suspect thought was his, but apparently wasn't. Some of those assaulted were bar staff who attempted to break up the fight, he said. Mr Reyes was cited on suspicion of battery and public intoxication and released, the detective told the website. The detective informed them he was not aware of the video or the bouncer's actions, but said he 'would definitely be interested in looking into it.' The manager at Voyeur nightclub said to LA Weekly Blogs, that the bouncer was an employee of Fubar, which is down the block.","Video shot outside a West .

An unemployed man who tortured a pensioner to death for her bank card PIN was today jailed for the rest of his life. John Mason, 55, of Llandissilio, west Wales, beat Angelika Dries-Jenkins to death at her home in Narberth, Pembrokeshire, in a 'brutal and heartless' attack on June 1 last year. Mason then stole the quiet 66-year-old divorcee's car and took £1,000 from her savings account to fund his impending wedding. 'Brutal and heartless murder': John Mason tricked his way into the home of pensioner Angelika Dries-Jenkins before torturing her for her bank card number and bludgeoning her to death with a blunt object . A jury at Swansea Crown Court took less than two hours today to find him unanimously guilty at the end of a two-week trial. Mason, the son of the victim’s nextdoor neighbour, wore a hi-viz vest and posed as a council workman to trick his way into Mrs Dries-Jenkins's home. He then cruelly tortured the pensioner to force her to reveal her bank card number before grabbing her by the neck and bludgeoning her around her head with a blunt object. The spread of the blood in the dining room where the attack took place showed the ferocity of the attack dished out to Mrs Dries-Jenkins, the prosecution said. The court heard that on the day of Mrs Dries-Jenkins's murder and on following days Mason used her card to take money from her bank account. He was due to marry his girlfriend Denise Evans and had moved their wedding forward to June 10th - nine days after Mrs Dries-Jenkins's savage murder. Mason, who lived on £100 benefits a fortnight, boot himself a new pair of boots and had himself measured up for a wedding ring at Argos in preparation for the big day. But he was traced and arrested for murder within a week and the planned wedding never took place. Jailing Mason for life with a minimum tariff of 30 years today, Judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams described the attack on Mrs Dries-Jenkins as a 'brutal and heartless murder'. He said: 'You killed a kind and gentle woman in her own home, and you did it so you could steal her money. 'In the hours and days that followed, you spent her money and went about your business as if you had no care in the world. 'By any standards, this was a despicable crime. 'The consequences of your crime have been far-reaching. Mrs Dries-Jenkins is dead and her family has suffered, and will continue to suffer.' 'You must realise Mr Mason that there is a very real likelihood that you will spend the rest of your life in prison.' Scene of the crime: Police and forensics officers at the house where Mrs Dries-Jenkins was found murdered in Narberth, Pembrokeshire, west Wales . After the verdict today, the jury heard that Mason had a long history of violence and was effectively a career criminal. At the time of the murder he was already electronically tagged and under curfew for threatening to kill his fiancee. A drunken Mason had also threatened to 'cut the throat' of her 11-year-old grandson during a blazing row at her home in Narberth. Police were called to the scene in March last year to find Mason passed out and part of the house doused in petrol and a lighter nearby. He was dealt with by an order to carry out unpaid community work and received two separate cautions. But within months Mason had tricked his way into Mrs Dries-Jenkins's home to murder her. The peaceful, yoga-loving pensioner suffered a merciless attack at his hands which lasted at least five minutes. Prosecuting, Patrick Harrington QC said: 'Angelika Dries-Jenkins was tortured and murdered in her own home. 'Her killer was John Mason - his reason for killing her was for money. 'After conning his way into her house by wearing a fluorescent jacket posing as a workman, he tortured his victim so she would reveal her pin number. 'He then beat her savagely to death using a blunt item. 'Being the coward that he is, Mason attacked her in the most vulnerable part of her body - her head. 'An already bleeding victim Mrs Dries-Jenkins was then repeatedly struck and the spread of blood shows the ferocity of which she was hit. 'There is also evidence of injury to the throat where he grabbed her during this murderous attack.' Grim discovery: The daughter of Angelika Dries-Jenkins, Eleanor, right, who found her mother dead after paying her a surprise visit . The victim’s horrified daughter discovered her mother’s disfigured body two days later when she made a surprise visit. Mr Harrington said: 'Her daughter chose to pay her mother a surprise visit. 'She had just come back from her holiday in Italy and wanted to surprise her, two days before her birthday. 'But instead of this joyous occasion, Eleanor made the grim discovery of her mother’s body having been left bludgeoned to death by John Mason. 'She suffered extensive head injuries and there was blood everywhere in the dining room of her home.' Mason had insisted from the outset that he was innocent of murder and that overwhelming evidence pointing to him as the killer was 'just coincidence'. The jury rejected that version of events in less than two hours today. The verdict was immediately welcomed by Dyfed Powys Police. Detective Superintendent Pam Kelly said: 'Angelica Dries-Jenkins was tortured for the Pin number of her bank account, she was murdered, her car stolen and her bank account emptied, but that was not enough for John Mason. 'He has put Angelica’s family through a three-week murder trial, he has lied from start to finish and shown no remorse whatsoever. 'Today’s verdict is welcomed, it reflects the strength of Angelica’s family and is a credit to the members of the community who have come forward as witnesses. 'This has been achieved through the dedication of the prosecution team, in particular a small group of local detectives from Pembrokeshire who have shown great dedication and tenacity in bringing John Mason to justice.' Detective Sergeant Paul Callard said: 'This was a complex investigation, which included all facets of forensic and conventional policing techniques. Our small team worked diligently to bring Mason to justice and we are pleased with the verdict.' A keen gardener, Mrs Dries-Jenkins was born in Germany and settled in Pembrokeshire after marrying a local man thirty years ago. She had three children including a son Benedict, 32, and two daughters. Although divorced, Mrs Dries-Jenkins’ former husband Daniel Jenkins was in the public gallery to hear the details of how she died.","John Mason, 55, jailed for life for the murder of Angelika Dries-Jenkins .

Israeli troops shot dead a Palestinian protester in Gaza today as thousands in the Palestinian territories, Israel and neighbouring countries participated in an annual protest against the Jewish state's land policies. Security forces in riot gear deployed in high numbers along the frontiers of Israel and the Palestinian territories in anticipation of a repeat of last year's violence, in which at least 38 people died near the borders with Lebanon and Syria. But for the most part, protests were small and organisers kept demonstrators from actually marching on the borders.

Gaza health official Adham Abu Salmia said Israeli forces shot and killed Mahmoud Zaqout, 21, and critically wounded another man as they were approaching the Israel-Gaza border during a demonstration of a few thousand people organised by the territory's Hamas rulers. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots before shooting directly at Zaqout, in accordance with the army's rules of engagement. The military said it responded to protesters with tear gas in addition to gunfire. Abu Salmia said an additional 37 protesters throughout Gaza were lightly injured, while the Israeli military put the number at about 29. By midday, skirmishes had broken out between protesters and security forces in the Jerusalem area. Palestinians threw rocks and Israeli troops responded with tear gas, stun grenades and rubber pellets. Dozens of Palestinians were treated for light wounds in hospitals throughout the West Bank and Jerusalem, including four with serious head wounds from rubber pellets and one hit in the head by a tear gas canister, said Mohammed Ayyad, a spokesman for the Red Crescent medical service in Ramallah.

After thousands poured on to Britain's beaches last week to take advantage of the warm weather, today suncream and bikinis were replaced by scarves and gloves as temperatures plummeted across the country. As many might have predicted the arrival of the weekend triggered a dramatic change in the weather with snow even being seen in the Shetland Isles in the early part of the day. It was also a very different picture in the small Scottish village of Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire which recorded the highest March temperature ever in Scotland on Wednesday when it peaked at 22.9C. Today the mercury had fallen to a much chillier 8C in Aboyne and it is a similar story across the rest of the country today with daytime temperatures in most places of between 8C and 10C. Wintry scene: The Shetland Isles today experienced sleet in scenes reminiscent of this one when snow carpeted the islands in 2010. Remember this? Snow may return to some areas next week, bringing back memories of February, when snow fell across the country, including in St James's Park in London (pictured) More than 100 tons of tomatoes are being picked a month early this weekend - due to the recent spell of unusually warm weather. The unexpected crop will be supplied to supermarkets including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's and Waitrose from Britain's biggest grower, based on the Isle of Wight. Brian Moralee, growing manager of Wight Salads Group, said: 'We were thrilled with this early bust of warm, sunny weather. 'Here on the island we feel good weather more, which brings out the best in our tomatoes' taste and quality.' The Isle of Wight was first used for tomato production by the Romans because of its favourable climate. But the fruit is not usually picked until the end of April. Nowhere got close to the extraordinarily sunny heights of the previous five days with Pembrey Sands in Swansea recording the highest UK temperature of 13.3C.

"By . Fiona Macrae . UPDATED: . 17:32 EST, 27 November 2011 . Basic care: Patients are paying for private nurses as NHS staff are failing them . Private nurses are being hired to feed and wash elderly patients in NHS hospitals. The patients, or their relatives, are spending up to £200 a day to ensure they receive basic nursing care that health service staff fail to provide. This includes help to eat their meals, being washed, and being turned in bed to prevent painful sores. The drafting in of private nurses has been described as a ‘terrible indictment of the NHS’. And campaigners have pointed out that only a minority of patients will be able to afford such a service, meaning others on the same wards have no option but to put up with a sub-standard service. The revelation comes just a month after a damning report revealed that the care of the elderly in many hospitals is so bad that it is breaking the law. In one in five hospitals investigated by the Care Quality Commission, the care was so poor that patients were denied help with ‘the basics in life’ – eating, drinking and going to the lavatory. In another probe highlighted by the Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign, nearly half of hospitals visited by undercover inspectors were failing to meet basic nutrition standards. Elderly patients were routinely left without anything to drink for hours, with some so dehydrated they were put on drips. Now, some feel they have no option but to bring in their own nurse. One private nurse, who has helped feed, wash and turn a patient in an NHS hospital in London, said ward nurses can seem so busy that patients feel guilty about asking them for help. Desperation: Sheila Smith and her mother Annette Townend who paid £1,000 on private carers to look after her . Angela Hamlin, founder of Draycott Nursing and Care Agency in central London, and a former deputy matron, said relatives were paying for private help because they were afraid of meals being whisked away before they were eaten. Miss Hamlin, who has supplied around eight nurses to NHS patients in the past two years, said the private staff from her agency would typically already be helping the patient at home, then continue to assist them if they were admitted to hospital. She said the nurses on the wards seemed more interested in filling  in paperwork than comforting patients: ‘You don’t see nurses just being with someone, which is often what the patient wants, they have always got something else to do.’ Some hospitals have refused to allow patients to engage private nurses, while others have agreed as long as they do not give any medical care, such as injections. Extra support: One agency has seen about eight cases where patients have sought carers while they were in NHS hospitals . The Patients Association says it has been told of eight cases in the past six months alone, describing it as a new phenomenon fuelled by worries about poor nursing care. Katherine Murphy, the charity’s chief executive and a former nurse, said it was through carrying out basic tasks such as feeding and washing that nurses became aware of changes in a patient’s medical condition. She said: ‘If patients have to go to the extreme of taking their own carers into what is meant to be a caring environment, it shows a total lack of trust in the NHS. ‘It is a terrible indictment of the NHS if people even need to consider that they have to have someone there to provide the level of care which is their right.’ Joyce Robins of campaign group Patient Concern described the situation as ‘pretty horrendous’. She added: ‘It is the way people are going to be forced to go if they want to come out fed and watered.’ Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, called on ministers to ‘get a grip’ on ensuring adequate staffing and making the basics of nursing care a top priority for hospital staff. The Department of Health said: ‘We expect all hospitals to make sure that they are providing safe, high-quality nursing care because this must be at the heart of the NHS.’","Elderly patients paying up to to £200 a day for help with being fed and washed .

"By . Emma Reynolds . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 30 March 2012 . A Republican politician is to stand trial for the 1979 murder of his 23-year-old lover after cold case investigators found his DNA on her nightgown. Pennsylvania councillor Gregory Scott Hopkins, 66, is accused of killing Catherine Janet Walsh, of Monaca, by choking her to death in her bed. She was found by her father, bound and strangled with a bandana, on September 1, 1979, after he could not contact her over Labor Day weekend. Arrested: Gregory Hopkins (left) is accused of murdering Catherine Walsh (right) Hopkins later attended a preliminary hearing in Beaver County, after the case was revived in January when police found new DNA evidence in Miss Walsh's apartment. The DNA thought to link Hopkins to the crime was found on her nightgown, the white rope that bound her hands behind her back and the bed sheet that covered her body. The Bridgewater Borough councillor's defence lawyer James Ross said yesterday that Hopkins' DNA was bound to be in Miss Walsh's apartment because they were in a relationship. But he said there was no evidence he was there the morning she was killed. Mr Ross says his client is innocent and plans to 'fight (these charges) vigorously.' The criminal complaint, filed to District Attorney Anthony J Berosh, said Hopkins had admitted to being Miss Walsh's lover when interviewed seven hours after she was found. But Hopkins, one of three Republicans elected to the council in 2010, denied he had killed her and said it had been a month since they had been intimate in her home. Berosh did not discuss a possible motive for the murder. And he did not say whether Hopkins had made a statement after being arrested at his home. But he revealed Hopkins had carried out construction work on one his alleged victim's houses. Walsh's brother, Francesco Caltieri, 52 and living in Columbus, Ohio, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that the arrest was 'the start of closure'. He said: 'Thirty-two years is a long time. Certainly there were a lot of times we thought (an arrest) would never happen. The heartbreak still comes back.' The arrest has left the 850 residents of Bridgewater, which lies on the banks of the Beaver River, in shock. Tim Phillippi said: 'When I heard (about the arrest) on the news, it shocked me. I couldn't believe it. I always thought he was a real nice guy. I never in a million years would have thought this.' Rod Weaver, a neighbour, said Hopkins was 'always very friendly to me. I would see him in the backyard and he would say, ""Hi! How are you doing?"" We never had any problems.' And Tony Dorazio, co-owner of Precise Automotive, said Hopkins 'has always been a good neighbour in the 26 years I've been here. 'We borrow stuff off him, he plows (the parking lot) for us. I don't know that I've ever seen him angry. He always has a pretty cool head on his shoulders.' Miss Walsh was said to be a popular but quiet girl who graduated from Monaca High School in 1975. Sources said she married soon after high school, but then separated. In the process of divorce in 1979 she moved into a house on Indiana Avenue that her parents owned. She had no children, lived alone and was working for a Monaca refrigerator company.","Councillor Gregory Hopkins, 66, accused of strangling Catherine Walsh .

A conman created fake parking tickets using his home computer - and slapped them on 150 cars in just two hours. Christopher Povey, an unemployed father-of-three, targeted cars on roads in Sale and Timperley, Greater Manchester, and then photographed them. The tickets demanded motorists pay a £60 fine or £35 within 10 days and told them to send a cheque to a PO Box address. Four drivers fell for the scam and sent cheques, but police were alerted by suspicious residents. Povey, 41, was today found guilty of fraud. Trafford magistrates’ court heard how Povey designed and printed the yellow tickets on his home computer before placing them in black waterproof wallets. The court was told Povey set up a company called Highways Safety Monitoring Partnership in May 2011 and each notice had a crest with the name on the top. He put the tickets on the cars between 8.30pm and 10.30pm on Monday, September 12. Police were contacted and the cheques intercepted before he was arrested. It was discovered Povey had set up a bank account, a PO Box address for HSMP and ordered ‘joke fake parking tickets’ and plastic wallets from a website. Representing himself at Trafford magistrates’ court, Povey said he wanted to take action against motorists after a near-miss with a mother and pushchair because cars were obstructing the pavement. He said he was conducting a ‘dry run’ of a study and would have returned or destroyed any cheques he received. Povey put the realistic looking tickets on 150 cars in just two hours in Sale and Timperley and then photographed them . Povey claimed he wanted HSMP to work in partnership with the local authority. He told the court: 'I am financially stable, there is no reason I would want to commit any type of fraud.' The prosecution said only the council and police can issue parking notices in Trafford. District Judge Mark Hadfield found Povey guilty of four charges of fraud by false representation and he was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £775 costs and £10 compensation to a woman charged for cancelling a cheque. Judge Hadfield said: 'It seems to me your account has inherent weaknesses. You were doing what one would expect a traffic warden to do, affix parking tickets to vehicles and take photos of them obstructing the highway. 'You said you wanted to work with a local authority but made no effort to contact and work with them. You produced notices that gave the real impression they were official parking tickets. 'I accept your general concern for parking, but you acted in a dishonest way to obtain money from motor vehicle owners. 'There were no means by which you could return the cheques and that reinforces my view that you were acting in a dishonest manner.'","Tickets demanded £60 fine or £35 within 10 days .

The outlook for Greece darkened yesterday as it plunged deeper into recession and eurozone leaders cancelled a meeting to discuss a crucial bailout. New figures showed that economic output slumped by 7 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2011 – amid increasing fears that Greece will not deliver the £2.8billion cuts package it has pledged in return for another huge bailout. Experts had expected a fall of only 5 per cent ahead of the latest round of deeply unpopular austerity measures.

The prospect of Greece's economy rebounding took a further hit today as it emerged the country's GDP shrank by 7 per cent in the last quarter . Greece is now in its fifth year of . recession and faces even deeper spending cuts in exchange for bailout . funds from Europe and the Inter-national Monetary Fund. ‘We were expecting the recession to . get worse but not at this pace,’ said Nikos Magginas, senior economist . at National Bank of Greece. Fears that Greece is heading for a . chaotic default on its towering debts were fuelled after an emergency . meeting of eurozone finance ministers planned for tonight was cancelled. Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg . Prime Minister who chairs the so-called eurogroup, said he was still . waiting to receive assurances from Greek leaders over the £2.8billion . package of cuts to wages, jobs and pensions. Athens went up in flames on Sunday . night as Greek MPs voted for the savage austerity bill to satisfy their . international paymasters and secure a new £110billion bailout. Mr Juncker said ‘further technical . work’ was required between Greece and the troika of lenders – the .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:40 EST, 7 March 2012 . Hundreds of protesters braved heavy rain today to take their campaign for fuel duty cuts to Parliament. Pensioners, cabbies, van drivers and hauliers were among those taking to the streets to lobby Parliament ahead of this month's Budget. Organised by the FairFuelUK group, the protest included the delivery of a key report to 10 Downing Street. Members of the FairFuel protest are calling on Chancellor George Osborne to cut fuel duty in his Budget . Pain at the pump: Prices have risen 15 per cent in the last year . From the the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), the report said even a modest cut in fuel duty of 2.5p per litre would create 180,000 new jobs. FairFuelUK founder Peter Carroll said: 'It may have been wet today but we have been heartened by the fact that hundreds have joined our protest. 'We are hopeful that Chancellor George Osborne will see sense and cut fuel duty in his Budget.' MOT failures are costing hard-pressed UK motorists an estimated £1.57 billion according to a new report yesterday.For failed vehicles now need an average of £143 spent on them in repairs before they finally pass the Ministry of Transport Test -- almost double the £82 it cost on average 18 months ago.The data highlights the increasing number of cash-strapped drivers who are trying to save money by cutting back on regular service checks and not purchasing new cars. Almost a quarter of owners --23per cent -- confessed they just 'keep their fingers crossed' and hope that their car will pass, while nearly one in five --18per cent -- say they 'give a cursory glance around the car' before putting their vehicle in for the test.But the trusting to luck method does not seem to be working as over 40 per cent of vehicles failed the MOT in 2010, up from 37per cent in 2009 -- an additional 930,000 vehicles.Lights and signalling were the biggest cause of MOT failure in 2010 at 31per cent, followed by tyres at 20per cent, windscreen and visibility problems at 16per cent, brakes at 12per cent, steering at 3per cent and exhaust and fuel at 3per cent. Geoff Dunning, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said: 'The findings of this report prove, without shadow of a doubt, that there is an achievable solution to regaining at least some stability as regards fuel prices.' The protest today came after latest figures showed new record highs for petrol and diesel at the pumps, with petrol having reached 137.79p a litre and diesel 144.92p. Another report last week showed that UK drivers were paying the highest fuel taxes in Europe. At Commons question time, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls told George Osborne: 'A year ago you promised to get the economy growing and introduce a fair fuel stabiliser which would cut fuel duty when petrol prices were higher. 'One year on, you are now indicating you are going to press ahead with fuel duty increases, even though rising oil prices mean pump prices have today reached a record high. 'How can you press ahead when petrol prices are 4p higher than in last year's budget? 'What's happened to the stabiliser? Or isn't the truth you can't do the right thing on child benefit or tax credits or fuel because your plans have failed? 'A year ago you said in the budget you would 'put fuel into the tank of the British economy'. 'The fact is it's the economy which has tanked, on the hard shoulder, and this Chancellor is the one who has run out of fuel."" But Mr Osborne said: ""There's an inconvenient truth which is the fuel duty rises you are referring to are the ones put in place by Labour, that you voted for and anyone who was in the last parliament voted for. 'That is the unbelievable opportunism of the Labour Party today.' Turning on Mr Balls he said: 'One month it's VAT, another month it's child tax credits, now it's fuel.'

"By . Lydia Warren . UPDATED: . 11:57 EST, 18 March 2012 . The heroic mother who threw herself on her children to save them from a deadly tornado that ravaged their Indiana home has spoken out about the terrifying ordeal from her hospital bed. Stephanie Decker, 37, lost one leg above the knee and the other foot protecting her eight-year-old son and five-year-old daughter as the storm flattened their 'dream home' in Henryville, Indiana. Speaking out for the first time since her courageous show of love, Mrs Decker recounted the comforting words she said to her children as they screamed that they did not want to live without her. Heroine: Stephanie Decker threw herself on her two young children to save them from the tornado that flattened their home. She has recounted the fearful moments from her hospital bed . She also remembered how she was so uncertain that she was going to survive that she filmed a message on her mobile phone to her husband, telling him she loved him. 'I assumed I was safe and I heard the . roar like a train, and I heard it behind me, and I knew it was coming,' she told ABC News from her hospital bed in Louisville, Kentucky. 'And it was so loud that I knew that I needed to do . something different. I knew staying put wasn't going to work.' With the house disintegrating, she grabbed her son Dominic, eight, and daughter Reese, five, and ran to the basement, where she wrapped them in a blanket and climbed on top of them. 'I remember the whole thing,' she said. 'I stayed conscious the whole time. I couldn't afford [to pass out]. They needed me. They had to have me, so I had to figure out what to do.' She held on tightly to the children as the house fell down around her. Family: Mrs Decker lost one leg and the other foot saving her daughter Reese, left, and son Dominic, centre. Her husband Joe, pictured, had texted her to warn her about the tornado . 'Everything started hitting my back, beams, pillars, furniture - everything was slamming into my back,' she told The Today Show. 'But I had my children in the blanket and I was on top of them and I was reaching around holding them. 'They were screaming, ""Mommy, I can’t live without you! I don’t wanna die, please don’t let me die!"" and I said, ""you’re not going to die, we’re going to make it"".' Then she realised she had been badly hurt, with her leg appearing as if it had been severed. She also suffered seven broken ribs and a punctured lung. Fighting back the tears, she said: 'It was cut off or it was barely attached. I took my phone and I made a video to my husband to tell him I love him.' 'Dream home': The Deckers had spent nine months building their home in Henryville, Louisiana . Ruins: The home was reduced to a pile of rubble by the 175 mph storm that flattened much of the town . 'I knew it was bad. If I didn't get help soon, I was going to bleed out,' she added to ABC News. Knowing his mother was hurt, it was Dominic's turn for bravery. He crawled out from under his mother and ran to a neighbor's house. 'After Dominic left, I realised I couldn't get out because I actually used the comforter I tied with them as a tourniquet. I knew I was cut,' she said. One neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark . County Sheriff’s officer, used his belt to create a tighter tourniquet and . drove her until he could flag down an ambulance, which took her to . hospital. Mrs Decker added, tearfully: 'I want these kids to have a mum and I did not want them to grow up without me.' Her husband, Joe Decker, tearfully said that the flattened house had been their dream home. His . wife had said she always wanted to have the children's handprints . imprinted in the foundation's cement, because 'we were never gonna leave . here'. Fears: Mrs Decker was so worried she was going to die as a result of her injuries that she filmed a video on her mobile phone for her husband Joe, pictured, to tell him she loved him . Saved: Mrs Decker protected her two children, eight-year-old Dominic (L) and five-year-old Reese (R) Motherly: Mrs Decker, pictured with Dominic and her nephew, was saved when her son ran for help . The small prints, with the 'Reese' and 'D' for Dominic, remain scrawled in the concrete. Mr Decker said: 'What I told her was: ""You’re alive and . you get to see your kids grow up"".' The home, which was partly built by Mr . Decker and his wife's father, is now completely destroyed, with a . bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field, the Courier Journal reported. The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mr Decker added. Henryville . was nearly entirely flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the . South and Midwest on Friday March 3, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless. Scared: As the house fell around them, Reese (R) screamed that she could not live without her mother . Remaining strong: The children's hand prints can still be seen in the home's foundations . Physicians Ancillary Services, where Stephanie has worked for three years, released a statement, the Frankfort Journal reported. CEO Carl J. Tyler praised the Deckers . who 'lost everything' and said that the company has set up a trust fund, . The Stephanie Decker Recovery Fund, to help pay their medical bills and . the losses they suffered. He added: 'I can tell you they are . some of the hardest working, giving people you could ever want to meet. They would never ask for help, but would be there to give it to others . in a second.' Snow fell across parts of Indiana on Sunday night, adding insult to injury and stunting rescue efforts. Destruction: The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds . destroyed by tornadoes in Indiana.

He lives in a million-pound flat bought for him by his parents and works in the family business, while his brother-in-law happens to be second in line to the throne. But James Middleton, who's big sister is the Duchess of Cambridge, has insisted that his business success is down to his own efforts and that 'nothing is handed to anyone on a plate'. The 24-year-old, who is the younger brother of the Duchess of Cambridge, said hard-graft, not Royal connections, is the secret behind his achievements. Mr Middleton, who was educated at the £30,000-per-year Marlborough College, has launched four companies after dropping out of Edinburgh University just a year into his four-year course. They are all linked to his parents' successful Party Pieces company and are registered to the same Berkshire address. But he insisted he has not done well because of his parents wealth or his sister marrying Prince William. His first business was the Cake Kit Company - and after it began making a profit he launched three more companies which are Nice Cakes, Nice Wine and Nice Group London. Mr Middleton, who lives in a £1million Chelsea flat - bought by his parents - with his sister Pippa, commutes daily to Bucklebury, Berkshire, along the M4 in his Range Rover to where the family business is based. He said: 'I've won awards for my own efforts because I am young and good in my . own right. 'It's not just because of my family that I've been getting . attention. I want to be known for my own contribution, not for being a ""relative of"" - that's boring,'  he told the Sunday Times News Review. The Middleton family have been accused of cashing in on their royal connections - and were plugging a range of street party products on their website before Kate's wedding. Royal connections: James' older sister Kate with the Queen last week at a fashion show at De Montfort University during a visit to Leicester . Now they are selling a range of party kits for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. James Middleton is dyslexic and as a result had to memorise the reading he gave at his sister's wedding a year ago. Despite his family's business success - and the £500,000 that the Middletons spent on school fees for their three children - James said there is no reason why others cannot launch their own comapnies like him. He added: 'Nothing is handed to anyone on a plate. There are possibilities for . everyone; there's no one who can't do something. You can start up a . business on next to nothing.' A week ago he took part in a cross country ski event in Sweden with his sister Pippa. Royal connections: Michael and Carole Middleton have been accused of cashing in on their royal connections - and their website is currently promoting jubilee celebration products . Mr Middleton says he has turned down thousands of interview requests since Kate's wedding to Prince William last April. But breaking his silence, James admitted he was 'lucky' to be able to turn to his parents Michael and Carole for advice as he started up his own enterprises. He spends three-hours commuting each day and has revealed in previous interviews how he often works for 14 hours a day. His Cake Kit Company was formed after he spent months experimenting with ingredients for home-made cake sets. Royal: Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge who married last year . He said cakes were the 'focal point' of any celebration - even during a recession. The business idea formed as he flew back from Edinburgh University in 2007. He quit his four-year environmental resources management course after just a year. The kits have various themes for childrens' birthdays - including football, rockets, fairies and handbags. All the kits contain the ingredients, candles and a throwaway baking tray. James has written on his website: 'I believe baking may be the most alluring kitchen activity for children. 'I have great childhood memories of my mother baking and I was always a willing participant, especially if it meant I could re-varnish the kitchen floor with treacle!'","James Middleton, 24, lives in £1m flat in Chelsea, London with his sister Pippa .

Our solar system may well have a twin - because it's thought a nearby solar system has nine planets. That's just one more than ours, which has eight, following the demotion of Pluto to dwarf-planet status in 2006. In a new report to be published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, astronomer Mikko Tuomi  re-analysed data taken of star HD 10180 with High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), a high-precision camera mounted on a 3.6 meter telescope in Chile . Record beater: This animation shows an artist's impression of the remarkable planetary system around the Sun-like star HD 10180 . The star has been studied for years because at 130 light years away it is relatively close and therefore brighter and easier for astronomers to examine. Recent studies detected that the star, which is in the constellation of the water snake Hydrus, hosted six planets and observed a possible seventh planet. However, the latest research confirmed the existence of the seventh planet and found a further two planets orbiting the star. Extraordinary: New findings show that the sun-like star could have nine planets orbiting around it . The planets vary drastically in size and include one which is 65 times the Earth’s mass and one estimated to be only 1.4 times heavier than Earth - making it one of the smallest planets discovered outside our own solar system. The two newly discovered planets weigh in at 1.9 times and 5.1 times heavier than Earth, 'enabling the classification of them as super-Earths,' says the study. The new planets follow hot orbits, circling their star in under 10 days for the small one, and 68 days for the larger. Artist's impression: The oft-examined star is 130 light years away and in the constellation of Hydrus, the water snake . Competition: If the findings are proved HD10180's solar system will have more planets than ours since Pluto has been demoted to a dwarf planet . One of the new planets to be discovered and the seventh planet which was confirmed are particularly close to the sun-like star. The one with a mass of 1.3 times more than Earth is only 3 million km away from HD 10180, closer than mercury is to the sun, making its surface hot enough to melt zinc, tin and possibly even iron. The study explained that the star was a ‘very quiet one’ making it unlikely that the activity of the two new planets that they detected was caused by stellar phenomena. ‘Also, the periodicities we report, namely 9.66 and 67.6 days, do not coincide with any periodicities arising from the movement of the bodies in the Solar system. Therefore, we consider the interpretation of these two new signals of being of planetary origin to be the most credible explanation,' the study continued. Other solar systems generally have four or less planets orbiting a star. Watch video here .",HD 10180 lies just 130 light years away in the constellation of Hydrus .
