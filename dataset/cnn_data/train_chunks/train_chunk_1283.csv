"David Cameron is set to announce proposals to penalise jobless families for having more than three children . Jobless families could be penalised for having more than three children under Tory plans for a welfare revolution. They could also be kicked off  the dole after two years in proposals to be outlined today by the Prime Minister. David Cameron will claim that there is a ‘welfare gap’ in Britain, where those on the dole have a financial incentive to breed while those in work are forced to stop having children because they simply cannot afford to. He will float the idea that workshy  couples could be penalised by having their income support slashed and additional child benefit stopped if they have more than three children. He will also suggest that Britain adopts America’s tough benefits rules which see the unemployed forced to work and even automatically stripped of payments after two years out of work. Stressing the virtues of ‘self reliance’, Mr Cameron will say: ‘Quite simply, we have been encouraging working-age people to have children and not work, when we should be enabling working-age  people to work and have children. So it’s time we asked some serious questions about the signals we send out through the benefits system. ‘Yes, this is difficult territory. But at a time when so many people are struggling, isn’t it right that we ask whether those in the welfare system are faced with the same kinds of decisions that working people have to wrestle with when they have a child?’ But Mr Cameron will reject growing calls to raid universal pensioner benefits, such as free bus passes and TV licences and the winter fuel allowance, which remain popular with the middle class. Other measures being considered include forcing the unemployed to work for free in exchange for benefits and removing Housing Benefit from under-25s, as the Prime Minister revealed in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. The maximum amount of Housing Benefit a family can claim could also be slashed from the current limit of £25,000 a year. Downing Street sources say the Prime Minister will seek to advance this agenda through the Coalition, but the reality is that he will meet fierce resistance from the Lib Dems. Instead, the measures are likely to form the centrepiece of a Tory manifesto at the 2015 election. Scroll down for video . Mr Cameron will say: ‘If you are a single parent living outside London, if you have four children and you’re renting a house on Housing Benefit, then you can claim almost £25,000 a year. That is more than the average take-home pay of a farm worker and nursery nurse put together. ‘We have created a welfare gap in this country – between those living long-term in the welfare system and those outside it. This has sent out some incredibly damaging signals. That it pays not to work. That you are owed something for nothing. It created a culture of entitlement.’ In 2010, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt provoked a row when he suggested that the workshy should stop having children if they cannot afford them, saying the number of children is a ‘choice’. Today Mr Cameron will point out that there are more than 150,000 people who have been claiming Income Support for over a year who have three or more children and 57,000 who have four or more. It remains unclear, however, exactly what ministers would do to ensure a child did not suffer if he or she was the fourth or fifth born. One idea is to improve school meals and early years education to the point where the less well-off benefit hugely. Mr Cameron will also cite the experience in America, where people are forced to work for benefits and do not get them indefinitely. A No 10 source said such ‘time-limiting’ could potentially apply to many benefits. ‘David will say we should look at time limiting benefits. In America they say, “Sorry, you have it for two years and then you’re on your own”.’ In Wisconsin, when benefits claimants were told they would get no handouts after two years on the dole, the number of claims dropped by 57 per cent. When that state introduced ‘workfare’ schemes to ensure claimants did something useful for their benefits, claims dropped by 80 per cent. Mr Cameron’s decision to float such controversial ideas is likely to lead to claims that he has abandoned the ‘compassionate Conservative’ mantra with which he won power. But he is keen to create clear blue water between the Tories and the Lib Dems as the Coalition enters the second half of the Parliament. The Lib Dems said they would not support the plans but were content with Mr Cameron floating Tory ideas. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said this morning the housing benefit payment system for under-25s would probably be restricted rather than eradicated altogether. 'The details of these, of course, we have to be careful about. We have to be sensitive to the different reasons people have housing - people coming out of care, being in difficulties in foster care,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added: 'He's (David Cameron) looking, quite rightly, at the balance between those families that work and try and do the right things against those families that aren't necessarily working and have understood how to work the system. 'We want to understand to what degree families realise they can get their children into social housing by getting them out of home.' On the question of the number of children in jobless families he said: 'I think it’s a genuine and reasonable question, and most people out there will want to ask it: It is this issue of fairness – taxpayers are working hard and thinking carefully about how many children they can have, and others who are not in work, do they do the same thing?' Liam Byrne MP, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, said: ‘This is a hazy and half-baked plan when we need a serious back-to-work programme for young families.’ David Cameron has backed Michael Gove’s plans to scrap GCSEs and return to rigorous O-level exams at 16. The Prime Minister said he is ‘right behind’ the Education Secretary, despite abuse from the Lib Dems. Senior Government sources say the Lib Dems hope to strike a deal with Mr Gove that would see him axe the second part of his plan – a CSE-style exam for the 25 per cent of least able pupils. Full support: Cameron has thrown his weight behind Education Secretary Michael Gove . He may be prepared to abandon the two-tier system in favour of pupils of different abilities sitting different papers of the same exam, in order to achieve the rest of his proposals. But Mr Cameron delivered a rebuke to those, such as Nick Clegg, who say Mr Gove wants to return education to the 1950s, insisting the Government would not put up with sub-standard schools. He said: ‘We just aren’t prepared to put up with second-rate standards in state schools.‘Michael has the courage to deliver it and I back him all the way.’ The Department for Education is also plotting to axe the national curriculum and have just one nationwide exam board in each subject, to stop companies touting for business on the basis of who has the easiest exam. A YouGov poll found 50 per cent of voters back a return to O-levels, with just 32 per cent opposed. Some 75 per cent back a single nationwide exam. But Mr Clegg says plans to earmark pupils for a simpler or more vocational exam  at 14 will be divisive and hold some back. Mr Gove’s aides were yesterday adamant he would not be compromising. ‘We are full steam ahead,’ one said.","Families could be removed from the dole after two years .

"A glittering list of football stars, including arguably the greatest player of all time, Diego Maradona, met Pope Francis today ahead of an inter-religious charity match. Ahead of the game this evening, Pope Francis was presented with an Argentina shirt by the man known to many for his 'Hand of God' in the 1986 World Cup quarter final defeat of England. At the time of fellow Argentinian Pope Francis' election in March, Maradona remarked: 'Everybody in Argentina can remember ""the hand of God"" in the England match in the 1986 World Cup. Now, in my country, the ""hand of God"" has brought us an Argentinian pope.' Scroll down for video .

"A woman who shot dead her ex-husband after he allegedly subjected her to a brutal rape and physical abuse has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Tracey Grissom, 32, sobbed as she was taken from the Tuscaloosa County Courthouse in Alabama in handcuffs after being sentenced on Tuesday. Grissom murdered her ex Hunter Grissom, 28, on May 15, 2012 and was found guilty by a jury last month. The couple have a five-year-old daughter, according to court records. Tracey Grissom sobbed as she left the Alabama court in handcuffs on Tuesday (pictured) to begin her 25-year sentence for the murder of her ex-husband Hunter Grissom, whom she shot dead in 2012 . The 32-year-old told the court on Tuesday at her sentencing that she had been left with a colostomy bag following the alleged brutal rape by her ex-husband . Tracey Grissom, 32, was sentenced to 25 years on Tuesday for the murder of her ex-husband whom she claimed raped and abused her . At her sentencing on Tuesday, one female jury member, Janice Kelley, asked the judge to be lenient, according to al.com. Ms Kelley said she believed Grissom did not get a fair trial as details of her alleged rape and sodomy were not given to jurors. When court restrictions were lifted on Tuesday at the sentencing, tuscaloosanews.com reported that Grissom told the court she had suffered permanent rectal and vaginal damage after allegedly being raped by her husband. She pulled up her shirt in court to show that she was wearing a colostomy bag and said that she had undergone several surgeries. She told the court on Tuesday that her husband told her during the 2010 attack that 'he would make it to where nobody would ever want me'. She did not report the rape because he had threatened her life, the news site reported. Following the sentencing on Tuesday, the victim's family shared their thoughts on Facebook page, Justice for Hunter Grissom. Along with tributes to the deceased 28-year-old, several friends and family members claimed that Tracey Grissom was not raped and that a 'broken justice system' had failed Hunter and cost him his life. Tracey Grissom's defense lawyer had claimed during trial that she acted in self-defense while suffering from post-traumatic stress caused by her husband's sexual assaults,al.com reported. Prosecutors said the killing had been motivated by the woman wanting to cash in Hunter Grissom's $100,000 life insurance policy. Tracey Grissom (pictured in her police mugshot) shot her husband Hunter (right) six times in the back in 2012. Her defense said that she was suffering from PTSD after his alleged sexual assaults while prosecutors convinced the jury that she had been out for her husband's $100,000 life insurance policy . She shot him in the back six times after ambushing him at work, the prosecution said. According to a 2012 arrest warrant, Grissom was driving to work when she saw her ex-husband at a boat landing. She claimed she had gone there to take a photo of him for litigation related to their divorce to prove he was working after he stopped support payments. Several witnesses watched as the man made an obscene gesture and the woman opened fire, a sherifff said at the time. Grissom called 911 after using all her ammunition and told them she shot her ex-husband. Hunter Grissom was previously charged with first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, unlawful imprisonment and other drug-related charges. At the time of his death, the local district attorney was pursuing charges but Mr Grissom was never found guilty, according to WIAT.com. Tracey Grissom was the alleged victim in the rape and sodomy charges, according to Tuscaloosa County District Attorney Tommy Smith in 2012. According to WSFA.com, Tracey Grissom told police she was raped and sodomized by Hunter Grissom in November 2010. She reported that he bound her legs with his belt, dragged her from their closet into their master bedroom and sexually assaulted her. Tracey told police she was then knocked unconscious on the floor of their bathroom and didn't wake up until the next morning. She went to the hospital for treatment following the alleged attack, and paperwork shows she had a gash on her head, bruises, bind marks on her feet and writing on her arm. Grissom's attorney said outside court on Tuesday that he would be seeking a new trial for his client. The 32-year-old will be eligible for parole.","Tracey Grissom, 32, of Alabama, found guilty of murder last month .

"Angel di Maria made his Manchester United debut at Premier League opponents Burnley on Saturday following his £60million transfer from Real Madrid - and we watched his every move.

The understanding with his team-mates is not necessarily quite there yet but he has shown enough already to illustrate how dangerous he can be.

"Hundreds of armed vigilantes stormed a Mexican town and arrested federal police in the latest bloody battle between residents, criminal gangs, and the police locals say are in league with the gang members. Around 600 members of local 'autodefensas', or self-defence groups, stormed Paracuaro in the troubled Michoacan state yesterday in an attempt to seize control of the town back from the feared Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar) drug cartel. The battle was the latest in a long-running war between the drugs gang in Mexico's south-west and local residents who say state and federal police are not protecting them. Scroll down for video .

Police officers are forced to surrender their weapons to armed vigilantes in Paracuaro after the group seized control . Members of Guerrero state's Public Safety System marched in honour of their first anniversary - their region is a centre for drugs production . Small groups of local vigilantes took up arms and joined forces to storm Paracuaro, headquarters of the Knights Templar gang, where they arrested police officers and seized control of the town in a blaze of gunfire. They drove into the town in black armoured vehicles shouting 'Don't be frightened, we are vigilantes', before expelling drugs traffickers, whom they accuse of kidnapping people and bribing them to make money.  Several gun battles were reported, leaving at least one dead. Police officers, whom the vigilantes accuse of being in league with the cash-rich drug gangs, were rounded up by machine-gun toting locals, along with others suspected of associating with gang members, and a checkpoint was set up at the entrance to Paracuaro. On the highway leading to Paracuaro, traffic was stopped after a bus was set ablaze, allegedly by gang members. Michoacan has been rocked by repeated explosions of civil unrest since February last year, as vigilante groups have sprung up in communities where people say they are not being protected from drugs trafficking gangs. Over in the neighbouring state of Guerrero, which produces half of Mexico's heroin and is riddled with drugs gangs, members of the Public Safety System, or the Guerrero community police, marched yesterday to commemorate the first anniversary of their foundation in Ayutla de los Libres.

"The UK is turning into a nation of 'Peter Pans' who never want to grow up, according to a new survey. Many are turning their backs on 'adulthood milestones' like marriage and starting a family, with more than a quarter admitting they lack the basic skills to live on their own. Research released by life insurance expert Confused.com showed 32 per cent of Britons aged 25-39 are still living at home with their parents. The generation who don't want to grow up: Many adults are delaying marriage and starting a family to stay at home where they are looked after by their parents . Nearly two thirds - 63 per cent - turn their backs on marriage with nearly the same proportion - 60 per cent - delaying starting a family. Nearly one in four - 24 - per cent - who are still living at home said the main reason is because they get meals cooked for them and nearly one in 10 say it is because someone else cleans up after them. The figures, based on people in the UK between the age of 18 and 39, found most of these stay-at-home sons and daughters are not ready to move out - or move on - with over a quarter - 27 per cent - of adults admitting they lack the basic skills to live on their own. One in three do not even do their own washing and men are the worst offenders with nearly half below 40 leaving their washing to their partners, parents or housemates. Women are slightly better, but more than a fifth - 21 per cent - still rely on others to clean up after them. And a third of Brits between the ages of 18 and 39 change their bed sheets once a month or less, while 34 per cent rarely or never cook for themselves. Lazy: One in three do not do their own washing and change their bed once a month or less . The research, conducted by OnePoll for Confused.com in August, surveyed 2,000 respondents between 18 and 39. It also found almost half of Britain's 'Peter Pan generation' is in debt of more than £9,000 (excluding mortgages). Almost a fifth of 18-39-year-olds also adopt a carefree attitude to their finances, regularly spending between £50-£150 each week - £5,000 a year - on keeping themselves entertained. A further 25 per cent admitted they were too busy living for today to think about the money they will need to pay back tomorrow. The research found Britons throw caution to the wind when it comes to providing cover for the future with two thirds yet to purchase life insurance and more than half of 25-32-year-olds haven't started a pension plan either. Matt Lloyd, head of life insurance at Confused.com, said: 'There's absolutely nothing wrong with being young at heart, but living for today doesn't mean you have to totally ignore tomorrow. 'What we recommend to people in their 20s is to start thinking now to see what they could be doing to make proper provisions for the future. 'Starting a savings account, a pension plan and putting in place life insurance are just some of the basics that can make a big difference to people's financial security and they're really not as complicated as people think. 'When you take out your life insurance policy you are locked into that price throughout the term, so it's beneficial to take out a policy when you are younger as it could save you thousands of pounds in the long term.'

"A mother who home-schools her ten children in Montgomery, Alabama, has opened up about how six of them began their college degrees by the age of 12. Those of the Harding siblings who have already graduated from college have gone on to become a doctor, an architect, a spacecraft designer and a master's student. Another two - 12 and 14-years-old - are still finishing up their degrees. But despite the Hardings' incredible achievements at such young ages, their parents - Mona Lisa and Kip - insist they are a family of 'average folks' who simply find and cultivate their children's passions early on. Smart family: Six of the ten Harding siblings started college by the age of 12, thanks to their parents' home-schooling, which lets them focus on their passions. The remaining four children are ten and under . Hannah was the first to take her college entrance exams - at the young age of 12. 'I didn't expect to pass,' the 24-yead-old told Today.com. 'So I started crying, because I was thinking, ""Now what?""' She passed the exam and, at just 17, became Auburn University Montgomery's youngest ever graduate, obtaining a BS in mathematics. Hannah went on to get master's degrees in math and mechanical engineering, and she was designing spacecraft by the age of 22. The other Harding siblings, spurred . on by their parents' encouragement and their older sister's success, . were quick to follow suit. Seth, 12, is the latest to begin at college. At seven, he announced that he wanted to be a . military archaeologist. He is now a freshman at Faulkner University, where he studies the Middle Ages. Eldest: Hannah, now 24, was the first Harding sibling to apply to college at the age of 12. She went on to get master's degrees in math and mechanical engineering, and was designing spacecrafts by 22 . Breaking records: Heath, now 16, was the youngest student ever to graduate from Huntingdon College at 15. He's now studying for his master's in computer science, which he will complete before his 17th birthday . Just down the hall is Seth's 14-year-old brother Keith, a college senior with a passion for music who is studying finite mathematics. His ambitious younger sister Katrinnah, ten, plans on taking her college exams next year. Still, despite the exceptional talents . of her brood, Mona Lisa - who studied to become a nurse before staying . at home to educate her kids - said: 'I don't have any brilliant . children. I'm not brilliant.' 'I don't have any brilliant children. I'm not brilliant. We're just average folks' The mother-of-ten also explained that her husband, who flew helicopters in the army and didn't graduate college until 25, is not brilliant either. 'We're just average . folks,' she insists. People who know them, however, would beg to differ. Seth's assistant professor Grover Plunkett, for instance, said of the 12-year-old, who lives at home rather than in a dorm: 'He's got the highest average in the . class.' Accelerated learning: Seth, 12, is a freshman at Faulkner University where he studies the Middle Ages. 'He has the highest average in his class,' said his assistant professor . Following their passions: Rosannah (left), now 20, became a fully fledged architect at 18. Her older sister Serennah, 22, (right) is training to be one of the youngest physicians in American history . But the Harding children insist they are not geniuses. Instead, they credit their . achievements to home-schooling, as well as a concentrated focus on their . passions, which their parents taught them to hone in on from an early age. 'By the time you get down to number five, number six, they just think learning seems normal,' Mona Lisa said of her children. 'They're taking college classes, but socially, they are just teenagers' 'We find out what their passions are, what they really like to study, and we accelerate them gradually.' For Serenneh, that passion was medicine. The 22-year-old is currently on her way to becoming a Navy doctor - which will make her one of the youngest physicians in American history. Younger sister Rosannah, now 20, became a fully-fledged architect at the age of 18. And Heath, who graduated . from Huntingdon College at 15, will have completed his master's in . computer science just after his 17th birthday. Support system: Ten-year-old Katrinnah (right), who gets some study help from older sister Hannah (left), plans on taking her college entrance exams next year . Up and coming: The younger Harding kids - ten, seven, five, and three-years old - are also being home-schooled by their parents . 'It makes you wonder,' Wesley Jimmerson, Seth's college friend, mused. 'Are they advanced, or are we just really behind?' In . fact, Mona Lisa and Kip are convinced that all children have the . capacity to learn at the rate theirs have. The couple have written a . book to illustrate their teaching method and launched a website detailing their unique approach. The book, called College By 12, is said to feature 'lots of tips of how you can simplify your homeschooling', as well as 'testimonies of how God has worked in our lives'. College may sound like too much pressure for the pre-teens to handle, but the Harding parents insist their kids are thriving, not suffering. 'All our children would have to tells us . is, ""You know, this isn't fun any more,""' says Mona Lisa says. 'And . we'd do something about that.' Understanding: Their mother Mona Lisa insists her children don't feel too much pressure to succeed. 'All [they] would have to tells us is, ""You know, this isn't fun any more,"" and we'd do something about that,' she said . Work and play: Their father says they still have time to be normal kids. 'The expectation is that you're going to have a fun day,' he said of his children. 'Not that you're going to come home with A's' Kip agrees with his wife: 'The expectation is that you're . going to have a fun day,' he said as he watched his children play in the backyard. 'Not . that you're going to come home with A's.' Indeed, the couple insists that despite their accelerated eduction, the children have led normal lives. 'We didn't limit their experience,' said Mona Lisa. 'They're taking college classes, but socially, they are just teenagers.' Their remaining children are seven-year-old Mariannah, Lorennah, five, and Thunder James, three, all of whom are being home-schooled, too.","Mona Lisa and Kip Harding from Montgomery, Alabama, home-school all ten of their kids - six of whom started college by the age of 12 .

"Up to 60,000 patients die on the Liverpool Care Pathway each year without giving their consent, shocking figures revealed yesterday. A third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw lifesaving treatment from loved ones. Despite the revelations, Jeremy Hunt last night claimed the pathway was a ‘fantastic step forward’. Outcry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt provoked outrage by saying the death pathway was a 'fantastic step forward' In comments that appeared to prejudge an official inquiry into the LCP, the Health Secretary said ‘one or two’ mistakes should not be allowed to discredit the entire end-of-life system. But Elspeth Chowdharay-Best of Alert, an anti-euthanasia group, said: ‘The Pathway is designed to finish people off double quick. It is a lethal pathway. ‘Mr Hunt has made a nonsense of the claim of his ministers that there is going to be an independent inquiry.’ The review follows a public outcry over a string of disturbing cases, highlighted by this paper, in which patients or their families were ignored. The pathway involves withdrawal of . lifesaving treatment, with the sick sedated and usually denied nutrition . and fluids. Death typically takes place within 29 hours. The . 60,000 figure comes from a joint study by the Marie Curie Palliative . Care Institute in Liverpool and the Royal College of Physicians. Finished off: Those placed on the death pathway typically die within 29 hours of vital treatment being withdrawn. (Posed by model) It found many patients were not consulted despite being conscious when doctors decided on their care. Records . from 178 hospitals also show that thousands of people on the pathway . are left to die in pain because nurses do not do enough to keep them . comfortable while drugs are administered. An estimated 130,000 patients are put on the pathway each year. Concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway. Health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £30million for putting more patients on the LCP. Critics say it is a self-fulfilling prophecy because there is no scientific method of predicting when death will come. Norman . Lamb, the care services minister, launched a review in November, saying . there had been too many cases of families not being consulted. But Mr Hunt yesterday suggested that concerns about the system were relatively minor compared with its benefits. Fatal: The pathway involves withdrawal of lifesaving treatment, with the sick sedated and usually denied nutrition and fluids. (Posed by model) Warning: The elderly are ending up in care too easily people should be more 'neighbourly' so they can stay in their own homes, Mr Lamb said . ‘It’s a fantastic step forward, the Liverpool Care Pathway, and we need to be unabashed about that because it’s basically designed to bring hospice-style care to terminally-ill people in hospitals,’ he told LBC Radio: . ‘I would be very sad if as a result of something that is a big step forward going wrong in one or two cases we discredited the concept that we need to do a lot better to give people dignity in their final hours because it’s something we haven’t done well. ‘Lots of people don’t want to die with lots of tubes going in and out of their body – they actually want to die in a dignified way.’ He added: ‘What should never happen is that people should be put on to that care pathway without patients being fully in the loop and their families and relatives being fully in the loop as well.’ Controversial: Jeremy Hunt said the death pathway gave the ill 'dignity' in their final hours . The national audit by Marie Curie and the RCP examined a representative sample of 7,058 deaths between April and June last year. The figures were scaled up to give a national picture. It found that in 44 per cent of cases when conscious patients were placed on the pathway, there was no record that the decision had been discussed with them. For 22 per cent, there was no evidence that comfort and safety had been maintained while medication was administered. And it also revealed that one in three families did not receive a leaflet to explain the process. The LCP system was developed in a Liverpool hospital and has spread across the NHS over the past four years. The review is due to report in the new year.","Pathway involves the sick being sedated and usually denied nutrition .

"Proud of her record-breaking afro, Aevin Dugas says her hair is inspiring legions of women to ditch chemical straighteners and 'go natural'. The 37-year-old, whose hair entered the Guinness Book of Records at 4ft 4ins around, says everyone from toddlers to grandmothers are following in her footsteps. Aevin said: 'At one time I strived to get hair that was bone straight and now all I want is it big and poofy'. Scroll down for video . Aevin Dugas boasts the world's biggest afro - measuring an incredible four-and-a-half foot around the middle . Aevin struggles to see out from underneath her extravagant hairdo if she does not style it up properly . 14 years in the making, Aevin says that she loves her bouncy hair . She believes her voluminous hair may . have grown even bigger, but she cannot reveal its size until Guinness . take an official measurement. 'When my hair is stretched out to its complete length and pressed, it . goes down to my butt. But I don't wear it like that because it looks . weird.' The newly single care worker is proud of her unique style but usually . ties her hair back when going on first dates, only revealing her secret . later. 'I did tell one guy and he was shocked and he Googled me and was like 'oh, wow'. 'But then when I saw him again - he was wearing an afro too.' Despite loving her hair, she has to tie it back while driving as it is so difficult to see past it . On first dates, Aevin likes to restrain her afro as she says it can be 'overwhelming' for new people . Aevin, who has won fans from Brazil to Italy, has spent the last 14 years growing her hair. Her jaw-dropping look brings her attention wherever she goes but it does . have its drawbacks as she often gets it caught in trees, car doors and . people's earrings.

To get her hair ready for a night out she shampoos it and then uses up to five conditioners. She then puts her hair into two French braids and from then it takes about two days to dry. But the positives far outweigh the negatives and she has become a hero in her hometown of Napoleonville, Louisiana. Her biggest joy is inspiring young girls to stop using chemical straighteners, which can cause long-lasting damage to hair. Hair washing has turned into a long-drawn out affair as it takes her two days to wash and dry it all in sections . However, Aevin is thrilled with the results and is keen to encourage other Africa-Americans to let their hair grow naturally . She said: 'I don't know why but there's something very important to me . about little girls appreciating my hair and then wanting to wear their . hair the same. 'I tell them there is nothing that I did special, there is no magical formula, we are born with our hair like this.' Aevin was originally inspired by a picture of her mum Deborah Dugas . wearing an afro in the sixties - and she remains one of her biggest fans . today. Mrs Dugas, 62, who runs a care home, said: 'I'm humbled by the fact she . did this because she liked my natural hair, way before she was born. Aevin getting her hair tended to at a salon in Reserve, Louisiana. Her mother says that she is particularly proud of her daughter for wearing her afro before it became fashionable . 'It was about half the size of Aevin's and everybody loved it.' She added: 'Her hair has definitely had an impact on the community. 'She made her decision when wearing your hair natural was considered unattractive in the black community. 'But, against all that, she started wearing her hair natural years ago. I am really proud.'","Aevin Dugas has spent the last 14 years growing her hair .

"A long-range 'Iran-busting' drone crashed near an Israeli air base during a test flight. A wing from the remote controlled Heron TP, which is nearly as wide as a Boeing 737, broke off after the aircraft 'performed a manoeuvre beyond its capabilities' on Sunday. The accident took place during secret tests to prepare the drone, which can be used for spying and bombing missions, for a military strike against Iran, it has been claimed. The Israeli Air Force has now launched an investigation into the smash of the $30million craft which can stay in the air for 40 hours and fly for 4,600 miles. Aircraft down: The Heron TP, Israel's most advanced unmanned aerial vehicle, crashed on Sunday when its wing broke off during a test flight . Bombing capabilities: The unmanned aircraft, which has a massive wingspan nearly that of a Boeing 737, can stay aloft for 40 hours . General Ido Nehushtan, commander of the Israeli air force, said new technology on the drone was being tested when the aircraft crashed into an orchard near the Tel Nof air base outside Rehovot. A preliminary investigation indicated that human error and a technical malfunction contributed to the accident. According to military sources, a wing that fell off the drone had been fitted with a highly advanced navigational device that might have interfered with the aircraft’s other flight systems. As the Israeli military’s most advanced . drone, it has a wingspan of 85ft, nearly that of a Boeing 737, and a . payload capacity of 2,000 kilos. It was developed by Israel Aerospace . Industries. Investigation: Authorities examine the crash site, near an orchard close to an Israeli air base . Investigation: According to initial findings, the crash occurred after the UAV performed a manoeuvre beyond its capabilities, causing one of its wings to break off . Known as the Eitan in Israel, the drone has platforms for surveillance equipment and for firing rockets. It can be used in a variety of . missions, such as aerial refuelling, jamming communications and relaying . ground control in Israel to manned aircraft over a distant target. Crew: None . Capacity: 2,000kg payload . Length: 46ft . Wingspan: 26m . Range: 4,600 miles . Endurance: 36 hours . Service ceiling: 40,000ft . Israeli officials reportedly have been . considering a military strike on Iran to prevent the Islamic republic . from making an atomic weapon. The Eitan, which soars as high as . 40,000 feet, would likely play a key role in an attack. The distance between Iran and Israel is about 1,000 miles. A security source in Jerusalem told the Mirror: 'The crash is of course a blow to the Israeli Air Force, which would obviously play a leading role in any military action against Iran – should current sanctions against Iran be unsuccessful in ­stopping its attempts to develop a nuclear weapon. 'The Heron is widely known as a drone that can easily reach Iran, hopefully remain unseen while performing an operation and then return to Israel to refuel.' According to press accounts, the drone was used in a 2009 airstrike in Sudan against a Gaza-bound convoy carrying Iranian arms destined for the Hamas militant group. The drone also is used reconnaissance missions over Lebanon and along the Egyptian border and to protect against sabotage of Israel’s offshore natural gas installations. General Nehushtan said 25 percent of the air force’s mission are carried out by drones. A squadron of Eitans was inaugurated in December 2010 and is scheduled to become operational in coming weeks. In December, an advanced U.S. surveillance drone using stealth technology went down in Iran. Iranian officials claimed to have forced it down electronically.","Heron TP unmanned aircraft crashed near Israeli air base .

"A country mansion with a novel history is up for sale 70 years after it inspired acclaimed British writer Daphne du Maurier. The six-bedroom romantic Georgian manor house was made famous by du Maurier's semi-historical novel Hungry Hill, which was published in 1943. The property in Carmarthenshire, South Wales, which is in need of renovation and stands at the end of a private drive in a 34-acre plot of land, has a guide price of  £695,000. Inspiration: The Grade II-listed manor house in South Wales inspired Daphne du Maurier's novel Hungry Hill . For sale: The Georgian mansion sits within a 34-acre plot of land and has a guide price of £695,000 . Historic: The property, which has been in the same family since the 1820s, is in need of restoration . The novel is an account of feuding families through the generations and details how its Puxley family owners - renamed Brodrick in the book - lived in the mansion at Llantharog. The family business was mined copper in Cork, Ireland, and they needed a place in Carmarthenshire in order to be in easy reach of Swansea Bay, where the metal was unloaded from ships crossing the Irish Sea. The book covers a century from 1820 to 1920 and was made into a film in 1947. It was du Maurier's 10th work of fiction. The lengthy book was a best seller in its day but has become a of forgotten title du Maurier, who is best known for her 1938 novel Rebecca. Du Maurier was born in London in 1907 . and died in Cornwall in 1989 at the age of 81. She was made a Dame in . 1969 but never used the title. Dan Rees, a property agent with Savills, . said: 'The house is a gentlemen's residence that still retains aspects . of the charm conjured up by Du Maurier in her magnificent story of life . in the late Victorian era.' Novelist: Dame Daphne du Maurier, pictured in 1988 with her west highland terriers, died in 1989 . Family home: The property's owners hope to sell it to a Welsh family who will 'enjoy it' like they did . Acclaimed: Hungry Hill was the 10th work of fiction by du Maurier and was made into a film in 1947 . Owner Charles Puxley, whose ancestors bought the estate originally in the 1820s, said it is instantly recognisable in Du Maurier's book. He said: 'It was once part an estate of 200 acres and is steeped in my family's history. There are many references to it and it is immediately recognisable in Hungry Hill. Lengthy: There have been 33 editions of Hungry Hill . 'The names were all changed but the house, referred to as Llatharog, was vividly described and the driveway, which sees carriages thundering down it is just as in the book.' Mr Puxley, whose family occupied the property until the 1930s when it was rented out, said it was a truly enchanting place. But Mr Puxley, who is based in London, said while the sale of the property came with some regret, it should be handed over to another family to enjoy. He said: 'The property is in need of restoration and while we could invest in doing that, it would only be to let it out again and we didn't feel that would be the best return for us. 'In many ways we feel it would be better to be in the ownership of a Welsh family who could own it and enjoy it the way my family have for the last 200 years. 'I'd much rather that than see it let by me, living 150 miles away.' The house lies around one mile from the village of Llanddarog and eight miles east of Carmarthen. Mr Rees said it was rare that a Grade II-listed building with such appeal comes on the market . He said: 'It certainly is a magical place sitting privately in its 34 acres and because of its link to Daphne du Maurier. 'When I first saw the house last autumn I was immediately impressed by it and the link to du Maurier was an amazing coincidence as my wife was reading one of her other novels, Frenchman's Creek, at the time.' Steeped in history: The house, once part of a 200 acre estate, is 'immediately recognisable' in Hungry Hill . Regret: The Puxley family are sad to be saying goodbye to the property after nearly 200 years .

"Perhaps it's the threat of Santa's naughty list but a survey has revealed that the day of the year Americans are least likely to watch pornography is Christmas. Website Pornhub - which allows free access to millions of X-rated videos - analyzed their U.S. traffic in 2012 last week to work out when they had the highest and lowest number of viewers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the days when porn was least watched are all holidays - with the top three being Christmas Day, Thanksgiving and Easter Sunday. Turned off: A porn website has revealed that it got the lowest number of hits on U.S. holidays . Americans are least likely to indulge in their X-rated habits on December 25 - perhaps due to the distraction of too much family, too much food and too many presents. Similarly Thanksgiving on November 22 - the day to be thankful doesn't appear to stretch to indulging in porn. It looks like some porn fans' religious obligations also get the better of them in early April as visits to Pornhub take a dip on Easter Sunday (April 8). One-track mind: Perhaps unsurprisingly online porn viewers dropped in number on Valentine's Day... but there were still more people logging in than on other holidays (posed by models) Christmas Eve hits the list at number four, when it's likely that last-minute gift-buying and turkey-basting takes precedence. 1. Christmas Day (December 25) 2. Thanksgiving (November 22) 3. Easter Sunday (April 8) 4. Christmas Eve (December 24) 5. Independence Day (July 4) 6. New Year's Day . 7. Superstorm Sandy (October 20) 8 & 9 Memorial Day weekend (May 26 & 27) 10. Father's Day (June 17) 11. Valentine's Day (February 14) At number five is Independence Day, when Americans are presumably too busy celebrating their Fourth of July freedom to bother with online antics. New Year's Day makes an appearance next - suggesting a link between those who like to party to excess (and pay the consequences with a January 1 hangover) and have a predilection for online porn. Next on the list this year was October 20 - the day when Hurricane Sandy struck the East Coast and Americans had more far important things on their minds (while several million Internet connections were also down). Both days of Memorial Day weekend saw a dip in those watching porn followed by Father's Day. Unsurprisingly, Valentine's Day sees porn viewing at an annual low - with the promise of real-life sex still preferable to that in cyberspace - however it does come bottom of the list.

"Accused: Kurtis Green was reported to the police after connecting a water supply to a war memorial in Dersingham, Norfolk, without permission . For 12 years, Kurtis Green has diligently tended the war memorial in his village, cleaning up rubbish and planting bulbs at its base. In January, the Queen congratulated the 19-year-old for his hard work revamping the memorial, near her Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. But officials at Dersingham Parish Council have taken a rather different view and reported him to the police for his unpaid work – which they have labelled criminal damage. Mr Green, whose grandfather fought in the Second World War, was quizzed for two hours at a police station after he added a pipe to water the flowers without permission. The volunteer was just seven when he started tending the garden around the memorial opposite his parents’ fish and chip shop. He saved up his pocket money to buy gardening tools, and over the past decade he has spent hundreds of hours working on his pride and joy. When he was 15, he persuaded councillors to spend £20,000 on restoring the area with raised flower beds, new railings, seating and block paving. Mr Green worked tirelessly to help with the project and won a Young People of the Year award after he was praised by villagers. His efforts were then recognised by the Queen in a letter after the local Royal British Legion won a prize for having Norfolk’s most improved war memorial. But Mr Green got into trouble in February when he connected a new water supply so the flower beds could be safely watered. He and fellow villager John Houston, 65, assumed they were authorised to do the work because the pipes for the water supply had already been placed in the ground as part of the restoration project. But Dersingham Parish Council complained to the police that they had done the work without its permission and accused them of criminal damage and theft. After: The police now say that Mr Green will not face prosecution. The decision follows a public outcry about his treatment. He tended the memorial opposite his parents' fish and chip shop for free . Before: How the memorial looked before the teenager spent his spare time looking after it . Mr Green, who works as a chef at a care home, said: ‘It is just  so pathetic. ‘All we have been trying to do is help the community and we are being treated as if we are criminals. ‘We were accused of causing criminal damage by digging up earth to see if the existing pipe was OK, but we left the area just as we found it. ‘I can’t understand what the theft is supposed to have been. ‘All the soil we dug up was replaced in the ground and the only thing we took away was the dirt under our fingernails. Hard work: Mr Green (pictured hiding in shrubbery with other volunteers) devoted hours to improving the overgrown area around the war memorial . ‘The policewoman was trying to trap us. She kept asking us the same questions in different ways.’ Mr Green started working on the site as a boy because it was full of weeds and rubbish and ‘not in a fit state’ to honour those who had fought for the country. He said: ‘In those days, it was a complete disgrace. I just decided to do something to help.’ Mr Green, who had been forced by the parish council to take out his own insurance for work on the site, added: ‘The trench we dug was marked with cones and it  was all filled in the same day. We replaced the turf as best we could and put down new grass seed. Pride: The monument commemorates all of those who died in the First World War . ‘It actually looked better than when we started. But while we were doing it, a councillor came along and took pictures of us on his mobile phone. The next thing we knew,  we were reported to the police by the council. ‘Loads of people in the village are supportive of us.’ Tony Bubb, a Liberal Democrat district councillor, resigned as chairman of the parish council on Monday, but said his decision had nothing to do with the dispute. Parish council clerk Sarah Bristow said she could not comment as the issue was being investigated by  the police, but added: ‘The parish council did not give anyone permission to do anything.’ A spokesman for Norfolk police said: ‘The circumstances are now being considered by the Crown Prosecution Service. Police are aware of Kurtis’s efforts in cleaning up the memorial and we will work with all concerned to try to reach an acceptable resolution.’ Mr Green’s mother, Sandra, 61, said: ‘All he is trying to do is some good. He’s got a heart of gold.’ Dersingham has a population of 4,500. Singer Phil Collins owns a house in the village.","Kurtis Green has tended to the Dersingham memorial since he was seven .

"Privacy czar: Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the company's beefed up technological security Wednesday, emphasizing the tech giant's 'fundamental' commitment to privacy . Apple has ramped up its technological security to the point that even the company itself can no longer pry into a password-protected iPhone or iPad. The additional safeguard is part of Apple's latest mobile software, iOS 8, which the Cupertino, California, tech giant released Wednesday - two days before iPhone 6 went on sale nationwide. Apple unveiled the more robust protection in a new section of its website that is prefaced with a letter from CEO Tim Cook who emphasized the company's 'fundamental' commitment to privacy and security.

That's why we have and always will work as hard as we can to earn and keep it.' Apple is highlighting its increased security following a mortifying episode that unfolded earlier this month after hackers broke into the online accounts of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, supermodel Kate Upton, singer Ariana Grande and other celebrities who stored copies of nude photos on the company's iCloud service. Nude photos of Lawrence and other female stars were posted on various websites, causing some security experts to question whether Apple had taken adequate precautions to thwart hackers trying to break into user accounts. Since the X-rated photos appeared, Apple has been stressing the need for its users to rely on passwords that are difficult to guess. Scroll down for video . Under lock and key: Users' personal information can be blocked not only on the new iPhone 6 (pictured), but on any device dating back to 2011 . It has also recommended the adoption of a security feature known as two-step verification that requires a special code sent to mobile phones to be entered along with a password to log into accounts. Apple's inability to unlock password-protected smartphones and tablets could frustrate law enforcement officials who sometimes obtain court orders to vacuum personal data off the phones for potential evidence in criminal investigations. The personal information will be blocked on more than just Apple's newest mobile devices, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, that hit the shelves today. That is because Apple is giving away iOS 8 to anyone with devices dating back to 2011. The software can be downloaded to devices as old as the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2. That covers hundreds of millions of devices already in use. Brand new:  The back of an Apple iPhone 6 Plus gold is shown here at a Verizon store on September 18 in Orem, Utah . Early adopters: Hundreds of people lined up Friday outside the Apple store in SoHo waiting to snap up Apple's newest offerings, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus . The number of legal requests that Apple gets for personal data off devices is relatively small. Apple provided some data in nearly 6,500 of the roughly 9,600 requests that law enforcement agencies around the world submitted for devices during the first half of this year, according to the company's own accounting. Apple says the requests came in most cases after a device was stolen. Like other technology companies, Apple is trying to present itself as a trustworthy steward of people's information after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing government spies' efforts to snoop on emails and other personal information as part of an effort to identify potential terrorists. Apple, like its peers, has lashed out at the US government's digital surveillance programs and stressed that it isn't cooperating with any of the spying. Exposed: The increase in security comes just weeks after hackers broke into the iCloud accounts of celebrties like Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Ariana Grande (right) and released their nude photos . Cook is seeking to draw an even bigger distinction between Apple and other prominent technology companies such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. that offer free online services financed by ads that are based on the personal preference expressed in emails that are scanned, search requests that are tracked and social media posts that are analyzed. Apple has no need to resort to those tactics, Cook said, because the company makes its money from the devices and services that it sells. 'A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you're not the customer,' Cook wrote in his letter. 'You're the product. But at Apple, we believe a great customer experience shouldn't come at the expense of your privacy.'","Users' personal information can be blocked not only on the new iPhone 6, but on any device dating back to 2011 .

"Steve has been with me for the past 50 years and Ron for 47. Neither is the man I am married to, nor have I seen or spoken to either since our love affairs ended in my 20s. All the same, there is no denying they have both messed with my marriage to Olly, the man who has been by my side for the past 40 years. I found myself thinking about them both as I read recent research that suggested women who played the field before marriage are unhappier with their lot than those who entered matrimony virginal. Angela Neustatter has often questioned what life would have been like had she married another man . My first reaction was: why on earth would that be? I have always believed a bit of experience, in both love and sex, to be an asset to understanding what we really want when selecting a partner for life. Having no history to draw on — settling down with no idea what else the world has to offer — seems a recipe for disaster, not satisfaction. And yet there is no denying that my past lovers have made their presence felt in my marriage — at times, even making me question my commitment. Olly and I have, along with a lot of fun, weathered many disagreements, and even contemplated separation after a mid-life hiccup saw all passion wilt. Although we’re still together, would Olly and I have been happier, our journey to this point easier, had he been my one and only? Not that I had notched up a great many scalps on my bedpost before we met when I was 29 — but there were a few, and, most significantly, Steve and Ron were both serious contenders for my heart. Although my relationships with the two ended very differently — I left Steve in London for a job in Manchester when I was 24, with great pain; Ron found fidelity too hard and broke my heart by ending our 18-month affair abruptly — they both left me with an undeniably tantalising sense of ‘what if’. Neither maintained any physical presence in my life, but memories of how good things had been with them at our best always lived at the back of my mind, like old love letters or black-and-white photographs gathered at the bottom of a box. They faded during the early years with Olly, and were covered over by fresh memories made with him. We were absorbed in our new-found love, revelling in the unearthing of shared interests and enjoying our sexual chemistry, leaving no room for thoughts of anyone else in my mind. So it is for many women in the early years after they tie the knot. But, as time passes, things change. The early days of romantic enchantment tend not to be the stuff of life ever after. Evenings channelling Elizabeth Barrett Browning and counting the ways we love each other are displaced — particularly after the arrival of children — by the urgency of deciding whether to replace the boiler, or whose turn it is to make dinner. All such things can bind us together, weaving tightly the tough fabric of a joined life. But the danger of life’s predictable routine — the groundhog day familiarity, talking to each other so matter-of-factly, being sparing with the compliments — lies in allowing the mind to wander. Angela with her former lover Steve. She says there is no denying that her past lovers have made their presence felt in her marriage — at times, even making her question her commitment to husband Olly . It is at such times that women, far more than men, according to Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, Yale psychologist and author of Women Who Think Too Much, are likely to find themselves ruminating on how life might have panned out with the past loves that seemed so magical in their time. Whether the thrill might have endured and could have made for an infinitely more satisfying relationship than the one we have now. These fantasies, as I see it, are like powerful ghosts, haunting the darker recesses of our psyche, ready to swoop in and cause trouble, when given the chance. Certainly, my marriage became crowded with ghosts when, after my first decade with Olly, the little things that had once been no more than niggles began to take on greater significance. We seemed too often to slip on to opposite tracks. Arguments and irritation replaced amiable conversation, sex felt more a chore than a delight, we were frequently exhausted by raising our two, growing sons while doing up a wreck of a house. Sex felt more a chore than a delight with husband Olly, and they were exhausted by raising two, growing sons while doing up a wreck of a house . All that had been so loveable in our partnership — impromptu, romantic weekends away, gifts given on whim, hugs whenever we passed on the stairs, conversations peppered with unsolicited ‘I love yous’ — had been replaced by a tetchy co-existence. After one explosive row — undoubtedly over something banal, such as Olly not paying sufficient attention to what I was saying — I took myself for a walk and, suddenly, it was as though Steve were there: tall and angular, his long legs striding beside mine, his deep, drawling voice asking me what was wrong, telling me how he desired me, his intelligent face breaking often into a broad smile. Once the gates had opened, the happy memories came in a flood. I remembered the hurt, baby pigeon we had adopted in a shared fit of impulsive sentimentality, and nursed back to flight. The novels he presented me with, filled with flowers he had pressed himself. The bottle of bubbles he had opened, apropos of nothing but his insistence that it was time to celebrate us. The evenings spent making passionate love. Memories so powerful, so tangible that I felt an urgent yearning to be back in that time and his arms. Angela with her husband Olly, who she says was crowded out by memories of her past lovers . Why oh why had we let the relationship go? Surely the fault lines had not been so great. I found myself ruminating on these memories over the days and weeks ahead, so that they became more real, more powerful, each time I conjured them up. Steve began to appear whenever I was feeling low, sad or undervalued — he would have known how to soothe me, I felt, when to say sweet things that answered my longing to feel there was someone to lean on, to be looked after by. At other times, when Olly and I had been in a sexual drought zone, Ron would come sweeping in. He had been one of those emotionally dangerous men of huge charisma and puckish good looks. He never quite felt reliable, yet gave me the intoxicating sense of inhabiting a private world, in which his penetrating, green eyes, teasing smile and utter absorption in our love were all that existed. Although he ended our affair abruptly and cruelly — in a way that I now suspect would have been repeated in other ways in a real life together — tantalising memories pay no heed to reality. Carefully edited by my subconscious, they left out his not-so-perfect moments and presented me only with the steamy ingredients that seemed to be missing from my marriage. Such rumination seems a particularly female trait. Why do past loves not torment men in the same way? Olly has ex-girlfriends he talks of warmly and with amusement, at times, but I have never felt he was inviting in the ghosts as I do — they are over and done with, locked away where they can do no harm. Relate counsellor Christine Northam believes men are more inclined to take a practical approach to the past. ‘They can put emotional things into a box and shut down the lid so nothing seeps out into everyday life,’ she says. ‘Women can do a lot of good to their relationships by focusing on emotional needs and confronting them. ‘But letting fantasies take over can be a way of avoiding a problem that needs sorting out in a real- life marriage. ‘Are the fantasies telling you what is missing in your present relationship that you could work on?’ Once Angela stopped inviting her ghosts in, they seemed to fade away . My ghosts were undoubtedly crowding Olly out. Adrift in our marriage, getting on each other’s nerves, I knew I needed to do some hard thinking of a different kind. Slipping so easily into ruminations and ‘what ifs’ was, I realised, a destructive self-indulgence, which stopped me making any real effort to unweave the unhappy web we were caught in. I was so focused on how Olly didn’t match up that I wasn’t wondering whether I did. I had to grow up and let go, if our marriage was going to hold strong. I started by refusing to give the thoughts of Steve and Ron houseroom when they appeared, and forcing my mind to something else. I laughed at Olly’s criticisms more often than I flared up; I made a point of talking about how I valued all we had built up together, what good friends we were, and how I relished spending shared time enjoying our grandchildren. I was surprised by how well this worked, how once I stopped inviting my ghosts in, they seemed to fade away, and how Olly, in turn, became softer, less critical, more able to acknowledge how much we mattered to each other. I am not sentimental enough to say we now have the perfect relationship, nor that Ron and Steve will never again get a nostalgic thought. There are times, even now, when I wish Olly were as artfully charming as Steve, or as dangerously seductive as Ron. but, while I would not wish away my past, I no longer imagine that it holds anyone who would have been a better bet than my husband. I can see clearly that his steady, reliable form of love, while not as demonstrative, has infinitely more value and will help us weather many more years together yet. As we snuggle up in bed, our books on our knees, laughing at how cosy this feels after 40 shared years, I am glad that I allowed Olly’s substantial self to banish my ghosts.

"Caroline Criado-Perez became the target of rape threats after leading a campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note . A man has been arrested in connection with a barrage of hostile tweets a feminist campaigner received after persuading the Bank of England to put Jane Austen on a new bank note. Caroline Criado-Perez received rape and death threats from Twitter users over the course of more than a day after she successfully campaigned for a woman's picture to be put on the note. Scotland Yard said a 21-year-old was arrested today in Manchester on suspicion of harassment offences after officers in Camden, London, received a complaint of malicious communications on Thursday. A campaign in her support, calling on Twitter to introduce a button to allow speedy reporting of abuse, has already been signed by 12,500 people and she has received support from MPs and celebrities. Writer Caitlin Moran tweeted: 'For those who say, ""why complain - just block?' on a big troll day, it can be 50 violent/rape messages an hour. Exhausting and upsetting.' There are also attempts being made to organise a boycott of the free social media network on August 4. Ms Criado-Perez said: 'It's sadly not unusual to get this kind of abuse but I've never seen it get as intense or aggressive as this. 'It's infuriating that the price you pay for standing up for women is 24 hours of rape threats. We are showing that by standing together we can make a real difference. 'We made the Bank of England change its mind, we can do the same with Twitter.' Ms Criado-Perez, a freelance journalist, organised a campaign which included a petition signed by more than 35,500 people after the Bank of England decided to replace Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on new £5 notes. Standing together: People have taken to Twitter to express their support to Caroline Criado-Perez . The move would have meant there were no women apart from the Queen on sterling bank notes. Her campaign was a success, with an announcement by the Bank last week that the author Jane Austen will feature on the new £10 when it is introduced in 2017. Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, is supporting Ms Criado Perez. 'What Caroline has had to deal with in the past day is not only disgusting, but criminal, she said. 'A quick look at Twitter this morning shows that women are not prepared to stand by and take this kind of abuse. 'Twitter needs to get its house in order, and fast.' The campaigner tweeted this afternoon that she was planning to make a police statement. Tony Wang, the general manager of Twitter UK, said that the company takes online abuse seriously. He tweeted: 'We encourage users to report an account for violation of the Twitter rules by using one of our report forms. 'Also, we're testing ways to simplify reporting, e.g. within a Tweet by using the 'Report Tweet' button in our iPhone app and on mobile web. MP Mary Macleod, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, MP Stella Creasy and Caroline Criado-Perez, pose after the announcement that Jane Austen will appear on the new £10 note . 'We will suspend accounts that, once reported to us, are found to be in breach of our rules.' A Twitter spokeswoman added: 'The ability to report individual tweets for abuse is currently available on Twitter for iPhone and we plan to bring this functionality to other platforms, including Android and the web. 'We don't comment on individual accounts. 'However, we have rules which people agree to abide by when they sign up to Twitter.

"Not having it: Dave Dawson, left, responded to travellers moving on to his land by leaping into his digger and threatening to move them by force . When he found travellers’ caravans had arrived on his land, Dave Dawson had two options. He could either alert the authorities and wait for the slow turning of the wheels of justice and officialdom. Or he could rely on the somewhat quicker wheels of his digger – and remove the caravans by force. Taking the second course of action, Mr Dawson put in a call to the police to inform them of his intentions, which risked leading to his arrest. Officers arrived to oversee what appeared to be a few heated exchanges before – remarkably – the travellers left of their own accord. His swift action stands in stark contrast to the decade-long battle to shift travellers from the notorious Dale Farm site in Essex, which only came to an end in October last year. Mr Dawson, whose farm is near Shoreham in West Sussex, discovered the intruders early yesterday morning. ‘I would have used any force possible to get them off my land,’ he said. ‘I got down here about 6am and told them to move off. There were four vans there at the time and more parked up outside. ‘I came down with the digger and tractor and told them if they didn’t move I was going to move them. ‘I just won’t tolerate it. It is my land. I bought it and I have worked hard for it. I called the police and told them I was going to get the digger and move them. ‘I didn’t care if they got squashed, flattened or left on their own, but one way or another I was going to get them off my land.’ 'It's my land': Undeterred by the sudden arrival of the travellers, Mr Dawson called police and told them he was prepared to remove the intruders by force . 'I would have used any force possible': Officers were forced to stand between Mr Dawson's digger and the travellers' caravans to prevent him from carrying out his threats . It is believed that the went to Lancing Green, West Sussex, three miles from Mr Dawson's land . He said that at one point in the clash the officers had to stand between the two sides. ‘The police told me that once they are on the land they have rights. But what about my rights?’ Mr Dawson added. ‘If I had left it to the authorities . they could have been on my land for weeks. I wasn’t going to wait for a . court order to get rid of them. ‘As it was, the police threatened to . arrest me. It has already cost me a day’s work and about £500 to repair . the damage. They cut through a metal gate and put their own lock on it.’ A spokesman for Sussex Police said: . ‘Six caravans turned up on land at 6.45am. The landowner also turned up . and threatened to evict the travellers. Furious: Officers oversaw what appeared to be several heated exchanges between Mr Dawson and his uninvited guests . A traveller talks to officers: Mr Dawson feared that if he left the eviction to the authorities, the caravans could have been left on his land for weeks . ‘Police attended and remained on scene . to prevent a breach of peace. The travellers left the site of their own . accord at 9.35am.’ Removing travellers who have occupied land without . permission is usually a much more costly and time-consuming exercise. At Dale Farm, the decade-long legal battle cost taxpayers an estimated £18million. A total of 43 people were arrested and . several injured after protesters fought running battles with riot . police over the eviction of about 80 families from what was the UK’s . largest illegal traveller settlement. As soon as Basildon council had . declared a final victory, there was a massive leap in the number of . caravans pitched on the legal Oak Lane site next door – and an adjoining . road – prompting more expensive legal action. In 2009, a convoy pitched up at . another controversial travellers’ site just hours after a group had been . evicted following a six-year legal battle costing £400,000. The new arrivals rolled on to a field . adjoining the notorious Smithy Fen site at Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, . where travellers had set up an illegal camp. Bye bye: The travellers eventually moved off Mr Dawson's land at 9.45am - three hours after they had arrived .","Dave Dawson threatened to remove travellers by force himself after declaring: 'I won't tolerate it.'

"Athletics, a sport tainted by regular drugs scandals, has nevertheless received the huge £200million-plus backing of Japanese marketing giants Dentsu for the next 15 years. Dentsu will announce that they are renewing their agency partnership with the IAAF — track and field’s ruling body — until 2029. Backing: Lord Coe is favourite to succeed IAAF president Lamine Diack . IAAF sources say the massive marketing and rights deal for a sport that has had more than its fair share of negative publicity will guarantee them a minimum £11m a year — with extra on a profit share — until 2019 and then £14m a year as a minimum for the next decade. The agreement will ensure IAAF president Lamine Diack leaves the organisation in a healthy financial state when he steps down next year. The favourite to succeed Diack is Lord Coe, who has enjoyed a good relationship with Dentsu since they became the IAAF’s marketing partners. The Japanese agency would not have committed to such a long contract if they did not fully expect Coe to take the helm. Coe, who is sure to have a strong anti-drugs agenda when he launches his IAAF election manifesto to the 212 voting associations, is likely to compete against Ukraine’s pole vault great Sergey Bubka for the IAAF presidency. But the troubles in Ukraine and Bubka’s support for the overthrown pro-Russian government, plus his rash challenge for the IOC presidency last year, has put Coe in pole position for the role he covets most. The football conference season starting this week might not quicken the pulse but that will not bother James Worrall, founder of the Leaders in Football brand of which he has sold a 50 per cent share to American City Business Journals for a reported £2.5m.

New face: Notts County's Jim Rodwell (left) made his FA international committee debut in Switzerland . Jim Rodwell, a journeyman lower league defender, was a long way from the England set-up as a player. But Rodwell, now Notts County chief executive and a Football League board member, made his FA international committee debut in Switzerland as part of the England party. He is one of the rare blazers who played football at a professional level. The FA received presentations at their last board meeting on how TV rights partners BBC and BT intend to heavily promote the FA Cup when coverage starts with the first round on November 8. But, embarrassingly for the FA, there is still no sign of a new sponsor following Budweiser not renewing their contract. The FA, chasing a £9m-a-year partner, revamped their commercial department by bringing in Manchester United-honed expertise. So far this has not worked, although the FA are confident of signing a sponsor by the first round — if not, definitely by the flagship third round. Carry on ranting, Roy . England manager Roy Hodgson’s ‘absolute f****** b*******’ briefing with the Press would not have happened if UEFA had their way. Tough talking: England boss Roy Hodgson let rip during press conference . The FA have been asked by European football’s governing body to hold all-in media conferences with TV, radio and newspapers so rights holders do not miss the best story line that invariably comes from Press rather than TV questioning. But the FA, to their credit, intend to carry on with separate conferences, even if it involves Hodgson letting off steam. The story from the new Bobby Moore biography that England’s World Cup winning hero had been turned down for membership by Chigwell Golf Club sparked clubhouse comment that the problem was more to do with Moore’s entourage of drinking pals than the fabled footballer himself. It is also alleged Chigwell’s clubhouse was set on fire shortly after Moore was snubbed. Turkish Airlines, who made a memorable commercial deal with sports stars Lionel Messi and Kobe Bryant, are understood to be top of the list to replace Samsung, whose contract as Chelsea shirt sponsors expires at the end of the season.

"The Duchess of Cambridge is facing the prospect of never becoming Prince William’s Queen. MP John Hemming is attempting to ensure all spouses of reigning monarchs are officially known as Prince or Princess Consorts, with an amendment to the repeal of ancient royal primogeniture laws. The wives of ruling Kings currently become Queen Consorts but the husbands of female monarchs have no right to any title - which is why the current Duke of Edinburgh is not known as King Philip. 'Princess Consort': An MP's proposal in an Early Day Motion says the Duchess of Cambridge (left) would lose out on being called Queen Catherine when her husband William (right) is crowned King . The Liberal Democrat’s Early Day Motion says the Duchess of Cambridge would lose out on being called Queen Catherine when her husband William is crowned King, reported the Sunday Express. ‘It’s not right that a Queen Regnant is treated as less important than a King Regnant,’ he told the Sunday Express. ‘It seems sensible we resolve this issue when dealing with the primogeniture issue.’ The proposal also means Camilla would become Princess Consort when Prince Charles becomes King - which Clarence House has always insisted upon, following the couple’s previous divorces. Current rules: The wives of ruling Kings become Queen Consorts but the husbands of female monarchs have no right to any title - which is why the current Duke of Edinburgh (right) is not known as King Philip . Early Day Motion: MP John Hemming is attempting to ensure all spouses of reigning monarchs are officially known as Prince or Princess Consorts . Prime Minister Winston Churchill was . told by the Lord Chancellor in 1954 that Philip had no right to any . title despite his wife Elizabeth II becoming Queen - but he was later . given the title of Prince. The current difference in title rights dates back to the custom of male primogeniture, which has meant that male heirs have traditionally leapfrogged their older sisters in the line of succession. But a new law to ensure the first child of the Duke and pregnant Duchess of Cambridge will succeed to the throne regardless of gender is being fast-tracked through Parliament. Ending gender discrimination in the line of succession will involve changing some of the oldest laws on the Statute Book, including the Treason Act 1351, which was originally written in Norman French. A Clarence House spokesman told MailOnline of Mr Hemming’s possible amendment to the repeal, which the Commons will be asked to consider next month: ‘It’s a matter for the Government.’","MP John Hemming wants amendment to repeal of royal primogeniture laws .

Attilio Lombardo to Crystal Palace (from Juventus in 1997) The Italy international did eventually end his career at Lazio and Sampdoria, but captured the imagination at Selhurst Park. A goal on debut against Everton set him on his way and Lombardo was even appointed caretaker manager for a spell. Christophe Dugarry to Birmingham (from Bordeaux in 2003) The maverick’s permanent deal didn’t go quite to plan, but the loan spell preceding that was hugely successful. Dugarry’s ability to serve as a lynchpin – scoring goals and exciting St Andrew’s – served as the stir Birmingham needed to finish 13th under Steve Bruce. Derby goal: Christophe Duggary scored important goals (including here against West Brom) for Birmingham . On the move: Alen Boksic rocked up at Middlesbrough after a spell up front for Italian giants Lazio . Escape! Boksic tries to wriggle free of Sol Campbell against Arsenal at the Riverside Stadium . Alen Boksic to Middlesbrough (from Lazio in 2000) Twenty-two league goals in 68 games was a decent return for the striker in a team trying to find their feet in the Premier League. Boksic’s execution was precise, his close control exquisite. Tomas Brolin to Crystal Palace (from unattached in 1998 – previously at Leeds) Even though he enjoyed a better time at Palace than he endured at Leeds, Brolin has long been regarded as one of the worst players to grace English football. Not too much healthier though - they released the Swede after just a season. George Weah to Manchester City (from AC Milan in 2000) Not exactly the goal machine he had one been, Weah epitomised Manchester City at the time: a little bit slow and lacking ideas. He found the net just once in the league and wasn’t best pleased with manager Joe Royle either. Not the best of times: George Weah never got on at Manchester City after winning the FA Cup at Chelsea . Trouble in the east: Croatian striker Davor Suker never truly settled at West Ham United . Making his name: Suker was brilliant at Real Madrid and won the golden boot at the World Cup in 1998 . Paulo Futre to West Ham (from AC Milan in 1996) A dazzling winger, Futre enjoyed the best of his career during a six-year stint at Atletico Madrid but failed to nail down a club to stay at and became something of a journeyman. Upton Park was no different, even though he had the capacity to excite. Davor Suker to West Ham (from Arsenal in 2000) Arsene Wenger landed Suker 12 months after the World Cup in France on the strength of his golden boot, but the Croat failed to live up to expectation it was a similar story at West Ham, too, and he left for 1860 Munich after a year. Gaizka Mendieta to Middlesbrough (from Lazio in 2004) The Spaniard – remarkably to some – still lives in the North East after a five-year love affair with Boro that, although laden with injuries, saw him become a hero.

"Come January there are many who begin the upward struggle to rid themselves of the extra pounds gained through holiday indulgence. These pictures show that it is not just humans who may have had a mince meant pie too many this Christmas – one or two of these pets definitely need a diet. The odd treat is definitely well-earned for catching a ball or a piece of string, but these animals are definitely being killed with kindness as most appear barely able to move.

A report from 2011 showed that 12 million UK pets are overweight after being fed too many calorific treats, including takeaways, cheese, crisps and cakes, often on a daily basis. The study, by the veterinary charity PDSA, also showed that owners were unaware of the damage they were doing.

Safety first: 'Sorry owner, there appears to be a seatbelt issue of the reach-around kind. We'll have to do the vet another day' Most believed the ‘special treats’ were something which enriched their pets’ lives. Only two per cent felt any remorse over feeding their pets high-calorie snacks and nibbles. Over six million British dogs and five million cats are fed junkfood on regular basis and a nearly all owners - 90 per cent - admitted giving cheese, toast, crisps, biscuits, takeaways, cakes or other fatty treats as part of their diet.

"A student has been counselled after she was caught performing sex act on camera in a university library. Picture posed by model . A University of Newcastle student has been caught broadcasting live sex shows from a campus library. The university said she had been 'counselled' after officials were informed she was broadcasting the solo sex performances from the Auchmuty campus library, on the New South Wales coast north of Sydney. Her sex shows were screened on a pay per view website and promoted via social media, the Newcastle Herald reported. A University of Newcastle spokeswoman said the institution was 'very disappointed' when the student was found to be 'using internet facilities inappropriately on campus'. 'We have a code of conduct that clearly outlines the sorts of behaviours the university expects from its community on campus,' she said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia. 'The matter has now been investigated and the student has been counselled. 'An important part of our duty of care is to protect our students' privacy and it would be inappropriate for the university to provide specific details in relation to the incident.' The section of the library where she performed sex acts on camera has since been steam cleaned. The University of Newcastle has the third highest number of students registered to 'sugar daddy' matchmaking site Seeking Arrangement in Australia.

"'Too few ethnic minorities in top positions': David Cameron says he wants to live to see an British Asian as Prime Minster . David Cameron last night said he wants to see a ‘Prime Minister with a British Asian name’ in his lifetime. The Prime Minister warned Britain is not achieving its full potential because prejudicial barriers still remain against ethnic minorities. There was ‘a glaring absence’ of diversity among figures at the top of public life in Britain. Mr Cameron said at the GG2 Leadership Awards sponsored by the Daily Mail: ‘One day I want to hear that title “Prime Minister” followed by a British Asian name. ‘In Britain today there are still too few ethnic minorities in top positions. Let us think big about what Britons of all backgrounds can achieve. When I hear “sir”, “your honour” or “right honourable”, I want them to be followed by a British Asian name. ‘The absence is glaring in the boardrooms of the FTSE 250, in the chambers of the Houses of Parliament, on football managers’ benches; on high court judges’ benches and in our fighter jets, our naval ships, our armed battalions around the world. ‘I am clear: this has to change. Not to tick boxes or fulfil quotas – but to fulfil potential. ‘Because Britain will only be the best it can be when its people – when all its people – are all they can be. ‘So I think there are three big things we, everyone here, can do: First, remove the barriers that stop people getting on. Second, attack prejudice. And third, celebrate role models. Because only then can we create a country where everyone – whatever their background – can get on.’ At the ceremony in London, Pesala Bandara won the award for Young Journalist of the Year. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid topped a power list of the most influential Asians in the UK, ahead of teenage activist Malala Yousafzai. Mr Javid became the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister in April after rapidly rising through the ranks of the party. Judges of the Power List, compiled by the Asian Media and Marketing Group, said Mr Javid earned the title for being the only Asian voice at the heart of the Government’s senior decision-making process and his commitment to ‘opening the cultural doors for all Britons in the UK’. He pushed 17-year-old Malala, who became the youngest ever Nobel prize winner last month for her work championing global education rights for girls, into second place.

"It is not often that skyscrapers double up as theme park rides - but this new design for a building in Miami is breaking the mold. Plans for the unusual SkyRise Miami have just been approved, combining two thrilling rides with a building that looks like a giant slide. The £262million ($428million) construction is set to become an icon in the Florida city as Miami's tallest building, standing at 1,000ft high - and has already been dubbed 'Miami's Eiffel Tower'. Scroll down for video . Deluxe: The £262 million project will include three observation decks and exclusive night clubs . Jewel of the harbour: SkyRise Miami will rise out of Port Miami to be an unmissable 1,000ft . Outside entertainment: With nightlife sorted, the building also features three rides for thrill-seekers . And while it will boast three observations decks, a sky-high bar and nightclub, it is the idea for two thrilling rides that has caught the public's attention. Thrillseekers will be able to indulge in SkyRise Drop, and experience that allows people to base jump off the skyscraper attached to a 'high-speed controlled-descent wire'. And if that isn't enough, they will also be able to try SkyPlunge, being locked into a harness before freefalling 50 stories. An exclusive club and a bar will cater for adults wand the SkyRise Flying Theater will provide additional entertainment. The Sky High Club will be the height of exclusivity for the vibrant Miami and South Beach club scene being 1,000ft up while a fine dining restaurant will have the same views a floor down in a more subdued setting.

The second ride, SkyPlunge, will see visitors strapped into a harness and sent into a 50-storey drop before a rapid deceleration keeps them from the ground.

"The father of a woman whose June rampage with her husband left two Las Vegas police officers and a good Samaritan dead visited the restaurant and store where the three were gunned down, saying he was still in disbelief and thinks about the victims' families every day. Todd Woodruff of Lafayette, Indiana, laid flowers Friday against the window of a pizza shop where his daughter, Amanda Miller, and her husband, Jerad Miller, killed officers Alyn Beck and Igor Soldo in an ambush during their lunch break. 'I can't believe they went in and did that,' he said of the couple who espoused anti-government views. Devastated: Todd Woodruff, the father of Amanda Miller, whose June rampage with her husband, Jerad Miller, left two Las Vegas police officers and a good Samaritan dead, visited the restaurant and store where the three were gunned down . Amanda Miller and husband Jerad Miller died as they opened fire in a Wal-Mart, killing two officers . Woodruff then went to a nearby Wal-Mart where the Millers fled after shooting the officers. His 22-year-old daughter shot and killed shopper Joseph Wilcox when he approached Jerad Miller, 31. The couple died during an exchange of gunfire with police inside the store. Woodruff told KLAS-TV that he realizes his daughter caused a lot of hurt and he will never forget the three victims. 'I can see their faces right now,' he said. 'I can't tell them (victims' families) I'm sorry enough. I think about it every day.' At the Wal-Mart, he passed through the same doors where his daughter and her husband announced, 'The revolution has started.' He also passed by the spot where his daughter killed Wilcox as he pulled his legal concealed weapon to stop Jerad Miller. Woodruff then made his way to the back of the store, where his daughter shot herself in the head and her husband was killed during the shootout. Pictured in this security footage, the Millers fled to this Wal-Mart where they shot and killed a good Samaritan while exchanging gunfire with police . Woodruff said he was so against his daughter's marriage he 'threw up' just before walking her down the aisle . As he left the store, he said it was almost as if he could hear his daughter's voice in his head. 'She apologized. She just said, 'I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't mean to disappoint you,'' Woodruff told the television station. He said he never imagined his daughter could be capable of killing anyone, and he blames Jerad Miller for brainwashing her with his anti-government rhetoric. 'We were so against this, that marriage, that I just threw up before I walked her down the aisle,' he said. Amanda Miller shot herself in the head after her husband was killed during the shootout . Police have said the Millers shared an ideology with militia and white supremacists that law enforcement officers were oppressors. The couple had temporarily joined supporters of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, who engaged in an armed standoff in April with U.S. Bureau of Land Management agents trying to round up Bundy's cattle amid a public land trespassing dispute. Woodruff not only came to Las Vegas for 'closure' but to bring back to Indiana his daughter's two cats, who had been at a foster home since the June 8 rampage.","Todd Woodruff laid flowers against the window of the pizza shop where daughter Amanda Miller and son-in-law Jerad Miller killed two police officers .

"The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority is facing a bit of embarrassment after a new license plate affixed to some of its fleet vehicles was spotted with a typo. The plates read 'Metropolitan Transporation Authority', with the second 't' in 'transportation' mysteriously missing. The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles says the fault doesn't lie with the MTA and is trying to figure out whether the error occurred in the designing or manufacturing stage. A license plate with the spelling error appears on an MTA fleet vehicle in New York. It's unclear how many license plates with the typo were printed . The New York State DMV says it ordered 908 license plates in the batch but doesn't know how many carry the mistake or how much it will cost to replace them . Some are speculating that the problem happened because the full word 'transportation' didn't fit in the allotted space on the plate, according to Pix 11. The DMV says it ordered 908 plates and plans to replace the error-ridden ones. Officials couldn't, however, provide the exact number of replacements needed or the cost of reprinting. The faux pas follows a few months after Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism committed its own spelling transgression on some of its graduates' diplomas. The school spelled 'integrated' without the 'n' for students obtaining a degree from its Integrated Marketing Communications program.","The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority's new plates are missing the second 't' in 'transportation'

"Investigators did not have enough evidence until last month to take custody of a 7-year-old Wyoming boy who was allegedly kept in an outdoor cage, despite requests last year to check on his welfare, authorities said. Albany County Sheriff Dave O'Malley expressed frustration Wednesday that deputies couldn't act sooner, but the initial investigations didn't provide enough evidence, the Laramie Daily Boomerang reported. The boy was kept in a cage outside, and forced to use the bucket for a restroom instead of the one in the house. Jena Harman and Alexander Smith are each charged with one count of child abuse and . three counts of felonious restraint in the alleged mistreatment of Harman's son, 7 . The child was allegedly kept in an outdoor cage behind this rural residence . 'It's not easy to take custody of a . child away from their parent,' O'Malley said. 'When you get to the .

Fox News reports mother Jena Harman and boyfriend Alexander Smith were each charged with one count of child abuse and three counts of felonious restraint in the case. Sheriff's deputies took the boy into protective custody July 24 after finding the 6-by-6-foot cage made of wood and metal outside a rural house west of Laramie. O'Malley said he was told the boy is doing well now. The boy's mother and her boyfriend were arrested on child-abuse charges. The man was scheduled to appear in court Thursday. The woman's next hearing has not been scheduled. The Associated Press typically does not identify abuse victims and is withholding the suspects' names to avoid identifying the child.

"John O’Shea has urged the Republic of Ireland to build the momentum after launching their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a last-gasp victory in Georgia. Martin O’Neill’s men looked to be heading for a frustrating draw in Tbilisi on Sunday evening after being pegged back by the Georgians, only for winger Aiden McGeady to snatch the points with a dramatic late winner. They now head into next month’s double header - on paper, at least, their easiest and most difficult matches, at home to Gibraltar and away to reigning world champions Germany - brimming with confidence and determined to keep the ball rolling. Great start: Aiden McGeady celebrates scoring the winning goal against Georgia . Bounced back: John O'Shea (left) and team-mates dejected after Georgia equalised but the men in green came back to win . O’Shea, who won his 97th cap at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, said: 'Look, it’s momentum, it’s just a key word. Martin and the staff have had to wait 10 months for their first competitive game and to get a win is huge. 'Now we can see the way the other results go and build from there. But you are coming away from home in the first game, three points - it’s massive, it really is. 'It was perfect, very, very perfect. It was a huge three points for us. People might have been thinking that 1-1 wouldn’t have been too bad, but believe me, we wanted to win this game beforehand. 'Going back to previous campaigns - you look at Armenia in particular - when you come away, a long-distance travel, tough enough opposition. 'But ultimately, we knew we could win the game and we did win it. We left it a little bit late, but what a special goal to win it for us.' O’Shea was one of a procession of players to heap praise on McGeady after the final whistle, understandably so in the circumstances. All to play for: Ireland's players congratulate McGeady on scoring his first goal . Driven: Seamus Coleman takes on Georgia's Davit Kvirkvelia . However, it was not just the fact that he scored the decisive goal which earned him the plaudits, but that he did so to cap arguably the best performance yet of his 70-game senior international career. Asked to play on the left in the absence of the injured James McClean, the Everton midfielder looked the man most likely to break down Temuri Ketsbaia’s men from the off, and so it proved when he accepted James McCarthy’s pass at the end of a swift 24th-minute break and slotted past keeper Giorgi Loria. But the Georgians were level seven minutes before the break when midfielder Tornike Okriashvili thumped a dipping shot past the helpless David Forde, preferred to 38-year-old Shay Given in the Irish goal, although O’Shea revealed his goalkeeper was unfortunate. He said: “Look, it’s a good strike from the lad, but we probably shouldn’t have given him as much space. It’s one of those. “It did take a slight deflection - we have had a good look back at the videos - and it went in like an absolute rocket, so that was frustrating.” However, McGeady saved the best for last and as the clock ticked into the 90th minute, he accepted another McCarthy pass, span and curled a delicious winner past substitute keeper Roin Kvashvadze, sparking mass celebrations both on the field and from the bench as O’Neill and assistant Roy Keane were handed the victory they so desperately wanted. Pride: Captain Robbie Keane leads Ireland out for their first Euro 2016 qualifier . Victory: Stephen Quinn challenges Jano Ananidze for the ball . Asked if he had ever seen McGeady produce a display of such quality, O’Shea said: 'To be fair, I have. It’s consistency now he will need to find and maintain that, and more game-time at Everton too will help contribute to that. 'But look, I have played with Aiden in the Irish team for a long, long time and in training up against him too. I know the quality he has got, so the more times we can get him on the ball in the final third - less so in our half, where he gives it away for fun! 'He is a top-drawer player. There are not many players in the world have that skill and finish to win the game for you.'","Aiden McGeady's double lead Martin O'Neill's men to a 2-1 victory .

"Cash-strapped France could sell the Mona Lisa to help pay off its vast national debt, the nation's media has suggested. The radical plan to put the world's best known painting on the market could 'make a dent' in the country's crippling £1,600billion deficit, state-run news channel France 24 said. The Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece hanging in the Louvre Museum in Paris is seen by up to a million visitors a year. Smiles better? Cash-strapped France could sell the Mona Lisa to help pay off its vast national debt, the nation's media has suggested . The painting is often called 'priceless' but was valued at £60million in 1962 for insurance purposes. But with inflation and a further surge in art prices taken into account, the 2014 value of the artwork could now be around £1.5billion  - or almost one per cent of national debt. The France 24 news website wrote: 'Her enigmatic smile beams down on hundreds of thousands of tourists a year at the Louvre Museum in Paris. 'And she could also bring a smile to France's cash-strapped government if a sale could ease the national debt.' Paris also has another 173 museums brimming with hugely valuable works of art, and a sale of the impressionists at the Musee d'Orsay alone would raise an estimated £3.5billion, the website said. Frame game: The Mona Lisa hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris and is seen by up to a million visitors a year . But selling off national treasures could be against the law because they they are owned by the public, it added. France 24 wrote: 'Article 451-5 of the French Heritage Code law governing national treasures stipulates that 'Collections held in museums that belong to public bodies are considered public property and cannot be otherwise'. 'Even a change in the law would be problematic, as most of France's cultural heritage has historically come from individual donors, who enjoy significant tax breaks in return for their generosity. 'They would have to be heavily compensated if their donated works were sold off.' But Paris City Hall's Head of Culture Bruno Julliard said he was against the controversial solution to help rescue France's floundering economy. He said: 'In theory a sale of the Mona Lisa would raise a very large sum of money. But France isn't yet in such dire economic straits.' Heavily-indebted Portugal is doing something similar by putting its state-owned collection of Miro paintings up for sale. It hopes to recuperate £29million  - a tiny fraction of its £168billion national debt. Meanwhile, France has been selling off what it can within the law, including the finest wines from the Elysee presidential palace cellar, and the former International Conference Centre near the Arc de Triomphe. The latter went to Qatari and Chinese buyers who spent 380 million pounds renovating the building to be reopened as the Peninsula Paris hotel, while private wine collectors have been buying up the finest vintages from the presidential cellars. There is, however, some light at the end of the tunnel for France's finances, because the country's descent down the World Economic Forum's league of economic strength has been arrested. After dropping for four consecutive years, France is clinging on to the No23 spot. The report said: 'The [French] government has promised a 'competitiveness shock' and is considering a number of business-friendly measures, including a simplification of administrative procedures, in order to revive growth and reduce the country's stubbornly high level of unemployment.' It added: 'Its infrastructure is still among the best in the world. France also obtains good marks for the quality and quantity of education at all levels, and it boasts a high degree of technological adoption.' Britain has climbed one spot to No9, the U.S is third, while Switzerland takes first place.","The Mona Lisa is said to be 'priceless' - but could be worth £1.5billion .

"An Iraqi oil tanker that disappeared from radar off the coast of Texas last week has suddenly reappeared today - and it's still full of $100million in crude. The United Kalavrvta is at the center of a legal and political battle over Iraq's oil wealth between the  Kurdish region in the north of the country and the central government in Baghdad. The tanker vanished from U.S. Coast Guard tracking systems on Thursday and is believed to have shut off its transponder. The ship, which has 1million barrels of crude oil aboard, reappeared on radar on Monday - in almost exactly the same spot where it was when it vanished. It's currently in the  Galveston Offshore Lightering Area, where large ships that can't fit in the Port of Galveston wait to be unloaded. As the disintegration of Iraq amid mounting violence continues, the semi-autonomous regime in Kurdistan is trying to cash in on Iraq's oil reserves and export its own crude. Oil tanker United Kalavyrta (also known as the United Kalavrvta), which is carrying a cargo of Kurdish crude oil, approaching Galveston, Texas on July 25. The boat disappeared from Coast Guard radar on Thursday . A still image from video taken by a U.S. Coast Guard HC-144 Ocean Sentry aircraft shows the oil tanker United Kalavyrta sitting in the Gulf of Mexico. It reappeared on radar on Monday . Iraqi Kurdistan has exported at least eight million barrels of oil since May, energy experts told Al Arabiya News. But the increasingly weak regime in Baghdad is trying to keep control of its oil billions and says the Kurdish regime cannot sell the oil in the U.S. The U.S. Coast Guard's AIS ship-tracking system showed no position for the United Kalavrvta on Thursday, which was carrying one million barrels - and was 95 per cent - when it went dark. The tanker was attempting to unload its cargo at sea, off the coast of Texas, after leaving the Turkish port of Ceyhan in June and anchoring near the U.S. port of Galveston in late July. The U.S. Coastguard confirmed to MailOnline today that the last contact the agency had with the United Kalavyrta was when the ship's certificate of compliance was completed on July 27. The vessel's disappearance was thought to be the latest development in a high-stakes dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds over the right to export oil. Several other tankers transporting disputed oil from Iran or Kurdistan have switched off their transponders before unloading their cargo - making their movements extremely difficult to track. A Coast Guard official told MailOnline today that the vessel might have turned off its beacon in the Gulf of Mexico, which it is not supposed to do. Legal dispute: The vessel's disappearance is thought to be the latest development in a high stakes argument between Baghdad and the Kurds over the right to export oil . The tanker Kamari, which had been carrying a partial load of crude oil from Iraqi Kurdistan turned off its satellite transponder on August 17, north of Egypt's Sinai. It reappeared unladen on August 19 about 30 kilometers off the coast of Israel, ship tracking data on Reuters showed last week. It was not possible to determine where the oil had been delivered to or who the buyer was. A spokesman for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Ministry of Natural Resources would not comment on the tanker's temporary disappearance at the time. Reuters reported on July 31 that tanker United Emblem, which was carrying more than 1 million barrels of Kurdish oil, had been offloaded into another tanker in the South China Sea. A senior executive at Marine Management Services confirmed in July that the ship-to-ship transfer involving the United Emblem took place in a 'legitimate operation'. The ship is 'fixed to a legitimate charterer and performing legitimate operations,' said Kostas Georgopoulos, the chartering manager at Marine Management Services . 'The ship is still in international waters,' he added. The agency has a HC-144 Ocean Sentry aircraft at its disposal which last took images of the  oil tanker United Kalavyrta on July 25. Only a few days ago, the partially-full Kamari tanker carrying Kurdish crude oil, disappeared from satellite tracking north of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Two days later, the empty vessel reappeared near Israel. In late July, the tanker United Emblem offloaded part of its cargo of Kurdish crude oil onto another ship in the South China Sea. The evasive behavior is the result of Baghdad wanting to block the Kurds from exporting the oil as they believe they have the exclusive right to do so. The Iraqi government in Baghdad has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court to reclaim control of the United Kalavrvta cargo and block the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) from delivering its cargo. The suit demonstrates that Baghdad is now stepping up their legal and diplomatic push to block Kurdistan's oil deals, which they view as smuggling. However, the Kurds see such deals as crucial to their own dreams of independence. On Monday, the U.S. court threw out the order  saying it lacked jurisdiction to seize the tanker as it disappeared some 60 miles off their coast. But the judge invited Iraq to re-plead its case over the cargo's rightful ownership. The issue is expected to fuel tensions between Washington and Baghdad, as in theory, Iraq can file claims against anyone taking delivery of the oil. A Coast Guard official said the vessel in the Gulf of Mexico might have turned off its beacon, sailed beyond antennas that monitor transponders, or perhaps some antennas might have been taken out of service. However, dozens of vessels were visible on Thursday in the Galveston Offshore Lightering Area, where the Kurdish tanker was last seen. The United Kalavrvta's disappearance is now thought to be the latest development in a high-stakes dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds over the right to export oil .","United Kalavrvta, carrying one million barrels, disappeared in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday .

"Workers at an Arizona firearms range desperately tried to save the life of their colleague who had been accidentally shot in the head by a nine-year-old girl. In a series of frantic 911 calls, friends of Charles Vacca battled to save his life by applying pressure to his head wound while urging dispatchers to send an emergency helicopter. While talking to the emergency services, one worker tries to reassure Vacci: 'Keep breathing brother... the helicopter is on its way.' Friends of Charles Vacca, pictured, tried to comfort the firearms instructor after he was accidentally shot . Former US army veteran Vacca, pictured, was instructing the young girl how to use the Uzi sub machine gun . Vacca was shot at the Last Stop gun range in White Sands, Arizona, about 60 miles outside Las Vegas . Although another can be clearly heard saying: 'I don't think he's going to make it.' The series of five 911 calls was released by the Mohave County Sheriff's Office who have determined that there should not be any criminal charges as a result of the tragedy. Vacca, 39, was shot dead at the Last Stop outdoor shooting range in White Hills, Arizona on August 25. During one call, the dispatcher is told that Vacca was unconscious and convulsing, but he was still breathing. Investigators do not believe that anyone will face criminal charges following last month's tragedy . A dispatcher urged callers to apply pressure to Vacca's wound while a man could be heard saying, 'Breathe, come on, Charlie.' Vacca was flown to a Las Vegas hospital where he died hours later. He was standing next to the girl from New Jersey when she squeezed the trigger and the recoil wrenched the Uzi upward toward his head. A lawyer speaking on behalf of the nine-year-old girl's parents said the entire family, who are from New Jersey, said they are devastated by what happened during their holiday. The shooting range is about 60 miles south of Las Vegas . The statement came as investigators released police reports and emergency call recordings involving the Aug. 25 shooting of instructor Charles Vacca at the Last Stop range in White Hills, Arizona, about 60 miles south of Las Vegas. The police reports name the child's parents as Alex Gen and Alison MacLachlan and don't list the couple's hometown. New Jersey-based lawyer Kevin Walsh said the family 'prayed day and night that (Vacca) would survive his injury, and they continue to pray for his family during this terribly difficult time.' The police reports say that immediately after the shooting, the girl said she felt the gun was too much for her and had hurt her shoulder. The young girl, pictured beside Charles Vacca, pulled the trigger before losing control of the weapon . Her family members were focused on the girl because they thought she was injured by the gun's recoil. It took several moments for people to realize that Vacca had been shot by the 9mm sub-machine gun. The family had taken a shuttle from Las Vegas to the range. After arriving, the girl, her parents, sister and brother took a monster truck ride before heading to the shooting range. The girl's father was the first one in the party to handle a weapon. After he fired shots, Vacca instructed the girl on how to shoot the gun, showed her a shooting stance, and helped her fire a few rounds, the reports state. He then stepped back and let her hold the Uzi by herself. She fired the gun, and its recoil wrenched the Uzi upward, killing Vacca with a shot to the head, according to the reports. The girl dropped the Uzi, and Vacca fell to the ground. The girl ran toward her family, who huddled around her as she held her shoulder. Charles Vacca, pictured, was airlifted to a hospital in Las Vegas where he died several hours after he was accidentally shot in the head by the nine-year-old girl . Another instructor rushed over to help to Vacca. The other children were then taken away from the range. Recordings of emergency calls show that people at the shooting range desperately tried to keep the unconscious Vacca alive as they urged police dispatchers to send a medical helicopter. A dispatcher urged callers to apply pressure to Vacca's wound. Vacca was flown to a Las Vegas hospital where he died hours later. Prosecutors are not filing charges in the case. Arizona's workplace safety agency is investigating the death. County prosecutors say the instructor was probably the most criminally negligent person involved in the accident for having allowed the child to hold the gun without enough training. They also said the parents and child weren't criminally culpable. The girl's mother had video-recorded the accident on her phone. 'All right, go ahead and give me one shot,' Vacca tells the girl in part of the video released by investigators. He then cheers when she fires one round at the target. 'All right full auto,' Vacca says. The video, which does not show Vacca being shot, ends with a series of shots being heard. Sam Scarmardo, the range's operator, has said the parents had signed waivers saying they understood the rules. He also said he never had a safety problem before at the range and his policy of allowing children eight and older to fire guns under adult supervision and an instructor's watchful eye is standard industry practice, though he noted his policies are under review. Vacca's ex-wife and children have said they harbor no ill feelings toward the girl or her family. Instead, they feel sorry for the child and want to comfort her.

"Looking uncannily like an Egyptian pyramid, it is not something you would expect to see on the surface of Mars. Nasa engineers were so intrigued by the unique, football sized rock, they have driven the Curiosity rover up to it for a closer rock. The football-size rock will be the first on Mars to be examined by rover's robotic arm . Scroll down for video . The mysterious 'pyramid' rock on Mars Nasa engineers want to take a closer at. It will be the first test for Curiosity's robot arm which contains several analysis instruments. Nasa has named the rock after the late . engineer Jacob Matijevic, who was the surface operations systems chief . engineer for Mars Science Laboratory and the project's Curiosity rover. He passed away on August 20th, at age 64. Matijevic also was a leading engineer for all of the previous NASA Mars rovers: Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity. Curiosity is about 8 feet (2.5 meters) from the rock. It lies about . halfway from the rover's landing site, Bradbury Landing, to a location . called Glenelg. The team plans to touch the rock with a . spectrometer to determine its elemental composition and use an . arm-mounted camera to take close-up photographs. Both the . arm-mounted Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer and the mast-mounted, . laser-zapping Chemistry and Camera Instrument will be used for . identifying elements in the rock. Nasa hopes this will give them a new insight into the structure of the red planet, and also allow cross-checking of the . two instruments. The rock has been named 'Jake Matijevic' after a Nasa employee who recently passed away. It has previously renamed the rover's landing site as 'Bradbury Landing' after the late sci-fi author ray Bradbury . Curiosity now has driven for six days in a row. Daily distances range from 72 feet to 121 feet (22 meters to 37 meters). 'This robot was built to rove, and the team is really getting a good rhythm of driving day after day when that's the priority,"" said Mars Science Laboratory Project Manager Richard Cook of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. The team plans to choose a rock in . the Glenelg area for the rover's first use of its capability to analyze . powder drilled from interiors of rocks. Three . types of terrain intersect in the Glenelg area -- one lighter-toned and . another more cratered than the terrain Curiosity currently is crossing. The light-toned area . is of special interest because it retains daytime heat long into the . night, suggesting an unusual composition. 'As . we're getting closer to the light-toned area, we see thin, dark bands . of unknown origin,' said Mars Science Laboratory Project Scientist John . Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. The route driven by NASA's Mars rover Curiosity since it landed on the Red Planet. The Glenelg area farther east is the mission's first major science destination. 'The smaller-scale diversity is becoming more evident as we get closer, providing more potential targets for investigation.' Researchers are using Curiosity's Mast Camera (Mastcam) to find potential targets on the ground. Recent new images from the rover's camera reveal dark streaks on rocks in the Glenelg area that have increased researchers' interest in the area. In addition to taking ground images, the camera also has been busy looking upward. On two recent days, Curiosity pointed the Mastcam at the sun and recorded images of Mars' two moons, Phobos and Deimos, passing in front of the sun from the rover's point of view. Results of these transit observations are part of a long-term study of changes in the moons' orbits. NASA's twin Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived at Mars in 2004, also have observed solar transits by Mars' moons. Opportunity is doing so again this week. This mosaic from the Mast Camera on NASA's Curiosity rover shows a close-up view looking toward the ""Glenelg"" area, where three different terrain types come together, and where Curiosity is headed. 'Phobos is in an orbit very slowly getting closer to Mars, and Deimos is in an orbit very slowly getting farther from Mars,' said Curiosity's science team co-investigator Mark Lemmon of Texas A&M University, College Station. 'These observations help us reduce uncertainty in calculations of the changes.' In Curiosity's observations of Phobos this week, the time when the edge of the moon began overlapping the disc of the sun was predictable to within a few seconds. Uncertainty in timing is because Mars' interior structure isn't fully understood. Phobos causes small changes to the shape of Mars in the same way Earth's moon raises tides. The changes to Mars' shape depend on the Martian interior which, in turn, cause Phobos' orbit to decay. Timing the orbital change more precisely provides information about Mars' interior structure. During Curiosity's two-year prime mission, researchers will use the rover's 10 science instruments to assess whether the selected field site inside Gale Crater ever has offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life.

"Snapchat has finally launched a set of location-specific photo filters revealed by MailOnline earlier this month. The ‘geofilters’ add a custom sticker to your photo, and are unlocked only when you're in a specific place or city. Experts say the firm could work with major brands to create custom stickers. Scroll down for video . A Snapchat user snaps a friend on the roof of The Getty art museum in Los Angeles and overlays a new geofilter to show where the snap was taken. The new smart filters don’t offer any photo-editing effects, and are clear filters with a graphic overlay. They look similar to they type of stickers that have been popularized by stand-alone photo editing applications. Snapchat users who use the service in Brooklyn are shown a clear filter with the word ‘Brooklyn’ written in an artistic font on the bottom, while those in New York's financial district get a special filter showing a shower of dollar bills. Users who use the service in Manhattan’s theater district receive a custom filter with the words ‘Broadway’ in yellow lights. The new smart filters don’t offer any photo-editing effects, and are clear filters with a graphic overlay. They look similar to they type of stickers that have been popularized by stand-alone photo editing applications. ‘Swipe right on the preview screen to check them out – they’ll change depending on which neighborhoods you’re in!’ the company wrote in a blog post and video announcing the new feature. The video features filters from several neighborhoods around their Venice Beach, CA headquarters, as well as filters for a specific Soul Cycle location, Disneyland, a coffee shop and cultural institutions like the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Getty. A Snapchat spokesperson told The Verge that ‘neither Disneyland, nor any of the other locations, paid to have their filter included in the app.’ Though, it’s easy to see how branded stickers and sponsored filters could become a potential revenue stream for the company, which isn’t currently making money, experts say. A Snapchat user in Malibu, California shares a playful snap of her toes in the wet sand. Snapchat recently unveiled 'geofilters', which add a custom sticker to your photo (pictured) and are unlocked only when you're in a specific place or city. Experts say the firm could work with major brands to create custom stickers . Snapchat debuted its first customized branded filter at Cannes Lions advertising festival just last month. The company partnered with a publisher to add a corporate logo to snaps taken at a party along with the phrase, ‘Yes we Cannes’. Brands such as Taco Bell and Rebecca Minkoff have sent out hundreds of snaps, and the ability to add their logo to Snapchat content could add extra legitimacy to their efforts. The geofilters already appear to be a hit with users of the service. ‘Super cute snapchat filters based on your location the future is now’ @juliacosette, a Snapchat user, tweeted. ‘What is this new snapchat filter. I like it.’ tweeted another user, @debzshin. Though the video only highlights geofilters in the Los Angeles area, the feature also appears to be enabled in New York. Enthusiastic Snapchat users in New York show off their custom filters featuring the word 'Brooklyn', when in Brooklyn,  and a sea of cash when pictures are taken near NYC's financial district. To enable new smart filters, update the app, go to the app’s settings menu, scroll down to ‘Additional Services’ and click ‘Manage’. Once there, ensure that you have the ‘Filters’ setting switched to ‘on’ and that you’ve given the app permission to pull your location. For instance, Snapchat users who use the service in Brooklyn are shown a clear filter with the word ‘Brooklyn’ written in an artistic font on the bottom, while those in New York's financial district get a special filter showing a shower of dollar bills. Users who use the service in Manhattan’s theater district receive a custom filter with the words ‘Broadway’ in yellow lights. Other users have received customized filters around events such as Gay Pride. Snapchat even released a custom filter for rival Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, CA. It shows Snapchat's familiar ghost logo pointing its finger and laughing. Facebook famously tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion in cash last year before being turned down by Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel. 'Hilarious Snapchat secret filter unlocked at Facebook HQ' an Instagram user posted last month. Last December, Snapchat released its first major update when it added its first line of filters along with a ‘replay’ function. In May, Snapchat unveiled its own in-app instant messaging and video chat service. Earlier this month, the company announced it was testing a new group-sharing feature for concerts and live events called Our Story. Both Apple and Facebook have released similar ephemeral messaging services in attempt to capitalize on Snapchat's runaway success. Facebook released Slingshot, its own service for sending self-destructing messages to friends in mid-June. Apple also added the ability to send self-destructing audio and video messages via iMessage. The company is based in Los Angeles and is run by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, two former fraternity brothers at Stanford. The service was first released in 2011 and quickly gained a following among high school students in Southern California. The company does not reveal the number of people currently using its service, but says more than 700 million messages are sent each day.","Users can only 'unlock' the filters in certain geographic locations .

"Jonnie Peacock's mum Linda is welling up with tears when the Paralympic athlete starts to talk about his meeting with David Beckham. ‘This is the second best day of my life,’ he admitted at the launch of Sainsbury’s Show Your Support campaign for the 2014 School Games. And the first? ‘Meeting David Beckham for the first time.’ Beckham does that to people, inspiring them with his presence and giving them the motivation to go on to achieve great things. Then: David Beckham meets the seven-year-old Jonnie Peacock during Euro 2000 . Now: Peacock and his mother Linda pose with Beckham again, 14 years on, having become a star athlete . Peacock did that after he met Beckham when he was seven, two years after his right leg was amputated just below the knee after he contracted meningitis. ‘I went to Euro 2000 with my mum soon after I lost my leg and it was a dream come true to meet David Beckham,’ said Peacock, who won gold in the 100 metres at the London 2012 Paralympics. ‘He pulled out a training top, signed it and I still have it today. It’s probably what made me sport mad. ‘It gave me so much confidence. I had just lost my leg, kids get a bit of bullying and that half an hour with David Beckham will stay with me for the rest of my life. 'Just the fact he went into that training bag and pulled out his T-shirt. It might be just a small token from him but for me it was such a huge moment. Golden boy: Peacock celebrates after winning the 100m T44 final at London 2012 to take gold . Inspiration: Peacock said that meeting the England star as a youngster motivated him to get into sport . ‘Thinking “Oh my god this guy has just given me his training top, how amazing is that”. Women from down the road were queuing up just to sniff it. I was charging to smell the T-shirt!’ Beckham insists that his parents gave him the grounding, telling him to be polite and mild-mannered as he made his way through life as a professional footballer. ‘My parents instilled it into me,’ he admitted. ‘How inspiring is Jonnie’s story? Whenever I talk to kids I tell them about my experiences, how I wanted to play for my country. 'I had to work hard because it didn’t always look like I was going to be a person who would go on to be an England captain and to be an ambassador for my country in many different ways.’ Future stars: Beckham and Peacock meet Sainsbury's Active Kids ambassadors . Passing it on: Peacock says he is trying to have a similar impact on the next generation of athletes . Peacock’s career took off at the Sainsbury’s School Games, which sees about 1,600 11 to 17-year-olds competing over four days in Manchester this weekend. He added: ‘That’s something I like to try to do for people now — after the European championships the other week, I was just getting my medal and this kid wanted my numbers. ‘I couldn’t get it off so I gave him the whole shirt. For him that might be something similar. It’s a big thing for him.’ David Beckham and Jonnie Peacock were taking part in a special motivational session for young athletes competing at this weekend’s Sainsbury’s School Games. Sainsbury’s is committed to helping young people lead healthier, more active lifestyles and has pledged to encourage over 20 million children to enjoy physical activity by 2020.

"At times last week it seemed some were ready to award Chelsea the Premier League title on the back on a 3-1 win at Burnley. And though in the end they did re-discover some of that momentum on Saturday, the over-riding lesson of their victory over Leicester was the stark reminder that Chelsea’s season will be a degree tougher in the long run and that they still struggle against well-organised teams. True, they won comfortably enough in the end with goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. And they could even afford a carnival moment towards the end, with Didier Drogba coming on, a hero returning to his natural home, on 79 minutes. Joy: Diego Costa runs off in celebration after breaking the deadlock for Chelsea against Leicester City on his home Premier League debut in a 2-0 win . At the double: Chelsea winger Eden Hazard made the game comfortable with a strike from the edge of the area in the 77th-minute to break Leicester City hearts . Finish: Diego Costa slots the ball past Kasper Schmeichel in the Leicester City goal to put Chelsea 1-0 up after 62 minutes at Stamford Bridge .

Yet though all ended happily, Chelsea laboured incredibly to get ahead in the first place. They were truly abject in the first half, languid and one paced, lacking both tempo and creativity, just as they had been for many games last season. Mourinho disappeared down the tunnel a good three minutes before half time to prepare his team talk. Judging by his team’s response in the second half, their manager had let them know quite how bad it was, though somewhat bizarrely the coach seemed to think the weather - cool and breezy for the time of year - was partly to blame. ‘We have lots of work to do,’ said Mourinho afterwards. ‘Our first half showed clearly that we have to improve. This week I trained at 3 o’clock because I was expecting this, as it’s not the best weather to play football, because you get a bit lazy. But I was unsuccessful in that because the team was lazy in the first half, which I didn’t like. But in the second half everything improved and they showed that they wanted it. ‘I think the weather makes players lazy, lose a bit of tension and sharpness in the body and after that you pass slow you move slow and you don’t react to the second balls and by the time you wake up it’s half time . ‘At half time we had to be a little bit emotional with them and make them realise we were at risk,’ said Mourinho. ‘I wasn’t annoyed but I told them that if you have the same feeling I have we’re not in trouble, we will change. But if you don’t we’re in trouble. I think they understood. It’s important not to lose points against teams that normally you would beat.’ It wasn’t simply that Leicester set up well and frustrated Chelsea. Dean Hammond was the most dominant presence in the midfield in the first half while Riyad Mahrez was always lively and indeed produced the first shot on target of the game on 35 minutes, which Thibaut Courtois got down well to save. ‘I’m proud but disappointed,’ said Leicester manager Nigel Pearson afterwards. ‘I’m disappointed we weren’t able to to convert an encouraging performance into a reward with points. The good thing is we created chances throughout the game. We played well but as always it will be about how efficient we are in both penalty areas.’ Frustration: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho stands with his arms out-stretched as he watches on during the match against Leicester City at Stamford Bridge .

Where Fabregas had thrilled on Monday, in the opening 45 minutes he looked as ineffective as his midfield partner Nemanja Matic. Oscar offered little more. Costa felt the sharp end of his manager’s tongue at one stage and Hazard had reverted to type, leaving Cesar Azpilicueta to deal alone with the frequent incursions of Mahrez. Half time did indeed prove pivotal. All of the above improved considerably and within minutes of the re-start Oscar had hit the post with a shot from outside the box and Kasper Schmeichel had pulled off an excellent save by pushing wide a Branislav Ivanovic header. Yet Chelsea were also more open at the back and Courtois was called upon when Hammond played in David Nugent, who forced the Belgian into a fine save with his right leg on 52 minutes. And Nugent had an even better chance when put clean through by Mahrez on 55 minutes, Courtois again being forced to save with an out-stretched leg. Passion: The Chelsea players embrace Costa in the corner of the pitch after the striker put the Blues 1-0 ahead against Leicester City at Stamford Bridge .

Grateful: Costa (left), who put Chelsea ahead, is congratulated by manager Jose Mourinho as he is substituted for Drogba after 80 minutes . Schmeichel then got a decisive touch to a lovely Fabregas chip on 57 minutes but Costa finally made the breakthrough, when Oscar played a lovely through ball for Ivanovic on 63 minutes. The Chelsea right back managed to take out two defenders with a neat turn and cross for the Brazilian-born striker, who was making his home debut. His chest down looked heavy, but the ball fell kindly and he swept it in past Schmeichel from close range. Having finally breached Leicester, Chelsea would never again look uncomfortable. And when Fabregas played in Hazard on 77 minutes, the Belgian simply cut inside his man and shot past Schmeichel for 2-0. The game safe, there was time for that a sentimental moment with Drogba, after two years away, coming on to a hero’s welcome. High in the stands, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich beamed – a change from his usual default scowl – and wildly clapped his hands above his head in delight. Never have we seen the Russian quite so animated. Safe to say, his mood had changed somewhat from the opening 45 minutes.

"It was business as usual for Leo Messi as he scored a double on the first day of the season for the fourth consecutive campaign. Barcelona won their first game 3-0 against Elche despite Javier Mascherano’s red card just before the break. Messi’s characteristic brace was achieved without the suspended Luis Suarez and the injured Neymar but he had more than enough help from Madrid born youngster Munir El Hadaddi. The young striker will not be 19 until September 1 but already has Barça fans predicting a big future – if he can stay in the side when Neymar and Suarez return. Barcelona have now scored 26 goals in their last six opening matches and not since 2008 have they been beaten on the opening day. That front three of Munir, Rafinha and Messi was a clean sweep for the club’s La Masia youth academy as Barcelona kicked-off the season with the entire bench and six of the starters products of its youth system.

You could win £1,000 every week - more than enough to fly out to Barcelona to watch Lionel Messi live! Enjoy the rest of your evening. The referee blows the final whistle and it means Barcelona open up with a win. They are also top of the league - if that's the sort of thing you read in to at this time of the season. Can Messi get his hat-trick? No probably not - as Barcelona don't look too bothered now. We can hope though. It's been a fine performance from Barcelona tonight - and the fans are recognising that by chanting Luis Enrique's name again. Unsurprisingly Messi has been brilliant - but so have debutants Munir and Ivan Rakitic. This team could take a lot of stopping this season. They have turned it down a notch now though - back into first gear for the Catalans as they see out the final minutes of the game. Adrian comes on for Pasalic. Sergio Roberto comes on to replace tonight's Barcelona captain Andres Iniesta. Lionel Messi takes the armband. It's gone a little quiet here at the Nou Camp - substitute Pedro has the best chance since Messi's second goal but he is denied by the excellent Tyton. During this lull - here's a video of the earlier 'cat' incident: . Scorer of the second goal, Munir, gets a standing ovation from the Nou Camp crowd after a brilliant debut that was capped with that great finish to tie things up at the beginning of the second half. The 68,105-strong Catalan crowd think they've seen their next big star - and who's to argue with them after that? Think the World Cup would leave Messi tired? You thought wrong. This time he beats three defenders - one of them twice - and slots the ball into the corner of the net. He latched on to Dani Alves' pass inside the area and didn't look to be posing too much of a threat until some trademark close-control took him away from multiple markers and opening up the opportunity for Messi to find the corner. Brilliant goal. Pasalic impedes Iniesta on the half-way line and goes into the referee's book. They're not throwing players forward at will anymore but Barcelona are still creating chances. Tyton flies off his line to deny Munir with his feet after Messi plays him in on goal. In fairness to the young forward the ball was stuck under his feet and he was left with little chance to finish. Jose Angel comes off with Alvaro replacing him. That second goal from Munir has effectively sewn up this game in Barcelona's favour. Now they seem happy to sit on it and keep possession - and even with 10 men they're managing that with ease. Claudio Bravo still left looking for anything to do... Two debutants combine to double the lead as the second half begins! Ivan Rakitic play in Munir with a brilliantly crafted chip and the youngster confidently fires home with a brilliant improvised finish. That should be this win sorted for Barca. Top quality all-round. Barcelona might have a new manager in Luis Enrique but this is very much the same from them. 80% possession, Messi on the scoresheet and looking shaky at the back - just like old times! What a last five minutes of that half - Lionel Messi opened the scoring as he made the pressure pay but then Javier Mascherano was sent off for bringing down Garry Rodrigues when he was through on goal on Elche's only real attack. Aside from that, the half has seen Munir El Haddadi and Andres Iniesta hit the bar - and the real star of the show: a black cat pitch invader. That changed quickly - Garry Rodrigues somehow finds himself through on goal for the so-far blunt Elche attack and Javier Mascherano drags him down as the last man. Referee Fernando Teixeira Vitienes had no hesitation in bringing out the red even as Mascherano pleaded his innocence. Professional foul - correct decision and Barca are down to 10. That should make this game a bit more interesting. The defenders can only stand and stare as Barcelona's little maestro produces a perfect first touch and runs past three of them before confidently finishing . Five years in a row he has scored on the opening night of La Liga. Easy does it. Messi plays a brilliant slide-rule ball through to Munir. He's in a great position to shoot but perhaps the 18-year-old's inexperience showed as the tried to square it to a non-existent team-mate. From a clever Ivan Rakitic free-kick Dani Alves, sporting a questionable new bob haircut, comes from deep to strike at goal. It goes just wide with Tyton stranded. 79% possession for Barca so far. Barca are getting closer and closer. Messi links up with the Spanish playmaker again and he crashes a left-footed strike from range against Tyton's crossbar. Beautiful play from the Barcelona star men. They exchange successive one-twos which bring them to the edge of the area including a couple of backheels but are eventually crowded out by the packed Elche defence. This kid is good... Debutant Munir al Habbadi latches on to Andres Iniesta's pass, turns and instinctively shoots from just inside the area, but he hits the woodwork. A brilliant effort. Barca are getting closer. What's that? You want more pictures of the cat? Oh, ok then. The Catalans are already camped deep in Elche territory tonight - and Lionel Messi is dropping deep to find the gaps that could open up their defence. Eventually they make it into the Barca half a couple of times but they're heavily outnumbered. Claudio Bravo hasn't even touched the ball yet. Luis Enrique is taking charge of his first game having previously played for Barca and after working with their youth academy. The Nou Camp crowd sing his name. Messi is playing provider here and he picks out Dani Alves' run to play him in on goal. Elche's new keeper Tyton comes out to deny him but brings down the Brazilian. Difficult decision made easier by the fact Alves was offside. Barcelona have started strong - they look sharp and we've barely seen a misplaced pass so far. With almost 10 minutes on the clock Lionel Messi goes scampering down the right wing and a brilliant turn takes him into the box before he eventually opts for a cross that doesn't quite meet the intended target. After the cat is eventually caught the ball can come into play. Barca keeping possession early on - although is that really news? There's a black cat doing the rounds of the Nou Camp pitch. Play has to stop and the cat keeps running on and off - stewards in pursuit but they can't get it into their clutches... But then a man in a fluorescent jacket comes to the rescue, but ends up dropping the cat off the pitch. So, so strange. I hope Barcelona aren't superstitious.... Here we go. Elche kick us off. Elche just about survived in La Liga last season following promotion from the Segunda division, eventually finishing just above the relegation zone in 16th. This summer saw them lose their best player, Carlos Sanchez - now of Aston Villa - but they have made some additions including the earlier-mentioned Pasalic and former Juventus winger Milos Krasic - although he misses out tonight. The club have big financial problems and are fifth favourites to go down this season. It could be a long night for Elche and their manager Fran Escriba. Chelsea loanee Mario Pasalic starts for the visitors in midfield tonight in a understandably defence-focused 5-4-1 formation. Want to know more about Pasalic? Check out Laurie Whitwell's profile of the 'next Frank Lampard' here. Six of Barcelona's first line-up of new season homegrown including the entire front three: Messi Munir and Rafinha. You might have heard the names of Bravo, Mathieu and Rakitic mentioned this summer but 'Munir' is a fairly unfamiliar name on that Barcelona team-sheet. It is in fact Munir El Haddadi - another of Barca's youth academy products. An 18-year-old Spanish forward, Munir is one of Europe's hottest properties and scored a wondergoal for Barca's Under-19 side in the final of his age group's equivalent of the Champions League final. Check it out below. Luis Enrique gives out four full debuts at the Nou Camp in a much changed Barcelona side. Gone are the likes of Xavi (benched) and Carlos Puyol (retired) and in come the new boys.

"A group of footballers suspected of being involved in match-fixing are playing at English clubs with the knowledge of the Football Association, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Following a lengthy investigation by this newspaper into alleged fixing in the Conference South in the 2012-13 season, and into subsequent match-fixing in Australia, top officials from the FA have admitted for the first time they have a ‘watch list’ of active players ‘of interest’ who, for various reasons, they cannot prevent playing. More than a dozen alleged fixers could be playing in England, according to law enforcement and football integrity sources. The FA will not put a figure on the number. In court: Wilson Maj Perumal watches on as he is tried for match fixing in Finland in 2011 . The players involved are at clubs in the lower reaches of the Football League and in non-League football, yet their CVs show that their former employers range from leading London Premier League clubs to smaller sides across the south. None of the those on the watch list can be named for legal reasons; not one has been charged or convicted with any fixing offence, hence the FA’s inability to stop them playing. In some cases, players were involved in games in England where betting and other evidence indicated fixing. A criminal investigation remains possible. Others have been sought by police elsewhere on fixing-related matters but left for England before they could be questioned. Watched: Krishna Ganeshan (left) and Chann Sankaran (right), pictured whilst under surveillance . Asked to confirm the existence of the watch list, the FA’s head of football integrity, David Newton, told The Mail on Sunday in an exclusive interview: ‘It’s safe to say we have procedures in place to manage those sorts of issues. Ringleader: Gerry Subramaniam, involved in the global match-fixing scam involving players at the Southern Stars Football Club . 'We also have the ability within our rules, but only under certain circumstances, to interim suspend players where we believe a sufficient case can be made that they have been in breach of the integrity rules.’ Indeed, it is understood several players have been suspended but the FA will not confirm how many. Watch list players who are not suspended have effectively been put on notice that their activities are being monitored. Newton said: ‘In the event that we believe somebody is connected in some way [to fixing] we may remind them of their responsibilities. ‘We can seek various written confirmations from them that they have nothing they wish to share with us in terms of breaches of our rules or those of any other body or international association, and they will inform us the minute they do become aware of anything.’ Fears of systematic fixing in England were raised in March last year when the FA announced they had warned Conference South clubs about their ‘responsibilities’, after abnormal betting patterns. The FA received a document of about 60 pages, detailing ‘suspicious’ matches, specific irregular wagers linked to incidents — and the names of players under suspicion. Betting companies as well as specialist monitoring agents are among those giving the FA such information. Bookmakers stopped taking bets on matches featuring Billericay Town, AFC Hornchurch and Chelmsford, and other clubs were under scrutiny. The FA liaised with the Gambling Commission, and tried but failed to get a police force involved in the case. Low-level suspected fixing was not a police priority at that time. Scandal: Southern Star soccer players Reiss Noel (centre) and Joe Woolley (right) leave court in Melbourne . The FA stopped short of starting any investigation of their own. No player or official at any club was questioned. This led to the FA being lambasted by, among others, their own former compliance chief Graham Bean, their former chairman, Lord Triesman, and the chairmen of several clubs linked to ‘dodgy’ matches. Bean said the FA had been guilty of a ‘dereliction of duty’ in not investigating. Triesman said he was ‘astonished’ nobody had been questioned, insisting it was the FA’s ‘duty’ to do so. What happened next raised real concerns that not only had there been malpractice in the Conference, but probably systematic fixing by a major Asian crime syndicate. Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan . British citizen of Sri Lankan heritage who was jailed in June for five years for a conspiracy to fix matches played in England in November 2013. Former long-term resident of north London, near Wembley, and latterly Hastings, he was also involved in fixing syndicate working in Australia last year. Chann Sankaran . Convicted and jailed along with Sanjey Ganeshan of conspiracy to commit bribery relating to matches in November 2013. Gerry Subramanlam . Jailed for ringleader role in Aussie fixing and linked to Wilson Raj Perumal and Sanjey Ganeshan. Wilson Raj Perumal . Singaporean match-fixer, responsible for hundreds of fixed matches around the world at club and international level. Lived in north London near Wembley in the past. Conference South 2012-13 . FA made public announcement in March 2013, reminding 22 clubs of ‘responsibilities’ after suspicious betting patterns, and a dossier from experts identified clubs, games and players believed to be involved in match manipulation. No investigation after police declined to get involved. Victoria League, Australia . The biggest fixing scandal in Australian history unfolded a year ago at Southern Stars FC in Melbourne. Convictions have been secured for a group of fixers controlled by a Singapore-based syndicate, including four English players, all former Conference South players. Various matches in England, Nov 2013 . Sanjey Ganeshan and associate Chann Sankaran, a Singaporean fixer, were jailed in June 2014 at Birmingham Crown Court after being found guilty of a conspiracy to commit bribery in a case that centred on English football matches played in November 2013. Both men got five years. Up to a dozen players who played in that tainted 2012-13 Conference South season, all associated to a UK-based organiser for Asian fixers — Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan — were recruited by him to play at regional level in Australia. Four players, all English, have since been convicted of match-fixing while at a Melbourne club, Southern Stars, and have been banned from football for life. Jailed: Krishna Ganeshan after being found guilty of conspiring to fix English football matches . Ganeshan was jailed in June for five years at Birmingham Crown Court for conspiracy to fix English matches played in November 2013 — matches entirely unrelated to either the season before or Australia. ‘It seems pretty clear now that there was match manipulation in England in the 2012-13 season, and it went uninvestigated, and some of those involved went on to be involved in Australia, including Ganeshan,’ said one veteran police source. ‘People got away with stuff in England. Some also got away with it in Australia. I’m sure the FA have an idea who they are.’ Football’s integrity ‘landscape’ has changed dramatically in England even since March 2013. The National Crime Agency (NCA), a new law enforcement agency with the appetite and power to go after fixers, has come into existence. It became fully operational in October 2013. It was an NCA investigation, prompted by investigative newspaper work, that led to the imprisonment of Ganeshan and two associates. The NCA continue to probe other alleged fixing, and receive support from the FA. Nobody at the FA will publicly blame police inertia before the NCA was established for the lack of investigation into the suspected 2012-13 fixing. But Darren Bailey, the FA’s director of governance and regulation, said: ‘These matters are now treated with the utmost seriousness by all the relevant agencies. We’re a lot happier in relation to the manner in which these matters are dealt with now.’ The significant words are ‘now’ and ‘all the relevant agencies’. In relation to the 2012-13 season, Bailey said the FA followed every procedure they were supposed to, and could not simply start banging on doors to find answers in case they compromised a subsequent formal criminal investigation by police. Guilty: Woolley (left) was fined £675 and Noel (right) was fined £1,126 after they pleaded guilty to fixing . ‘It’s not like in the old days when you can go in like the Sweeney and just interview some person,’ he said. As well as being an FA director, Bailey is also a key figure in a ‘tripartite organisation’ — comprised of sports bodies, the betting industry and the police — that meets regularly to share information and discuss strategy. Like the NCA, it is relatively new, and aims to tackle corruption. ‘We cannot do it as a sport on our own,’ said Bailey. ‘We have limited power, (only) over our participants. We don’t necessarily have all of the investigative powers that other bodies have. So we do need their assistance.’ On the issue of whether the law may catch up with past fixers who are still at liberty, perhaps even playing while on the watch list, FA integrity chief Newton added: ‘We’re not saying there is a big line under any case.’","More than a dozen alleged fixers could be playing in England, according to law enforcement and football integrity sources .

"A dethroned Burmese beauty queen has refused to return her $100,000 jewelled tiara until organisers of the pageant apologise for calling her 'a liar and a thief'. May Myat Noe allegedly disappeared with the tiara after she was dethroned as the 2014 Miss Asia Pacific World winner for 'being rude'. But at a press conference today the 18-year-old insisted she had done nothing wrong and denied accepting breast implants free of charge, as claimed by David Kim, the director of media for the South Korea-based pageant. Scroll down for videos . Dethroned beauty queen May Myat Noe, of Burma, has refused to return her $100,000 jewelled tiara until organisers of the pageant apologise for calling her 'a liar and a thief' The 18-year-old insisted she had done nothing wrong when she appeared at a press conference today . Mr Kim had said organisers wanted her to have breast enhancement surgery before they could get her a record deal. He had said the teenager was stripped of her title because she was dishonest and unappreciative - and because she ran off with her bejewelled tiara. Miss Noe however has said that she boarded a plane for Burma without realising she had been dethroned. Mr Kim had said Miss Noe had been a disappointment from the outset. Following her victory, the organisers and sponsors wanted the 5ft 7in pageant winner to change her looks so she could become a singer. Mr Kim said: 'We thought she should be more beautiful ... so as soon as she arrived we sent her to the hospital to operate on her breasts.'

May Myat Noe (right) winner of the 2014 Miss Asia Pacific World, walks with her mother San San Htwe for a press conference while carrying her crown that she allegedly ran away with . Adding that the competition's sponsors paid £6,000 for her breast enhancement, Mr Kim said: 'It's our responsibility. 'If she has no good nose, then maybe, if she likes, we can operate on her nose. If it's breasts, then breasts.' The pageant organisers had said they also paid for a 10-day trip for her and her mother to Seoul, South Korea, but that quickly turned into three months, incurring extra cost. She 'lied' and 'never had respect for the main organisation, the national director, the manager, media or fans who made her the winner,' organisers said in a statement. Burmese model May Myat Noe, 18, was crowned winner of Miss Asia Pacific in May but has been dethroned . Miss Noe's picture has been taken down off the competition's website and it says 'dethroned' next to her name . Miss Noe was given a flight back to Burmese capital Rangoon, but did not show up, with Malaysian news sites reporting that she got on an earlier plane. The pageant organisers have been demanding she hand back the jewel-encrusted Swarovski tiara - worth between £60,000 and £120,000. Mr Kim said: 'Everyone knows she is no longer the queen, but she thinks as long as she keeps this crown she's the winner. She's not.' Her picture has been taken down off the competition's website and it says 'dethroned' next to her name. British model Amy Willerton took part in Miss Asia Pacific in 2011, but chose to leave the competition early . Hla Nu Tun, who initially acted as her unofficial manager, has said Miss Noe and the organisers had disagreed over who should oversee her career. Miss Noe's mother wanted control but so did the organisers, she said. Burma, which only recently emerged from a half-century military rule and self-imposed isolation, started sending contestants to international beauty pageants for the first time in decades in 2012. British model Amy Willerton took part in Miss Asia Pacific in 2011, but left the competition early, labelling it 'a shambles'.","May Myat Noe, 18, was dethroned for 'lying' to pageant managers .

"It is hard to believe it is 10 years since Wayne Rooney signed for Manchester United. Ten years since that first whispered press conference with partner Colleen sitting shyly in a corner of the room. Ten years since that explosive debut hat-trick against Fenerbahce in the Champions League. Rooney has achieved much with his club and many ambitions have been satisfied. At home in the Cheshire commuter belt, he has five Premier League medals and one from the Champions League. Now he is captain at Old Trafford and his country’s new leader, too. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: Rooney must be a captain off the pitch too . Heat is on: Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney toils at Turf Moor during the 0-0 draw with Burnley . Decade: Wayne Rooney (right) signed for Manchester United for £25million from Everton in August 2004 . Signed: August 31, 2004 . Fee: £25million (from Everton) Debut: Manchester United 6-2 Fenerbahce (September 28, 2004) Appearances: 444 . Goals: 218 . Yellow Cards: 82 . Red Cards: 2 . Major Trophies: Premier League (5), UEFA Champions League (1), FIFA Club World Cup (1), League Cup (2) Undoubtedly, though, Rooney’s career with United now stands at something of a crossroads. It is time for phase two, time to show that he is capable of surviving and thriving in a Louis van Gaal team that looks to be set up perfectly for him. When Rooney signed his new United contract last autumn, he was given assurances about transfers. Almost a year on, he finds himself playing in a United team featuring players such as Juan Mata and Angel Di Maria. No longer does Rooney have to waste energy scurrying across the field in search of possession. No longer does he need to drop deep looking for the ball, looking for momentum. Once again he is a centre forward in the truest sense of the term. First day: Rooney with partner Colleen and Sir Alex Ferguson on the day he signed for Manchester United . Decorated: Rooney has won five Premier League titles, one Champions League trophy and two League Cups . The identity crisis that sometimes seemed to overcome him during the later Sir Alex Ferguson years should, by rights, be no more. As such the responsibility to show that he is still worth the £250,000-a-week salary, worth the armband, is now his. On Saturday at Turf Moor, Rooney looked the part, physically at least. As the players emerged from a tunnel hardly wide enough to stand side by side, the 28-year-old looked as lean as he ever has. His performance, though, was modest and fitful. At the end of the game, it was hard to remember him being on the end of an opportunity. This says much about United’s performance. Despite promising work from Di Maria on his debut, Van Gaal’s team didn’t function effectively as an attacking unit. Showcase: It's time for Rooney to show that he is capable of surviving and thriving in a Louis van Gaal team . Arrival: Rooney moved to Old Trafford as a talented teenager but is now 28 and needs to lead from the front . Rooney, though, has a responsibility to lead now. He has always been a talismanic figure for United, often inspiring successful United teams with his hard work but also with moments of genuine quality and inspiration. At Turf Moor he wasn’t able to do that. At his best, Rooney is a wonderfully instinctive footballer. On Saturday, though, he was unable to find the sureness of touch, the right pass, or the yard of space he needed in which to work. There was one fine pass to Di Maria in the second half that gave the Argentinian a sniff of a chance on his left foot and, later, there was a clever bit of movement at the far post that allowed him time to head down towards the bottom corner. Skipper: Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has made Wayne Rooney his club's captain this season . That effort only found the side netting, though. Unfortunately, there was not much more. Asked about his new captain on Friday, Van Gaal revealed he had chosen him because of the way he impressed him during the pre-season period. Yet the United boss said he needs to see proof he was right. ‘I think he is ready for it but the future shall confirm that or not,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I cannot predict that but my opinion at the moment is that he shall be a great captain for Manchester United.’ Rooney moved to Manchester United on deadline day in the summer transfer window of 2004 for £25million from boyhood club Everton. The transfer was a protracted affair. The young striker was pictured with a T-shirt with the message 'Once a Blue, Always a Blue' on it before heading to Euro 2004 with England. The Merseysider starred for the Three Lions but was injured in the quarter-final as England were eliminated by Portugal. He returned to the country amid much fanfare and became the subject of a bid by Newcastle United. Newcastle's interest sparked United into action and they upped their efforts to sign Rooney. Sir Alex Ferguson wrote in his autobiography how Everton chairman Bill Kenwright weeped in his office, declaring 'they're stealing our boy, they're stealing our boy', when United pipped the Magpies to his signature on deadline day. Here, Sportsmail looks at some of the highs and lows of Rooney's Manchester United career. HIGHS . Hat-trick on debut against Fenerbahce (September 28, 2004) Rooney began paying back his hefty fee instantly. His injury hangover from the Euros had ensured he did not make his Manchester United debut until September. But as soon as Rooney pulled on a Red shirt he looked at home. A magnificent hat-trick and an assist in his first game at Old Trafford. Not a bad way to introduce yourself... Perfect start: Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick on his Manchester United debut against Fenerbahce . Named Manchester United captain by Louis van Gaal (August 2014) When Louis van Gaal announced that he was making Rooney his captain, the striker declared it as an 'honour'. Rooney's reign as skipper has not started well but he seems invigorated by the challenge and responsibility of leading from the front and is overjoyed to have been given the role. Leader: Rooney was given the United captain's armband by manager Louis van Gaal in August 2014 . Lifting the Champions League trophy (May 21, 2008) A day that Rooney will never forget. The striker started United's victory on penalties over Chelsea in the first-ever all-English Champions League final and lifted the trophy after the match. Glory: Rooney (second left) was part of the team who beat Chelsea to win the Champions League in 2008 . THAT overhead kick against Manchester City (February 12, 2011) This is the moment that anyone who witnessed it will always remember Wayne Rooney for. With the score tied at 1-1 at Old Trafford and just 12 minutes remaining on the clock, Rooney produced a moment of inspiration that won this Manchester derby. Nani's crossed was deflected and looped behind Rooney, who shifted his body around before producing a magnificent overhead kick into the back of the net to win the match. Simply sensational. Sublime: Rooney scored a magnificent overhead to win the derby match against Manchester City in 2011 . Arms aloft: Rooney ran to the corner to celebrate his spectacular strike against rivals Manchester City . First Premier League title (May 2007) The England striker netted 14 times during the 2006-07 season as he collected his first Premier League title at United. First of many: Rooney claimed his first Premier League title in 2007, scoring 14 goals in the process . LOWS . Striker requests to leave United due to lack of club's ambition (October 2010) In a press conference in October 2010, Sir Alex Ferguson revealed that Rooney had asked to leave the club following an argument over the extent of the striker's ankle injury. Rooney's representatives insisted he wanted to leave the club due to their lack of ambition and not for financial gain. The striker made a dramatic U-turn just weeks later, however, and signed a massive five-year contract with the Red Devils. Wantaway: Rooney declared his desire to leave due to United's lack of ambition, and not for money, in 2011 . Suspended by FA for swearing into TV camera (April 2011) After scoring a hat-trick at Upton Park against West Ham United, Rooney ran to the corner and swore into a television camera in celebration. The striker was handed a two-match ban by the FA and fined as a result. X-rated: Rooney was suspended by the FA for two matches after swearing into a TV camera at Upton Park . Rooney hands in transfer request (May 12, 2013) Following Sir Alex Ferguson's last day in charge of United, the Scot announced that Rooney had demanded a transfer. Jose Mourinho, having returned as manager of Chelsea, attempted to lure the England striker to Stamford Bridge over the close season and eventually Rooney signed a new bumper contract at United worth £250,000-a-week. Time to go: Despite winning the title with United in 2013, Rooney handed in a transfer request . Losing the title on last day of season to bitter rivals Manchester City (May 13, 2012) United went into the last day of the season behind rivals City on goal difference. They headed to Sunderland and claimed a 1-0 victory and waited to see the result from the Etihad Stadium. City were behind with just minutes remaining before Edin Dzeko bagged an equaliser and then Sergio Aguero netted the winner in the 94th minute to break Rooney and United hearts.

"It is the most expensive - and many would argue delicious - part of a sushi menu. But one man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm. The Chinese man had gone to his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin. To his horror, scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish. Scroll down for video . One man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm . The Chinese man had seen his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin. Scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm parasites after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish . Humans contract tapeworm infections from sushi by eating raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage. When fish eat tapeworm eggs, the hatching larvae attach themselves to the intestinal wall of the fish and the worms infect the fish flesh. Because sushi is not cooked, the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish. Once a human is infected, a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine to a length of up to 15metres over a period of weeks. It can survive for years and go undetected for weeks or months, in turn releasing its own eggs that infect other parts of the human body. Symptoms include fatigue, constipation and abdominal discomfort - which can be so mild the victim may not notice anything is wrong. If larvae begin to migrate to other parts of the body they can start to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart or brain and cause life-threatening conditions. Doctors believe some of the uncooked Japanese delicacy of raw meat or fish must have become contaminated. He was treated at the  Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital in Guangdong Province, in eastern China. Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections. Tapeworm infections occur after ingesting the larvae of diphyllobothrium, found in freshwater fish such as salmon, although marinated and smoked fish can also transmit the worm. While cases have increased in poorer areas due to improved sanitation, cases have increased in more developed countries,. This is most likely due to the soaring popularity of sushi, say doctors writing in the journal Canadian Family Physician. Study author Nancy Craig wrote: 'The widespread popularity of Japanese sushi and sashimi (slices of raw fish) is a contributor. 'But other popular dishes might also be implicated, such as raw salted or marinated fillets - which originate from Baltic and Scandinavian countries - carpaccio - very thin slices of raw fish common in Italy, raw salmon and ceviche - lightly marinated fish.' Dr Yin, of Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital, told the website that'smags.com that eating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person’s blood stream. This type of infection is life-threatening once it reaches the brain. Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections .

"A widow whose husband bled to death in her arms just two days after routine tonsil surgery has won a $13 million case against his surgeon. Eric Price, a 38-year-old father-of-two from Hull, Massachusetts, underwent a tonsillectomy at South Shore Hospital in 2004 to treat his sleep apnea, the Boston Herald reported. But two days after the surgery, he  started bleeding uncontrollably and his wife, Cynthia Price-Brown, saw him rush into the bathroom. 'I knew something was wrong right away,' Price-Brown, now 53, told the Herald. 'Maybe four to six minutes later my husband bled to death in my arms.' Relief: Cynthia Price-Brown, pictured, has won a $13 million malpractice case against her late husband's surgeon. Eric Price bled to death in her arms just days after undergoing a tonsillectomy . In 2007, she filed a malpractice suit against her husband's surgeon, Dr. Peter Ambrus, who had suggested that Price have the tonsillectomy. On Wednesday, she won a $13 million verdict against him, but the agreement requires she receive only $1 million - but she told the Herald that it's not the money that matters to her. 'I feel like I finally have justice for Eric,' she said. The doctor had performed four surgeries on price - but they were ill-advised because Price's sleep apnea was so mild, Robert M. Higgins of Lubin & Meyer had argued. Suit: Dr Peter Ambrus, Price's surgeon, 'feels terrible' about the death of his patient, attorneys said . But Ambrus' attorney had countered that heavy bleeding is a known complication of the surgery, and that death is always a risk when undergoing any operation. The attorney, William J. Dailey III, said that his client 'feels terrible' about the outcome. According to Price-Brown's Facebook page, she has now remarried. Around 380,000 tonsillectomies are performed annually in the United States. Tonsillectomies are carried out to remove the tonsils in order to help tonsillitis, sleep apnea, airway obstruction or snoring, among other issues. In children, the adenoids are sometimes removed at the same time. They are riskier for adults given the larger size of the vessels and arteries compared to those in children. Up to two per cent of patients bleed within 24 hours of surgery, while up to 3.7 per cent of patients bleed between six and 10 days after surgery, according to Kristin Hayes, an ENT disorders experts.. Few are fatal. Most recently, last year, 13-year-old Jahi McMath of Oakland, California, started bleeding from her mouth and nose following tonsil surgery and was later declared brain dead.","Eric Price, 38, passed away just minutes after he started bleeding in 2004 .

"A big night out is usually followed by a fry-up, a cup of tea and painkillers. But a Middle Eastern recipe uncovered in a 10th century cookbook could be all you need to cure a hangover. The 1,000-year-old Iraqi dish involves cooking meat with vegetables and spices, and then adding something known as 'kashk'. Scroll down for recipe . A Middle Eastern recipe uncovered in a 10th century cookbook could be all you need to cure a hangover. The Iraqi dish involves cooking meat with vegetables and spices, and then adding something known as 'kashk' Kashk is combination of fermented yoghurt, milk and whey, and is common in Iranian, Turkish, Balkan and Arabic food. It is the main ingredient in this hangover cure found in ancient book, written by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, and translated by Nawal Nasrallah in 'Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchens.' 'We need to keep in mind that people in medieval times believed in the Galenic theory of the four humors — blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile, and their properties, of cold, hot, humid, and dry,' Ms Nasrallah told MailOnline. 'The rationale was that with its cold properties, easy digestion, and nourishing power, it helped alleviate the hangovers - usually people suffer from excess heat in the head and stomach.' The book claims that eating cabbage before drinking prevents you from getting too drunk. To make Kishkiyya, you cook lamb with some vegetables and spices such as coriander and cumin. Today, Kishkiyya is still cooked in the same way, mostly in northern Iraq and the Levant . It also advises eating snacks between drinks to slow down the effects of alcohol. 'You need to know that drinking cold water first thing in the morning is recommended only for people suffering from…hangovers,' Al-Warraq wrote. 'However, they should avoid drinking it in one big gulp. Rather, they need to have it in several small doses and breathe deeply between one dose and the other.' Historians believe that al-Warraq’s Kitab al-Tabikh, or 'The Cooking Book,' is the oldest cookbook in the Arab world. Al-Warraq says that sips of coldwater should be followed up with Kishkiyya, an ancient meat and chickpea stew. To make Kishkiyya, you cook the meat – usually lamb – with some vegetables and spices such as coriander and cumin. You then let it boil. The Kashk, also known as Kishk, is added and the dish left to simmer and rest on the remaining heat. In the book, Al-Warraq cites an older poem about the dishes ability to cure a hangover. Kashk is combination of fermented yoghurt, milk and whey. It is the main ingredient in this hangover (left) recipe found in ancient book, written by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, and translated by Iraqi scholar Nawal Nasrallah in her book, 'Annals of the Caliphs' Kitchens (right) 'The nourishing dish to have when in the gripes of a hangover one craves some food. 'Having eaten it intoxicated one will be all anew and the hangover will itself renew,' the poem stated. 'In 10th Century Iraq, people did not drink alcohol while eating the meal as the custom is today, and even drinking water while eating was discouraged,' Ms Nasrallah told MailOnline. 'The full meal was composed of condiments, fermented and unfermented served with bread, followed by cold dishes, and then the serious stuff - the hot meal. 'Sweets, but not fruits, were encouraged after the meal as they thought that with their hot properties they aid digestion. 'Drinking wines (for those who imbibed it) was done in drinking sessions after the meal. Their physicians believed that it had the power to aid digestion.' Today, Kishkiyya is still cooked in the same way, mostly in northern Iraq and the Levant. Ingredients . 3lbs of meat, 1/2 lb of chopped onion, 4 ounces of fresh herbs, a handful of chickpeas, 1 piece of galangal, 1/2 cup of olive oil, seasonal green vegetables, khask (or plain yogurt as a substitute), the juce of unripe sour grapes, 6 grams of cumin, 6 grams cassia, 1 gram cloves, 1 gram spikenard (or other aromatic root-based oil). Cooking Directions . Translated from Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq's cookbook: . Wash 3lbs meat and put it in a pot. Add 1/2lb chopped onion, 4 ounces fresh herbs, a handful of chickpeas, 1 piece galangal, and 1/2 cup olive oil. Pour water enough to submerge the ingredients in the pot. Let the pot cook until meat is almost done. Add any of the seasonal green vegetables and a little chard. When everything in the pot is cooked, add 1/2 of kashk. Pound them into fine powder and dissolve them in 2 cups juice of unripe sour grapes. Add it to the cooking pot. When kashk is done, add 6 grams cumin and an equal amount of cassia. Add a handful of finely chopped onion. Do not stir the pot. When the onion cooks and falls apart, add to the pot 1 gram cloves and a similar amount of spikenard. Stop fueling the fire, let the pot simmer and rest on the remaining heat, then take it down. This is how to make basic kishkiyya and it can substitute for all other kinds. However, you might add variety by making it less or more sour, to suit your taste, and putting whatever other vegetables you prefer. Translated recipe for kashk: . After you boil wheat and dry it, crush it coarsely and winnow it to get rid of all bran and finely ground grains (duqaq). Knead the sifted grains with enough hot water, and a small amount of yeast. Put the dough in a tub and leave it exposed to the sun. Uncover it during the day and cover it during the night. Do this for six-days or more until it becomes intensely sour. Finely chop as many kinds of herbs as you like. However, you should avoid endive and watercress because they are not good [with kishk]. Use a lot of tender-leaf leeks, cilantro, and rue. If you prefer to use finely chopped small round onions, do so by all means. You can also add eggplant, gourd, and cabbage. All these will make it quite delicious. Now add small and sour plum. Sour grape juice will be good, too. Knead together all the ingredients very well and leave the dough in a sunny place for five days. Then divide it into portions, which you shape into discs and set aside to dry out. When completely dry, thread them into necklace-like links, and hang them [for storage]. If you like, you can substitute water [used in kneading the grains] with defatted sour yogurt. In this case, of all the herbs mentioned above, use only cultivated mint and parsley.","Kishkiyya recipe found in 10th century Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq cookbook .

"The oil price fell to a five-year low yesterday amid fresh worries about the outlook for the global economy. Crude tumbled to as low as $67.53 a barrel – the cheapest it has been since October 2009 – before rebounding back to around $70. The price of oil has now fallen around 40 per cent since topping $115 a barrel in June. Scroll down for video . The slump in oil price is good news for motorists and airlines but a disaster for the likes of Vladimir Putin who saw the rouble fall to a record low against the dollar . This is good news for motorists and airlines but a disaster for the likes of Vladimir Putin who saw the rouble fall to a record low against the dollar. The slump has been triggered by a huge increase in supply from the shale boom in the United States at a time of weak demand around the world. OPEC – the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries – last week refused to cut production to prop up prices despite pleas from members including Venezuela. Analysts described cheaper oil as a ‘tax cut’ for households and businesses – adding that it could boost the British and global economies by driving down the price of essentials from petrol to food. ‘The prospects for the world economy are much brighter with global oil prices at $70 per barrel than they were at $110,’ said Julian Jessop, an economist at Capital Economics. He said gross domestic product around the world – the total size of the economy – could be 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent higher ‘as a result of the decline in oil prices’. Shares in airlines including easyJet and British Airways owner International Airlines Group have soared in recent days following the fall in oil price . British supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Morrisons last week shaved another 2p off the price of a litre of petrol – setting the scene for a price war at the pumps this Christmas. The AA said the price of litre of unleaded has fallen from 131.70p over the summer to 121.45p now while diesel is down from 136.37 a litre to 125.99p. Luke Bosdet, a spokesman for the AA, said: ‘Lower pump prices are good for families. But the real benefit will be felt by the High Street retailers. 'The timing of the fall in oil prices allows more money to be siphoned from fuel to Christmas spending. Families will be feeling warmer and happier this Christmas because they will have more money to spend. As a result retailers should see more money through their tills.’ Simon Williams, a spokesman for the RAC, said the falling oil price is ‘excellent news for motorists this Christmas’. The falling price of oil is also likely to drive down the price of food as it makes it cheaper to produce by cutting the cost of everything from petrol to fertiliser. It could also make holidays cheaper for British families as airlines lower their fares. Shares in airlines including easyJet and British Airways owner International Airlines Group have soared in recent days. At the same time, shares in oil companies such as BP and Shell have fallen on expectations that lower prices will hit profits. Analysts at Berenberg Bank raised their growth forecast for the UK for 2015 from 2.8 per cent to 2.9 per cent on the back of the falling oil price. They also expect inflation to fall from the current level of 1.3 per cent to 0.8 per cent before the end of the year as the price of everyday goods tumbles. At the same time, shares in oil companies such as BP and Shell have fallen on expectations that lower prices will hit profits . Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg, said low inflation means the Bank of England will be able to leave interest rates on hold at 0.5 per cent well into next year. He added: ‘Cheap oil could give the recovery its fizz back, after the growth outlook had been dulled by eurozone troubles. The signs are tentative so far, but falling unemployment may finally be stirring British wage growth from its long slumber. 'Combined with super low inflation, which has also been helped by falling food prices and other import costs, consumers should see meaningful gains in their purchasing power next year. That is a real change from the gloom that pervaded consumer income prospects just three to six months ago, and justifies our continued optimism.’ But lower oil prices mean lower tax revenues from the North Sea – leaving Chancellor George Osborne with even less room for giveaways in the Autumn Statement tomorrow (WEDS) or before the general election in May. The slump in the oil price has piled pressure on some of the world’s main producers including Russia. The Russian rouble was down as much as nine per cent to a record low against the US dollar yesterday – the biggest fall since the country’s currency crisis of 1998. Oil and gas accounts for 70 per cent of Russian exports and half of government revenues, making the country and the currency vulnerable to falling prices. Lee Hardman, a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said the slide in the oil price is ‘reinforcing the loss of investor confidence in the rouble’ as the country reels from sanctions over its land grab in Ukraine. Energy UK – which represents household energy suppliers such as British Gas – played down the prospect of lower bills. A spokesman said: ‘End consumer prices may not always reflect changes in wholesale market prices as companies buy energy, weeks, months and years in advance as well as on the day ahead market. 'This is to protect customers from short term fluctuations in price. As a result, changes in customer prices reflect long term trends, not short term ones.’","Price of oil has now fallen around 40% since topping $115 a barrel in June .

"‘Nice problem to have’ is the usual cliche thrown out by managers when they have a surplus of ego-centric stars to mesh into a team. Perhaps Bill Shankly put it better when he said the biggest problem in football management was keeping the players happy - ‘the players who aren’t in your first 11,’ he added. And Shankly never had to deal with the Champions League squad sizes that  Brendan Rodgers is managing. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool will always be ambitious - Ayre . Liverpool's Mario Balotelli, Steven Gerrard, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling during the win at Spurs . Adam Lallana's Liverpool career got off to a frustrating start, but he is now fit again after injury . Mario Balotelli joined Liverpool from AC Milan for £16m and made his debut at Tottenham . Daniel Sturridge in action against Tottenham during Liverpool's 3-0 win at White Hart Lane . How Liverpool could line up in their diamond . Undoubtedly, given the lack of depth in the Liverpool squad last season, it is a ‘nice problem to have,’ for Rodgers, especially with the Champions League campaign beginning next week. That said, just how does the Liverpool manager squeeze Mario Balotelli, Daniel Sturridge, Rickie Lambert, Raheem Sterling, Lazar Markovic, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana, who is now fit, into the same team? He won’t, of course, unless he wants to end up like Ossie Ardiles who sent out his famous five of attacking players - Jurgen Klinsmann, Darren Anderton, Nicky Barmby, Ilie Dumitrescu and Teddy Sheringham - for Tottenham in 1994. How pretty it looked in August; Ardiles was sacked in October. Let’s take it as a given that Rodgers wants to get Balotelli, Sturridge and Sterling on to the pitch and work from there. That would suggest - and the game at Tottenham backs this up - that his preferred way of playing will be the diamond, with Sterling behind the front two, requiring Lallana to play a little deeper and narrower alongside Jordan Henderson in midfield. It’s a role he filled at Southampton, though with more licence to go forward. Steven Gerrard would anchor the midfield leaving Markovic, as the new boy, and Coutinho to miss out. Raheem Sterling has thrived when playing at the point of Liverpool's diamond formation in midfield . Jordan Henderson provides Liverpool's midfield with plenty of energy,  impetus and hard work . Steven Gerrard has dropped back into an anchor role at the base of the midfield diamond . And yet Coutinho impressed as an attacking midfielder last season, so if Rodgers wants to revert to him playing behind a lone striker - presumably Balotelli - then Sturridge will be the man forced wide, with Sterling resuming a wide left role. Rodgers claims Balotelli will play where he’s told but it would be a brave man to play him out wide, given the utter necessity of tracking back in that position. Roberto Mancini tried it at Manchester City and gave up. Henderson and Gerrard would anchor in the above formation meaning no place for Lambert, Lallana or Markovic. Philippe Coutinho impressed last season but could make way after a number of summer signings . Lazar Markovic comes off the bench to replace Mario Balotelli during the victory at Tottenham . But Rodgers is a man whose tactical blueprint is derived from the likes of Marcelo Bielsa, Johan Cruyff and Louis van Gaal so a 3-4-3 formation must also be a possibility. That would allow him to play the front three as above and give him a midfield with Markovic and Lallana as wide men. It looks extraordinarily ambitious and asks a lot of those two defensively. But Rodgers is not a man afraid to take risks. And we can safely assume, that unlike Ardiles, he will be given time to find the best combination and the right balance.

"Who will be flying the military aircraft of tomorrow? According to the Pentagon, it may partially fall in the hands of artificial intelligence (AI). Reports say that both the US Navy and Air Force are planning next-generation fighters that don't have just a human pilot. Future fighter jets may have an AI co-pilot on board that can help with sensory data in addition to autonomously landing the plane on an aircraft carrier. Scroll down to watch an autonomous aircraft dodge a missile . The Pentagon in Virginia is planning to introduce artificial intelligence to a future generation of fighter jets. The plan it to use AI as co-pilots to humans and possibly to help landing on an aircraft carrier. Such technology may be used in the US Navy's upcoming F/A-XX jet (artist's concept shown) According to the US Naval Institute (USNI), artificial intelligence will feature prominently on the successors to the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. A human-like ‘skin’ for aircraft - allowing them to detect any damage and ‘feel’ the world around them - is being developed by British experts. Engineers at BAE Systems’ Advanced Technology Centre are investigating a ‘smart skin’ concept which could be embedded with tens of thousands of micro-sensors. When applied to an aircraft, it will enable it to sense wind speed, temperature, physical strain and movement, far more accurately than current sensor technology allows. The revolutionary ‘smart skin’ concept will enable aircraft to continually monitor their health, reporting back on potential problems before they become significant. The US Navy is working on the F/A-XX and the Air Force on the F-X, with both designed to replace their predecessors by 2030 at the earliest. ‘AI is going to be huge,’ a US Navy official told the USNI. While the exact purpose of AI in aircraft isn’t known yet, it could have a number of uses from acting as a co-pilot to carrying out autonomous landings. According to Popular Science the robotic co-pilots would be especially helpful for aircraft carriers, which are difficult to land on. Recently the Navy’s X-47B experimental drone landed autonomously on an aircraft, demonstrating the usefulness of AI in such a situation. AI could also help with something known as advanced sensor fusion. This involves combining data from various sensors to get a more accurate reading of a situation or location. The Navy and Air Force are also hoping to get help from industry experts in Silicon Valley to aid them in the design of such sixth-generation fighters.

Most of those here with their banners are disciples of Ferrari, the team that Enzo built into an icon of a nation, but with the shiny scarlet cars off the pace, it is the tussle between a cerebral German and an instinctive Briton that promises to provide the greatest excitement of the afternoon. The backdrop to the race was provided a fortnight ago at Spa, where Hamilton and Rosberg collided on the second lap. Hamilton ultimately retired from the race. Rosberg, the aggressor, survived a broken front wing to come second and increase his advantage in the drivers’ championship to 29 points. The row afterwards was even more feisty. It ended up with Rosberg being fined by Mercedes and apologising to his team, his rival and the seemingly the whole world. Both were warned to keep it clean, though their management will permit them to race free of team orders. Back on track: Hamilton celebrates after claiming pole in Monza .

Pipped: Rosberg was prevented from getting a fifth consecutive pole by his Mercedes team-mate . So after Hamilton  claimed his first pole since the Spanish Grand Prix more than half-a-season ago – on May 10 – the question was how they would race in the first few frantic moments tomorrow along the fastest lap in Formula One.Would the keep-it-clean instruction be in their minds? ‘It won’t be ringing in my ears,’ said Hamilton. Sitting next to him, Rosberg said: ‘It’s a question I am not able to answer. The message is that we keep on racing. Every situation is different.’ Fasten your seat belts. Hamilton was strangely underwhelmed in the post-qualifying press conference. ‘It is a great feeling to be up here he said,’ with all the enthusiasm of a dental patient mid-filling rather than somebody who had interrupted Rosberg’s run of six poles in seven races. ‘As for me, I’m… looking forward to it.’ Mercedes’ outright pace suggest they should be too strong to be challenged, yet mechanical glitches have hindered them more regularly than expected. Hamilton sat out an hour of Friday’s second practice session with an electrical problem and Rosberg missed yesterday practice with a faulty gearbox. ‘Every race is important,’ said Hamilton. ‘But time is running out. I need those points.’ Podium position: Valtteri Bottas took Williams to third as the only team to challenge Mercedes . True Brit: Jenson Button's future at McLaren remains uncertain - his contract expires at the end of the year . All the top six – Hamilton, Rosberg, Valtteri Bottas in third, his Williams team-mate Felipe Massa and the McLaren pair of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button are powered by Mercedes engines. To the disgruntlement of the Italuan fans Fernando Alonso starts in seventh place while the second Ferrari of Kimi Raikonnen was only 12th fastest. Ferrari’s recent dismal run of form led the Monza rumour-mill to suggest that Luca di Montezemolo, the 67-year-old team president, might stand down after more than 40 years of high-level service with the company. But with a sweep of his hair, he dismissed tales of his demise. ‘I told the Ferraru board in March that I was ready to accept three more years for my shareholders and particularly for my people, the women and men of the Ferrari,’ he said. ‘They are the most important part of my life and I took a commitment with them. Italian job: Fernando Alonso carries the hopes of Ferrari and the Italian home crowd . Prancing pony: Alonso speaks with Ferrari's President Luca Di Montezemolo . ‘We are preparing an historic record at the end of this year in terms of financial and economical results, so Ferrari is facing a fantastic moment. ‘If and when there is some news about me, I will be the first – I emphasise the first – to let you know.’ Rookie: McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen  ahead of Ferrari's Alonso . Dark horse: Daniel Ricciardo will start the race from the fourth row along with team-mate Sebastian Vettel . Must do better: Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen went out at the second stage of qualifying . Di Montezemolo is not only a great survivor but among Formula One’s big beasts, a name to set alongside the likes of Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosley and Ron Dennis. Mosley derided him as a bella figura  – roughly translated as all fur coat and no knickers. Living up to his theatrical billing, Di Montezemol enveloped Alonso in a long, lingering, listing hug. Another hugger was Hamilton, embracing his dad Anthony on the way to the car. There is at least some love here among the enmity.","Hamilton claimed his first pole position since May's Spanish Grand Prix .

"His eyes bulging and his mouth wide with panic, a starving squirrel stretches out a despairing arm as his nuts fall irretrievably to the ground. There's not a human being alive that doesn't know that desperate feeling of losing something of great personal value. And, as this picture shows, animals lose things too... but it never gets any easier. The photograph was taken by keen amateur photographer Ajeet Vikram, 27, outside his home in Dehardun, northern India. Nooooooo! His eyes bulging and his mouth wide with panic, a starving squirrel stretches out a despairing arm as his nut falls irretrievably to the ground . Grooming: The day began so well as the rodent climbed to the top of the sun-soaked pylon for a spot of self-grooming before breakfast . Ajeet, how works as development manager by day, said that his original intention was to shoot the sunrise, but then the squirrel caught his eye basking in the morning light. It was scurrying up and down an electrical pole outside his house before settling on its top to tuck in to breakfast. But as it opened its mouth to eat, it fumbled the treat sending it plummeting to earth, just as Ajeet took a picture. Ajeet said: 'It was a early morning and I wanted to shoot sunrise, but suddenly I saw the squirrel on top of the electrical pole. Inconsolable: But after the squirrel dropped its prized food, Ajeet managed to capture the exact moment of despair . Nowhere to be seen: The squirrel searches the ground despairingly for his food . Acorn crazy: The picture is reminiscent of Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel from the Ice Age films, who keeps losing his acorn . 'The squirrel was contentiously going up and down the electric pole, and then suddenly squirrel climbed on the top and started to eat something. This made me want to take pictures. 'The squirrel had hold of some kind of nut, which he dropped. 'When I saw the photo, I thought 'Bingo' - it was mindblowing. My friends all call me a real photographer now. 'I really like squirrels. I think they look really innocent.'","The picture was taken by amateur photographer Ajeet Vikram, 27, from India .

"Domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty has been announced as the 2015 Australian of the Year on Sunday night. Ms Batty from Tyabb, Victoria, overcame huge personal tragedy to be a voice for Australia's many unheard victims of domestic violence.

"Caught: Nearly four years after three family members were found murdered with a pick axe, State Police have arrested Nicholas Ortiz, 20, the man suspected of the triple homicide . A man from New Mexico suspected of killing a couple and their adult son nearly four years ago has been taken into custody and charged with three counts of murder. Nicholas Ortiz, 20, was also charged with tampering with evidence and bribery or intimidation of a witness. Ortiz  tried to steal $20,000 from the family who had previously let him stay in their home, according to court documents. State police say 53-year-old Dixie Ortiz, 55-year-old Lloyd Ortiz and their special-needs son, 21-year-old Steven Ortiz, were found dead from head trauma in their El Rancho home on June 29, 2011. Investigators later found a blood-stained pick ax in a nearby field and linked the weapon to the killings. The grisly murders had lingered among the state's most disturbing unsolved cases and had left a sense of unease in the community where the slain Ortiz family members were well regarded. According to police, Nicholas Ortiz wasn't related to the victims (despite sharing their last name), but had stayed with them. The arrest came out of the blue on Friday and was the first major development in the four-year-old case, which left the victims' family and El Rancho residents frustrated with the lumbering investigation. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported that in the past four years, investigators never revealed if they had potential leads or knew of the motives behind the slayings. Poser: Nicholas Ortiz, 20, of Pojoaque was charged with three counts of murder, tampering with evidence, and bribery or intimidation of a witness . Killed: On Father’s Day 2011, Lloyd and Dixie Ortiz along with their 21-year-old son Steven were found murdered with a pick-axe in their El Rancho home . Murdered: Steven Ortiz, the couple's 21-year-old adopted son had been bludgeoned to death . Behind bars: Nicholas Ortiz would have been 16 at the time of the killings. He is now in the Santa Fe County jail and is being held without bond . State police have remained silent about why it has taken so long to make an arrest. In a statement issued Friday, the agency described it as a 'complex investigation.' The department also remained silent when asked why they believe Ortiz, who would have been 16 at the time, killed the Ortiz family. According to a police affidavit filed in court Monday, witnesses told investigators Nicholas Ortiz was out to steal $20,000 from a safe at the residence. He allegedly told friends that he killed the family, panicked and then ran out of the house. Police found the bodies had been brutally mutilated. Tragic: Lloyd Ortiz, who operated a tile business at the same address, was found face down outside the home. His adopted son, Steven Ortiz, right, was found in the kitchen . Not in their name: Although Nicholas Ortiz shares the same last name as the victims, he is not related to them . Cross to bear: The murders shocked and terrified the community of El Rancho near Espanola. As the years went on, the family’s pleas for any leads in the case grew more desperate . Autopsy reports said the three died from blunt force trauma, and the murder weapon was a pickax. Steven Ortiz had been struck 17 times, Lloyd Ortiz seven times and Dixie Ortiz twice . After the bodies were discovered on Father’s Day at the family’s El Rancho home, state police initially said the Ortizes had been shot, but officials later recanted that story. Investigators who returned to the scene found a blood-covered, 5-pound pickax in a field near the family’s home. Nicholas' father and mother appealed to the judge during Monday's hearing to allow their son to be released. The Albuquerque Journal reported that the father said Ortiz was not a flight risk and had cooperated with police throughout the investigation. Cherie Ortiz, Lloyd and Dixie's daughter, urged the judge to keep Nicholas Ortiz in jail. She said the families live close to each other and she considered Nicholas Ortiz a threat. 'It's not safe for our family and the community,' she said. Ortiz was denied bond during a hearing Monday at which his parents asked that he be allowed to live with them pending his trial. No trial date has been set. Sigh of relief: For the small community, the arrest is the news they’ve waited for, for nearly four years. But it was met with mixed emotion .","Three family members of the Ortiz family found murdered with a pickaxe .

"Police have revealed new details about the unthinkable chain of events that led to a Las Vegas mother being shot dead in a road rage incident last Thursday, with the killer still on the loose. At a press conference on Tuesday, Metro Police said Tammy Meyers, 44, was heading home from giving her daughter Kristal a driving lesson when a silver sedan sped up behind them. The daughter was a passenger in the car, but leaned over to honk the horn, causing the sedan to pull in front of them. Both cars stopped and, after a heated exchange, Meyers drove off home, where she told her daughter to go inside and get her 22-year-old son, Brandon. Killed: Tammy Meyers - seen here with her husband Robert Meyers - went out looking for a man she had a road rage argument with, cops said. She was accompanied by their son Brandon, 22, who brought a gun with him, according to authorities . Son: Brandon Meyers, 22, posted a photo of a Beretta handgun (right) to his Facebook page one year ago, saying: 'New addition to the family.' Police say he shot at the fleeing car after his mom was gunned down . Shot dead: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, went home first before heading back out to find the man that eventually killed her following a road rage incident last Thursday, police say . Vowed to find suspects: Mrs Meyers' husband, Robert Meyers, said his 15-year-old daughter Kristal is distraught. He believes the family's car and that of the suspect crashed at some point before the deadly shooting . He came and got into the car and brought a gun with him, police said, according to local station 8 News Now. Meyers and her son drove around trying to find the silver sedan and eventually did. Police have not elaborated on what happened at this point. However they say the driver of the sedan then followed Meyers home and shot her in the head outside the house. The shooter is not believed to have gotten out of his vehicle. Myers' son fired shots at the fleeing car with his handgun as his mother lay dying nearby. Meyers died Saturday after being taken off life support. A candlelight vigil was held on Tuesday evening outside Walter Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers had been giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson in the parking lot. Suspect: A twenty-something man with spiky hair, while Kristal Meyers holds a candle during a memorial vigil for her mother on Tuesday night . Kristal Meyers, left, and her brother, Robert Meyes Jr. spoke at a memorial vigil for their mom on Tuesday night at Walter Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers had been giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson . 'I did what I had to do to protect my family. And I'd do it for anyone I love,' said Brandon Meyers, reports Review Journal. Daughter Kristal told the 75 or so people at the vigil: 'I was in the car with her. There's so much I can say about my mom. ‘My mom was protecting me that night and she was doing what any mom would do. She was my everything, my best friend. She did everything she could possibly do to protect me and I love her so much.' Police have not named the suspect, but have released a sketch of a person they are looking for. He has been described as a white man in his mid-20s, standing 6-feet tall, weighing about 180 pounds with spiked dirty blond hair and blue or hazel eyes. They have also released CCTV footage of the silver sedan that were captured on cameras near the crime scene. Meyers' bereaved husband has vowed to find the suspect, and the two other accomplices who were in the car along with him. 'My word to them is I hope the cops find them first and it’s not me,' Robert Meyers said. 'I have four kids. I just want to let you suspects know you took a mom away.' 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive. 'After I turn off the machines to my wife today... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.' On the run: The surveillance footage above shows a four-door sedan wanted by police in connection to a deadly shooting last week in Las Vegas . Overreaction: Police say one of the passengers in this car shot dead 44-year-old mother Tammy Meyers after getting into a road rage argument on Thursday . Meyers had let her daughter Kristal take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot before the incident with the sedan. Mr Meyers described the girl as emotionally distraught, according to ABC News. He also confirmed their son fired several shots with a handgun. Mr Meyers said he thinks at least one 9mm shot fired by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police. In February 2014, Brandon Meyers posted a photo of a Beretta handgun to his Facebook page, along with the caption: 'New addition to the family.' Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said. Investigators were looking for the shooter and possibly two other men in the vehicle. Mr Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side. 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive,' Robert Meyers told the AP before addressing reporters outside their home (pictured) where the shooting happened about 11:30 p.m. Thursday.

"A 'missing' hour from the timeline of the final day of a young woman who was burned to death in her car that could hold the clue to solving her murder, investigators say. At 6.10pm on December 6, 2014, Jessica Chambers was driving on Highway 6 into Batesville, Mississippi. Twenty minutes later, at 6.30pm, she was in her home town, Courtland. By the next time she was seen, she was lying on a rural road by her blazing Kia Rio sedan, dying after suffering 98 per cent burns. She wasn't found until 8.09pm, but investigators place her at that scene by 7.30pm. Now they are focusing on the final hour before she arrived, in the hope it will provide the key to her murder. Horrific: Jessica Chambers, 19, was burned alive in December by an unknown assailant. Authorities have released a timeline of her final hours in the hope it might jog the memory of potential witnesses . Grief:  Miss Chambers' mother, Lisa Daugherty, has said her daughter went out at 5pm on the day of her murder, after telling her she was going to buy food and clean her car . Panola County District Attorney John Champion has released details of Miss Chambers' final hours. He hopes they will the memory of  witnesses who can plug the gaps in the investigation. The 19-year-old was alive when firefighters reached her at 8.15pm that night. She slipped away in a Memphis hospital the next day, with her mother by her bedside. But months after Miss Chambers death, and despite a mammoth investigation, her murder remains unsolved. 'We just don't know where she was between 6.30pm and 7.30pm,' Mr Champion said yesterday. 'We're releasing this timeline in hopes it will generate some leads and memories. This case is obviously unusual for this area.' Mystery: Miss Chambers' Kia Rio sedan. She was found alive next to the vehicle just after 8pm . The crime scene: Investigators place her here by 7.30pm, but don't know what happened in the hour prior . Miss Chambers' mother, Lisa Daugherty, has said her daughter went out at 5pm, after telling her she was going to buy food and clean her car. After she was seen on cameral buying gas, Miss Chambers visited a home in Courtland, then drove the 10 minutes to nearby Batesville, where another video camera spotted her. By 6.30pm, she was back in Courtland. An hour later she was at the scene where someone set her on fire. 'We've gotten leads on where she might have been and every one of them has been followed up on,' Mr Champion said. 'The problem is the one-hour gap.' Investigators have used witness statements, video camera footage and cell phone metadata to narrow down Miss Chambers' movements throughout the day. 'We're certainly using her cellphone records and using some technology we have available to pin some of this stuff down,' Mr Champion was quoted as saying by the Jackson Clarion Ledger. Despite a $54,000 reward for information no viable tips have been received, the paper reported, citing officials. Locals have reportedly said people are unwilling to come forward for fear they could be the next victim. Investigators believe the killer is probably local. Assistant US Attorney Chad Lamar said there is potential for a 'witness security program' to be made available to any informants. CCTV: Before she died, Jessica Chambers went to a gas station in Courtland to fill her car with gas . Last week Miss Chambers' mother revealed the final words she spoke to her daughter as she lay dying. 'I just looked at her and said, 'I know you're in pain, Baby, if you want to go, you can go.' Then, Ms Daugherty said, 'she took her last breath.'","Miss Chambers was found with 98 per cent burns on December 6 last year .

"An Indianapolis couple have been charged with neglect in the death of their paralyzed 18-year-old daughter who died wearing only a diaper and covered in blackened bedsores in a house crawling with gnats. John and Lavonne Kelley are accused of failing to seek medical treatment for Linda Kelley, who suffered from spina bifida and died August 4 in the family's filthy, roach-infested home. The Marion County coroner's office determined the cause of death was acute and chronic bedsores, some of which were so deep they exposed bone and organs. Poor hygiene was listed as a contributory factor. Charged: Lavonne and John Kelley (left and right), a married couple from Indiana, have been charged with neglect of a dependent in the death of their paralyzed teenage daughter, who was found covered in bedsores . The Kelleys each face a felony count of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury. Court documents show they had previously been accused of neglect. Linda Kelley was paralyzed from the waist down and had a shunt, or tube, in her brain. John Kelley, 51, and his 40-year-old wife, Lavonne, were taken into police custody Wednesday on charges of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury. They are being held in jail without bond. Lavonne Kelley reportedly told police she noticed broken skin and bruises on her daughter's body two days before her passing, but Linda allegedly refused to go the hospital and would not let anyone turn her over, according to The Indianapolis Star. Linda Kelley's heartbreaking living conditions were revealed during September hearings into how the 18-year-old's case was handled by the Department of Child Services before her death. A DCS case worker and employees from Damar Services, which provides care to patients with special needs, had visited the teen at her parents' home in Indianapolis just six days before she died. Marion Juvenile Court Judge Marilyn Moores held hearings in the fall to see if staff had falsified positive reviews of the girl's living conditions, the Indianapolis Star reported. But she concluded that they did not. Instead, there was a 'negligent oversight, if not reckless disregard, of the conditions of the home', she said. DCS Director Mary Beth Bonaventura said the girl was failed by multiple people, including the case worker, the DCS and her parents, Lavonne and John Kelley. The girl lived with her mother, Lavone Kelley, and her father. Neither have been charged - and it is not known if they knew about the sores on the girl's legs - but police are investigating . The DCS case worker, Teresa Carter, said she was shocked when she learned about the conditions because when she visited six days earlier, the home was in good condition and the girl had smiled. But after the death, she returned to the home and found it covered with dog feces, trash, soiled adult diapers and cigarette butts and saw bugs crawling through the refrigerator. She also learned that Linda had sores below her waist. At the hearing, she admitted she had only checked some rooms in the house and did not check the Linda's legs for sores. She knew the girl had previously suffered a leg injury but after it healed, she did not see the need to continue to check her legs, she said. Carter said that she had been handling up to 28 cases at the time, whereas the legal limit in Indiana is 17. She explained that she was unable to keep up and could not sleep at night. But the DCS, which fired Carter and her supervisor after Linda passed away, said that workload was not a valid excuse for the oversights, and that the visits should have been carried out more thoroughly. The department had a long relationship with the Kelleys, who reportedly neglected their children in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2012. In December, the DCS learned the couple had failed to take their daughter to all of her doctors' appointments, including for a sore on her leg. When they checked the home at the time, it was filthy and crawling with gnats, records show. The department entered into a judge-approved agreement with the family to clean up the conditions, bring in a pest exterminator, attend all doctors' appointments and re-enroll the teenager in school. The couple apparently met the terms of their agreement and the case closed in mid-July, although Carter and Damar Services workers went for the final meeting on July 29. The president of Damar Services, Jim Dalton, said his workers had never seen the home in such a terrible shape as on the day she died and that if they had, they would have reported it.","Linda Kelley, who had spina bifida, had sores covering much of her lower body when she passed away in her parents' Indiana home in August .

"A 91-year-old war veteran who smothered his ailing wife to end her suffering has been released from prison early after serving six months. Robert Shaw was sentenced to four years behind bars last June after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter as part of a plea deal in the death of his wife of 65 years, Virginia, in 2008. On Tuesday, Lorain County Judge Mark Betleski granted him early release for good behavior and the grandfather left Pickaway Correctional Institution in Orient, Ohio. 'There was no question in my mind as I'm going through the process that this was a man who made a tortured decision,' Betleski told NewsNet5 after the hearing. Scroll down for video . Freed: 91-year-old Robert Shaw, pictured in court last summer, has been released from prison in Ohio after serving six months behind bars for smothering his ailing wife of 65 years to end her suffering . Shaw, who has been in poor health himself, will be on probation for two years after his release and will live with family members, his defense attorney Kenneth Lieux said at the hearing, the Chronicle-Telegram reported. The family had requested for him to be released, he said. Shaw, who struggled to hear the court hearing as he appeared via video link, had been eligible for release after serving six months as part of last year's plea deal. Lieux added that Shaw, who had never been in trouble with the law before the killing, has not had any infractions in prison and even worked a job behind bars. He was initially charged with aggravated murder, murder and felonious assault for the killing because mercy killings are illegal in Ohio. Euthanasia is illegal in the US but a handful of states - Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Montana - do allow physician-assisted suicide in some instances. 'The law is black and white, but we’re all humans,' the judge added to NewsNet5. Shaw, who fought at the Battle of the Bulge in Europe and was retired from a job in truck manufacturing, smothered his 84-year-old wife, Virginia, as she lay in bed on November 13, 2008. He then phoned a 911 operator and said: 'I just killed my wife.' Scene: He used a towel to smother his wife Virginia at their Avon, Ohio home (pictured) in 2008 after she had spent the previous few months in and out of hospital. He then called 911 to report what he had done . On the recording, Shaw can be heard saying he wanted 'to put her out of her misery'. He went on: 'She had been in and out of the hospital and came home a couple of months ago, and... uh... I can't talk ...' Police arrived through an unlocked door to find Shaw sitting at a table. He told officers that they could find his wife in the bedroom. The Lorain County Coroner said she appeared to die by asphyxiation. At the hearing on Tuesday, Assistant County Prosecutor Chris Pierre warned that Shaw could pose a risk to the community. 'I hope the defendant understands he does not have the right to decide when to end someone's life,' he told the judge.

"Officer Jesse Turano and his partner saved a 37-year-old man from jumping on Tuesday. This is the 12th person Turano has saved in five years . A veteran Port Authority police officer has saved 12 people from jumping to their deaths from New York City's George Washington Bridge in just five years - his most recent rescue coming just Tuesday. Officer Jesse Turano and his partner saved a 37-year-old man this week after they found an abandoned car on the side of the road and the man standing on the bridge's edge. Nine-year veteran Turano and  Officer Brendan Mulderrig spotted the abandoned 2011 Toyota Venza after getting a call about a suicidal man at 6.40pm. The officers couldn't immediately find the man, but heard him screaming into his phone while standing on the outside of the bridge's railing with the river 200 feet below, according to New York Post. 'What I did is tell him, ""Relax! Relax! All I want to do is talk to you."" And all he would say was, ""Get Away! Get Away! All I want to do is die!""' Turano told New York Post. Turano, a weightlifter and former Marine, reached over and grabbed the man, struggling to pull him back to safety as Mulderrig held onto his partner, according to NJ.com. They succeeded after a few tense moments, and the man was taken to Englewood Hospital for an evaluation. 'I wasn’t going to let him go - I wasn’t going to let him die while I was out there,' Turano told the Post. Turano started working at the bridge in 2010, and since his start date he has prevented 12 suicides and has saved men and women of all ages. During one rescue, he snatched a man out of the air by the belt in order to save him from jumping. The span across the Hudson River is the most popular spot in the New York City area for suicide - with at least a dozen jumpers every years and about 40 foiled attempts, the Post reports.

"Police forces across the USA are considering changing to new hi-tech firearms - specially designed not to kill suspects. Departments are under severe pressure to find effective non-lethal weapons following the spate of high-profile fatal shootings by the police last year. Two models currently being considered for use are the Triple Defender and the Alternative. New technology: The Triple Defender: The state-of-the-art Triple Defender can incapacitate a suspect by blinding them with pepper gas, zapping them with a stun gun and disorientate them with a strobe light . The state-of-the-art Triple Defender can incapacitate a suspect by blinding them with pepper gas, zapping them with a stun gun and disorientating them with a strobe light, CNN reports. The Alternative consists of a small metal ball that is clipped to the end of a normal gun. When the firearm is discharged, the bullet embeds itself into the orange ball as it speeds towards the target and the force of the impact is significantly lessened. A direct hit would be extremely painful but would be very unlikely to kill you. Another non-lethal weapon: The Alternative consists of a a small metal ball that is clipped on the end of a gun. When the gun is discharged, the bullet embeds itself into the ball as it hurtles towards the target and helps lessen the bullet's impact . The device is made by Alternative Ballistics - a direct hit is painful but would be very unlikely to kill you . The picture above shows how the bullet is embedded into a ball which lessens its impact as it hurtles towards  a target . The efforts to develop better non-lethal weapons come after concerns over police practices following a number of lethal shootings last year. In August 2014, unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri - causing months of civil unrest and protests. And in November, a police officer in Cleveland shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice dead after the young boys was reported for waving a weapon around in a park - which turned out to be a replica firearm. Ferguson Police Department are believed to be considering the use of the Alternative gun setting - to diminish the force of bullets fired. Christian Ellis, founder and CEO of Alternative Ballistics, the company that makes the device, said: 'It's going to feel like you're getting punched in the chest by Barry Bonds. It's going to break some ribs.' Another company, called Security Devices International, offers a variety of less-lethal ammunition than can be fired from 40mm grenade launchers. This includes projectiles containing pepper gas, or colored liquid to identify suspects. There's also a 'malodorant round' which contains 'a highly noxious payload that delivers an appalling odor' - designed to disperse crowds. Historically, Tasers have been favored as the most effective non-lethal tool in a police force's arsenal. But questions have been raised over the device's safety with Amnesty International claiming more than 500 people have died in the US 'after being shocked with a Taser either during their arrest or while in jail'. A Taser fires electricity into people and shocks them. On its website, Taser says its electric pulses 'affect the sensory and motor functions of the peripheral nervous system and cause incapacitation.' The company, Taser International claims that the weapons do not damage vital organs, have 'been safely deployed more than 3.5 million times' and saved 125,000 people from death or injury. The firm also disputes the Amnesty figure, claiming the tally of deaths directly linked to being stunned is closer to 60. Killed by police: Michael Brown, 18, (L) was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a police officer in Missouri while 12-year-old Tamir Rice (R) was shot dead in Cleveland by an officer while carrying a replica gun . Taser has now provided Ferguson's police officers with body cameras. The US military has also been researching new non-lethal weapons - specifically a futuristic device to disperse crowds. Developed by Raytheon, the new weapon is said to work like a giant microwave, repelling crowds by blasting them with invisible heat rays. Raytheon describes the device - the Active Denial System - as a weapon that 'emits a focused beam of millimeter wave energy that penetrates the skin to 1/64th of an inch, producing an intolerable heating sensation that causes targeted individuals to flee'. Kelley Hughes, an employee working in the development of the device, volunteered to get zapped by it on five occasions. She compared it to the sudden heat  you would feel from opening an oven door - even though she was 3,000ft from the source of the beam. She told CNN: 'I felt an intolerable heating sensation. I felt its heat ramping up quickly and lasting a few brief seconds on my entire body. My immediate reflex was to move quickly away from the beam.' The Air Force says the Active Denial System insists the device is not radioactive, does not cause cancer or infertility, and can only be lethal if the beam is 'sustained and prolonged many times'. The weapon was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 but, aside from testing, has never been used on people.","Police under pressure after spate of fatal shootings by officers last year .

"The mother of a 22-month-old boy who died after being left in a hot car is too distraught to speak to police. Homicide squad Detective Senior Sergeant Shane O'Connell said the mother was present when the boy was found in the car, but said police investigating the incident would not speak to her for days, the Herald Sun reported. 'As you can imagine the family of this young boy are devastated by what has occurred so it's been difficult for us to try and piece together exactly what has occurred but that's something that will be the focus of our major ongoing investigation,' Det Sen Sgt O'Connell said. 'She's absolutely devastated by what has occurred. It's a very tragic set of circumstances.' Scroll down for video . The body of an infant boy was found in a vehicle on Acacia Drive in Kyneton (pictured) on Thursday . The owner of a separate local childcare centre said they were heartbroken over the tragedy . The childcare centre where a 22-month-old boy was found dead in a hot car parked outside was privately-run and operated out of a family home . The toddler's father is also understood to be devastated. The boy was found in a car parked outside a home on Acacia Drive in Kyneton, north-west of Melbourne, where a family day care was operated. The woman who operates the family day care is part of a well-known local family and runs the business from her house, The Age reported. The toddler was found unconscious by a family member while strapped in a car seat in the Toyota Hilux parked outside the home about 3pm on Thursday. The car window was smashed in order to rescue the boy but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. The family day care's father said his daughter was 'distraught', but said the family would not be speaking publically until police had finished their investigation. There is no suggestion the childcare centre owner was involved in the boy's death. Police are investigating whether a female relative of the 22-month-old had forgotten the child was in the vehicle. The 22-month-old boy was apparently found by a family member . Victorian homicide detectives are trying to establish whether the woman mistakenly thought she had dropped the toddler at a childcare centre in the morning before continuing with her regular routine, the Herald Sun reported. Temperatures in Kyneton reached 31 degrees at the time of the tragedy. The woman ran a regulated family day care service through Bambini Child Care Services, a company that trains educators to take care of children from their home. A spokeswoman for Family Day Care Australia, of which Bambini is a member, said: 'Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family and all those affected by this tragedy.' They refused to comment on any other details while police were conducting inquiries. The owner of a separate local business - Kyneton Family Day Care - posted on her Facebook page: 'The only information I can give regarding the accident in Kyneton this afternoon is that I am absolutely heartbroken for the family and my friend.' Inspector Ryan Irwin said at the scene: 'I understand the boy has been found by a family member and paramedics were called and obviously there were attempts made to try and revive the child.' Insp Irwin said homicide squad detectives would oversee the investigation, and called the incident an 'absolute tragedy'. 'We're devastated,' Inspector Irwin said, according to the Herald Sun. '[The family are] devastated, absolutely devastated and we're still trying to track some family members down to actually notify them.' Officers were still at the scene on Acacia Drive in Kyneton, 100km north-west of Melbourne hours after the awful discovery. Neighbours of the house the baby boy was found outside said the residency doubled as a childcare centre, the ABC reported. Neighbours of the house the baby boy was found outside said the residency doubled as a childcare centre . The suburb, which is about 100km north-west of Melbourne, recorded temperatures of 31 degrees . Homicide detectives have been called into the investigation but this is 'common procedure' according to police. Ambulance Victoria would not comment on the latest case, but has issued repeated warnings against leaving children in cars. In the first five weeks of the year, paramedics were called to 200 cases. Most recently, a young girl had to be rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital after being locked in a hot vehicle at Maribyrnong, 4km west of Melbourne, for just half an hour after her mother couldn't open the doors. 'The girl was sweating profusely and her clothes were drenched, so there was certainly potential for it to quickly become life threatening,' advanced life support paramedic Ben Dalton said. 'The MFB smashed a window to get the girl out of the car.' It comes after Ambulance Victoria were called in to help at least six young children locked in hot cars in separate incidents last week, and a total of 200 children in the first five weeks of 2015 . Mr Dalton said two children have died in the last few years after being left in hot cars in Victoria, and it's frustrating the message is not getting through. 'Children can't regulate their body temperature like adults can, which puts them at significant risk,' he said. 'It's never okay to leave a child locked in a car, even for a minute or two.' The state government said it will increase penalties for leaving children in hot cars, with fines up to $3700 and jail time increased from three months to six months.","Victoria police confirmed 22-month-old boy was found dead in a hot cat .

"Newly released video shows a panting Rob Konrad looking to speak to his family after surviving an arduous swim for his life. The former fullback for the Miami Dolphins, 38, was picked up by police near the south Florida coast following an ordeal that started when a wave knocked him off his boat and the vessel went on without him on autopilot. Police video sees Mr Konrad, his hair still wet from his swim, sitting with Palm Beach officers inside their cruiser and asking to contact his loved ones. Scroll down for video . Video from a Palm Beach police cruiser shows former NFL player Rob Konrad, 38, right after his nine-mile swim . Mr Konrad, covered in a blanket, asked officers if he could call his family to let them know he was alive after the 16-hour ordeal . The man, who played in the NFL from 1999 to 2004, said 'Is there any chance I can get a phone to let my family know I’m alive?' Officers then called his mother and asked her to contact his wife Tammy, the video obtained by TMZ shows. He was given a bottle of water and the heat in the car was turned to the maximum, after he rang a beachfront house's doorbell and the police came, according to ESPN. Wrapped in a blanket, he was treated at a local hospital for hypothermia, dehydration, and the breakdown of his muscle tissue. The athlete, originally from Massachusetts, endured jellyfish stings and saw sharks below him during last month's 16-hour ordeal. He fell off nine miles from shore, but estimates that he swam a crooked 27 miles in the water from 1pm to around 5am in the morning. The former Miami Dolphin rang a beachfront house's doorbell after he completed what he estimated at 27 miles in the water . The athlete was treated for hypothermia, dehydration and the breakdown of muscle tissue after he made it ashore . Mr Konrad asked what time it was, and had previously thought it was only midnight, according to the Sun Sentinel. Neither a recreational fishing boat or a Coast Guard helicopter were able to spot him, despite his best efforts. Search parties were sent out after he missed a dinner date. He had been taking his 31-foot boat in for servicing when a wave rocked his boat right as he had hooked a fish. The boat, on autopilot, left Mr Konrad without a life preserver as it continued at 5mph. The former football player said that he decided he needed to swim to shore. 'After some time I just said look, I’m not dying tonight and I’m going to make it to shore,' he told a press conference. Mr Konrad will not face charges or be cited for any violations, according to the Palm Beach Post. The boat was later found in the Grand Bahamas with $70,000 worth of damage.

"Alan Pardew insists that the last thing Newcastle and Sunderland supporters should be doing is ‘fighting each other’ – and believes the Malaysian Airlines disaster has brought the rival fans closer together. A fund set up by a Sunderland supporter in memory of the two Newcastle fans killed when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in July raised more than £33,000. The teams face each other for the first time on Sunday since the clubs joined forces in tribute to John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who died on their way to watch the Magpies play in New Zealand. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has called for supporter calm ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby . Newcastle fans clashed with police after the 3-0 defeat by Sunderland at St James' Park in April, 2013 . Newcastle fans pay tribute to the two supporters that lost their lives in the Malaysian Airlines disaster . The Tyne-Wear derby has been heavily policed in recent seasons amid fear of trouble and in April, 2013 Newcastle fans - following a 3-0 home defeat - clashed with law enforcers as they rampaged in the city centre. One man was later jailed for punching a police horse. Pardew, though, senses an effort to make the fixture about the passion on the pitch rather than vitriol in the stands. ‘I am hearing the right stuff on the radio and in the street about the levels of antagonism between the two clubs dying down a little bit to what it's really about – a football match. I am really pleased about that and hope it carries through to Sunday,’ he said. ‘I said two years ago that this nasty hate – those kinds of words – needed to go out. It’s a rivalry, a game of football, may the best team win and then we shake hands and go home. John Alder and Liam Sweeney were on board flight MH17 on their way to watch Newcastle in New Zealand . One Newcastle supporter was arrested for punching a police horse . Pardew said the last thing the North East should be doing is fighting each other . ‘The last thing the North East should be doing is fighting each other. But, at the same time, we know it's a massive rivalry and the passion of the game shouldn't be lost.’ There has been suggestion that Newcastle fans could applaud during the 33rd minute of the match in a show of thanks for the money raised for charity by the JustGiving fund. And Pardew added: ‘The incident with the Malaysian flight has definitely helped build bridges and we need to carry on doing that. ‘The way the Sunderland fans contributed and the effort they made has made great steps to help this fixture become what it should be, a spectacle for the North East. Not something where we have to order extra police.’ Sunderland boss Gus Poyet suggests that alcohol should not be sold on the day of the Tyne-Wear derby . Pubs in Newcastle, meanwhile, have confirmed that they will not be serving alcohol before 10am. That is three-and-a-half hours before kick-off and Sunderland boss Gus Poyet would rather drink was banned entirely on derby day. ‘You want a friendly derby? Don’t sell alcohol (throughout) the whole day in Newcastle and maybe you’ve got a chance,’ he said. ‘But if you’re going to let everybody go to the pub and you want them to behave, you’re a little bit naive. Quite naive. ‘But I’m a head coach, I’m not in the police department. I’m not going to make that decision. But let’s not be too naive.’","Newcastle host Sunderland on Sunday in the Premier League .

"A woman who forged her dying partner's will in an attempt to cheat his family out of £15,000 was caught when his belongings were spotted for sale on eBay. Ingrid Lee, 57, had told Terence Powell's children that he had not left a will when he died of cancer aged 57, but later claimed he had bequeathed his entire estate to her. They became suspicious when they spotted his belongings being sold online, and when they asked for a formal reading of the will discovered that Mr Powell's signature had been forged. Ingrid Lee, 57, (right) forged the will of her dying partner Terence Powell (left) in an attempt to cheat his family out of £15,000 was caught when his belongings were spotted for sale on eBay . In the weeks before Mr Powell died, Lee had even persuaded her ex-husband Christopher, 62, to help with the fakery - convincing him to provide two witnesses and an executor for the will which would have given her a potential £15,000. Both Lee and her former husband admitted one charge of forgery on what would have been the first day of their trial at Worcester Crown Court yesterday, but were spared an immediate prison term. She was sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for two years while Christopher, of Handsworth, Birmingham, was sentenced to 10 months in prison, suspended for 18 months. Lee had told Terence Powell's children that their father, pictured before his death, had not left a will when he died of cancer aged 57, but later claimed he had bequeathed his entire estate to her . When Mr Powell was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2009, Lee took over the management of the business as well as caring for him . Lee admitted one charge of forgery on what would have been the first day of her trial at Worcester Crown Court yesterday, but was spared an immediate prison term . They were both ordered to pay court costs of £1,400 each within 12 months. Recorder Andrew Mainds said: 'It is quite clear Ingrid Lee had loved Mr Powell and had contributed a great deal to a relationship ended by his tragic death and decided she wanted some recompense.' The court heard Mr Powell, from Worcester, ran a car refurbishment business when he met Lee in 2003 following her 'acrimonious divorce' from  husband Christopher. Lee had even persuaded her ex-husband Christopher, 62, (left) to help with the fakery - convincing him to provide two witnesses and an executor for the will which would have given her a potential £15,000 . The couple bought a £700,000 mock-Spanish house in Worcester which they fitted out with jacuzzis as well as splashing out on a canal boat and a fleet of luxury cars. And when he was diagnosed with lymphoma in 2009 she took over the management of the business as well as caring for him. After he died on December 14, 2010, she initially told his grown-up children he had not made a will but later changed her story and claimed Mr Powell left his estate to her. Prosecutor Charles Hamer told the court: 'Ingrid Lee had been with Mr Powell for five or six years up to his death and had put up the money from a previous inheritance into buying a £700,000 property. 'The terms of the purchase meant she did not get its full value upon his death. 'She had also put cash into his car-refurbishing business but it was close to collapse and the staff, including two of his children were not being paid. 'That was the motive for her to falsify the will.' Mr Powell's sons Simon, 35, Aaron, 37 and daughter Victoria, 24, became suspicious and asked for a formal reading of the will to take place in a solicitor's office. Mr Hamer told the court the document 'looked like something downloaded from the internet, which is was.' The police were called in and handwriting expert revealed Mr Powell's signature had been forged, probably by Lee, the court heard. Harpreet Sandhu, defending Lee, said: 'She found herself dealing with Mr Powell's failing health from cancer as well as his failing business interests. 'Through his relationship with her, he was able to lead a life that would otherwise not have been available to him. 'Over the course of six years, she lost everything because she indulged him.' The couple bought a £700,000 mock-Spanish house in Worcester which they fitted out with jacuzzis . The court was told that Lee had put up the money from a previous inheritance into buying the £700,000 house . The couple also splashed out on this canal boat prior to Mr Powell's death . Mr Powell's Jaguar and Mini, which were left to his three children, along with some jewellery . The court heard Lee was now penniless and was paying off her mortgage at a rate of just £1 a month. Andrew Baker, defending Christopher Lee, said: 'Heaven alone knows why he became involved. 'He had an acrimonious divorce and his relationship with Mr Powell was very difficult, there could be no financial gain for him.' Speaking after the hearing, Mr Powell's son Simon, 35, from Kidderminster, said he believed his father had been the victim of an elaborate con. He said: 'My father is turning in his grave. He was a strong man, and didn't put up with nonsense. 'He was taken advantage of, and I feel he was trying to tell us, but we thought his condition was whey he was being oddly behaved. 'He told me he had made a will in 2007 or 2008 and that everyone would be looked after. I now think he may have believed he had made a will but nothing has ever been found. Two examples of Mr Powell's signature (left, and centre), with the one used on the forged will (right) A friend of Simon Powell spotted an old red telephone box for sale on eBay, and suspected it might have belonged to his father . 'I feel my father was duped. The court case only heard Ingrid's side of the story. The truth is, my father was a successful businessman. 'He and Ingrid ran the business together and made a lot of money. They bought a beautiful £700,000 house with jacuzzi rooms and Spanish-style tiles. 'It was huge. The also went on lavish holidays together and enjoyed the good life. When my dad died I believed that his estate would come to his children but Ingrid took the lot. 'At first she told us there was no will and then she said there was one but it was obviously a fake. It left all his possessions, including the house and business, to her. 'It just didn't ring true and when we got the signature analysed it was proved to be a forgery. Mr Powell's son Simon (pictured) said his father would be 'turning in his grave' Simon, pictured with his father in 2009, said he thought Mr Powell's estate would go to his children . Mr Powell pictured in 2009 with his daughter Victoria. He also had another son, Aaron . Mr Powell (right) in 2009 with (left to right) his niece Jessica, brother Andy and mother Claira - who is said to be 'traumatised' by what happened with Lee .

'So in all we ended up with a Jaguar, a Mini and some jewellery. Effectively it amounts to little between the three of us, perhaps a few thousand pounds each. 'The sentence is not an issue to me really, maybe we, the family, wanted her to be in jail. 'The fact that she had admitted it, and has to live with it is okay for me..

"Spanish police say they have arrested two men for the death of a football fan following a brutal street fight between rival radical fan groups before a match in Madrid two weeks ago. Spanish police wrote on their official Twitter account that '32 ultras arrested in Madrid, Avila and Toledo for the violent incidents at Manzanares, among them, 2 alleged perpetrators of the homicide.' On November 30, a large clash between Atletico Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna 'ultra' groups led to 43-year-old Deportivo fan Francisco Javier Romero Taboada dying later from injuries after he fell into the Manzanares River during the fight.

"Here was one encounter with Liverpool when Nigel Pearson would have been more justified in rattling off a few expletives. Last month Pearson was given a touchline ban after letting rip at one of his club’s fans when provoked during his side’s 3-1 defeat at home by Liverpool. On Sunday, Leicester’s manager remained rather restrained, calling only for the introduction of video technology to avoid the kind of decisions that proved so costly to his struggling side. But the first of two penalties that were awarded to Liverpool would have angered any manager at Anfield, given that Mike Jones punished Wes Morgan for handball when Raheem Sterling’s cross struck the Leicester captain square in the face.

Jeffrey Schlupp equalised for Leicester - click here for our brilliant Match Zone service . Steven Gerrard’s two penalties took Liverpool’s goal tally from the spot to 100 in the Premier League, more than any other side have managed. Any sense of injustice was softened for Pearson by the response from his players: two stunning second-half goals from David Nugent and Jeffrey Schlupp in less than two minutes that underlined just how well they performed. But when a team sits bottom they need wins, not draws, and Pearson will regard this as two points lost rather than one gained. It was one of those games that leaves both managers feeling a little bruised; the frustration for Brendan Rodgers his side’s failure to build on the momentum of successive victories. If Rodgers thought his side had turned a corner with that dynamic display against Swansea on Monday night, they seemed to run into a bit of a dead end again here. Philippe Coutinho delivered another fine attacking performance but as a team Liverpool certainly lacked the flair and pace of that 4-1 demolition of Swansea, instead showing the usual defensive frailties that explain why they are conceding as many goals as they score this season. Wes Morgan was adjudged to have handled when Sterling's cross smacked him in the face inside the area .

The Leicester players surrounded the official after Liverpool were given a penalty in the first half . Philippe Coutinho slides a ball past Foxes midfielder Danny Drinkwater as Liverpool took charge from the off . Rodgers acknowledged his players made ‘too many mistakes’, even if he also complained of ‘fatigue’ in this busy Christmas period. It will give him no pleasure to learn that this was only the third time in the Premier League that Liverpool have thrown away a two-goal lead. Buoyed by a first win in 99 days last weekend, Leicester started this encounter in some style. They were the better team and, had the excellent Riyad Mahrez been more accurate with his finishing, could have been ahead. After little more than a minute Mahrez had seen a free kick bounce off a stranded Simon Mignolet’s left-hand post and the Algerian should have scored a few minutes later when Schlupp escaped Emre Can. Mahrez sent his close-range shot both high and wide. A Liverpool side strengthened by the return of Gerrard but short of goalscoring options, with Mario Balotelli not even on the bench bceause of injury, according to a club spokesman, offered little until that controversial 17th-minute penalty. Coutinho sparked the move that led to the incident that so incensed Leicester, sending Sterling clear with a marvellous pass. But Morgan did everything you might expect from a captain and central defender, moving swiftly to recover the ground on the young England forward and launching himself to block the shot. For showing such courage and athleticism Morgan really deserved better. Gary Lineker was so angry he described it on Twitter as the ‘worst decision ever’; a measure as much of his passion for Leicester as a referee’s incompetence. Coutinho was barged in the back by Leicester defender Danny Simpson as Leicester tried to find a way back into the game .

Hapless referee Mike Jones started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding Liverpool a penalty when the ball appeared to hit Leicester's Wes Morgan on the head as he slid to block Raheem Sterling's cross. Jones clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of Morgan but replays showed that was not the case. Referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened. Mahrez would threaten again with a free kick that was deflected over Mignolet’s crossbar but with Coutinho very much at the centre of things Liverpool were playing with more purpose. Adam Lallana went close and when Coutinho darted into the area and attempted to lift the ball into the path of his advancing team-mates, Danny Simpson foolishly halted its progress with an outstretched hand. Pearson thought it harsh as well but this time Jones got it right. It was handball and Gerrard struck again, six minutes before the break. From a corner Liverpool then tried something rather more spectacular, with Lallana inviting Henderson to try his luck with a volley from outside the 18-yard box. Henderson connected beautifully, but his effort whistled just wide. The first half concluded with Pearson talking to a police officer who was patrolling the technical area. He joked afterwards that he had not been arrested. After the break Alberto Moreno very nearly increased Liverpool’s lead, but with the loss of Lallana to a thigh injury after 55 minutes came a slight loss of impetus. Within four minutes Leicester had scored, Jamie Vardy chesting a ball forward from Matty James into the path of Nugent and inviting the former England striker to score with a spectacular hitch-kick style half-volley. No sooner had the game restarted than Leicester struck again, with Schlupp guiding a left-foot shot from outside the penalty area past Can and beyond Mignolet, who for some reason did not even move. Further opportunities would follow for both sides, with Jones opting not to award another penalty against Morgan for a challenge on Fabio Borini. If he was feeling more generous towards Morgan after that first-half error, it was the least Leicester deserved.","Mike Jones awarded Liverpool two questionable penalties in the first half .

"Hollywood actor Pierce Brosnan has started renovations on his Malibu home after a dramatic blaze ripped through it, last week. The star's California mansion caught fire last Wednesday evening, causing an estimated $1 million worth of devastating damage. A clean-up crew were seen arriving at the property on Thursday to embark on damage restoration. Scroll down for video . Repairing the damage: Hollywood actor Pierce Brosnan has started renovations on his Malibu home after a dramatic blaze ripped through it, last week . Wearing a safety hard-hat, a worker could be seen using a wheelbarrow to transport charred goods onto a lorry for clearance. And, although much of the content was unidentifiable, there was certainly a considerable amount of it. In fact,  he could be seen filling the vehicle several times which deftly illustrates the scale of the destruction. Clear-out: A clean-up crew were seen arriving at the property on Thursday to embark on damage restoration . KTLA reports that as many as 20 firefighters responded to the first-alarm residential fire and put the flames out within 30 minutes. As a result, only the garage and a nearby guest bedroom sustained any damage. Brosnan, who was home with wife Keely Shaye Smith and two of his sons at the time, Dylan and Paris, could be seen distraught as he spoke on his phone while firefighters put out the blaze. TMZ report that Brosnan said in his 911 call 'I've got to go now in case I get blown up'. Investigators stayed on the scene at the 13,000 square-foot residence for hours after the blaze was put out as they tried to determine what the cause was. One neighbor, Andy Stern, claimed; 'Their last house totally burned down several years ago, then it took them several years to build this house.' Concerned: Pierce Brosnan was spotted outside his home in Malibu on Wednesday evening after the garage caught fire . Safe: Pierce Brosnan's Malibu home caught fire on Wednesday evening, but the actor remains unharmed. He was seen outside with police officers during the blaze . Los Angeles County firefighters responded to emergency calls to put out the fire at the Hollywood star's property, estimated to be worth $18.5 million, at 9:48pm local time on 11 February. It took around 50 firefighters to distinguish the blaze in around 35 minutes. Brosnan, who is best known for his role as James Bond in movies including Die Another Day and GoldenEye, was pictured outside of his mansion at the time of the fire. An additional clip has surfaced online, taken by a supposed nearby witness from Malibu, showing the fire going at full strength. Taking action: Los Angeles County firefighters were called out to put out the fire at the Hollywood star's property at 9:48pm local time . Putting out the blaze: Around 50 firefighters were able to distinguish the fire in 35 minutes, according to reports . To the rescue: Luckily for the Brosnan family the emergency services responded promptly to get the blaze under control . Aftermath: The Malibu property was taped off by the emergency services the following day . Damage: Fire ravaged remains from the blaze could clearly be seen on the mansion's driveway . NBC journalist Kenny Holmes posted pictures on Twitter of the actor outside with firefighters during the incident. He added: 'Heavy smoke & fire last night from the garage of Pierce Brosnan's Malibu home. No injuries. Damage to garage/bedroom.' MailOnline has contacted a representative for Pierce Brosnan and is awaiting comment. The large home is said to be one of Malibu's finest beach-front properties, with neighbours including Danny DeVito and Dustin Hoffman. Most recently, the 61-year-old actor appeared in a Super Bowl commercial. The new Kia Sorento Super Bowl advert - entitled The Perfect Getaway - sees Pierce attempt to go back to his 007 roots. Unharmed: The 61-year-old actor was safely away from the fire when it ripped through his garage . He finds himself disappointed as his agent pitches him a movie role that lacks his flair for action and adventure. The clip sees the actor sitting in a luxurious office waiting to line up his next globe trotting onscreen adventure, only to have his hopes dashed. Soon every expectation is dashed for the star, as he learns he will not be contending with snipers and missile launchers but instead will have to settle for pleasant encounters with natural beauty and wildlife while driving a modest Kia Sorento. The vehicle his agent is pitching - a fuel efficient family SUV - is a far cry from the zippy super cars he is used to in his various action movie roles. But just when he thinks all hope is lost he asks if the scene he is being pitched ends in an explosion... which it doesn't. He does however get some fireworks in the form of a lovely woman waiting for him in a snowy cabin his modest car arrives to at the end of the pitch. The Irish actor has been married to wife Keely Shaye Smith for over ten years; the couple have two teenage sons together, Dylan and Paris.

"A homeless woman and mother of three whose baby was found dead at a Detroit-area recycling center with his umbilical cord still attached weeks after she gave birth alone in an unheated garage was charged Wednesday with murder and child abuse. The boy, born just a few days before Christmas, 'must have suffered greatly' while left in the garage with low temperatures in the 30s, Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said. Angela Alexie, 24, appeared in court in handcuffs, with her head down and her long hair covering her face as a detective offered details about a case that has gripped the region for two weeks. She has plead not guilty to the charges. Angela Alexie (above) was in court Wednesday and charged with murdering her newborn son . Alexie 'disposed of the body with recycling' according to authorities, and it was later found at a local plant (above) This after Alexie let the baby freeze to death in a garage right after he was born . Investigators initially believed the baby might be a missing newborn from the Lansing area, 85 miles west, but tests ruled that out. Police were stumped about the boy's identity until crucial tips rolled in due to news coverage. Eastpointe Judge Carl Gerds set bond at $1 million and said he would appoint a lawyer for Alexie. She told investigators that she gave birth in a garage in Eastpointe on Dec. 22, behind a home where she was living temporarily, Berlin said. The infant survived just a few days, likely dying due to exposure. 'She made statements that she'd go out every couple hours, try to feed him and see if he was all right until he passed away,' the police chief said. The body was discovered on Jan. 14 at a recycling center nearby in Roseville. Alexie, who is homeless, has three other children . Alexie denied placing the body in a recycling bin for curbside pickup, Berlin said, but 'we believe she acted alone.' He said she didn't give a reason for her actions. Alexie had three other children, ages 1 to 4, but doesn't have custody of them. The 1-year-old was also born without medical assistance, Berlin said. If convicted, she could face life in prison. Bond was set at $1million dollars and a probable cause hearing for was scheduled for February 4.","Angela Alexie of Detroit, Michigan has been charged with murdering her newborn son .

"Four cancer-stricken children died at Great Ormond Street Hospital after a series of failures in stem cell transplants at the world-renowned hospital, an inquest has heard. The young patients, aged between one and 12, were among eight children whose transplants failed when the stem cell freezing system - used in life-saving operations - inexplicably stopped working. Four children went on to recover. But well-known charity fundraiser Sophie Ryan Palmer, 12, one-year-old Ryan Loughran, four-year-old Katie Joyce and Muhanna al-Hayany, also four, died between July and October last year. The children's hospital has now admitted that Katie might have survived if it had acted more quickly to resolve the problems. Lawyers for two of the families have also accused Great Ormond Street of taking too long to stop the transplants once concerns arose. At an inquest into the deaths this week, the court heard that doctors were initially dumbfounded as to why the procedures suddenly started failing after a decade of success, the Guardian reports. The transplanted stem cells were intended to help the child's bone marrow, damaged during chemotherapy, grow again to maximise the chance of recovery. Concerns were first raised in June 2013 when Sophie, who had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, failed to make progress after her transplant. By October that year, the hospital realised that a more patients than usual who had undergone stem cell transplants between March and August had suffered setbacks. Scientists immediately stopped freezing stem cells on site at the hospital base Bloomsbury and launched an investigation. But, by then, three of the eight patients had died. Ryan Loughran, from Bournemouth, died on 10 July while Sophie, from Sunbury in Middlesex, died on 17 July. Katie, from Hertfordshire, died on 6 October. Muhanna, who had come from Kuwait to have the treatment, received stem cells at the same time as those three and died in August this year. Concerns were first raised at the world-famous hospital (pictured) in June 2013. The hospital closed down its stem cell freezing laboratory in October that year . Doctors from the hospital told St Pancras coroner's court that they regretted not stopping the process soon and that Katie's life might have been saved if they had. By then, staff were 'very concerned' that Sophie was progressing very slowly, the court heard. But they believed they were doing the right thing by continuing with the transplants because 'cancer doesn't wait', the court heard. Dr Nicholas Goulden, divisional director for the infection, cancer and immunity and laboratory medicine unit at Great Ormond Street, told the court it was a 'reasonable decision at the time' but that the hospital does regret it now. He said: 'The saddest thing of all, the heartbreaking thing for you all, is that [Katie] would have had a good chance – the disease was under control. 'I think it is important to say to the families, while I think it was a reasonable decision at the time, we do regret it now. We would all dearly love to understand if there could have been something we could have done.' He also stressed that he thought she died as a result of a lung injury due to toxicity linked to her transplant. The court heard worried physicians and scientists had 'exhausted every possibility', testing the frozen cells, the freezers and the labs repeatedly. But they were forced to close the cryopreservation laboratory in October last year when they could not find the cause. The mystery was finally solved by stem cell expert Dr Michael Watts, from University College London Hospitals in Euston who discovered the failure was in the method of freezing the cells. The result was that the cells were alive and appeared healthy were unable to mature properly. Sophie had become well-known after she raised £18,000 for cancer charities. She also shaved her hair off to raise money. She had been diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of two and had undergone three bone marrow transplants. Before she died, her friends and family raised £6,000 so she could carry out a 'wishlist' while undergoing treatment, which included swimming with dolphins and meeting singer Peter Andre. Katie also received media attention for her battle against neuroblastoma. Former Arsenal stars played in a charity match to raise money for the hospital. At the inquest, a senior doctor at the hospital urged the coroner to write to all hospitals and research centres to encourage them them to pool information and produce a national register to avoid similar tragedies. The hospital has since overhauled its procedures to prevent further incidents and there are calls for the deaths to lead to tighter procedures around how stem cells are stored at hospitals and research centres across the UK. But, seventeen months on, it is still investigating why the freezing process stopped working after a decade of success. The coroner, Mary Hassell, is due to deliver her verdicts on all four deaths on Tuesday.","Patients, aged one to 12, among eight children whose transplants failed .

"The number of Americans who see illegal immigration as the nation's most pressing problem has spiked from 3 per cent to 17 per cent since May, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. That percentage now tops government corruption, the U.S. economy, jobs, health care and every other hot-button issue, driven by a flood of tens of thousands of illegal immigrant children pouring across the U.S.-Mexico border. When Gallup announced the results of the same poll in two months age, 'immigration' and 'illegal aliens' ranked eleventh out of 47 issues, attracting a deep level of worry from fewer Americans than those who put homelessness or foreign aid at the top of their lists. Scroll down for video . One in six Americans now say 'illegal aliens' are the most important U.S. problem, judging from the language Gallup used in its telephone surveys of more than 1,000 adults . But since then horror stories about children of all ages crossing illegally into the United States, most of them accompanied only by mercenary 'coyotes,' have dominated national news. American taxpayers are on the hook for costs associated with housing, feeding and legally processing the minors. 'The numbers have doubled since 2011,' Catholic Relief Services regional director for Latin America Richard Jones told a U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday. Gallup found that growing concerns about illegal immigration are largely driven by Americans in western states, where 24 per cent say it's the most pressing U.S. problem. Wednesday's spike nationwide is at its highest since 2006, when the U.S. Senate debated and passed President Obama's comprehensive immigration reform bill – which has yet to have a hearing in the House of Representatives. Obama is now asking Congress to authorize $3.7 billion in new spending to respond to the border crisis, money that Republicans are reluctant to approve since little of it would be earmarked for strengthening border security. Some Democrats in recent days have seemed to welcome the deluge of 'unaccompanied alien children,' the term used by the Department of Health and Human Services. 'We are all connected. We can't just build a wall or a fence and say no more,' Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis tweeted on Tuesday. 'This is America. Our doors are open.' Most politicians on the political left are pointing to Obama's languishing legislative proposal as the answer. His plan would stop immigration officials from pursuing the deportation of millions of existing illegal immigrants, instead focusing resources on intercepting new border-jumpers. 'Our nation’s immigration system is broken, which requires genuine, comprehensive reform,' tweeted House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat. The question of what to do with more than 400 Central American children who reach the U.S. each day while they wait to see an immigration judge has become a heated one, with state after state declining to bear the financial burdens beyond what the federal government is willing to pay. Concerns about communicable diseases have made those concerns all the more newsworthy. Connecticut became the latest state to say 'no mas' on Tuesday, refusing to open a largely decommissioned facility for developmentally disabled adults. The institution was slated to house 2,000 child immigrants. Anti-immigration activist Judy Lairmore was one of about 300 people protested the arrival of buses carrying illegal immigrants on Tuesday in Oracle, Arizona, where they were to be housed . Back they go (in small numbers); Women and their children are being deported back to Honduras (shown) and other countries, but in tiny numbers compared to how many are entering each day . President Obama has borne the brunt of anger from many Americans, especially those in western states, who have become impatient with a government they say is catering too much to immigrants who cross the border illegally . In the city of Lynn, Massachusetts, which has absorbed at least 600 such children, public schools and hospitals are stretched to their breaking point. Mayor Judith Flanagan Kennedy told Fox25 in Boston that 'it's gotten to the point where the school system is overwhelmed, our health department is overwhelmed, the city's budget is being substantially altered in order to accommodate all of these admissions in the school department.' More than 600 new students have enrolled in public schools since May, including 248 from Guatemala – 126 of whom are illegal immigrant minors. 'Many of them [will] do two years in the ninth grade,' the city's school superintendent said, noting that a large number are illiterate. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has agreed to open up his city's services to illegal immigrant children, drawing the ire of homeless advocates who say Angelenos living on the streets need help first. In Westminster, Maryland, a building that will soon be the site of temporary child housing was defaced with graffiti on Saturday. 'NO ILLEAGLES HERE. NO UNDOCUMENTED DEMOCRATS,' read the spray-painted scrawl, according to the Associated Press. 'Hate crime': Maryland State Police are investigating this graffiti spray-painted on a former military building proposed as housing for illegal immigrant children . The exterior wall was partially repainted this week . But most of the temporary housing is being set up in border states like Texas, where the Baptist Child & Family Services charity has received a $50 million federal government contract to purchase and operate a Texas resort hotel as a 600-bed luxury detention center for children who have just snuck into the U.S. from the south. The property features two swimming pools and a tennis facility. The Americans for Legal Immigration PAC has organized more than 170 protests nationwide for Friday and Saturday, attracting Americans upset with President Obama for accommodating the influx of new immigrants. The administration is hampered by a 2008 law that requires the federal government to offer temporary housing to children from 'OTM' countries – those 'other than Mexico.' The measure was passed in order to provide relief to minors fleeing human traffickers and sexual slavery. Republicans in Congress say granting Obama's latest funding request should be predicated on a change in that law so the U.S. can immediately deport such children, as it already does with Mexican nationals. They also allege that the White House's sudden immigration policy shift in 2012, which delayed the deportation of people brought to the U.S. as children before 2007, sent a message that the U.S. will welcome children regardless of their legal status.","17 per cent of Americans put illegal immigration at the top of their lists of U.S. concerns, the highest-ranking item on a list of 47 issues .

"Discovered: The body of Kosta Karageorge was found on Sunday in a dumpster two blocks from his Columbus, Ohio, apartment . A neuropathologist will look for signs of traumatic brain injury in an Ohio State football player who was found dead in a dumpster with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and had a  history of concussions. Kosta Karageorge, was discovered in the trash bin days after sending his mother cryptic texts apologizing for being 'an embarrassment' because of his repeated head injuries. The examination, not normally part of the autopsy process, is being done on Kosta Karageorge because of that history, the Franklin County coroner Dr. Anahi Ortiz said on Monday. Police spokesman Sgt. Rich Weiner said police received a call around 2:30 p.m. on Sunday from someone reporting a body found in the trash bin in Columbus. Weiner said a woman and her son apparently were looking for items in the dumpster when they found the body, which had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 'At this time we are able to confirm through tattoos here at the scene that it is the body of Kosta Karageorge,' Weiner said. Weiner also revealed that a handgun was recovered from the dumpster. Police found the body near the campus after a search began when Karageorge went missing Wednesday. The senior defensive tackle had last been seen at his apartment in Columbus, when his roommates said he left to go on a walk. Susan Karageorge told police she had received a text from her son about 1:30am on Wednesday that said, 'I am sorry if I am an embarrassment but these concussions have my head all f***ed up.' The body was found within a couple hundred yards of Karageorge's home and about a half block from High Street, the main artery of the campus. Sunday evening, no one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the metal door of Karageorge's apartment. Players knew of Karageorge's history of concussions, teammate Michael Bennett, a defensive tackle, said Monday. 'We knew he had a lot of concussions and we were worried about that. But we didn't see any side effects of it,' Bennett said. Dr. Tom McAllister, chairman of psychiatry at Indiana University, who has studied concussions in college athletes, said that brain injuries seem to increase the likelihood of depression.

"A popular model was today axed from the South African edition of lads' mag FHM after she was accused of making racist comments on Twitter. The publication confirmed Jessica Leandra Dos Santos, 20, would no longer appear in its photoshoots after she caused outrage by using a taboo term for black people in a tweet. The attractive model, known as Jessica Leandra, was widely condemned after she yesterday tweeted details of a confrontation with a black man in her local supermarket. Criticised: Jessica Leandra Dos Santos, 20, was removed from FHM's pages  photoshoots after she caused outrage by tweeting a taboo term for black people . She wrote: 'Just, well took on an arrogant and disrespectful kaffir [an offensive term for a black person in Afrikaans] inside Spar. Should have punched him, should have.' The tweet immediately sparked outrage across South Africa, where race relations remain a key issue just 18 years after the end of apartheid. FHM editor Brendan Cooper today condemned Leandra's use of the 'k-word', which is still considered one of the country's most racially-charged terms. He added that she had been stripped with immediate effect of her title as winner of one of the magazine's model competitions. In a statement he said: 'FHM was appalled by Jessica Leandra Dos Santos' racist tweets and would like to formally announce that she has been stripped of her title as winner of the FHM Modelbook 2011 competition with immediate effect. 'It's important to us that it is noted that she in no way represents the magazine; she was merely the winner of an online poll we ran, and that we totally distance ourselves from her blatantly racist comments. 'We have removed all pictures of her from our website and will have nothing to do with her in future. FHM is a proudly South African magazine and say ""No"" to racism.' Leandra's axing from FHM came months after the aspiring glamour model found stardom as the winner of one of the magazine's talent-spotting competitions. Controversy: The public and FHM editor Brendan Cooper today condemned Leandra's use of the 'k-word', which is still considered one of the country's most racially-charged terms . She beat a string of would-be models to win the competition last year and has since appeared several times on the pages and website of the magazine alongside other work in advertising campaigns and fashion shoots. However Leandra's career today appeared to have crashed and burned after her remarks sparked outrage across South Africa. The model has deleted her offensive tweet amid the controversy alongside another angry posting in which she wrote: 'Highlight of my weekend? Almost punching an #Engen petrol assistant. No tolerance for rude African monkeys whatsoever!' The former cover girl today faced furious attacks on the social networking site, where she was the top trending topic in South Africa. Thousands of furious members of the public posted comments condemning the model, who also reportedly faces an investigation by South Africa's Human Rights Council. Meanwhile one Leandra's main sponsors also confirmed on Twitter it had stripped her of a contract. Weightloss firm Quick Trim tweeted: 'Due to the severity of the remarks by #JessicaLeandra #QuickTrimSA herewith ends our sponsorship to her with immediate effect!' Leandra today apologised for her outburst and claimed she had posted her tweet only after being sexually harassed. The model, who describes herself on her website as 'a woman of clear visions', admitted her comment had been irresponsible. She wrote: 'I tweeted rather irresponsibly about an incident I encountered last night, using a harsh and unkind word about the gentleman who had confronted me with sexual remarks and sounds. Shocking comments: The tweet sparked outrage across South Africa, where race relations remain a key issue just 18 years after the end of apartheid . 'Many of you don't necessarily know the details of the incident, and I also don't intend on going into them but I do wish you knew where my anger originally boiled from. 'I strongly believe that no lady should brush off any kind of sexual harassment or arrogance from anyone be it a man or woman of any colour. 'It is no surprise that my comment has offended many people and for this I am apologetic. 'There is no excuse to act out loudly over my social networking accounts and I do apologise to those that have taken offence to my language. 'Whilst most of you would enjoy the opportunity to throw a few vicious words at me, please do understand that I was acting in pure anger and frustration at the time and although we know this is no excuse, it is a lesson learned and again, I am sincerely apologetic.' The 'K-word' remains one of the most explosive and offensive terms in South Africa. Derived from the Islamic term 'kafir', meaning non-believer or liar, it entered common usage as a derogatory term for blacks. The word was used widely during the apartheid period but is now considered taboo. The use of racist language has been illegal in South Africa since the country's new constitution was enacted following the advent of democracy.","Jessica Leandra used word 'kaffir' - a derogatory term for a black person .

"One of the University of Alberta's oldest underclassmen is a 60-year-old man who's come back to school to study the cancer that ended his wife's life. Powel Crosley's wife Sladjana died in 2009 at the age of 58 due to granulosa, a rare form of ovarian cancer. Only 5 per cent of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed as granulosa. CBS News reports Crosely spent his career to now in information technology, and enrolled in cllege again in 2010. Powel Crosley, seen here with wife Sladjana, who died of a rare type of ovarian cancer in 2009, has returned to school at the age of 60 to study the disease that took her from him . 'The main thing I'm trying to do is come up with an effective treatment,' he said. Crosley especially hopes to find better drugs for patients than many now which are 'highly toxic' He's now doing course work in biochemistry and oncology and has secured a $60,000 grant to continue researching. A promising drug developed by the University of Illinois is among the compounds he's currently testing. The drug, Pac-1, has shown some results with lymphoma, which carries a mortality rate of 85 per cent. He's also hoping to find something easier for patients to process. 'Many of the drugs are highly toxic,' he told reporters. In Sladjana's case, the fatal problem came from internal bleeding cause by a medication. She was initially diagnosed in 1996. Despite undergoing six major surgeries and multiple clinical trials, the cancer metastasized to her liver and lungs. 'They . told us they caught it early, they told us there was no sign of  the . disease, they told us it wouldn't come back,'he told CBS News. Much as her husband is doing now, she studied scientific literature about her cancer for 13 years and was the one who found literature pointing to Pac-1. Crosley has helped get a $60,000 grant to continue his research at the University of Alberta . She also founded the Granulosa Cell Tumor Research Foundation to help patients get information about their disease. Her husband has since taken over running the foundation. 'She . had tremendous drive and determination to look into things and achieve . things.' Crosely said. 'She was incredibly intelligent and just a very strong person. 'Her motto was: The answer lies in the lab. She was pretty persistent about things she . believed in. And so I'm just basically completing her mission.'","Powel Crosley's wife Sladjana died in 2009 at the age of 58 due to granulosa, a rare form of ovarian cancer .

"Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has landed a $3.4m job for a Wall Street investment bank just months after being ousted by a Tea Party candidate, it was announced on Tuesday. The Virginia Republican, who lost his primary this summer and subsequently resigned his congressional seat, will serve as a vice chairman and managing director of Moelis and Co. the investment bank. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission uncovered by Bloomberg News reporter Erik Schatzker show that Cantor stands to earn $3.4 million in cash and stocks by joining the investment firm - a cushy deal for the recently ousted member of Congress. Cantor was making a fraction of that - $174,000 a year - before he left Congress in mid-August. In this June 11, 2014, photo, then House Majority Leader Eric Cantor speaks at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Cantor officially stepped down from his position in Congress last month after losing his party's primary to a political novice backed by the Tea Party . The filing shows that Cantor negotiated a $400,000 signing bonus for . himself and a $400,000 base salary. Next year, Moelis has agreed to give Cantor . an additional $1.2 million as incentive pay. The company will also grant Cantor $400,000 in restricted stocks that will be transferred to him quarterly in 2015 and $1,000,000 in restricted stocks that will be released to him incrementally upon his third anniversary at the company. Cantor won't receive the stocks, however, if the company fires him for cause or he leaves to take 'a full-time elected or appointed position in federal government, state government, or a national political party' before the agreed upon date. Furthermore, Cantor will have to repay some or all of his signing bonus or incentive pay from 2015 and 2016 if he goes back into politics before the second anniversary of the payment dates, giving the former lawmaker serious motivation not to return to politics anytime soon. 'I've got a lot to learn,' Cantor told the Wall Street Journal when it asked about a political comeback. 'I'm very focused on my next step.' Cantor told the Journal that talks between himself and Moelis founder Ken Moelis, whom he has know for three years, began just before the Fourth of July. The casual conversation between friends over a brunch in Los Angeles with their wives turned serious in late July, Cantor said. The Virginia Representative announced his resignation from Congress and called for a special election for his seat through an op-ed in a local newspaper on July 31, hours after his resignation as House Majority leader took effect and Congress was set to begin a month-long recess. His full resignation from the legislative body became official on August 18. Cantor's abrupt departure from the House of Representatives followed a shocking defeat in his party's primary by a Tea Party backed political novice named David Brat. Brat's upset victory in the race delivered a crushing blow to the rising Republican's political career and stopped his ascension to Speaker of the House dead in its tracks. The former congressional leader claimed in his op-ed that he was resigning because he wanted constituents have a 'clear and strong voice' during the 'consequential' lame duck session at the end of the year. If Brat wins the special election, which will be held concurrently with the general election in the heavily Republican district, he will be able to take office immediately instead of having to wait until January. The timing of Cantor's resignation raised questions about the genuine reason for his early retirement. Suspicions that it was tied to a future employment opportunity were all but confirmed by Cantor's own account of his hiring discussions with Moelis. 'After Dave Brat’s upset victory in June, many analysts accused Eric Cantor of paying more attention to Wall Street than to the people of Virginia’s 7th District. He certainly didn’t waste any time validating that theory,' Kevin Broughton, national communications director for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, said in a statement on Tuesday. Cantor, who was once the number two Republican in the House of Representatives, may have gotten the better end of the deal. The former Congressman stands to earn $3.4 million by joining investment banking firm Moelis as managing director . While Cantor, 51, has not previously worked on Wall Street, he has strong ties to the financial community, having raised $1.4 million from big banks and their employees since 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Cantor's wife, Diana, is also a partner at an privately-owned investment management firm, according to Forbes. She also serves on the boards of Domino's Pizza and Revlon. In the past she has served as a vice president at Goldman Sachs. Moelis' founder told Wall Street Journal on Monday that the firm was hiring Eric Cantor for his 'judgement and experience.' 'I have no need for a political figurehead,' Moelis said. 'What I want is a partner.' Cantor and his family won't be moving to New York, however, the Journal reports. The former Virginia representative will continue to reside in his home state and will be responsible for opening the firm's new branch in Washington, D.C., though he will have an office in the company's headquarters in New York.","House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was defeated in his party's primary by a Tea Party backed, political novice in June .

"Former South African president FW de Klerk has sparked outrage after he gave a television interview in which he appeared to justify elements of apartheid. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate, 76, faced widespread condemnation this morning after he told the American news network CNN he believed there was merit in the idea of different ethnic groups living apart. Mr De Klerk told CNN that the idea of ethnic communities being separated, as under apartheid, was 'not repugnant'. FW de Klerk spoke on CNN, saying the idea of separated ethnic communities was not repugnant . He added that black people were not deprived of power under the apartheid regime, saying: 'They were not disenfranchised, they voted' FW de Klerk and Nelson Mandela addressing crowds after Mandela's inauguration in 1994 . The former president served as South Africa's last white leader before the advent of democracy in 1994, and served as deputy president under Nelson Mandela until 1996. He was asked by CNN reporter Christiane Amanpour whether he believed apartheid had been morally repugnant. He answered: 'In as much as it trampled human rights it was and remains morally indefensible. 'I have made the most profound apology in front of the Truth Commission and on other occasions about the injustices which were wrought by apartheid.' But he added: 'What I haven't apologised for is the original concept of seeking to bring justice to all South Africans through the concept of nation states. 'In South Africa it failed. By the end of the 70s we had to realise, and accept and admit to ourselves that it had failed. And that is when fundamental reform started.' Mr De Klerk made his remarks as he spoke to CNN in Chicago, where he has been attending a summit of Nobel laureates. The statesman was awarded the peace prize jointly with Nelson Mandela in 1993 after the pair negotiated a peaceful end to apartheid. Mr De Klerk's National Party had previously controlled a white minority government in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. Former South African presidents Nelson Mandela, left, and FW de Klerk, right, pose with their Nobel Peace Prizes in Oslo in 1993 . The party brought in a series of draconian laws which formalised a system of apartheid in which racial groups were forced to live apart. By the late 1950s the apartheid government had developed its policy to include the creation of 'homelands' for the black population. The supposedly-autonomous states, which received little international recognition, comprised less than 15 per cent of South Africa's land but were designed to house around 80 percent of its people. The policy was greeted with mass protest by the country's majority black population, who were denied the vote and forced to obtain permits to visit or work in white areas. In his interview with CNN Mr De Klerk said he had initially believed in the concept of apartheid. He said: 'There is this picture that apartheid used to be compared to Nazism. De Klerk, right, meeting former Prime Minister John Major at Number 10 Downing Street in 1992 . 'It's wrong, and on that, I don't apologise for saying that what drove me as a young man, before I decided we need to embrace a new vision, was a quest to bring justice for black South Africans in a way which would not - that's what I believed then - destroy the justice to which my people were entitled.' He added: 'That's how I was brought up. And it was in an era when also in America and elsewhere, and across the continent of Africa, there was still not this realisation that we are trampling upon the human rights of people. So I'm a convert.' When he was asked a second time whether he believed the policy had been morally wrong, he said: 'I can only say in a qualified way. 'Inasmuch as it trampled human right, it was - and remains - and that I've said also publicly, morally reprehensible. 'But the concept of giving as the Czechs have it and the Slovaks have it, of saying that ethnic unities with one culture, with one language, can be happy and can fulfil their democratic aspirations in an own state, that is not repugnant. 'They were not put in homelands, the homelands were historically there. At that stage the goal was separate but equal, but separate but equal failed.' Mr De Klerk's comments today sparked a wave of outrage in South Africa.The former president was the top trending term on Twitter as thousands posted remarks condemning his views. Many called for the retired statesman to return his Nobel peace prize in light of his apparent unwillingness to accept apartheid was wrong. One tweeter, Nqubi, wrote: 'You see what forgiveness gets you.' Journalist Victor Dlamini added: 'I suppose De Klerk played a role in 'ending' Apartheid in the same way a hostage taker plays a role in ""releasing"" his hostage.' Another person wrote on Twitter: 'FW de Klerk remains a bitter apartheid apologist and defender. Can't say I am shocked.' Thabo Mekwa added: 'Oh de Klerk what have you done. Now you're helping create a new breed of young racists who were born in a democracy. 2 steps back for all.' Mr De Klerk stepped down from public life following Mr Mandela's election as president in 1994. The former statesman now lives in Cape Town and conducts work through the FW De Klerk Foundation. His spokesman Dave Stewart today said the retired statesman had not intended to cause offence. He said: 'What he was trying to say was that the Union of South Africa was an artificial creation. 'If you have an artificial creation you can go two ways - either by going your separate ways like in the Soviet Union or in what is being suggested for Israel and Palestine, or by trying to build a multicultural society. 'Mr De Klerk was saying that as a young man they tried to go for the first option in South Africa. 'They changed course when they realised it was not working.' He added: 'It is not immoral for the Afrikaners to want to rule themselves any more than it is for the Israelis or the Scots to wish for the same things. 'Mr De Klerk meant no offence by his comments and the response is unjustified. 'It is a nonsense to suggest he should return his peace prize. 'In fact South Africa is now a constitutional democracy whose citizens have rights which were created through the negotiations that he himself set in motion.'","FW de Klerk says the idea of apartheid ethnic separation was 'not repugnant'

"Midway through a National Organization protest in front of the US Supreme Court building, punches flew. One, which landed on the face of a marcher, was thrown by gay marriage advocate Sergei Kostin, a former Occupy DC member whom a source in the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department described as a 'professional activist.' The other was a gut-punch that Kostin told MailOnline provoked him - one that no one else saw. If that punch flew, one observer countered, however, it's not clear how hard it could have been. But if the swinging fists were half-imagined, the ideological confrontation on Tuesday was genuine. Both sides of the debate were out in force, with Christian opponents easily outnumbering advocates for gay marriage. Inside, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could determine whether the federal government or the 50 states will decide what a marriage is. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sergei Kostin (L) argues with a supporter of a traditional definition of marriage, outside the US Supreme Court. Moments later, Kostin punched him in the face. He claims the other man gut-punched him first . Kostin is a well-known gay rights activist in Washington, DC. His Facebook page shows him dressed in rainbow gear for several protests in the city. A source inside the DC Metropolitan Police Department told MailOnline that he is 'a professional activist' Yahoo! News reported that the cast of characters included a drag queen in a rainbow tutu and devil horns, cross-carrying Christians who knelt in prayer, and a host of other activists. The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) marchers 'were met by another small group of people that had stretched out a rainbow flag in front of them,' according to Yahoo. 'When they refused to budge from the street, NOM organizers urged everyone to just go around them. A NOM demonstrator began arguing with one of the men holding the flag, Sergei Kostin, and tried to push him out of the way.' Enter the fisticuffs. Neither the Metropolitan Police Department nor the National Park Police said they had any knowledge of the altercation, and no arrests were made. Kostin took up the cause of the late Trayvon Martin in 2012. Martin, a black teen, was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, who said Martin attacked him first. Kostin himself is arguing the same about his confrontation in front of the Supreme Court, claiming that he was attacked before he threw a punch that landed on a man's face. In a telephone interview with MailOnline, Kostin said he only threw an uppercut after he was attacked first, when he stepped between the anti-gay-marriage crowd and a lone sign-carrying woman, in an attempt to protect her. 'This gentleman had his hand on my chest,' Kostin said. 'I've been an activist for several years, and that kind of stuff doesn't bother me. But when he got closer to me, he threw a punch into my stomach.' 'In turn, when he did that I reacted back to him. That's when I clocked him.' Kostin said no law enforcement officers intervened, and he hasn't heard from any since the confrontation. He doesn't know the identity of the man he struck - only that he was 'twice my size.' Kostin confirmed that he was a longtime member of the Occupy DC contingent that maintained an encampment in DC's McPherson Square for nearly nine months, ending in June 2012. Kostin is a colorful character seen frequently at Washington, DC protests. In this photo, he demonstrated against the US government's use of drones in military operations. Kostin wore black lingerie and a pink sign reading 'CIA' A woman carrying a 'Get Equal' sign and an American flag danced with a man dressed in heels to draw attention to the fight for gay marriage equality . He also protested the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Martin, a black teen, was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, who said Martin attacked him first. Kostin himself is arguing the same about his confrontation in front of the Supreme Court, claiming that he was attacked before he threw his own punch. Asked whether he would meet force with force again - and what would Gandhi do? - Kostin said he would think about it. 'When you get aggressive, then my passive resistance draws a line,' he explained. 'Passive resistance is passive, yes, but there's also that word ""resistance"" in there.' 'Physically assaulting me? I guess it wasn't Ghandiism. It's not my personality to do something like that.'","Gay marriage advocate Sergei Kostin punched opponent in the FACE .

"Roy Hodgson has poured scorn on the notion that swearing during a Press briefing after the 1-0 friendly win against Norway last week was a sign of the pressure getting to him. The England manager has been in the spotlight ever since England’s awful World Cup display, in which they picked up just one point and scored twice, their worst performance at a World Cup finals since 1950. It led him to use the words ‘f****** b*******’ after the Norway game when he was asked if he was worried that statistics from the game showed England had two shots on target. Hodgson regularly berates the use of stats, considering them an unsophisticated reading of the subtleties of the game. And he laughed off the fact that he had sworn, admitting that he even does so in front of his wife. Furious: Roy Hodgson swore during a press conference after England's win over Norway . ‘That’s ridiculous,’ he said, when asked about his language. ‘Goodness me. What sort of world are we living in? You are scraping the bottom of a barrel to say something negative there. ‘Listen, I’m a football coach. I worked most of my life, up to the age of 25, in England.

They didn’t even know they were swearing because they didn’t know any other words. ‘If you say: “We are very, very annoyed and morally offended by Hodgson, the England manager, using a swear word. And we insist that in the future he never swears,” then, OK, I will never swear in your company again. ‘I just thought I was with people mature enough to understand that a swear word, which I thought was probably used at the right time, should not provoke a fit of moral indignation... I wasn’t arguing with anybody, I was making my points. Is this the way to victory? Hodgson takes his England side to Switzerland for their first Euro 2016 qualifier . ‘It was the same discussion about England’s future, it was put in the same [calm] tone of voice. It was put strongly — yes, I’ll accept that. I will put the message forward quite strongly, even a little bit aggressively, sometimes. ‘But there was no need for me to be upset by anybody and there was no ill feeling. I swear all the time. I swear in front of my wife. I never used to when I was a kid but I do now, so there you go.’ Hodgson says that his broader point in the exchange was that the young players he has at his disposal can cope with the pressure being placed on them to lift the gloom that has enveloped the national team ever since the World Cup failure. ‘I do believe they can, without a shadow of a doubt,’ said Hodgson. ‘They’re getting a baptism of fire, many of them are coming in very young and into an air of negativity. It’s a bit of a baptism of fire.’ He added: ‘It would be nice if the Switzerland game wasn’t being built up into a World Cup final. Once they’ve played with each other for a couple of years, had European experience with their clubs and played another 10 to 15 international matches, they will go into the Euros and that’s when we’d be hoping they could lift our heads a little bit out of this gloom.’ This way! England must improve if they are to come away from Switzerland with three points on Monday .","Roy Hodgson feels he swore at the right time after England beat Norway .

"Last year Mattel came under fire for its outdated representation of Mexican culture with its launch of Mexico Barbie who wore bright pink traditional dress and had a Chihuahua tucked under her arm. However this doesn't appear to have deterred the toy giant who has now launched their latest doll in traditional mariachi dress complete with wide brimmed sombrero and embellished suit. According to the General Manager of Mattel Mexico, Ana Paula Martinez de Alba.The launch of the Mexican Barbie comes a month prior to the celebration of the national day of Mexico (15 September). Barbie's latest nationality will be a Mexican as Mattel launch the toy in traditional mariachi dress . Barbie takes on a full transformation wearing . a fitted black bolero jacket and cropped trousers trimmed in intricate . golden brocade that mirrors the pattern on her impressive, wide-brimmed . sombrero. Flourishes include a brilliant pink tie, low ponytail and tall . black boots. However, Mattel's latest offering comes as a bit of a risk as Barbie's previous venture into Mexican culture caused huge controversy. Last April, the toy company sparked controversy with the launch of its first Mexico Barbie criticised for adhering to outdated and offensive stereotypes. Outdated or educational? Could Mattel's latest Mexican Barbie cause as much controversy as their previous offering? Mexico Barbie wore a bright pink 'traditional' dress and held a Chihuahua, sparking a debate over whether the dolls are helpful or harmful to cultural awareness in children. She was part of Mattel's Barbie Dolls of the World collection. Initially introduced in 1980, the line . was relaunched in 2012 as Mattel's attempt to appeal to a new generation . of diverse Barbie fans. Sara Rosales, a spokesman for Mattel, told Fox News Latino . that the toys - which represent countries including Mexico, China, . India and Holland - are educational tools for young children. 'Girls . enjoy exploring the world and learning about different cultures through . play,' she explained, adding: 'The Barbie brand understands the . significance of introducing new cultures to girls in a relatable way.' Under fire: The Barbie Dolls of the World collection - and, in . particular, the Chihuahua-toting Mexico Barbie (left) - was . criticised for promoting cultural stereotypes. China Barbie (right) comes with a baby panda . Nonetheless, the multicultural dolls have incited criticism for their apparently simplistic portrayals of different heritages. Felix Sanchez, chairman of the . National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, said of the toys: 'These . images seem very dated and seem to have been created for a different . time.' Indeed, most of the dolls are marketed on the Mattel website as sporting 'traditional' costumes and 'classic' looks. Despite their latest Barbie being . described as wearing 'traditional costume' it appears that the doll may . not be entirely authentic. On . the Barbie Collector website under Doll Details the doll's skin tone is . listed as LA tan - not exactly a perfect likeness to an actual Mexican . woman. Mr Sanchez added that Mattel could improve the collection by adding more contemporary representations of the countries. All of the Dolls of the World are . dressed in their 'native fashions', according to Ms Rosales, and they . each carry a passport and a pet that is meant to represent their heritage. Cultural heritage: Thai Barbie (left), Argentina Barbie (middle) and India Barbie (right) all sport apparently traditional native outfits. India Barbie carries a monkey on her arm . Cute or cliched? Hawaiian Barbie is decked out in luau attire and accompanied by a tortoise (left) while Ireland Barbie has red hair and wears an old-fashioned green dress (right) Critics of the dolls have said that they represent cliched perceptions of different cultures. Website The Corvallis Advocate . said of the collection: 'Apparently no one from Mattel has ever set . foot outside the U.S. - possibly not outside of Disneyland’s rather aged . It’s a Small World exhibit.' And a blogger for The Stir expressed her disapproval of Mexico Barbie: 'If you really have to do the old-fashioned, traditional dress, why not at least make it accurate?' she wrote. Furry friends: The dolls each carry a pet that is meant to represent their respective countries. Australia Barbie for instance (middle) cradles a koala bear in her arm, and Holland Barbie (right) is accompanied by a bunny . With Mattel's latest offering based, . once again on traditional Mexican dress, the Barbie brand could once . again come under fire for its stereotypical approach to world cultures. However, Mattel defends the Barbies as representations of genuine and unique qualities of countries around the globe. 'The Dolls of the World collection features the native fashions, while celebrating the cultures and diversity represented within each country in a way that will appeal to Barbie fans of all ages,' asserted Ms Rosales.","Mattel has launched a second Mexican Barbie in their doll range .

"Disturbing footage has emerged showing a masked child firing an AK47 assault rifle while shouting Islamic slogans in Syria. Two short videos apparently filmed in Ghouta, a rural suburb of the capital Damascus, were uploaded to YouTube by an user calling themselves Abd Sad. They show a young boy, who appears no older than six-years-old, being instructed to fire the weapon by an adult male who then praises him and encourages him to join in religious chanting. Scroll down for video . Disturbing: The footage shows a masked child firing an AK47 assault rifle while shouting Islamic slogans. It was apparently filmed in Ghouta, a rural suburb of the Syrian capital Damascus . Child: The young boy, who appears no older than six-years-old, is instructed to fire the weapon by an adult male who then praises him and encourages him to join in religious chanting . The footage, the authenticity of which could not be immediately established, was posted on YouTube last week by a user who has also uploaded an pro-ISIS propaganda video. Describing the child as a 'cub cub' the video captions suggest they were filmed in southern Ghouta - a collection of farms on the outskirts of Damascus near to where Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad is believed to have carried out a brutal chemical weapons attack a year ago that left hundreds dead. Throughout the clips the young boy appears unsteady on his feet under the weight of the large gun - and each time he fires the weapon he looks close to toppling over thanks to its powerful recoil. When he stops firing, the young boy turns towards the camera as if looking for praise as an adult man encourages him to chant religious slogans. Dangerous: Throughout the clips the young boy appears unsteady on his feet under the weight of the large gun - and each time he fires the weapon he looks close to toppling over, thanks to its powerful recoil . Shameful: The two short videos - apparently filmed in Ghouta, a rural suburb of the capital Damascus - were uploaded to YouTube by an user calling themselves Abd Sad . ISIS - which rebranded as Islamic State earlier this year after establishing a self-described caliphate in the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq under its control - has long groomed children to take part in jihad. The practice was the subject of the second episode of VICE's groundbreaking 'Islamic State' documentary series, in which very young boys were seen being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist, and were forced to repeat calls for the murder of Western 'infidels'. In the footage, ISIS' PR man Abu Moussa - who has since been killed - describes how every male child under the age of 15 is forced to attend a 'Sharia camp' to be taught the militant group's radical interpretation of Islam. At the age of 16 the boys are sent to a military camp, where they are given intensive training in the art of warfare and prepared for possible future as either front-line militia or suicide bombers. Shocking: ISIS has long groomed children to take part in jihad. The practice was the subject of the second episode of VICE's groundbreaking 'Islamic State' documentary series . This nine-year-old self-described ISIS 'fighter' said he was about to be sent away for training at a military camp. When asked what his training consisted of, the boy replied 'The Russian' - meaning Kalashnikov assault rifle .

This morning Amnesty International accused ISIS of carrying out a systematic campaign of mass killings, abductions and ethnic cleansing in northern Iraq that could amount to war crimes. The London-based rights group says the extremists, who overran parts of northern and western Iraq in June, have systematically targeted religious minorities. In today's report Amnesty said ISIS fighters have expelled Christians, Shiites, Yazidis and other minority groups from their homes . The report documents several cases where the militants carried out mass killings of Yazidi men, rounding up men and boys and killing them in groups. The report also documented the abduction of hundreds of Yazidi women and children. It says the fate of most of the abducted women and children is still unknown.","Footage shows boy firing assault rifle and shouting Islamic slogans in Syria .

"A new wing of global terror group al Qaeda which has formed in India, could be set to target the United States. It comes after the group, who have been named Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) released a video earlier this week announcing their formation. In it Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri says they will 'raise the flag of jihad' across the 'Indian subcontinent'. Scroll down for video . A still from a video released earlier this week showing Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri announcing that the terror group has formed a new wing in the United States . Now it has emerged that the group, who were responsible for the 9/11 terror attacks on New York's World Trade Centre, is targeting the United States once again. The SITE monitoring service quoted AQIS spokesman Usama Mahmoud as saying the group's goals include 'waging jihad against America and the system of global disbelief', and 'uprooting it, in order to establish Sharia-based governance', according to an audio speech. He added: 'This is the system that put upon worshippers of Allah a political system built on non-religious, democratic, secular principles, and weakened the Islamic creed and corrupted Muslim society. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri announced the formation of an Indian branch of his militant group he said would spread Islamic rule and 'raise the flag of jihad' across the subcontinent. He said: 'My Muslim brothers everywhere, peace be with you today, I announce to all Muslims in the world and especially in the Indian subcontinent, the founding of a new branch of Qaedat al-Jihad. 'This is to help raise the flag of jihad and the return of the Islamic rule in the subcontinent, which one day used to be part of the land of the Muslims until the infidel enemy took it over and divided it.' He also renewed a longstanding vow of loyalty to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar, in an apparent snub to the Islamic State armed group challenging al Qaeda for leadership of transnational Islamist militancy. Zawahri described the formation of 'Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent' as glad tidings for Muslims 'in Burma, Bangladesh, Assam, Gujarat, Ahmedabad, and Kashmir' and said the new wing would rescue Muslims there from injustice and oppression. 'And because of this system, apostate, traitor armies were put upon the Islamic lands and the rulers hostile to Islam.' The formation of the new wing of Al Qaeda comes as the United States, Britain and other western countries focus on the continuing threat from ISIS, who have declared parts of Iraq and Syria an Islamic state. It is thought that ISIS recently split from Al Qaeda's control in a direct challenge to their authority. The timing and content of the video suggests rivalry between al Qaeda and ISIS, which anecdotal evidence suggests is gathering support in South Asia. According to media reports, Islamic State pamphlets have been distributed in Pakistan in recent days. 'Al Qaeda has seen its authority eroded by the fact that it is no longer able to independently carry out large-scale attacks anywhere in the world, and by the emergence of rival factions,' Omar Hamid, head of Asia analysis at security research firm IHS Country Risk, wrote in a report. Al Qaeda's establishment of a local branch seeks to take advantage of the planned withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan, which may lead to an influx of battle-hardened militants into India, Hamid added. Until a few days ago, there has been no evidence that al Qaeda had a presence in India. On Thursday, several provinces in India were put on alert after the announcement of the formation of AQIS. New Delhi regards the message as authentic and has warned local governments, said an official who attended a security briefing in which it was discussed with Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who is responsible for policing and internal security. An official said: 'This matter has been taken very seriously. An alert has been sounded.' Indian security forces are usually on a state of alert for attacks by home-grown Islamist militants and by anti-India groups based in Pakistan. It was not immediately clear what additional steps were being taken. Zawahri's announcement made two references to Gujarat, the home state of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist. Hedescribed the formation of 'Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent' as glad tidings for Muslims 'in Burma, Bangladesh, Assam, Gujarat, Ahmedabad, and Kashmir' and said the new wing would rescue Muslims there from injustice and oppression. Tensions between Hindus and Muslims on the subcontinent have grown since Pakistan was carved from Muslim-majority areas of India in 1947 in a violent partition in which hundreds of thousands were killed. Kashmir, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan, has long attracted foreign mujahideen fighters as well as home-grown separatist militants. In June, al Qaeda released a video urging young radicals in Kashmir to draw inspiration from militants in Syria and Iraq and join the 'global jihad'.","New Al Qaeda wing say their goals include 'waging jihad against America'

"Two years ago Ben McMahon woke up from a coma more than a week after a horrific car crash that almost claimed his life only being able to speak Mandarin. The 22-year-old remembers how he woke up and saw a nurse who looked Asian standing by his bed and said to her 'Excuse me nurse, I feel really sore here' in Chinese. He then asked the nurse for a piece of paper and pen and he wrote on it in Mandarin: 'I love my mum, I love my dad, I will recover.' Scroll down for video . Two years ago Ben McMahon was involved in car crash that left in a coma for more than a week . His new-found language skills baffled his doctors as well as his parents. Ben's father, Mark, and his mother were told it would be a miracle if their son survived. 'We got the call from the hospital and [the hospital staff member] was saying ""Oh Mark, look I just wanted to ring and let you know that Ben's actually started to come out of the coma""...and she said, “I don’t know how to say this...he's speaking Mandarin',"" Mark told Channel 10's The Project. 'Neither of us can speak Mandarin so we just nodded but deep down quite concerned about what’s going on.' When he woke up, he was only able to speak fluent Mandarin - having only learned it at school . The 22-year-old along with his parents appeared on Channel Ten's The Project to tell his story . Despite taking Mandarin at school, Ben had never been fluent at the language. 'I wasn’t consciously thinking I was speaking Mandarin, it was what just came out and it was what was most natural to me,' he said. It took Ben two or three more days to recall how to speak English. Since then, Ben's language skills have open new opportunities to him like leading Chinese tours of his hometown and hosting a Mandarin television program. Now the Melbourne man has moved to Shanghai to study commerce at university. He said he was fortunate to be alive and to be able to speak a second language. But what happened to Ben is not the first of its kind. His parents said they were baffled that he could speak Mandarin as neither of them spoke the Chinese language . His new-found talent for the language led him to appear on a Mandarin television show and he now lives in Shanghai, studying commerce . He said he was fortunate to be alive and to be able to speak a second language . In 2010, a 13-year-old Croatian girl woke up had replaced her fluency in her native language with speaking German. More recently, a U.S. navy veteran was found unconscious in a motel room and had no recollection of who he was and spoke fluent Swedish in July 2013. But a Queensland Brain Institute neuroscientist thinks he might have an explanation about what happened to Ben. Dr Pankaj Sah said the brain was made up of different circuits - which assist in language, breathing, speaking and thinking - similar to electronic circuits. According to him, what possibly happened to Ben was that the parts of the brain that recalled English were damaged in the crash and those that retained Mandarin were activated when the 22-year-old woke up from his coma.","Ben McMahon was the passenger of a car that was involved in a car crash .

"When I was an RAF Tornado navigator, the phrase 'going to Poland' would have meant the Cold War had turned hot and we were on a one-way trip to deliver nuclear Armageddon. In my early days in the military, communist-ruled Poland was on our target list for destruction, and certainly a country forbidden to visit. How times have changed. British stag parties head off to cities such as Warsaw for a weekend of debauchery, and we now have a large number of Poles settled in Britain. Happy guests: John visited Poland with his family to attend the wedding of an old friend . More importantly, a few years ago my old friend Terence met Asia, a beautiful Polish girl working as a nanny in Sunderland. And so it came to pass that I eventually went to Poland - not in an RAF Tornado, but with my wife and daughter, who are both called Suzie, on a more comfortable Ryanair flight and armed only with a wedding present for Terence and his bride. Asia (the Polish nickname for any girl named Joanna) comes from Slawa, a small town 70 miles southwest of Poznan. As we neared her home, her family and neighbours came out to give us a fantastic welcome, setting the scene for a weekend of enthusiastic friendliness and unbridled hospitality. Water enthusiasts flock to the Lake Slawskie - the focal point of the town and its increasing tourist industry . We were staying at Bar U Dudka in the centre of Slawa, which was also the location for the wedding feast. The owner, Jerzy Dudek, was a most convivial host, while the rooms were clean, comfortable and incredibly good value at about £50 a night, including breakfast for all three of us. As we discovered, food was to play an ever increasing part of our brief stay in Poland. Our first experience was at the local pizza restaurant, where 14 of us feasted on huge pizzas washed down with copious quantities of beer and red wine. The bill came to an embarrassingly small £100. Breakfast the next morning took nearly an hour to complete, with platters of cold meats, cheeses, eggs and pastries flowing from the kitchen until we had to call a halt to the endless procession. In an effort to diminish the calorific intake, we strolled through the dense pine forest down to the beautiful Lake Slawskie, the focal point of the town and its increasing tourist industry. Watersports enthusiasts flock here during the summer for sailing and water-skiing, and in the winter for iceskating tournaments. Back at Dudka's for the wedding celebrations, I was amazed to see tables already groaning under the weight of salads, fish dishes, breads, cold cuts and countless bottles of vodka for the toasts. To my astonishment, this was just the starter, and for the next ten hours an array of sumptuous dishes marched from the kitchen. Flagons of soup were followed by endless platters of roast meats, fried potatoes and more fish. Each course was interspersed with increasingly enthusiastic dancing, toasts, speeches and singing. While the British contingent was small, we gave hearty renditions of Jerusalem and the National Anthem. Towards the end of the night, our repertoire had faded, so we resorted to We Wish You A Merry Christmas and that Scout favourite Ging Gang Goolie. I like to think we gave a decent account of ourselves, but the vodka may have affected my reasoning. Finally, at 3am, as a gigantic wedding cake was brought in, I dragged myself off to bed, harbouring the uncomfortable thought that another huge breakfast was only a few hours away. Our family trip to Poland was a wonderful insight into a bygone culture of openness and incredible hospitality. I just hope stag parties don't ruin it for the rest of us.

"Andy Mangan handed Shrewsbury a shock Capital One Cup victory over Barclays Premier League new-boys Leicester. Mangan, a free-transfer signing from Forest Green Rovers during the summer, scored the only goal of the night at the King Power Stadium to send the League Two Shrews into the third round. It was nothing more than Micky Mellon's side deserved as there was often little to determine which team was in the top flight and the other three leagues below. Winner: Andy Mangan whipped in a free-kick to hand Shrewsbury Town a 1-0 victory against Leicester City . Leicester City: Hamer, Pearson, Konchesky, Cain (King 58), Wasilewski, Moore, Knockaert, Watson (Nugent 58), Wood, Taylor-Fletcher, Mahrez (Schlupp 70). Subs Not Used: Morgan, Hopper, Barmby, Smith. Booked: Mahrez. Shrewsbury Town: Leutwiler, Goldson, Woods, Demetriou, Grandison, Knight-Percival, Clark (Akpa-Akpro 85), Wesolowski, Gayle, Mangan (Vernon 40), Collins (Robinson 85). Subs Not Used: Wildig, Caton, Halstead, Smith. Booked: Woods, Gayle. Goals: Mangan 38. Att: 8,017 . With one point from their opening two matches on their return to the big time, if City boss Nigel Pearson had been looking at this game as a springboard to get his team's season rolling, then he was sorely mistaken. Readily conceding to a selection with one eye on Sunday's visit of Arsenal, Pearson made eight changes overall, with the inclusion of four debutants. Goalkeeper Ben Hamer, in for Kasper Schmeichel following the former's summer arrival from Charlton, was not too much of a surprise. More so, though, were three rookies in defender James Pearson and midfielders Michael Cain and Ryan Watson. The resultant performance was far below Premier League standard, especially in the first half as a disjointed City were barely at the races as they lacked urgency and enthusiasm. Instead, it was left to journeyman striker Mangan to net his fourth goal in four matches with a 22-yard free-kick in the 38th minute. Pulled up: Mangan injured his hamstring scoring for Shrewsbury, which turned out to be a shock winner . The only downside for Mellon and Mangan is that it proved to be the 27-year-old's last kick of the game as he appeared to sustain a hamstring injury in striking the ball. Regardless of Pearson's changes, City should have taken the lead after just 30 seconds, but an angled left-foot strike from Riyad Mahrez produced a fine save from Jayson Leutwiler, a free transfer capture from Middlesbrough over the summer. Shrewsbury could easily have been rattled, but they hit back in the third minute, with a header from James Collins forcing Hamer into a tip-over save. Captain-for-the-night Paul Konchesky then struck a rising left-foot shot from 20 yards that was easy pickings for Leutwiler, before Jordan Clark fired his own left-footer narrowly over the bar. After 18 minutes, City were again indebted to Hamer for another superb fingertip save as he nudged a stunning strike from Mickey Demetriou over the woodwork. Out muscled: Leicester City failed to score against League Two side Shrewsbury, who deservedly won 1-0 . Six minutes later, and for a split second it appeared City would be given a penalty when Mahrez seemed to have his leg taken away from under him by Town captain Connor Goldson. Refere Simon Hooper saw differently, however, and instead booked the Leicester winger for simulation. Leicester then should again have taken the lead with two chances in the space of three minutes, but first Leutwiler made a reaction stop to Marcin Wesilewski's hooked volley. That was followed by the towering Chris Wood planting a header against the crossbar in meeting a free-kick from just outside the left-hand edge of the penalty area from Anthony Knockaert. The missed opportunities proved costly because seven minutes from the break the Shrews grabbed the lead courtesy of Mangan's free-kick into the bottom right-hand corner. So close: Chris Wood's towering header clattered off the crossbar but Shrewsbury held on for the Cup upset . Despite Mangan's immediate withdrawal, Town should have headed into the interval with a two-goal cushion, only for an unmarked Demetriou to scuff a seemingly simple shot after being teed up by Collins and substitute Scott Vernon. After the break City undoubtedly dominated possession, with Pearson replacing two of his young guard in Cain and Watson with experience in Jeff Schlupp and David Nugent on the hour. Shrewsbury, though, should have sealed the tie in the 75th minute, only for the left-hand post to twice spare the blushes of the Foxes. First Hamer was beaten all ends up by a 25-yard rocket from Clark, before Vernon on the follow up sidefooted against the same piece of woodwork from 10 yards. Town, though, had the sticks to thank themselves just three minutes later, with Nugent cursing his luck after firing against the right-hand upright. It was as close as City came in the dying stages to forcing extra time, leaving Pearson and Leicester to contemplate an embarrassing night and the Shrews a top-flight scalp to savour.

"This is the shocking moment a man suffering from Ebola was bundled into the back of an ambulance after he caused mass panic at a market in Liberia when he wandered in looking for food. The unidentified man walked into a market in the capital Monrovia - which has been badly hit by the worst ever outbreak of the disease -  only to be chased from the area by panicked shoppers.

The . world's worst-ever Ebola outbreak has so far killed more than 1,500 . people in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Guinea - where it is . believed to have first developed. Surrounding countries have closed land borders, many airlines have suspended flights to and from the affected countries and seaports are seeing less traffic, restricting food imports to the hardest-hit countries. Those countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - all rely on grain from abroad to feed their people, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Making off with loaves of bread, the man is then chased down the road by men wearing yellow protection suits . Taking no chances: The heavily protected health workers eventually catch up with the runaway Ebola patient . In one market in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, the price of cassava root, a staple in many West African diets, was up 150%. 'Even prior to the Ebola outbreak, households in some of the affected areas were spending up to 80% of their incomes on food,' said Vincent Martin, who is co-ordinating the agency's response to the crisis. 'Now these latest price spikes are effectively putting food completely out of their reach.' The UN has said 1.3 million people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone will need help feeding themselves in coming months. The situation looks likely worsen, FAO said, because restrictions on movement are preventing labourers from accessing farms, and the harvest of rice and corn is set to begin in a few weeks. Unconvinced: The man seems unwilling to leave the area with the medics and starts trying to escape . Force: Unwilling to leave the market the man is bundled into the back of the back of the ambulance by medics . Stopped: The health workers eventually manage to get the patient into the back of the vehicle before driving off . The World Health Organisation is asking countries to lift border closures because they are preventing supplies from reaching people in desperate need. Ivory Coast decided last night to keep its borders with Guinea and Liberia closed but said it would open a humanitarian corridor to allow supplies in. The news comes as Ivory Coast's football association said it will host the country's African Nations Cup qualifier against Sierra Leone this weekend following a special national security council meeting. The decision, announced in a government statement published in local media today, comes one week after the government said it would not allow the match to go ahead, citing health concerns. As of August 29, the World Health Organization had confirmed 935 cases of the deadly virus in Sierra Leone - including 380 deaths - though that number is likely to have since risen. No escape: The medics cling on to the back of the vehicle as it pulls away to stop the man climbing back out . Anger: Furious Monrovia residents chase the vehicle down the road as a warning to the man not to return . With the Ebola death toll continuing to rise in West Africa, new details emerged of next week's first human trial for virus vaccine. So far the most effective treatment for Ebola appears to have been the experimental drug ZMapp, but this is designed to treat an existing infection, not prevent one. The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health is working with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline to develop the drug, which is said to have 'performed extremely well' in primate studies. The first human studies will take place in Maryland next week and involve 20 human subjects aged between 18 and 50, according to the National Institutes of Health. The subjects will not actually be infected with Ebola. The vaccine will simply be given to them in order to see if it stimulates the appropriate response from their immune system and to test for side-effects.","Ebola patient wandered into market in Monrovia, Liberia causing mass panic .

Mother and daughter: She is the third calf of Indi, a 28-year-old elephant born in Burma who ended up in the Swiss Knie Circus before being moved to the Zurich zoo in 1999 . The curator at the Zoo said: 'At the beginning she did not know what to do with her trunk. I had the feeling that there would soon be a knot in it. 'She spends lots of her time with her mother and aunts who are always watching over her - once she tried to go swimming and they had to fish her out.' Elephants are known to have tight bonds with herd members outside their immediate family. Mothers and their calves share a special connection, but adults have been known to watch over little ones that aren't theirs. Other members of the clan may act as babysitters - a practice that helps young female elephants prepare for motherhood. Asian elephants like Omysha are an endangered species with a wild population of between 40,000 and 50,000, the Zurich Zoo said.","The adorable scenes were captured on mobile phone at Zurich Zoo .

"Even at this level, this is a fixture that nobody wants to lose, where neither side will give an inch. This encounter was no exception, the two teams eventually sharing the spoils. Manchester United against Liverpool always brings up the mercury, raising the tension in the dugout and on the pitch. In this sense, it was a little odd to see one of English football's most famous clashes diluted into a rather timid affair. As Nicky Butt watched on, now a coach with his former club, he may have secretly pined for a return to the visceral intensity that we are accustomed to when Manchester United meet Liverpool. Get in! Liverpool's youngsters celebrate after Lussey scored a free-kick in front of the Kop . Youth coaches continue to agonise over the absence of a competitive edge in the Under-21 leagues and with a smallish crowd in attendance, the usual aggro and needle was absent. Some will welcome the more cerebral and tactical approach and it was certainly pleasant to see English talent comfortable in fluid formations. United, in particular, are a curious watch these days, at any age group. The Louis van Gaal philosophy is filtering down into Warren Joyce's reserve side and United played for the second consecutive league game with the 3-5-2 system that the Dutchman is attempting to instill into his senior players. The thinking is that it will prepare players for the step up as Van Gaal looks to unearth the latest young gems from the United academy. Comeback: Manchester United Under 21s had to show character to come back from a goal down . Manchester United (3-5-2): J Pereira, McNair, Thorpe (c), Vermijl; Janko, Harrop, Pearson, Evans (Weir, 55); Rothwell, Lawrence, Pereira . Subs not used: O'Hara, Grimshaw, Goss, Willock . Liverpool (4-3-3): Ward; McLaughlin, Jones, Williams, Stewart; Rossiter, Brannagan, Lussey (Pelosi, 79); Wilson (Canos, 72), Ojo, Peterson . Subs not used: Maguire, Vigouroux, Yesil . Referee: P. Wright . For an hour or so, both sides appeared to lacked the wit or know-how to force a breakthrough. A steady United performance yearned for the inspiration of James Wilson, the club's most exciting talent who scored four against Manchester City just a few weeks ago. He has been training with the first-team, his performances a cut above at this level. Several other rising stars, such as Tyler Blackett and Reece James, are also in line to be heavily involved when Louis van Gaal's first team travel to Sunderland this weekend. On another night, this team could also have included the mercurial talents of Wilfried Zaha and Nick Powell. Liverpool were missing Jordan Ibe, who took his place in the smart seats. As it was, this was a United performance of measured control, exuding a calm authority in possession and discipline without the ball. Tom Thorpe was a commanding force at centre-half, taking any encroachment into the penalty area as a personal affront. It is a surprise Van Gaal is yet to involve him in the first-team set-up. It is clear United are still learning in this system and the coach Joyce was guiding his players throughout, urging young Joe Rothwell to fill the pockets of space in the Juan Mata role and gesticulating at Ben Pearson, a holding midfielder, to get tighter to Liverpool's bright young talent Jordan Rossiter. Equaliser: Tom Lawrence levels things up from close range despite the close attention of Reds defenders . Initially, this was a slow burner, devoid of vibrancy and imagination. Liverpool tried the harder to build some momentum, underpinned by the movement of Sheyi Ojo, who harried United's defenders at every opportunity. When goalkeeper Joel Perreira received the ball, Ojo was there in a flash, closing down a clearance that very nearly rebounded into the goal. United's attacking forays were notable only for a whippped delivery across the goalmouth, when Paddy McNair timed his run, caught it with the instep, but somehow diverted wide with the goal gaping. The breakthrough, when it came just past the hour mark, was worth the wait. Jordan Lussey had already given United advance notice of his potency from range, crafting one curling effort inches wide of Perreira's goal in the first-half. It was his free-kick from 25 yards that opened the scoring, drilled hard and low into the right-hand corner of the goal. Not settling for a point: Lawrence headed for the centre circle after scoring the equaliser . United's response was instant, as if they suddenly remembered that defeat at Liverpool resounds through this club, whether it be a youth game or European Cup final. Substitute James Weir tiptoed his way through the Liverpool defence, reaching the byline and calmly squaring for Tom Lawrence to side-foot into the roof of the net. Moments later, Lawrence galloped forward again, driving a swerving effort that brought a smart stop from Danny Ward. The tempo rose as Liverpool pushed on with greater urgency. A quick free-kick released Sergi Canos, who was thwarted by the sprawling frame of Pereira. Liverpool continued to press, swinging dangerous set-pieces but United continued to stand tall. This, as ever, was simply a game they were not prepared to lose.","Jordan Lussey scored a low second-half free-kick to put Liverpool  in front .

"When Adeba Shaker arrived at a house in Raabia, Iraq, after being kidnapped by Islamic State militants last month, one of her captors received a phone call. A few moments later all five men in the apartment picked up their guns and stormed out. Shaker, a 14-year-old girl from the Yazidi ethnic minority, heard trucks leaving the property and then silence. For the first time in 20 days she and another girl being held with her were alone with no guards, and the door was unlocked. Scroll down for video . Living in fear: The Yazidi in northern Iraq have suffered persecution and abuse at the hands of ISIS . Islamic State militants had trafficked Shaker from her village in the north-eastern Iraqi region of Sinjar to the Syrian border and presented her as a 'gift' to fighters on the front line. She was to be converted to Islam and forcibly married to one of them. 'When [the militants] left us I panicked, I didn't know what to do. I saw a bag full of cell phones and I called my brother,' Shaker said by phone from a camp for internally displaced people in Iraq. Her brother Samir and he told her to go to a nearby house and ask for help and directions to reach the border where fighters from the Kurdistan State Workers Party (PKK) were battling Islamic State militants. He said the PKK would help her reach safety. Yazidi refugees fleeing Mount Sinjar after ISIS militants trapped them in the mountains of northern Iraq .

'This was a gamble as I didn't know who was a friend and who was an enemy,' she said. Shaker and her companion decided to try their luck. They snuck out of the house and knocked on a neighbour's door. 'We explained the situation to them and they showed us the way to the border.' The two girls set off toward the front lines. 'I couldn't walk straight, my legs were shaking and my heart was beating so fast. We ran and walked and we never looked back,' Shaker said. After two hours on the road they heard gunfire. As they got closer, they saw a group of PKK fighters and started running towards them. 'I was crying and laughing at the same time,' she said. 'We were free.' Shaker is one of the few Yazidis to have escaped the Islamic State militants who have taken over large swathes of Iraq and Syria in recent months. Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled their ancient homeland of Sinjar and other villages to escape a dramatic push by the Sunni militants, who regard them as devil worshippers who must embrace the Islamic State's radical version of Islam or die. In addition to Shaker, militants abducted at least 73 women and children from her village and trafficked them across northern Iraq. Yazidi refugees carrying buckets of drinking water in Zakho, close to the Turkish border . Shaker recalled how the militants separated old women from the rest of the group. Then they took the children. Young women and girls faced terrifying fates. Some girls were raped by the commander, who had the privilege of taking their virginity, before being passed round among the fighters. After they had been gang-raped, they were likely to be sold off to the highest bidder. Women and girls are auctioned for as little as $10, according to numerous reports. Others, like Shaker, were to be married off to militants. 'The most terrifying moment was the first night after they captured us,' she recalled. 'We arrived at a police station in another town and everybody was crying and screaming. We didn't know what was going to happen to us.' Shaker had been living in a small village with 25 family members. She loved school and wanted to become a teacher. When the family heard that Islamic State fighters were approaching, they fled to a nearby village. But the fighters reached them shortly afterwards. 'They promised they were not going to hurt us if we surrendered,' Shaker said. 'They separated women and kids from men … Then they took all our jewels, money, phones and vehicles.' Two hours later all the prisoners were loaded onto trucks and moved to an unknown destination. 'At the beginning (they) were trying to be nice to us … They were trying to calm us down.' Shortly afterwards, their attitude changed and they became 'abusive and aggressive,' she said. Eventually, Shaker and her family arrived at the town of Badoosh, near Mosul, where they joined around 1,000 other Yazidi women and children. She was separated from her mother and the rest of her family and was later sent to the house in Raabia from which she escaped. Shaker is now safe in a camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) in Iraq, where she was reunited with two of her brothers. She doesn't yet know the fate of 22 other relatives who are still in the hands of Islamic State. 'Sometimes I can't sleep at night … I worry so much about them,' she said. 'Those hours are the worst … Everyone is asleep and I still think about my escape.' 'I know I was lucky, God saved me.'","Adeba Shaker had been kidnapped from her village by ISIS jihadists .

"The U.S. State Department's deputy spokeswoman told a startled briefing room full of reporters Thursday that she couldn't define what 'completing the mission' to defeat the self-declared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) might look like. '""Completing the mission"" is a term – I don't even know what that means when you're talking about terrorist organizations,' said Marie Harf. She also called 'completing the mission' against the murderous terror army a 'catch-phrase' and a 'buzzword.' The jaw-dropping statement came exactly one week after President Barack Obama told the White House press corps, referring to his own government, that 'we don't have a strategy yet' for dealing with ISIS jihadis in Syria. Scroll down for video . Face, meet palm: State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf exploded at a journalist Thursday, saying that 'completing the mission' against ISIS is just a meaningless 'buzzword' 'We need to make sure we've got clear plans,' Obama gaffed on Aug. 28, 'and we're developing them.' Fox News Channel correspondent James Rosen asked Harf on Thursday whether the administration believed the battle against ISIS would extend past January 2017, when President Barack Obama will leave office after eight years. It's a question he had asked Harf's boss, Jen Psaki, in Tuesday's briefing. Psaki deflected it. But Wednesday on CNN, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said that the 'sustained effort' required to cripple ISIS is 'going to take time, and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat.' 'Now,' Rosen said Thursday, 'the administration has placed some kind of time-frame on this. So perhaps you could explain why this president, who has about 2-and-a-half years left on his term – a little less than that – feels he cannot complete this mission.' A visibly annoyed Harf snapped back. 'Let's talk about what this mission means, because I think that's a catch-phrase,' she told Rosen. 'Obviously, we cannot kill or capture every terrorist in the world,' she said. 'That's not how – that's not how this ends. We've been clear about that. What we can do is take the fight to them. Take their leaders off the battlefield. Cut off their funding. Build partner networks on the ground. ... So we can take away their capability to attack the United States and significantly degrade that.' Harf seemed to mirror a schizophrenic policy articulated a day earlier in Estonia by Obama himself, when he first said he aimed to 'destroy' ISIS but then vowed only to make it a more 'manageable' threat. Harf clung to Obama's second statement while ignoring the first. Fox News reporter James Rosen asked Harf whether the president thought he could finish off ISIS before leaving office in January 2017 . 'That's how you fight terrorist organizations,' she said. 'Completing the mission is a term – I don't even know what that means when you're talking about terrorist organizations. 'It doesn't always fall into a nice little buzzword, as you used in your question,' she mocked Rosen. '""Complete the mission – why won't he complete the mission by the end of this term?""' She cited the decline of al-Qaeda in Yemen, the Pentagon's recent attack on al-Shabbab in Somalia, and the drone-strike killing of the terror leader Anwar al-Awlaki as examples of intermediate victories that should reassure Americans. 'The record, Rosen shot back, 'could also be seen as including Benghazi, the current chaos in Libya, [and] the rise of ISIS to become the kind of threat that it is – but that would be argumentative. I don't want to go there.'","Marie Harf exploded at a Fox News correspondent who questioned whether President Obama could knock out ISIS by the end of his term in office .

"Controversial: Justice campaigners have called for an investigation after sex assault charges were dismissed against Matthew Barnett (above) due to lack of evidence . A county prosecutor and sheriff have been accused of a cover-up after sex attack charges were dropped against the grandson of an influential Missouri representative. Matthew Barnett, 17, had been facing charges of sexually assaulting a drunk 14-year-old girl at his family home in January. But the case sparked outrage among justice campaigners when the accusations were dismissed earlier this month due to lack of evidence. An online petition claims the decision was made despite video evidence and even before forensic test results had come back from the lab. It alleges the teenager's grandfather, GOP state representative Rex Barnett, may have influenced Sheriff Darren White and prosecutor Robert Rice. It states that Rex Barnett serves on at least one committee with Sheriff White and has called on Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster to investigate. 'The conduct of Robert Rice and Darren White is, at the very least, questionable in this case,' the petition goes on to say. Barnett had been accused of sexually assaulting the girl while his friend Jordan Zech, 17, recorded the alleged attack on his cell phone. It is also alleged a 15-year-old boy was filmed assaulting a 13-year-old girl at the same time in the house. 'Cover-up': It is claimed Barnett's grandfather, Missouri State Representative Rex Barnett (left), may have influenced Sheriff Darren White (right) into dropping the charges . Court documents state Barnett left the girl passed out on her front lawn, where she was found by her parents, according to St Joseph News-Press. She says she cannot remember the alleged attack. Barnett and Zech faced sex charges after the incident on January 8, but these were dropped on March 13 because prosecutors said they could not prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. Barnett instead faces a misdemeanor charge of endangering the welfare of a child over claims the girl was given alcohol and then dumped outside. No charges remain against Zech. Mr Rice said it was the 'right call' to drop the charges. 'The state does not have proof beyond a reasonable doubt that those two defendants committed the charges that were originally filed against them after concluding our investigation,' he is reported as saying.' He added: 'We did have all the medical, and all the information where we could make a decision based on the evidence, and I am absolutely convinced it was the right call to do, and it was the right decision to dismiss it.' 'Questionable conduct': The petition on change.org which calls on Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster to investigate the case . Campaigners have expressed their shock over the decision, which they claim was made before the forensic test results had been been returned. They also point to the fact there is video evidence and claim the 15-year-old confessed to his part in the attacks while facing charges in the juvenile courts. The petition posted on change.org, a website which allows people to campaign for social change, says: 'The rape kits (forensic tests) performed on both the girls haven't even come back yet for investigators to see. 'Matthew Barnett is also in a very influential family in Maryville. His grandfather is Missouri representative Rex Barnett, and Rex serves on at least one committee with Sheriff Darrin White. 'The conduct of Robert Rice and Darrin White is at, the very least, questionable in this case. 'Please sign our petition, give these girls and their families some relief, justice, and closure.'

"After decades of waiting for the fight the whole world wants to see, it now seems that Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao could happen twice in one year. Bob Arum, the PacMan’s promoter, is convinced that the two greatest pound-for-pound boxers on the planet will finally get it on in 2015. Arum also believes that the carrot of a double-your-money re-match a few months later will clinch at last a deal which has proved more elusive than the Scarlet Pimpernel. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pacquiao's thoughts on his main challenge, Algieri . Clash of the titans: Manny Pacquiao (left) could face Floyd Mayweather (below right) twice in a year . Since a first fight in May is projected to be the richest in ring history at $300 million, the prospect of raising the ante to more than half a billion dollars with a second clash in September next year will surely amount to an offer neither man can refuse. The removal of two long-standing obstacles which have prevented Mayweather and Pacquiao getting into the same ring together has encouraged Arum to go public in America. The major pay-per-view TV rivals in the US - HBO who screen Pacquiao’s fights and Showtime who have Mayweather under contract – are understood to be willing to share the massive financial pot via a joint-broadcasting contract. Arum says: ‘Both networks want this to happen. All signs seem to point to a first fight early next year,’ Then the departure of Richard Schaefer from his post as chief executive at Golden Boy promotions, who organise Mayweather’s promotions, has led to a thaw in the long-running feud between that company and Arum’s Top Rank corporation. Arum envisages that shift in positions making the two-fight deal negotiable. He says: ‘A second fight in the autumn would provide a different cash split because the winner of the first would claim the higher percentage. As each of them believes he would win, that provides an extra incentive.’ Pitching the idea: Pacquiao, throwing the ceremonial first pitch in San Francisco, could be willing to agree to a series of demands in order to fight Mayweather . Since the PacMan has agreed already to the Money man’s demands for Olympic-standard drugs testing and a bigger percentage of the purse for a first fight, it would seem that only Mayweather’s concern for his unbeaten record remains to be over-come. And the biggest hint yet that he is ready to meet that challenge has come with him hinting at ‘a big surprise when I announce my next fight.’ Actually, since he meets Marcos Maidana in a rematch in Las Vegas on Saturday week, he means his fight after next. That is planned in Sin City for May, which is good timing also for Pacquiao who fights Chris Alegieri in Macau this November. Always assuming, of course, that both the main men successfully defend their world welterweight titles. After that, time will begin running out for them to plunder the riches on offer right now. On the road: Pacquiao (right) and Chris Algieri are currently on tour to promote their bout in November . Both Mayweather and Pacquiao are in their mid-30s and Arum reminds them: ‘There is a sell-by date after which…..who cares?’ Although the public appetite for them to meet remains ravenous, there are signs on social media of fans growing tired of all the excuses and delays. Not that Mayweather and Pacquiao spending next year exclusively fighting each other would be the best of news for Britain’s own Amir Khan, who is hoping to cash in against one or other of them in 2015. If boxing’s version of the No 10 bus materialises – you stand there all day, then two come along together – Khan will still be left waiting at the stop. PS: In another sign that Mayweather is getting ready to bank his heftiest pay-cheques ever, he has been chilling out with American billionaire Warren Buffett. The aging mega-investor even changed into boxing kit at Mayweather’s gym in Las Vegas, where he gave the man called Money tips on how to make even more money from all the money he banks from boxing. ‘He’s cool,’ said Mayweather of Buffet. He’s also very, very shrewd. Common sense prevails for Fury . Tyson Fury, who erupted angrily when first charged with bringing boxing into disrepute, is said to be ready now to attend next Wednesday’s inquiry into his foul-mouthed outburst at a press conference. Fury threatened initially to boycott the hearing but Robert Smith, general secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control, says: ‘We understand Tyson will come to explain and defend himself.’ Eliminator: Tyson Fury (right) is set to face Dereck Chisora at the ExCeL Arena in November . That appearance, I understand, will ensure that Fury’s world heavyweight title final eliminator against Dereck Chisora goes ahead as re-scheduled on November 22 at London’s ExCeL Arena. Common sense appears to be prevailing. Not least because the potential prize of a championship challenge to Wladimir Klitschko is too big for Fury to refuse to accept a reasoned punishment – perhaps a fine and a caution - if found guilty. Nor – after being marooned for so long by the withdrawals of David Haye (twice) then Chisora and consequently relegated from a world heavyweight top 10 – can he remain inactive any longer. Frampton looking to sink Martinez in Titanic struggle . Belfast belter: Carl Frampton will look to beat Kiko Martinez again and retain his title . Barry McGuigan is presiding over the biggest fight in Belfast since the Clones Cyclone himself was in his exciting prime and filling the old King’s Hall to its rocking rafters. Carl Frampton, McGuigan’s protegee, will fight this Saturday night before an even bigger crowd, in a yet more dramatic venue. More than 16,000 will pack a temporary arena constructed in the Titanic Quarter, the dramatic commercial renovation of the shipyard site from which the doomed liner was launched. Like his promoter and mentor, who famously dethroned featherweight knigs Eusebio Pedroza in the warm London summer of 1985, the impressive and undefeated Frampton is hoping to bring a world title to Northern Ireland. Since he has beaten IBF super-bantamweight champion Kiko Martinez once already, Frampton is firm favourite to realise that ambition. The Spaniard regrouped after that stoppage, in Belfast, to claim his belt in convincing fashion. But with a fervent Ulster crowd anticipating even bigger nights in Belfast – against British rival Scott Quigg, Leo Santa Cruz and perhaps, eventually, Cuba’s super-bantam king Guillermo Rigondeaux – expect Frampton The Jackal to be a howling success this weekend. *Frampton v Martinez will be televised live on BoxNation on Saturday night.","Promoter Arum is convinced mega fight will finally happen in 2015 .

"A prisoner at Guantanamo Bay has accused guards of launching a crackdown on protesting detainees, bringing in a special team  with orders to 'break hands and legs'. Yemeni detainee Emad Hassan claimed a specialist team of guards have been attacking some of the prisoners in a letter to his attorneys at UK-based human rights charity Reprieve. In the note dated August 22, Hassan says a 'forced cell extraction' team beat  Shaker Aamer, the last British inmate in Guantanamo, adding that a medical team then took his blood by force. Hassan says the same team broke another prisoner's hand, and twisted a third man's leg so badly he was unable to walk. He writes: 'Who's next I don't know, but I'm definitely on the list.' Emad Hassan, a Yemini detainee at Guantanamo Bay, has claimed a specialist team has been brought in with orders to 'break hands and legs' of detainees protesting against their imprisonment . Hassan says the guards beat Shaker Aamer, the last British prisoner at the camp, before a medical team took his blood by force (file picture) He goes on to say that one of the beatings lasted for up to two hours. Hassan, who has been cleared for release since 2009, has been on hunger strike for the last seven years and is currently fighting a legal battle over his detainment and use of force-feeding. Colonel John Bogdan, a former Guantanamo warden, has previously said 'forced cell extraction' is only used against inmates who refuse to leave their cell, or pose a risk to themselves or others, and that guards are trained to use minimal force. However, Reprieve say that FCE is a process which involves detainee being forced out of his cell by a group of armed guards, often before being taken to the force-feeding chair. The charity says Aamer has previously described being beaten by the FCE team  eight times a day. In a statement, a spokesman for the charity protested the treatment of Aamer, saying he is in 'in extremely poor health' and suffering from post-traumatic stress. Aamer was cleared for release by both Bush and Obama administrations and has never been charged with a crime. He has been detained at Guantanamo for more than 12 years. Cori Crider, strategic director at Reprieve and a lawyer for Mr Aamer, added: 'Just weeks ago, the UK Government dismissed our concerns about Shaker Aamer’s wellbeing. 'Now we hear that Shaker, already a seriously ill man, has been beaten. 'Phillip Hammond should seek answers from the US without delay about why, instead of simply releasing Shaker, it prefers to detain and abuse him.' However Navy Captain Tom Gresback, a Guantanamo spokesman, denied the claims, saying that all personnel at the military base were committed to 'safe, legal, humane and transparent care' of inmates, according toVice News. He added that procedures for dealing with forced cell extractions and 'other movements' had not changed, despite a new warden and new commander taking over at the base last June.","Emad Hassan has been detained for 12 years and is protesting treatment .

"American whistleblower Edward Snowden has been elected rector of on of the UK's oldest universities. The computer analyst was nominated by a group of Glasgow University students who said they had received Snowden's approval through his lawyer. The result of the ballot, which opened to students on Monday, was disclosed in Glasgow today. National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, pictured in Hong Kong, has been elected rector of Glasgow University . The philosopher and economist Adam Smith (left), considered by many to be Scotland's greatest thinker, was rector of the university between 1787 and 1789. The political theorist and Parliamentarian Edmund Burke (right), who is often described as the father of conservatism, was rector between 1793 and 1785 . Snowden defeated former champion cyclist Graeme Obree, author Alan Bissett and the Very Rev Kelvin Holdsworth, who champions gay rights. Former CIA employee Snowden, 30, became a wanted man when his leaks brought to light secret National Security Agency (NSA) documents which revealed widespread US surveillance of phone and internet communications. He is staying in Russia where he has been given temporary asylum. In a statement to The Guardian, Snowden said he was 'humbled and honoured' by the vote, describing it as a bold and historic decision in support of academic freedom. 'In a world where so many of our developing thoughts and queries and plans must be entrusted to the open internet, mass surveillance is not simply a matter of privacy, but of academic freedom and human liberty,' Snowden said. A statement from the group which nominated Snowden said: 'We are incredibly delighted to see Edward Snowden elected as the new rector of Glasgow University. Former Prime Minister Andrew Bonar Law (left) is another former rector, between 1919 and 1922 as was TV personality Johnny Ball in the 1990s . Conservative politician, statesman and Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (left)  was rector between 1928 and 1931 while former Eastenders actor Ross Kemp, pictured here during his induction, took the role in 1999 . Former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy after the Ceremony of Installation as the new Rector of Glasgow University at Glasgow University's Bute Hall in 2008 . 'We have a proud and virtuous tradition of making significant statements through our rectors and we have once more championed this idea by proving to the world that we are not apathetic to important issues such as democratic rights. 'Our opposition to pervasive and immoral state intrusion has gone down in the records. 'What is more, we showed Edward Snowden and other brave whistleblowers that we stand in solidarity with them, regardless of where they are.' A lithographed portrait of Benjamin Disraeli who was rector for six years from 1871 (left) and Richard Wilson (right), who played Victor Meldrew in One Foot In The Grave, was rector from 1996 to 1999 . I don't believe it: Richard Wilson's induction ceremony in 1996 . Rab Butler, a key figure in the Conservative Party in the 1950s, is inducted as Rector of Glasgow University in 1956 . The statement added: 'In the following weeks we will continue to campaign for the NSA and GCHQ to cease their assault on our fundamental right to privacy and for Edward Snowden to be recognised as the courageous whistleblower he is, rather than a traitor.' The role of rector is to represent student issues to senior management at the university, but previous incumbents have been elected as political statements. Winnie Mandela was elected in 1987 and Israeli whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu became rector in 2005, despite students knowing that neither would be able to travel to Glasgow and take up the practical role of the position. Sir Robert Peel (left), the former Prime Minister who helped create the modern concept of the police force, was elected as rector in 1836 and (right) newsreader Reginald Bosanquet pictured reading the News at Ten, was rector between 1980 and 1984 . The English statesman Lord Palmerston was rector between 1862 and 1865. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela (right), ex-wife of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela, was elected rector between 1987 and 1990 . The election was held under the single transferable vote system. Snowden received 3,124 votes in the first round and 3,347 in the second. The nearest candidate was Mr Holdsworth, Episcopalian rector and provost of St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow, with 1,563 votes. PhD student Chris Cassells, part of the group that nominated Snowden, said: 'We had no idea what the outcome would be but we are absolutely delighted so many students felt this was an important enough issue to come out and vote. Snowden beat Graeme Obree, the former world champion cyclist pictured here, to the post . 1980-1984 - Reginald Bosanquet, TV newsreader . 1984-1987 - Michael Kelly, Lord Provost of Glasgow . 1987-1990 - Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, wife of Nelson Mandela . 1990-1993 - Pat Kane, musician, former student . 1993-1996 - Johnny Ball, TV presenter . 1996-1999 - Richard Wilson, actor . 1999-2000 - Ross Kemp, actor . 2001-2004 - Greg Hemphill, actor, former student . 2004-2005 - Position vacant . 2005-2008 - Mordechai Vanunu, Israeli nuclear technician and whistle-blower . 2008–2014 - Charles Kennedy, former Leader of the Liberal Democrats, former student . 2014- present - Edward Snowden, intelligence whistleblower . 'It's in the same tradition that elected Vanunu and Mandela. It's a clear statement from Glasgow students that they stand in opposition to pervasive state surveillance and that they celebrate Edward Snowden for his actions as a whistleblower. 'We are very hopeful he will be able to deliver the inaugural address in April either via video link or a pre-recorded message and hopefully that will be the first in a series of engagements.' The nomination of Snowden proved controversial on the university campus. The group that campaigned for his election complained that some posters they put up had been torn down and cut up, while some university unions called for an active rector who will be able to work on behalf of students to be elected. More than 6,500 students voted – double the number who voted when former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy was elected for a second time three years ago. A group of students who gathered in the university's Bute Hall to hear the election result were disappointed with the outcome. Louise Wilson said: 'It sucks. I'm all for political statements, but at a time when the university and students need the biggest say with all the cuts it's just not appropriate to not have a working rector.' Hannah McNeill said: 'I'm furious. We need an active rector, we could have given him [Snowden] an honorary degree or something.' Former champion cyclist Obree is a former student at the university who dropped out four months into a design engineering degree. He said: 'It was quite weird coming back after 25 years. I didn't quite fit in at the time so to be nominated as rector now was quite poignant. When I first accepted I didn't know Edward Snowden's hat was in the ring. 'The students obviously feel quite strongly about what he stood for.'","The computer analyst was nominated by a group of students .

"'Parting favour': One of Andrew Mitchell's final decisions as International Development minister was to unfreeze aid to Rwanda . Andrew Mitchell overruled Foreign Office advice to hand £16million of British aid money to a controversial African dictator accused of fuelling a bloody civil war. A senior Foreign Office source told the Daily Mail that Mr Mitchell’s decision to lift the freeze on aid to Paul Kagame’s Rwandan regime was a ‘mistake’ which would damage Britain’s reputation for standing up against human rights abuses. Mr Mitchell, now David Cameron’s chief whip, is reported to have overruled his own civil servants by making the decision in his final hours as International Development Secretary last month. Half of the money will go directly into the Rwandan government’s coffers – despite fears that it will be used to fund a murderous rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). One human rights campaigner yesterday described the move as a ‘parting favour’ to President Kagame, a personal friend of Mr Mitchell. The revelations will pile pressure on the chief whip, who is already fighting to save his job after being accused of hurling foul-mouthed abuse at police officers who stopped him riding his bike through the gates of Downing Street. Labour yesterday called for the publication of the civil service advice received by Mr Mitchell. Shadow International Development Ivan Lewis accused him of putting ‘personal friendship above proper foreign policy considerations’. The Department for International Development insisted his decision had been ‘based on advice from policy officials within the department’, but refused to detail the advice. In June, a United Nations report produced detailed evidence showing that Rwanda is backing the notorious M23 militia which is leading a bloody uprising in the DRC. Dictator: Rwandan president Paul Kagame (pictured with David Cameron in 2007) is accused of backing a murderous militia operating in neighbouring Congo . The militia, led by alleged war criminal Bosco Ntaganda, is accused of widespread murder and rape and has driven 470,000 people from their homes in recent months. Kagame, who was re-elected in 2010 with 93 per cent of the vote, has also been accused of suppressing political opponents and journalists in his own country. A senior Foreign Office source said: ‘The evidence against Kagame’s regime is absolutely overwhelming. The UN experts’ report found incontrovertible evidence that there had been support from Rwanda to the M23 rebels in terms of supplying weapons, uniforms, tactical advice and command and control assistance. There was also evidence of Rwanda fomenting strife in the area. ‘Most people in the Foreign Office think the time has come to take a really tough stand.’ Sources close to the new International Development Secretary Justine Greening have indicated she is also unhappy about the decision and will review it when the next aid payment to Rwanda is due in December. Congolese troops and tanks hunt for M23 rebels . in the east of Congo: The UN found evidence of support . from Rwanda to the M23 rebels in terms of supplying weapons, uniforms, . tactical advice and command and control assistance . Foreign aid accounts for more than 40 per cent of the Rwandan government’s income, and Britain is the country’s single biggest donor, giving £75million this year. A £16million aid payment was frozen at the end of July following the publication of the UN report. It was released just six weeks later on Mr Mitchell’s last day in office. Aid freezes imposed by the United States, Germany, Holland and others remain in place. In a statement last month Mr Mitchell said he was releasing the cash because Britain had a ‘responsibility to protect the poor’ in Rwanda. He said he had ‘sought assurances’ from Kagame that he was not abusing human rights.","New chief whip said to have made the decision in his final hours as International Development Secretary .

"A U.S. law firm that was advising Indonesia's government on trade issues was spied on by Australia, according to another top secret document released by former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden. Australia essentially did the United States' dirty work on behalf of the NSA which was then given the information. The document which was obtained by The New York Times does not go into details as to whether the information was then given to U.S. trade officials to provide some kind of leverage, but it does highlight the reach and influence the NSA had over other countries intelligence services. Listening in: An unnamed US law firm was caught up in surveillance involving the National Security Agency and its Australian counterpart . Watching and listening: The agency’s ability to crack encryption used by the majority of cellphones in the world offers it wide-ranging powers to listen in on private conversations. They're listening: U.S. law prohibits the NSA from collecting the content of conversations between Americans without a court order. If the NSA has the capacity to easily decode encrypted cellphone conversations, then other nations likely can do the same . The document outlines how the National . Security Agency's counterpart in Australia notified the the NSA that it . was eavesdropping on conversations between Indonesian officials and an . American law firm. The Australian agency offered to share the details with the NSA, including 'information covered by attorney-client privilege.' The . NSA is not allowed to target American citizens or businesses for . surveillance without a warrant, however, it is allowed to intercept . communications between Americans and foreign intelligence targets. The . document from the Canberra office speaks of how the Australian feds . were able to 'monitor to cover the talks, providing highly useful . intelligence for interested US customers.' The . U.S. law firm was not identified, but the New York Times also noted . that the Chicago-based firm Mayer Brown was advising Indonesia on trade . issues at the time. It is also not clear which trade issues were being monitored. A . lawyer from the firm who was involved in the talks told the Times: 'I . always wonder if someone is listening, because you would have to be an . idiot not to wonder in this day and age. But I’ve never really thought I . was being spied on.' The lawyer added: 'None of this stuff is very sexy. It’s just run of the mill.' Bending the rules: The NSA is not allowed to target American citizens or businesses for surveillance without a warrant . Crusade: Snowden leaked thousands of documents to media outlets including the Guardian and the Washington Post . Last year, Snowden leaked thousands of documents to media outlets including the Guardian and the Washington Post. One of the journalists to whom he leaked the documents, Laura Poitras, was bylined on the Times piece. Information disclosed by Snowden has included the NSA’s collection of the telephone records of millions of Americans. The . agency has also come under fire for eavesdropping on heads of state, . including the German chancellor Angela Merkel, and for working in . industrial espionage. Indonesia in recent years has been in a series of confrontations with the U.S. over cigarettes, shrimp and other issues. Attorney-client privileges protected by U.S. law do not extend to the NSA’s snooping. The . document, a monthly bulletin from the NSA’s liaison office in Canberra, . was dated February 2013, hints that the Australian Secret Service were . essentially operating as the Asian wing of the NSA, based on the other . side of the world.

"The seemingly-innocent SodaStream machines that allow environmentally friendly users to carbonate their own water at home has come under fire for producing ‘blood bubbles’. The Israeli company, which has just signed on Scarlett Johansson as their first Global Brand Ambassador, runs three factories in the occupied West Bank and many say the company is taking advantage of the Palestinian residents who have few other employment options. SodaStream has been around in one form or another for more than a century but it became a publicly traded company in 2010 and emerged on the American market over the past five or six years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sipping in 'blood bubbles'? Scarlett Johansson will be featured in the company's upcoming Super Bowl ad which is reigniting controversy over the locations of their factories . Now they are re-affirming their status in the cultural mainstream with an ad starring Johansson that will air during the Super Bowl, but that decision is bringing around a new round of boycotts. The company’s tagline- ‘Set the bubbles free’- and the good, clean feeling that comes with knowing that your carbonated beverage was also good for the environment play up the advantages, and the newly-minted spokeswoman is towing the party line. ‘My favorite thing about soda stream is that I don't feel guilty when I enjoy beverages at home. I don't feel I'm being wasteful,’ Johansson said in a behind-the-scenes video showing the making of the Super Bowl commercial. Those declarations come as double-edged swords for the company, however, as critics say that the ‘guilt-free’ bubbles come at a truly human cost. Hot bed: Three of the company's main production factories are located in the Israeli-occupied West Bank settlement of Mishor Adumim (pictured) where rent is up to 69% cheaper than in Israel . The Forward, one of the best-known Jewish daily newspapers in the United States, slammed the company, saying that it 'does exploit the commercial benefits of (the factory's) location, essentially profiting from occupation'. Specifically, rental rates for land in the settlement of Mishor Adumim- where the SodaStream factory is located- can run up to 69 per cent cheaper than similar land across the West Bank border in Israel. The controversy surrounding the product isn't new, and they are finding enemies in their target audience of left-leaning environmentally conscientious foodies. One example comes from the  Park Slope . Co-Op in Brooklyn which used to sell the controversial filters. Now they . have turned against them and joined a Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions . (BDS) movement and a group of members participated in a protest against . the company in December. Fizzy issue: Like many environmentalists, Johansson, seen here with Daniel Birnbaum, has said that she likes how users 'don't feel guilty' because SodaStream saves the use of plastic bottles . The fizz of controversy surrounding the Super Bowl ad is not the only concern for company executives, however, as their stock has taken a hit this quarter. They estimated lower profits than usual for this past holiday season- which ended up being on point- but they also said that the first half of 2014 would be a difficult time because of lower selling prices and high production costs that makes profit margins even more slim. Their high came in June 2012 when the company was selling for $76-per-share. The market closed today at $38.74-per-share, marking a 20.5 per cent hit since this time last year.","The actress has signed on to be the face of the company and will star in their Super Bowl ad .

"A skeleton key, one that can open any lock, is normally something confined to the realms of films and television. But two engineers claim to have devised a 3D printed ‘bump key’ that, with a bit of brute force, can do exactly that. Their device can apparently be used to open any conventional lock without having access to the real key used to open it. Scroll down for video . German engineers have revealed designs to make 3D-printed 'bump keys' (shown). These devices can be used to break into popular pin tumbler design locks. In a video a lock is opened by a bump key and a hammer in seconds. To make the key all that is needed is a picture of the lock and pin positions . Later this month at an event known as LockCon 2014 German engineer Christian Holler will present his and Jos Weyers' bump key design. Lock bumping is a lock picking technique that can be used to open pin tumbler locks (shown above), the sort found in many homes. These locks require a key with specific groves at different levels to align a set of pins along what is called the shear line, allowing the lock to be turned. Each pin has an upper and lower segment, as shown in the image. A bump key, meanwhile, has groves that are all at the same level. When the key is placed in a lock, it needs to be struck sharply with a hammer while torque is applied. The force of the blow makes the top of the pins ‘jump’ above the shear line but leaves the bottom pins in place, allowing the lock to be turned. A stopper is also used to prevent damage being done to the lock. Traditionally bump keys were made out of metal, and were quite hard to manufacture. Now, with the 3D-printing method, anyone could feasibly create their own bump key. Using DIY software known as Photobump, the technique requires only a picture of the lock in question to produce a working key. ‘While there are locks on the market, that are immune to bumping, a large quantity of locks in use is theoretically vulnerable,’ Holler explains in a blog post. A bump key, as its name might imply, involves ‘bumping’ a key into position in a lock. They have multiple grooves cut to the same length that can fit into conventional locks. They are normally made from blank keys, which are flattened keys with no cuts, used by locksmiths and manufacturers to make key duplicates. The technique for making bump keys isn’t particularly new; it’s been around for decades, with a hammer used to hit the key and click it into a lock’s pins. With 3D printing, however, such keys can now be made relatively easily. To create the key, Holler and Weyers use a picture of the lock in question. They also need to know the position of each pin in a target lock, which is accessible from widely available key-cutting software. Mr Holler says it can be used to open locks that are vulnerable to bumping, but such keys have been on the market for more than ten years. The 3D printing technique, however, makes the creation of both blank and bump keys much easier. ‘If you have the right software, getting a blank is easy,’ Holler tells MailOnline. Designer Christian Holler tells MailOnline that he does not think his work will be used by burglars to break into houses. 'One of the main reasons is probably that there are easier, destructive entry methods, and a burglar is not interested in non-destructive opening,’ he says . ‘Basically, I take a photo [from the front], then I manually edit it in Photoshop or Gimp (it's really easy) to give me a black/white silhouette of the profile,' Mr Holler continues. ‘Once I have that, I import it into my software, specify the key length (that would also be guessed from the brand) and from that, I already get a 3D model that I can order from any online 3D printing service.’ But, he says, making a bump key is a bit more difficult. It requires knowledge of the pin distances and maximum height, which can be guessed from other keys or taken from a database. To print them he doesn’t use his own printer, but rather a professional printing service which can take a few days, or up to two weeks. To create the key, Holler and Weyers use a picture of a lock in question.They also need to know the position of each pin, which is accessible from widely available key-cutting software. Mr Holler says it can be used to open locks that are vulnerable to bumping, but such keys have been on the market for more than ten years . The bump key is made from a 3D model of a blank (shown) and has groves that are all at the same level. When the key is placed in a lock, it needs to be struck sharply with a hammer while torque is applied. The force of the blow moves the pins and allows the lock to be turned and opened . On whether a burglar could use this technique to break into a house Mr Holler says: ‘If he has enough criminal energy, then I guess, yes.’ However he adds that he does not think this is a ‘realistic scenario’; he says that bump keys are already available, but they are not widely used by burglars. ‘One of the main reasons is probably that there are easier, destructive entry methods, and a burglar is not interested in non-destructive opening,’ he explains. ‘At least here in Germany, only something below 0.2 per cent of all burglar attacks target the lock cylinder.’ But his advice is that if you are worried about bump keys, there are locks are available that are immune to bumping. 'All regular pin tumbler looks are vulnerable,' he says, but other systems are typically immune. Using a pin tumbler design with a so-called 'sidebar', however, requires a second combination on the key that is much harder to mimic. But despite revealing his technique to create bump keys, Mr Holles doesn't consider bumping 'a larger threat now' with his work. 'The practical relevance of bumping (for burglars) seems to be overall low, so there is no reason to panic about this,' he says. 'People also haven't panicked the last 10 years, although bumping was a well known technique.'","A German engineer has revealed how to make 3D-printed 'bump keys'

"An electronic nose can sniff out superbug Clostridium difficile in pateints' faeces. Currently tests only look for toxins which suggest C-Diff might be present . Sniffing faeces with an ‘electronic nose’ can detect bacteria causing deadly infections, according to new research. An electronic nose was able to sniff out whether killer hospital superbug Clostridium difficile (C-diff) was present in patients’ faeces - as well as which variety they have. This is because different strains of the bacteria release different smelling chemicals, which the nose can pick up on. Current tests just examine the symptoms and search the faeces for toxins which suggest C-diff is present, rather than sniffing out the bug itself. Researchers at the University of Leicester say the tool could be useful in screening patients in future. One of the researchers, Professor Paul Monks, told the BBC that electronic noses could be attached to bedpan washers to screen patients for C-diff. He said: ‘By smelling different strains of C. difficile we could tell which are good and which are potentially bad, which leads to the question, ""Can you screen patients?"" ‘We've shown it is possible to do it in the lab - the next thing we need to do is in bedpans. 'We can [put the e-nose] on the side of bedpan washers as you start the cycle, sniff it and then say, ""You may want to look at that patient"".’ C-diff can lead to serious infections, causing stomach cramps, temperatures and diarrhoea. It is resistant to many ordinary antibiotics and can lead to death. In 2012, there were 1,646 deaths in the UK involving C-diff. While the number of cases has fallen rapidly, a new strain of bacteria has emerged in recent years that tends to cause more severe infections. It is hoped that screening for C-diff could save the NHS money if patients are not hospitalised for so long with it. Scientists were able to work out the ‘chemical fingerprint’ of compounds associated with the different strain of the bug. The electronic nose could smell the 'chemical fingerprints' of different strains of the bacteria. Researchers were able to work out the 'chemical fingerprint' of compounds associated with different strains of the superbug. The electronic nose can identify each different strain . Scientists are already investigating whether electronic noses could be used to detect cancer, by looking for the unique smell of the chemicals produced by a lung or breast tumour. As well as being able to identify which strain of bacterial species is present, the researchers said that knowing which strain of bacteria was causing the illness could allow doctors to give more targeted treatment. Dr Martha Clokie, from the university’s Department of Microbiology and Immunology, said: ‘Current tests for C-diff don’t generally give strain information - this test could allow doctors to see what strain was causing the illness and allow doctors to tailor their treatment.’","Electronic nose can detect whether superbug Clostridium difficile is present in faeces, as well as which strain .

"Carl Frampton kept his footing on the slipway down which the Titanic slid towards disaster and brought his first world title home to Belfast. The Jackal’s speed of hand as well as movement overwhelmed Kiko Martinez’s defence of his IBF super-bantamweight title. Ulster, reconciled behind its new standard bearer for an improved present and a better future, rejoiced. Scroll down for video . On his way: Carl Frampton lands with a right hand on Kiko Martinez as he eases his way to the world title . Down he goes: Martinez was dropped in the fifth round but recovered to take the fight to the final bell . The setting, a pop-up arena for 16,000 in the historic Titanic Quarter, made its own statement about the growing prosperity of a city trying to leave its Troubles behind. Frampton’s classy exhibition of counter-punch boxing gave him a runaway victory, even though his gallant Spanish opponent kept coming through the pain and punishment to give the fans a fight to keep watching. Those heroics gave Martinez one round and a share of the last by my 119-109 reckoning. Two of the judges went one point better at 119-108, while the third gave Martinez a sympathy score of 118-111. The Jackal could could not deliver the knock-out for which the crowd were baying. But this performance put the cement in the bricks of reconciliation in Belfast which his manager and mentor, the Irish legend Barry McGuigan, began constructing with his own world title exploits back in the 1980s. A rich future involving championship unification fights beckons. Frampton would prefer the first of those to be against English rival Scott Quigg, holder of the ‘regular’ WBA title. As the IBF belt was strapped about him he said: ‘I’ll fight Quigg anywhere. And he needs to remember that I’m the one holding a proper world title.' A mandatory may intervene early next year but Frampton is close to being the finished article after this, only his 19th fight. Close up: Frampton picked the champion off throughout to build up a healthy lead on the scorecardsV . And the new: Frampton is announced as the new world champion after dethroning Martinez in Belfast . Following in his footsteps: Frampton is hugged by his manager and former world champion Barry McGuigan . His inability to repeat – or even improve upon – his ninth round stoppage of Martinez here last year suggests he still has to sharpen his killer instinct when he has a top-class fighter in trouble. The one knock-down he landed should have encouraged him to shed the last vestiges of caution. But this was a stylish 12 rounds of work and Britain has another worthy champion to celebrate. The Jackal, as challenger, had entered the ring first to a great howl of acclaim from the Ulster gathering  reconciled behind their symbol of the new Belfast. Had this been indoors the din would have been deafening. But although a little of the euphoria dissipated into the cold night air it was still an electrifying atmosphere in a statement venue. The formalities of the first round were less rousing but Frampton connected with enough crisp rights to take it. Martinez sensed he had to march into the line of fire but was repeatedly picked off. When he did get to close quarters Frampton was the sharper in-fighter. Although he walked on to one right himself he was already building a solid lead. Martinez had done well to regroup and win the IBF belt since losing to Frampton last year but the Jackal looked to have improved even more. This was growing into an impressive evening for Frampton – and a potentially long one for a champion who could not land cleanly. Frampton was down early in the fifth but English referee Steve Gray ruled it a slip – not to the approval of all in the Titanic Quarter. There was no doubt when Frampton connected with the sharp right which decked the champion. Martinez also suffered a slight cut as he battled to stay in the fight. Going for it: Martinez did well to last the full 12 rounds as he tied to push Frampton on to the backfoot . Swinging: Frampton now wants a unification with Manchester's Scott Quigg who has the WBA belt . This was one way traffic and Martinez needed all his courage keep resisting the storm. The Frampton left was as wound as the right now and the Spaniard was beginning to resemble a bull being stuck by the picador. The chance was there for The Jackal to improve on his ninth-round stoppage first time . It was almost a novelty when Martinez connected with a cuffing left hook – but he was punished by a stinging Frampton combination for his trouble. Still Martinez kept coming – and getting hit. Martinez at last enjoyed some success in the eighth session. After outscoring the challenger in the clinches he shook Frampton with a left and a right and finally had a round to call his own. An encouraged Martinez raised the pace at the start of the next but after forcing Frampton even further on to the back foot he shipped more damaging counter punches. Martinez needed a knockout to keep his title but he was the one being rocked repeatedly. But although the crowd appreciated the quick, slick quality of their man’s work they were growing a mite impatient for a knock-out finish. The tenth was another round in the Ulster bag. But for a cautious tendency Frampton would surely have finished it by now. The faithful were not as animated but a sudden burst of Belfast aggression had them back on their feet and Martinez did well to make it to the bell. The pair embraced at the start of the last round, one acknowledging the skill and one the courage of the other. Again the gallant Spaniard survived a barrage as Frampton went for the grandstand finish, The knock-out punch did not materialise and Martinez battled for a deserved share of the 12th. It was a landslide victory for Frampton; his first world title was well won, if not in fully spectacular fashion.","Carl Frampton outpointed Kiko Martinez to win IBF super-bantamweight title .

That night in 1981, Chartrand was bartending at Fanny Ann's Saloon, a bar in Old Sacramento. Police found the stolen car 750 miles north in Washington.

"The family of a nine-year-old girl who accidentally killed a shooting range instructor with an Uzi have spoken of the devastation at the tragedy. The girl's parents, named in a police report as Alex Gen and Alison MacLachlan, released a statement saying that they prayed that instructor Charles Vacca would survive after the incident at the Last Stop range in White Hills last Monday. The statement came as officers investigating the death released police reports, which say that immediately after the shooting, the girl said she felt that the gun was too much for her and had hurt her shoulder. Scroll down for video . The nine-year-old girl, pictured alongside shooting instructor Charles Vacca, at the White Hills shooting range in Arizona . Mr Vacca, pictured, was shot in the head, after the girl accidentally fired the Uzi and he later died in hospital . Her family members were focused on the girl because they thought she was injured by the gun's recoil and didn't immediately realize that Mr Vacca had been shot until one of his colleagues ran over to him, the reports state. New Jersey-based lawyer Kevin Walsh released a statement saying that the girl's family 'prayed day and night that (Mr Vacca) would survive his injury, and they continue to pray for his family during this terribly difficult time.' However, neither the reports nor the statement by Mr Walsh explains why the parents let the girl take the Uzi. The family had taken a shuttle from Las Vegas to the range around 60 miles away during their vacation to the city. After arriving, the girl, her parents, sister and brother took a monster truck ride before heading to the shooting range. Mr Vacca's family say they harbour no ill feelings toward the girl and her family and instead say they feel sorry for the child and want to comfort her . The girl's father was the first one in the party to handle a weapon. After he fired shots, Mr Vacca instructed the girl on how to shoot the gun, showed her a shooting stance, and helped her fire a few rounds, according to the reports. He then stepped back and let her hold the Uzi by herself. She fired the gun, and its recoil wrenched the Uzi upward, killing Mr Vacca with a shot to the head, the reports state. The girl then dropped the Uzi, and Vacca fell to the ground. The girl then ran towards her family, who huddled around her as she held her shoulder. Another instructor rushed over to help to Mr Vacca and the other children were then taken away from the range. The reports describe the family as shaken by the accident. The incident happened at the Last Stop outdoor shooting range, pictured, in White Hills, Arizona . Recordings of 911 calls show that people at the shooting range desperately tried to keep unconscious Mr Vacca alive as they urged emergency dispatchers to send a medical helicopter. The call handler can be heard urging the caller to apply pressure to Mr Vacca's wound. He was then flown to a Las Vegas hospital where he died hours later. Prosecutors are not filing charges in the case but Arizona's workplace safety agency is investigating the death. County prosecutors say the instructor was probably the most criminally negligent person involved in the accident for having allowed the child to hold the gun without enough training. They also added that the parents and child weren't criminally culpable. Prosecutors are not filing charges in the case but Arizona's workplace safety agency is investigating the death . The incident unfolded as the girl's mother recorded her daughter firing weapons on her mobile phone at the range, pictured . The incident unfolded as the girl's mother recorded her daughter firing weapons on her mobile phone. In the video, released by investigators, Mr Vacca can be heared saying 'All right, go ahead and give me one shot.' He then cheers when she fires one round at the target and then says, 'All right, full auto.' However, the footage, which does not show Mr Vacca being shot, ends with series of shots being heard. Mr Vacca's ex-wife and children have said they harbour no ill feelings toward the girl and her family and instead say they feel sorry for the child and want to comfort her. Meanwhile, Sam Scarmardo, the range's operator, has said the parents had signed waivers saying they understood the rules. He also said he never had a safety problem before at the range and his policy of allowing children eight and older to fire guns under adult supervision and an instructor's watchful eye is standard industry practice, though he noted his policies are under review.

"Czech Republic snatched a last-gasp win over Holland thanks to Vaclav Pilar's added time goal after a dreadful mistake by Daryl Janmaat in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday. Defender Janmaat attempted to cushion a header back to Jasper Cillessen inside the area but it beat the Dutch keeper and struck the post only for Pilar to tuck the rebound into the net to the delight of the home fans watching the Group A clash. The Czechs had started brightly and were rewarded in the 22nd minute when David Lafata controlled a cross into the box before laying it off to Borek Dockal whose left-foot shot slammed off the post into the net to give the hosts the lead.

Holland, third-place finishers at the World Cup in Brazil, responded with a Stefan de Vrij driving a header into the back of the net after a cross from Daley Blind in the 55th minute. The hosts kept their shape at the start in an effort to blunt a Dutch attack missing several key players, including Arjen Robben who was out with an ankle injury. The Dutch began taking more control in the second half but they could not beat Czech keeper Petr Cech for a winner as both sides pressed forward. Pavel Vrba’s always looked dangerous on the break though and scored when the Dutch mix up gave them a dream start to their campaign. The result also gave coach Vrba, who took over following their failure to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil, his first victory at the helm. The match was Guus Hiddink's first competitive game in charge since his return to the national side after Louis van Gaal stepped down to take charge of Manchester United.

Scroll down for video . Daniel Ashley Pierce, 20, from Kennesaw, Georgia, secretly filmed the moment he was disowned by his family . In the video a woman, believed to be his mother, is heard saying: 'I have known that you were gay since you were a tiny boy. 'You have made a choice from what you've told your daddy. You can deny all you want to but I believe in the word of God and he does not create anybody that way.' Mr Pierce responds saying that he was born this way and has not made a choice, but his family does not back down. He tells his family he believes that 'scientific proof trumps the word of God'. But his mother responds saying: 'You will need to move out and find whenever you can to live. Because I will not let anyone believe that I condone what you want to do.

"Have you ever daydreamed about having superhuman strength so you can lift weights with such ease it was like picking up a feather? Well, now one man has man this dream a reality. Incredible suits capable of lifting heavy weights have been developed by universities and the military, but until now the technology was prohibitively expensive. Now a US engineer has made his own exoskeleton using scraps of metal to make his dream of having superhero powers a reality. Scroll down for video . Making light of the situation: James Hobson, a Californian engineer who is known as The Hacksmith, has demonstrated his DIY exoskeleton by lifting a 171.5lbs (78kg) breeze block barbell, pictured in this screen shot . James Hobson, a Californian engineer who is known as The Hacksmith, has demonstrated his DIY exoskeleton by lifting a 171.5lbs (78kg) breeze block barbell. His contraption looks like a mechanical backpack with metal arms, which are strapped securely to his own. Pneumatic cylinders on the arms allow him to lift heavy weights with ease and he can be seen curling the large weights in the video. The exoskeleton comprises two arms, a backpack frame, valve bank and a compressor. Pneumatic cylinders on the arms allow Mr Hobson to lift heavy weights with ease. When the valve is activated, high pressure is pumped into the top section of the back cylinders and the bottom section of the front cylinders on the backpack. That pushes one piston down and the other one up. When this happens, the lifting arm pivots and when the back piston depressed, the arms lift up. ‘I didn’t feel like I was lifting 170lbs…but my legs felt it,’ he said. Mr Hobson has documented the creation of the exoskeleton, which he has been working on since May. Talking about his motivation to create the gadget on his website, he said: 'As You can probably imagine, it's been a life goal of mine to build some kind of exoskeleton - the alien exoskeleton, an Iron Man suit...the list goes on. ‘[But] it's just too darn expensive! Until now. A friend got me a bunch of pneumatic cylinders and it's finally within my reach.’ While he has not said how much the exoskeleton has cost to make, it features two arms, a backpack frame, valve bank and a compressor. His friend and fellow YouTube star, RimstarOrg, explained that when the valve is activated, high pressure is pumped into the top section of the back cylinders and the bottom section of the front cylinders on the backpack. Lots of people daydream about having superhuman strength – or an Iron Man suit (pictured) they could use to save the world. Incredible suits capable of lifting heavy weights have been developed by universities and the military but the technology is prohibitively expensive for consumers . Armed and ready for action: The contraction looks like a mechanical backpack with metal arms (pictured), which are strapped securely to Mr Hobson's own. They allow him to lift heavy weights. With the addition of a better air compressor and support for his legs and back, the engineer could lift much heavier weights . That pushes one piston down and the other one up. When this happens, the lifting arms pivot and when the back piston is depressed, the arms lift up. Mr Hobson can lift the 170lb (78kg) weights unaided to waist level, but used the pneumatic exoskeleton to raise the weights higher. He thinks with a few tweaks, his exoskeleton could lift double the weight. ‘If I upgrade my air compressor, I could potentially curl 300lbs (136kg) but I don’t think my back and legs could take it,' he said. ‘I’m going to have to build the lower half of this exoskeleton – it’s just going to get better from here.’","A Californian engineer known as The Hacksmith, has demonstrated his DIY exoskeleton by lifting a 171.5lbs (78kg) breeze block barbell .

"An Australian forklift driver who some historians argued was the true heir to the British throne has died in the small New South Wales town he called home. Mike Hastings, 71, was a real-life aristocrat, born the 14th earl of Loudoun, who moved to Australia in 1960 in search of adventure. He made international headlines in 2004 when a Channel Four documentary team conducted extensive research into the monarchy and concluded his ancestors were cheated out of the crown in the 15th century.

Hastings, an avowed republican, died on June 30 and was buried today in Jerilderie, about 465 miles southwest of Sydney, the local Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser reported. He was a descendant of England's House of York, whose dynastic struggle with the House of Lancaster became known as the Wars of the Roses and was dramatised by William Shakespeare. The British documentary found documents in France's Rouen Cathedral he believed showed King Edward IV, who ruled with a brief interruption from 1461 to 1483, was illegitimate. Historian Michael Jones believes that Edward's father Richard of York was fighting the French at Pontoise when he was conceived.

If true, the crown should have passed on to Edward's younger brother George, the duke of Clarence, who was a direct ancestor to Hastings. Hastings showed little interest in pursuing his claim to the monarchy when interviewed by AFP in 2005, citing the intense public scrutiny endured by the royals.

"A diner who asked for a ‘doggy bag’ to take home her half-finished meal was surprised to be asked to sign a legal waiver. The complicated form is being issued to customers at a restaurant part-owned by celebrity chef Raymond Blanc before they can take any of their food away with them. Brasserie Blanc in Oxford refused to allow the diner to take home her unfinished tarte flambee – a pizza-style dish – before she agreed to indemnify them ‘from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, damage, costs, charges, fines, penalties and expenses’ that could arise from her eating it at home. Suprised: Sarah Hesketh (left) was asked to sign a disclaimer when she asked to take home her unfinished tarte flambee from Brasserie Blanc in Oxford, which is part-owned by celebrity chef Raymond Blanc (right) The restaurant said the document was designed to stop diners from suing it if they took the £11.80 dish home, failed to store or refrigerate it properly and became ill. But managers admitted they had never been sued. Sarah Hesketh, 31, from North London, said: ‘I was having Sunday lunch with my boyfriend and didn’t manage to finish my main course, so thought I’d take it away to eat on my way home. ‘But when I asked the waitress to wrap it up she said I had to sign a waiver. I did it without thinking, but the more I thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed. It is a completely pointless bit of paperwork. I only wanted to take away the tart that I was already eating.’ Written in convoluted legalistic jargon – and bad English – the ‘indemnity form’ asks diners to ‘confirm that I will be taking away [the food or drink] into the house/home (“the premises”) for the consumption (“function”)’. It continues: ‘I and my guests will then be able to consumer [sic] this food or drink.’ But the diner must fulfil two requirements. Firstly, they must ‘ensure that all applicable licensing laws are complied with’ and ‘ensure that no sales of liquor are made on the premises’. Waiver: Sarah Hesketh had to agree to indemnify the restaurant 'from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, damage, costs, charges, fines, penalties and expenses' that could arise from her eating it at home . Secondly, they must: ‘Observe and comply with all legal requirements relating to food and its preparation, food safety and health and safety, together with any other requirements affecting catering premises and/or premises for the preparation of food (as defined by the Food Safety Act 1990, whether statutory or otherwise) and all new relating Regulation.’ Brasserie Blanc said the form is a standard one provided by environmental health officers and used by many restaurants. A spokesman said: ‘Although we don’t have to use it, staff are strongly recommended to as we don’t have a licence to serve takeaway food.’ Restaurant critic Richard Harden, co-founder of Harden’s London Restaurants guides, said: ‘I would never ask for a doggy bag in the first place. But even if I were to, I don’t see the use of this form. ‘I’ve never heard of such a thing. This is just more nonsense designed to interfere with the operation of common sense.’ Security: The restaurant said the document was designed to stop diners from suing it if they took the £11.80 dish home, failed to store or refrigerate it properly and became ill.

"The King of Spain is a serial womaniser who once made a pass at Princess Diana while she was on holiday with Prince Charles, a book has claimed. It also alleges that Juan Carlos is a ‘professional seducer’ who has had numerous affairs and has not shared a bed with his wife for the past 35 years. And it reveals that age has not stopped  the 74-year-old, with the monarch regularly receiving vitamin injections and anti-ageing treatments. Tactile: Princess Diana being kissed in 1987 by the King of Spain, who according to a new book, is a serial womaniser . Together: Diana, Prince Charles and their boys with King Carlos, Queen Sofia and members of the Greek royal family on board a yacht in August 1990 . The Solitude of the Queen by Pilar Eyre, which is likely to prove controversial in the Catholic country, claims the king made a ‘tactile’ advance to Diana while she and Charles were on holiday in Majorca in the 1980s. It follows much-derided allegations made in 2004 by Lady Colin Campbell that the princess had a fling with Juan Carlos while on a cruise in August 1986 and then again the following April. Controversial: The Solitude of the Queen by Pilar Eyre claims the king made a 'tactile' advance to Diana while she and Charles were on holiday in Majorca in the 1980s . During a 1987 visit, in which Charles . and Diana  went to Madrid, the king was pictured smiling as he kissed . the princess on the hand – a gesture which left Diana  looking . embarrassed. Miss Eyre’s book also alleges that Queen . Sofia has not slept in the marital bed since 1976 and only remains in . the marriage out of ‘a sense of duty’. She even claims the queen stumbled upon her husband with one of his alleged  lovers, the Spanish film star Sara Montiel, at a friend’s country house in Toledo in 1976. Sofia, now 73, was forced to attend a football match the day afterwards ‘as protocol demanded’, before storming out of the  Zarzuela Palace, their official residence, with her children. Advised to stay with her husband, she was told a break-up would mean she would ‘end up being paid to liven up the parties of the newly rich’. Miss Eyre adds: ‘The role of the queen is sad, she is the loneliest woman in Spain.’ Distant: Carlos and Queen Sofia have allegedly not slept in the marital bed together since 1976 . She also told Spanish gossip magazine  Vanitatis: ‘Queen Sofia is a woman betrayed and hurt with a married life that has been a real tragedy. The king’s closest friends I have spoken to say they don’t like her.’ And she alleges that, as recently as last year, when the monarch was recovering from the removal of a benign lung tumour, he was seeing a 25-year-old German translator. After writing the book, Miss Eyre was informed she would no longer appear on Spanish TV channel Telecinco. She said she was told: ‘The station has banned talk about your book and does not allow you to continue working. You are banned, Pilar, we are sorry.’",Book claims Juan Carlos has had numerous affairs and has not shared a bed with his wife for 35 years .
"By day, Abi Steel is a sharp-suited queen of the boardroom whose tenacity and talent have brought her enviable success as an international educational consultant. But at home, the 32-year-old mother is the epitome of an old-fashioned wife, ensuring the house runs like clockwork. Still, there's one daily ritual she adamantly refuses to take part in - eating with her husband, Tristan. 'I've made a very calculated decision to limit the times we sit and eat together. It's just so unappealing,' she says. Scroll down for video . Worried she'll look unattractive: Abi doesn't want her husband to see her eating . 'I want my husband always to find me attractive, and munching away in front of him is the last thing he needs to see.' Instead, Abi, from Newbury, Berkshire, dines with their four children: Lewis, 12, Alliyah, 11, Verity, eight, and Jessica, six. Abi, a slender size 10, says her attitude towards food had been set long before she met Tristan. The daughter of a teacher and a policeman, she had it drummed into her from an early age that her attractiveness was inextricably linked to what and how she ate. 'Eating cereal is a particular problem,' she says. 'The noise is simply unbearable. Corn on the cob is even worse - messily eating with your fingers makes you so unappealing. 'It's a relief not to have to eat with Tristan and also that he is happy to dine while I sit and chat to him. 'At the weekends, when we do eat together as a family, I will only eat a small portion - half a chicken breast and a few vegetables - so I still look elegant and self-controlled.' But surely an intimate dinner as a couple is one of life's pleasures? There is something delicious about sharing an indulgent pudding with your partner, and men often comment that they find a hearty appetite appealing in a woman. Not Tristan. He is grateful that Abi largely keeps the unedifying business of eating away from his gaze - and appreciates her constant efforts to keep her weight in check. 'It shows she cares about how she behaves in front of me; too many women don't. She doesn't make a big issue out of it and is very discreet. I would find it unattractive to see Abi tucking into huge portions or unhealthy meals.' Dr Jessamy Hibberd, a chartered clinical psychologist and author of several books about our relationships with food, says it's surprisingly common for women to feel uneasy dining in front of their partner. Discreet: Abi is happy to eat in the kitchen away from her husband's eyes . 'We are socially conditioned to feel negative about our bodies, even when we're slim, which naturally makes us self-conscious about what we are seen to eat,' she explains. 'Many of us use food as a means of communicating something about ourselves - ordering a salad or refusing chocolate, for example, makes us think that others will be impressed by our restraint. We fear being judged and that our choices reflect not just our figures but also our personalities.' Abi has been self-disciplined from her first date with Tristan, 38, a company director - inconveniently, at a steak restaurant in Portsmouth, where she opted for a light chicken dish and side salad. 'I ordered a panna cotta for dessert but ate just two small mouthfuls before declaring that although it was delicious, I was full. To me, that portrayed femininity. 'I behave in exactly the same way in front of my friends and so do they. I can't remember the last time one of them ordered something masculine such as pie or chips.' Although Abi may surreptitiously enjoy a biscuit with a cup of tea if she's on her own, in the evening she will lay just one setting at the dining table. 'I'm happy watching Tristan eat a manly steak or large portions. I do all the cooking in our household, and consider feeding him well as another way of showing that I care.' Melanie Carson's fear of dining with her doctor husband Matthew, 43, however, is inextricably linked to gaining almost two stone since they met five years ago. The 35-year-old blog editor has gone from a petite size 8 to a 12 and is now ashamed to sit at the same dinner table as him. 'I've hardly eaten in front of Matthew since our wedding three years ago,' says Melanie, who lives in North London. 'It's had a huge impact on our social life. Last weekend, we went to our favourite French restaurant but while he tucked into three courses, the only thing I ate was a starter of fried courgettes. Not because I'm on a diet, but because I simply didn't want to appear indulgent in front of him.' Fears looking greedy: Ali's awkwardness about eating with her husband stems from worries about her weight . Her awkwardness first manifested itself in early 2011, 18 months into their relationship, by which point she'd gained around 10lb through a mixture of contentment, work commitments and little time to exercise. 'We were wedding planning in the pub over a Sunday roast, and I'd already decided I'd order sticky toffee pudding for dessert,' she recalls. 'Then Matthew started talking about how he'd upped his gym regime ahead of the wedding and I stared down at my big plate of food, disgusted. 'How could I eat like that in front of the man I was going to marry when I was already bulging out of my clothes? Matthew's never said or done anything to make me feel self-conscious. But I've been so vocal about hating my weight gain that it seems hypocritical to then be seen eating. 'Perhaps because of his job as a psychiatrist, Matthew doesn't question my behaviour or make an issue of it, he just tells me I look great and encourages me to join a netball team or the gym.' Only one in ten British families sit down and eat a meal together, and a fifth of those will spend fewer than ten minutes at the table . In fact, Matthew admits that he feels 'uncomfortable' when Melanie hides away to eat in the kitchen, especially when he's in the house. 'I miss seeing her looking happy and relaxed at the dinner table,' he says. 'I honestly never scrutinise Melanie's weight or what she eats. To me, she is still the beautiful woman I married.' Although Ali Ogilvie, 35, a project manager from Shropshire, is not yet at the stage where she avoids eating in front of husband Stu, 36, a consultant in the travel industry, altogether, she empathises with Melanie's angst. 'In restaurants, I'll pick the smallest piece of bread from the basket and pass the rest to Stu, and order lean chicken instead of the juicy steak I'd prefer. 'If he's at work on a Saturday, I see that as my opportunity to eat whatever I want.' Ali's issues also relate to her weight - she was a size 10 when she and Stu started dating in 1999 but is now a 16. Stu, on the other hand, has always been sporty and has spent the past decade regularly running marathons. 'He has the metabolism of a horse, so eats like one,' Ali says. Frustrated: Stu wants his wife to be happy and worry less about what she eats . Ali began feeling awkward eating in front of her husband a year after their wedding in 2003. 'I remember devouring a stack of pancakes for breakfast one morning on holiday in America, then reading on the menu that they contained 1,400 calories. I was horrified that I looked greedy in front of Stu, although he insisted he was not bothered. 'For the past decade I've tried to make sure my portions are feminine compared to Stu's because I don't want to appear greedy.' Ali admits her willpower is part of her personality: 'I am highly organised and quite controlling so I feel like a failure because I'm not in control of my eating habits - which is why, publicly at least, I try to look like I am in control.' Yet Stu admits his wife's private war over meal times makes him sad. 'I just want her to be happy and healthy and to eat what she truly wants to. It's frustrating to see her restricting what she eats as I know it detracts from her enjoyment of a meal. 'I think men are much easier going than we are given credit for and I don't think most men judge women on what they eat. 'There's far too much pressure on people, especially women, to look, be and eat a certain way. 'I wish Ali could find a way to balance food and physical activity so that she worries less about what she eats. 'The day we order a cheeseboard for two in a restaurant and I can sit and watch her indulge to her heart's content is one I will cherish.'","Abi Steel refuses to eat with her husband .

"Roy Hodgson insists the Football Association would jump at the chance to involve David Beckham in the England set-up. The 39-year-old former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder told several national newspapers earlier this week that he would be proud to have a role with England in the future. And now Three Lions boss Hodgson has given his approval for Beckham to assist the national team in some capacity. England fan: David Beckham said he would jump at the chance to be part of the England set up . 'Someone of David's stature, with his qualities and personality, I'm 100 per cent certain if he can find the time to lend his presence to the FA they would be happy to find role for him,' Hodgson told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. 'If he could make himself available for England in some way or another I have no doubt in my mind that (FA chairman) Greg Dyke and (FA general secretary) Alex Horne would welcome his presence within an England capacity.' Come and join us, David: Roy Hodgson says he is sure The FA could find a role for Beckham . Leader: Beckham captained England 59 times and made 115 appearances for the Three Lions . Beckham earned his 115th and final England cap in 2009 and his only duties with the national team off the pitch since were when he served as a 'player liaison' as part of then manager Fabio Capello's backroom staff at the 2010 World Cup after injury ruled him out of the tournament.

"A 20-year-old woman from Massachusetts who was banned from driving took to the road after manufacturing a home-made licence plate for her car. Writing on a piece of cardboard, she used a red marker pen to draw out letters in the centre of the licence plate before using a blue pen to write 'Massachusetts' at the top and 'Spirit of America' below. However the forgery proved less-than convincing after officers driving along the I-391 in Chicopee quickly spotted the fake plate.

"Controversial post: Richard Kopf is a senior U.S. district judge in Nebraska . A top judge has told the U.S. Supreme Court to 'stfu' in a blog post. Richard Kopf, the senior district judge in Nebraska delivered the profanity-filled blast to justices for taking what he sees as a too active role in controversial cases. He said: 'Next term is the time for the Supreme Court to go quiescent–this term and several past terms have proven that the Court is now causing more harm (division) to our democracy than good by deciding hot button cases that the Court has the power to avoid.

In October, Judge Kopf declared Congress should 'go to hell'. In his latest post, Judge Kopf posted up a letter from an anonymous lawyer begging him to stop blogging because it distracts the public from the fundamental role of a judge. The lawyer wrote: 'There is little surprise in the level of attention drawn by, or the inevitable public reaction to, a federal trial judge, in a public forum, repeatedly using vulgarity including serial exercise of the f-word, apparently disclosing a fondness for looking up the skirts and down the blouses of female attorneys who appear before him, telling Congress to ""go to hell"", and urging the SCOTUS to ""stfu,"".

"Charges: Justin Ross Harris, pictured in court earlier this year, has been indicted on eight counts . Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia dad who left his 22-month-old son to die in his hot car earlier this summer, has been charged with the boy's murder. If convicted, 33-year-old Harris faces a mandatory life sentence and possibly the death penalty. A Cobb County grand jury indicted him on eight counts including malice murder - which states that he left his son behind 'with malice aforethought' - and two counts of felony murder on Thursday morning. He also faces counts of cruelty to children in the 1st degree, cruelty to children in the 2nd degree, criminal attempt to commit felony exploitation of children, and two counts of dissemination of harmful material to minors. The charges of criminal attempt to commit a felony and dissemination of harmful materials  are not related  to Cooper's death - rather, they refer to allegations that Harris sexted underage girls. Harris pleaded not guilty to murder and child cruelty charges in mid-June, but these charges filed in a grand jury indictment supersede the previous charges. More information will become available about the latest charges at a 3pm press conference. Harris was arrested after his son Cooper was found dead in the back seat of his hot car, which was parked outside the Home Depot where he worked on June 18. Scroll down for video . Indicted: Harris has been charged with malice murder for the death of his 22-month-old son Cooper, pictured, who died after Harris left him in his hot car in June. As the boy died, he sexted numerous women . Found: Temperatures soared to the high 80s as Cooper was left to die in the SUV, pictured, on June 18 . Police  said the toddler was left in a vehicle for about seven hours as temperatures in the Atlanta area soared into the high 80s. The medical examiner's office has said the boy died of hyperthermia - essentially overheating - and has called his death a homicide. During subsequent investigations, it emerged that Harris had sexted as many as six women while Cooper died. He even texted one 16-year-old girl an image of his erect penis, documents reveal. The latest indictment refers to these allegations, accusing Harris of requesting a nude photo of a minor's genitalia and sending the same girl descriptions of 'sexual excitement and sexual conduct'. In mid-June Harris pleaded not guilty to charges of felony murder and second-degree child cruelty, claiming he had simply forgotten to drop his son off at daycare that morning. Staying silent: Harris' wife, Leanna, appears in court for her husband's bond hearing earlier this summer . At the time, Cobb County Chief Magistrate Frank Cox signed off on the charges, saying Harris must have noticed that 'the stench in the car was overwhelming' when he got in it and 'drove it for some instance' before stopping to check on his son. Prosecutors have claimed that Harris, an unfaithful husband to wife Leanna, had wanted a life without children - even looking at website advocating a child-free lifestyle before the death. Investigations found he had also researched online how long it takes to die in a hot car. Another allegation was that Harris had taken  his son's new forward-facing  seat out of the car and switched it for an old rear-facing one before his death. If Cooper had been in a forward-facing seat, there would be more chance of Harris seeing the toddler when he got out of the car. During a three-hour hearing in July, prosecutor Chuck Boring questioned a police detective at length, outlining evidence he said proved that Harris intentionally left his young boy in the hot SUV. But defense attorney Maddox Kilgore argued that the evidence was insufficient and that the boy's death was a tragic accident. Harris is a native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and moved to Georgia in 2012 to work for Home Depot.","Justin Ross Harris, 33, was arrested in June after his 22-month-old son Cooper was found dead in his hot car outside his workplace .

"Britain’s most high-profile black woman judge, Constance Briscoe, has been arrested by police. The 55-year-old was questioned by Kent Constabulary before being bailed pending further inquiries. ‘A 55-year-old woman was arrested in Clapham, south London, on Saturday October 6. She was interviewed by officers,' Kent Police said in a statement. Her arrest means that she will not be able to sit as a judge while being investigated concerning matters which cannot be revealed for legal reasons. A spokeswoman for the Office for Judicial Complaints said in a statement: ‘The Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor have suspended Constance Briscoe from the judiciary pending the outcome of the police investigation into the allegations against her. It would be inappropriate to comment further whilst the investigation is active.’ Ms Briscoe has been a controversial figure and was unsuccessfully sued by her own mother over revelations in her autobiography. The leading barrister and part-time judge wrote ‘Ugly’  a memoir about her grim childhood in Kennington, South London, which charted in agonising detail her difficult younger years. Controversial: Ms Briscoe's memoir 'ugly' made her famous and led to her mother unsuccessfully suing her for defamation . Relationship: Until 2010 Ms Briscoe  was with Anthony Arlidge QC . In the book, Ms Briscoe alleges that her Jamaican mother Carmen and stepfather Garfield Eastman regularly beat her as a child and repeatedly criticised her looks, once refusing to buy her school photograph with the words: 'You is ugly.' Once her mother allegedly said: 'Look at those lips - you didn't get them from my side of the family. Why don't you use them to clear out the blocked sink?' Ms Briscoe also . describes the extraordinary lengths she has gone to not to be 'ugly' any more in the sequel to her memoirs, Beyond Ugly, published in 2008. She has had cosmetic operations to . narrow and straighten her nose, to slim her lips, to remove eye bags, to . whiten her teeth and narrow her feet.

This is a late, late, late crisis. ‘Of course, I was terribly upset. I’d been with him a long time, but I think men get to a certain age where they press the bonkers button.’ She and Mr Arlidge met in a café at the Old Bailey in 2000.

"Health officials are investigating nine cases of muscle weakness or paralysis in Colorado children and whether the culprit might be a virus causing severe respiratory illness across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday sent doctors an alert about the polio-like cases and said the germ — enterovirus 68 — was detected in four out of eight of the sick children who had a certain medical test. The status of the ninth case is unclear. The virus can cause paralysis but other germs can, too. Health officials don't know whether the virus caused any of the children's arm and leg weaknesses or whether it's just a germ they coincidentally picked up. Scroll down for video . Suffering in Colorado: Jayden Broadway, 9, of Denver struggles to sit up in his hospital bed coughing as he is being treated for enterovirus 68, the virus that's been identified in 40 out of 50 states . Sweeping the nation: The CDC has been testing a limited number of specimens from very sick children around the country, and as of Thursday reported 277 people in 40 states and the District of Columbia with enterovirus 68 . EARLY SYMPTOMS: . The virus beings like the common cold and may include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. This is all that happens for most people who catch an enterovirus, especially adults. Children, especially with asthma, are more susceptible to catching a more severe form of the illness. At the beginning it's almost impossible to tell the difference between enterovirus 68 and a common cold. If a child develops a rash, a fever, or has difficulty breathing, parents should seek medical attention as soon as possible. PROGRESSION: . Some patients will develop a severe cough, have difficulty breathing and/or develop a rash. Enterovirus 68 is sometimes also accompanied by a fever or wheezing. Children accross the United States have had to be put on life support because of the virus. Beginning last month, a flood of sick children began to hit hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago — kids with trouble breathing, some needing oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many — but not all — had asthma before the infection. Health officials are investigating nine cases of muscle weakness or paralysis in Colorado children and whether the culprit might be a virus causing severe respiratory illness across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday sent doctors an alert about the polio-like cases and said the germ — enterovirus 68 — was detected in four out of eight of the sick children who had a certain medical test. The status of the ninth case is unclear. The nine children had fever and respiratory illness about two weeks before developing varying degrees of limb weakness. Earlier this year, Stanford University researchers said they had identified polio-like illnesses in about 20 California children over about 18 months. Two tested positive for enterovirus 68. CDC officials say it's still not clear if the virus was a factor in those cases. The CDC has been testing a limited number of specimens from very sick children around the country, and as of Thursday reported 277 people in 40 states and the District of Columbia with enterovirus 68. So far no deaths have been attributed to the virus, but  15 still are being investigated. RED CROSS PREVENTION TIPS: . 1. Avoid sharing objects such as utensils, cups, and bottles. 2. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands afterwards. If tissue-less, cough or sneeze into your elbow or upper arm, not into your hands. 3. Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth to keep germs from entering your body. 4. Proper and consistent hand washing is one of the easiest ways to prevent the spread of flu. Teach kids by example by showing them proper hand washing technique: . Wet hands with water and apply an amount of soap recommended by the manufacturer to hands. Rub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, covering all surfaces of the hands and giving added attention to fingernails and surfaces where jewelry is worn. Rinse hands with water. Dry thoroughly with a disposable towel. Use towel to turn off faucet. 'That's why we want more information,' and for doctors to report similar cases, said the CDC's Dr. Jane Seward. The cases occurred within the last two months. All nine children are being treated at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, and most are from the Denver area. A hospital spokeswoman said the patients' families didn't want to talk to the media. The nine children had fever and respiratory illness about two weeks before developing varying degrees of limb weakness.  None seems to have a weak immune system or other conditions that might predispose them to severe illness, but the cases are still being investigated, Seward said. Investigators don't think it's polio — eight of the nine children are up to date on polio vaccinations. It's not known whether the limb weakness or paralysis is temporary or will be long-lasting. The cases come amid an unusual wave of severe respiratory illness from enterovirus 68. The germ is not new — it was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before, including in Georgia and Pennsylvania in 2009 and Arizona in 2010. Because it's not routinely tested for, it's possible the bug spread in previous years but was never distinguished from colds caused by other germs. This year, the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses. Beginning last month, a flood of sick children began to hit hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago — kids with trouble breathing, some needing oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many — but not all — had asthma before the infection. Bed ridden: 13-year-old Will Cornejo is recovering at Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian/St. Luke's Medical Center in Denver earlier this month from what doctors suspect is enterovirus 68 . Sudden onset:  Will Cornejo, 13,  was at school one day earlier in the month, woke up not feeling well in the night and in the morning his mom found him unconscious on the couch and had to call 911 . The CDC has been testing a limited number of specimens from very sick children around the country, and as of Thursday reported 277 people in 40 states and the District of Columbia with enterovirus 68. So far no deaths have been attributed to the virus, but Seward said 15 still are being investigated. Health officials know enterovirus can cause paralysis. Published reports count at least two U.S. children who were paralyzed and died and were found to have the virus in their spinal fluid. One was a New Hampshire 5-year-old who died in 2008. Details are scant on the second case, which happened many years earlier. Earlier this year, Stanford University researchers said they had identified polio-like illnesses in about 20 California children over about 18 months. Two tested positive for enterovirus 68. CDC officials say it's still not clear if the virus was a factor in those cases. Paralysis is a rare complication of enterovirus 68 infection, but with so many more cases of enterovirus being reported this year, it may not be surprising to see that problem, said Dr. Larry Wolk, chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The CDC is asking doctors to report patients 21 or younger who developed limb weakness since August 1 and who have had an MRI exam that showed abnormalities in the nerve tissue in the spinal cord. Seward said a test that showed the germ in a patient's spinal fluid would be good evidence that the virus was causing paralysis. Unfortunately, lab tests of spinal fluid often fail to identify bugs like enterovirus 68, even if they're present, she added.

"The U.S. government is going to log the diversity of every neighborhood in the U.S. As part of a proposed rule, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), would provide detailed demographic information on every single neighborhood in the country in an attempt to get a better understanding of segregation, integration and poverty, the agency said. This racial mapping will be done as part of the new Fair Housing rule proposed by the agency. Big deal: Shaun Donovan, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. details the Fair Housing rule at a recent speech given to the NAACP . By disseminating this information, HUD believes the original Fair Housing Act, signed into law in 1968, will be modernized for the 21st century, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan said in a recent speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The more modern approach to tackling today's discrimination issues should be able to help HUD lessen disparities such as African Americans learning about 11 percent fewer . available rentals and 17 percent fewer available homes to bu . This inequality comes from real estate agents showing fewer available properties to minorities than to equally qualified whites, Donovan explained, adding that ‘because of the subtle nature of this discrimination, often times, they don’t even know they have been subjected to this abuse.’ Brain trust: U.S. President Barack Obama (L) speaks as Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano (2nd L), U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta (2nd R) and Housing and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan . The best way to combat this problem, said Donovan, is through a neighborhood mapping tool the agency will create that will provide information on jobs, schools and transportation.The agency believes the map will help ‘expand access to high opportunity neighborhoods and draw attention to investment possibilities in under-served communities,’ Donovan continued.The maps will allow planners and residents to view ‘data on patterns of integration and segregation, racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty,’ as well as ‘data on individuals with disabilities and families with children, and discrimination,’ according to the rule proposal.HUD will also further step up fair housing enforcement. In the past three over $54million in compensation has been awarded to 25,000 people who were wrongly discriminated against as a result of enforcement actions, Donovan noted. Urban decay: Two vacant and boarded up apartment buildings sit across from a liquor store near downtown Detroit, MI, a city that has become symbolic of the plight of declining inner cities in the U.S. Calling this a ‘big deal,’ Donovan added that ‘With the HUD budget alone, we are talking about billions of dollars. And as you know, decades ago, these funds were used to support discrimination. Now, they will be used to expand opportunity and bring communities closer to the American Dream.’With half of all African-American household wealth in the U.S. wiped out in the four years before President Barack Obama took office, Donovan said, quoting a Pew Research study, the agency has its work cut out.Donovan, though, remains optimistic, saying ‘we will continue to in order to strengthen this work in the months and years ahead to bring Fair Housing into the 21st century.’","Meant to bring the Fair Housing Act, passed in 1968, into the 21st century .

"It has been revealed that the University of South Alabama campus police officer who fatally shot a naked student was carrying pepper spray and a baton at the time . University spokesman Keith Ayers admitted yesterday that Officer Trevis Austin, was armed with all three weapons when he walked outside the police station with his gun drawn to confront Gil Collar. The shooting of the 18-year-old college freshman who was naked when he banged on police department windows in the early hours of last Saturday caused national outrage because of the perceived use of excessive force. Scroll Down for Video . Gunned down: College freshman Gil Collar (left) was shot dead campus police officer, Trevis Austin (right), who was carrying a baton and pepper spray as well as his gun . It's unclear why Austin, a four-year employee in his first police job  went for his gun first, but the decision was defended by the campus police as the right course of action. Authorities said that Collar, a 5-foot-7, 140-pound high school wrestler in his first semester of college, was on LSD when he moved aggressively toward the officer in an athletic stance, prompting the shooting. But surveillance video shows the student never tried to grab the officer's weapon or got within 4 or 5 feet of Austin. A copy of the university's weapons policy, released to The Associated Press in response to an open records request, shows an officer's actions in cases where force is necessary should be based on how much a suspect resists. Loss: Gilbert with his mother Bonnie, who said footage of the killing showed he had not touched the officer . Loss: Friends and family, including Collar's . mother, right, said that the police officer should have dealt better  teenager . Deadly force is justified only when a suspect has the intent, ability and opportunity to kill or injure someone else, the policy states. The policy says that an officer's attempt to control a situation 'should match (the) level of resistance then move up or down as resistance changes.' But Ayers declined comment on how the guidelines are interpreted when an officer is confronted by someone who doesn't have a weapon, yet could present a threat. 'The university is withholding further comment at this time as the district attorney and sheriff's office have time to conduct a thorough external review,' he said. An attorney for Collar's family, former Alabama Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley, said the university's policy 'totally gives support to our position' that the shooting wasn't justified. 'There is no question the required force here was much less than shooting somebody,' he said. 'He could not say his life was in jeopardy or he was in fear of bodily harm.' Probe: Austin, an officer for four years, has been placed on leave while an investigation continues . Authorities have said a grand jury would review the shooting to determine whether charges should be filed. Such investigations are typical in police shootings in Alabama. Mobile County Sheriff Sam Cochran has said it was unclear whether the officer could have done anything other than shoot Collar because he walked outside with his gun drawn. 'Had the officer had a Taser or some other less lethal instrument, I do not know if that officer would have had an opportunity to ... holster his pistol and to use something else because the events were evolving so rapidly and he was so close that had he put the pistol in the holster, I don't know that he could have drawn something else,' Cochran told reporters earlier this week. Cochran said he believed it was proper for the officer to go outside with his gun drawn after Collar repeatedly banged on windows at the campus police station, but he hasn't said whether he thought the shooting was justified. Authorities haven't said why Austin drew his gun first rather than opting for a less-lethal weapon.

Ajmal said he would soon start work on his bowling action with Mushtaq, who will reach Lahore on Sunday.

"For any new parent, trying to get their baby to stop crying can be a daily ordeal, but not for these mothers in Tokyo, Japan, who hand their infants over to student sumo wrestlers who compete to make them bawl. During the festival of Nakizumo, which literally translates as 'crying baby sumo', wrestlers take a child each, enter the ring, then begin pulling faces and making noises in order to get the babies to cry. The first child to cry is declared the winner, and if both start crying at the same time, then the champion is the one who cries the loudest. If the babies don't shed tears, laugh or - as sometimes happens - fall asleep, then the referee dons a devil mask to finish the job. The 400-year-old tradition is based on the proverb 'crying babies grow fastest', and it is believed that making the infants weep will bring good health. It is also thought that the sound of their screams will ward off evil spirits. Scroll down for video . In the 400-year-old festival of Nakizumo, which literally translates as 'crying baby sumo' student sumo wrestlers compete to make children bawl . The wrestlers take a child each into the ring, then pull faces and shout Naki, meaning 'cry', to start the tears flowing. Whoever cries first in the winner . If both babies begin crying at the same time then whoever is the loudest is declared victorious. The competition takes place in the Sensoji temple, Tokyo . The festival is based on the proverb 'crying babies grow fastest' and is designed to bring good health. The sound of screams is also thought to ward off evil spirits . In order to compete in the festival, babies must have been born in the previous year. The competition is held on Children's day in Japan, part of a national holiday . If the babies don't cry, laugh or even fall asleep, then it is up to the referee to get the tears flowing using a traditional oni, or ogre, mask . Good god: Once they begin bawling the babies are held up high so their screams will be closer to heaven which the Japanese believe will strengthen the blessing . The ritual takes place all over Japan but is most commonly performed by student sumos at the Buddhist Sensoji temple in Tokyo . The contest is watched over by a traditional sumo referee called a gyoji, who wears an elaborate silk outfit in order to denote his rank, and holds a wooden fan used to start the bout . The festival is held on April 26th each year and is part of Golden Week, a period of nine official public holidays which lasts from late April until early May . Sumos hold babies while competing to make them cry the fastest during the annual Nakizumo festival held in Sensoji temple, Tokyo, Japan . One baby looks on with a rather sinister scowl as the other child weeps, meaning she is the winner of this round of Nakizumo . In order to take part in the competition, the infants are often dressed up in miniature kimonos, have devil horns put on their head or wear bibs with traditional writing on them . Babies are held face to face to determine how loud and long they can cry. Some 120 babies attended the event this year .","Sumo wrestlers compete to see who can make babies cry the fastest during the traditional Nakizumo festival, Japan .

"Loyal: Morrison with Baroness Thatcher in 1990 . A former Tory Minister last night made incendiary claims that one of Margaret Thatcher’s closest aides was implicated in one of the most harrowing child abuse scandals of recent times. Rod Richards, a former Conservative MP and ex-leader of the Welsh Tories, made the shocking allegation that he had seen evidence linking Sir Peter Morrison to the North Wales children’s homes case, in which up to 650 children in 40 homes were sexually, physically and emotionally abused over 20 years. Mr Richards also linked a second leading Tory grandee – now dead – to the scandals at homes including Bryn Estyn and Bryn Alyn Hall, both near Wrexham. He said official documents had identified the pair as frequent, unexplained visitors to the care homes. Mr Richards – who helped establish the inquiry that unearthed the scale of the abuse – said bluntly: ‘What I do know is that Morrison was a paedophile. And the reason I know that is because of the North Wales child abuse scandal.’ He added that William Hague, who was Welsh Secretary at the time of the inquiry, ‘should have seen the evidence about Morrison’. Morrison was Lady Thatcher’s parliamentary private secretary and deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. The claims prompted Labour MPs to call for the files to be reopened to ensure that there had not been an ‘establishment cover-up’. Mr Hague called the inquiry into the scandal in 1996 after care homes boss John Allen was convicted of child abuse. It concluded that a  paedophile ring around Cheshire and Wrexham had caused ‘appalling suffering’ to children in care in the Seventies and Eighties. Scandal: Abuse was uncovered at the Bryn Estyn home, near Wrexham, North Wales . Mr Richards said he received detailed briefings about the case while junior Welsh Office Minister for health and social services. He said: ‘It fell to me to decide  initially whether to hold a public inquiry. So I saw all the documentation and the files. Morrison was linked. His name stood out on the notes to me because he had been an MP. He and [the other man] were named as visitors to the homes.’ Mr Richards could not offer anything to substantiate his claims against Morrison, who died in 1995 at the age of 51. But he said that as the MP for Chester, he would have no obvious reason to visit care homes in other MPs’ constituencies. The claims have emerged amid growing public revulsion over the institutional failures revealed by  the Jimmy Savile scandal. Savile was a regular guest of Lady  Thatcher’s at Chequers. Mr Richards added that he was frustrated that the £13 million, three-year inquiry headed by Sir Ronald Waterhouse QC had not uncovered any evidence to link Morrison to the  abuse. He said: ‘It would seem that there are some parallels with Savile in that Morrison got in under the radar, and his activities did not appear in the final report’. However, he said that as Welsh Secretary, Mr Hague ‘should have seen the evidence about Morrison’ in the preliminary files. Network: Further abuse was uncovered in Bryn Alyn Hall, which was also run by John Allen . Last night, sources close to Mr Hague said that he had never come across any information implicating Morrison. His spokesman said: ‘Mr Hague established the North Wales Child Abuse Inquiry precisely because of the serious and widespread reports of abuse. It was set up to be as thorough as possible and its terms of reference were widely supported in Parliament.’ Tory peer John Cope – a Tory contemporary of Morrison’s in the Commons – told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Without hard evidence I cannot find these allegations credible.’ Mr Richard’s intervention follows claims last week by former Tory Minister Edwina Currie that Morrison had sex with 16-year-old boys when the age of consent was 21 and that he had been protected by a ‘culture of sniggering’. In her diaries, she called him ‘a noted pederast’, with a liking for young boys. Last week, Labour MP Tom Watson stunned the Commons when he asked David Cameron to examine historic allegations about a high-level paedophile ring linked to a former Downing Street aide – who he later clarified was not Morrison. Last night Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said of the allegations about Morrison: ‘These are extremely serious claims. The evidence files should be reopened to ensure that there has not been an establishment cover-up at the heart of Westminster’. North Wales police did not respond to calls for comment.","An ex-Tory minister has claimed Sir Peter Morrison was implicated in the child abuse scandal that engulfed children's homes in North Wales .

"Spain's king Juan Carlos today apologised for going elephant-hunting in Africa while everyday people in his country endure a severe economic crisis. In an unprecedented act of royal contrition, the monarch said: 'I am very sorry. I made a mistake. It won't happen again.' Looking sheepish and using crutches to walk, he spoke as he left the Madrid hospital where underwent surgery after breaking his hip in a fall during the trip to Botswana. Contrite: King Juan Carlos of Spain apologised for going elephant hunting after he was discharged from hospital following hip replacement surgery . Under fire: Spanish King Juan Carlos (right), pictured during a previous elephant hunting trip in Africa, has come in for criticism for his safari . It came as calls grew for him to be stripped of his honorary presidency of the Spanish branch of the World Wildlife Fund. Juan Carlos del Olmo, the secretary general of WWF Espana, said the king's position as patron had become untenable. He said: 'It's a problem of the image it sends nationally and internationally rather than the issue of elephant conservation in Botswana.' The 74-year-old monarch had come under scathing criticism this week after he went on the expensive safari as both Spain and its citizens struggled amid an economic crisis that has worsened by the day. The trip came to light when the king fell and had to be rushed back to Spain on Friday. A . royal palace official denied news accounts that the monarch left the . country without telling the government saying that he told the prime . minister where he was going. Anger: Juan Carlos (left, on a previous trip) has been slammed for his upper-class pursuit as his country goes through the economic doldrums . And Justice Minister Alberto Ruiz-Gallardon said yesterday that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy always knows where the head of state is. The palace official added the king made the trip as a guest of unnamed hosts - so no taxpayer money was spent. Farewell: Spain's King Juan Carlos pictured leaving from the Madrid hospital yesterday . Newspaper reports today suggested he was the guest of Mohamed Eyad Kayali, a Syrian-born Saudi business man and right-hand man of Saudi's defence minister Prince Salman. Kayali is said to be a key figure in securing a Spanish consortium the €6.7billion contract to build a high-speed rail link between Mecca and Medina. Many Spaniards were dumbfounded that the king could make such an opulent journey while everyday people brave a 23 per cent unemployment rate, a shrinking economy and fears the country will be the next after Greece, Ireland and Portugal to need a bailout. For many, the trip made the king's recent comments about how he could not sleep at night thinking about the country's unemployed ring hollow. News of the safari caused an uproar so loud it eclipsed Spain's economic crisis for a few days. Members of most political parties had urged the king to say he was sorry. The palace official confirmed the apology was unprecedented in the history of Spain's monarchy. The royal family has been in the news a lot lately - and not for the best reasons. The king's son-in-law Inaki Urdangarin is a suspect in a corruption case, accused of using his position to embezzle several million euros in public contracts through a not-for-profit foundation. Then, over Easter, the king's 13-year-old grandson shot himself in the foot with a shotgun, even though by law in Spain you must be 14 to handle a gun. Unlucky: The Spanish King was on trip hunting elephants in Botswana when he fell after returning to his bedroom in a lodge . Until now, Juan Carlos had always been a highly respected figure in Spain and almost never came in for criticism from either politicians or the media. The king rarely speaks out on current affairs in Spain. But with the royal family looking so bad because of the Urdangarin case, in his traditional Christmas address last year, the king made a point of saying 'everyone is equal in the eyes of the law'. He said he was worried because of what he called growing mistrust of 'some of our institutions'.","Spain is being sucked back into eurozone's financial crisis .

Scrutiny: Hartsfield-Jackson Airport where the 17-year-old had her breasts exposed while going through security . The Congressman wants the agent who touched his niece fired from Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta, Georgia.

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Mr Hall's press office in D.C. The senator for Georgia, Saxby Chambliss, has also contacted the TSA in his state about 'potentially invasive screenings'. The incident involving Mr Hall's gran-niece happened two years ago but has just come to light under the Freedom of Information Act after it was caught on CCTV.

Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport last year after she . had passed a scanning device. As she travelled down an escalator, she claims she heard someone yell: 'Hey you, hey you, ma'am, stop.

Exile: Monique, her brother Francisco (second row, third from left) and sister arrived in North Korea in the 1970s, shortly before their father was executed . Military operation: Monique Macias (left) stands in front of the Mangyongdae Revolutionary School with her elder sister Maribelle (centre) and brother Fransico (right) during their first year at school in 1989 .

Friendship: Francisco (left) poses for a photo with a friend in the grounds of the Mangyongdae Revolutionary School in Pyongyang in 1984 . This, she said, is what inspired her to publish her . memoirs now, with tensions between North and South Korea running high. She said: 'Although . North and South say they want unification, they don't actually know . each other as people. If we want unification, we have to bury . prejudice.' Ms Macias, who . left North Korea in 1994 and spends time with family in Spain, still . speaks Korean as her first language after those formative years in . Pyongyang with children of the elite. On . social occasions the country's founding leader, Kim Il-sung, . would nag her to study hard, which made him seem like a 'typical Korean . grandfather'. At the . Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, the uniform worn by Ms Macias and her . sister and brother was a military-style jacket with officer's pips on . the epaulettes and a green cap emblazoned with a shiny red star. Her education, which she speaks highly of, was peppered with survival courses and drills. Education: Monique (second row, centre) poses with fellow students in 1990 while studying at a Pyongyang university . Holiday fever: Monique poses at the top of the Dongmyong hotel in Wonsan, eastern North Korea, during a break in August 1989 . Memoirs: Now in her 40s, Ms Macias poses for the camera during an interview in central Seoul last week . She said: 'The . first week, all of us were so hungry after shooting, climbing and . running every day that we ate our weekly rations in three days and, for . the other four days, we were hungry. 'But we learned - we learned we had to organise ourselves.' The . school traditionally took only boys but Ms Macias said a class was created . for girls so she and her sister could study together. Each girl was given a Kalashnikov to train with and had to learn how to strip, clean and reassemble it. She said: 'Most . people could shoot guns when they were 18 or 19. But because I was put . in the only class with girls my sister's age, I was able to shoot when I . was 14. 'I could probably still shoot it but I don't remember how to strip it.' She recalls rumours in 1989 of the Tiananmen Square democracy movement and . subsequent massacre in Beijing reaching the hallways of North Korean . colleges. 'I felt . university students in Pyongyang at the time were thinking about change . too. Although they (North Korean media) didn't report it, a lot of . people knew about it.' Under . the North Korean education system, anti-Americanism became a constant . factor in her understanding of the world as a child, something that made . meeting her first American a big shock on a rare trip to see relatives . in Beijing. She said: 'At that time . no one there spoke English and I was lost. I saw a white guy passing and . I asked him if he spoke English but when he started talking he had an . American accent,' Macias said. 'I . was so scared. I thought ""oh my god, it's an American"". My palms were . sweating and I just started to run. He was shouting ""hey, stop! I'm not . going to eat you"".' This week, state media in North Korea criticised a report by a US think-tank on scenarios for the collapse of a reclusive country with a grim record of famine, prison camps and nuclear brinkmanship. But Ms Macias sees that as unlikely. She said: 'There are people in North Korea who know that this is not the right way to live,"" she told Reuters in Seoul. 'I don't think it's going to collapse easily. What I'll say is that it can open up like China but very, very slowly.' Bubbly: Ms Micias, now in her 40s, spends much of her time living with relatives in Spain, although she was in Seoul for the launch of her memoirs .","Monique Macias was packed off to North Korea with her siblings in the 1970s when her father was executed .
The former leader of Equatorial Guinea struck a deal with Pyongyang to take his children shortly before his death .
Monique's schooldays consisted of firing Kalashnikovs and completing survival courses and military drills .
Now in her 40s, Ms Macias has just published her memoirs of North Korea, 'I'm Monique, from Pyongyang'"
"A supermassive dinosaur measuring 85ft (26m) long and weighing 59,300kg (about 65 tons) has been discovered by scientists. The skeleton of the Dreadnoughtus schrani, seven times bigger than T-Rex, is also the most complete skeleton ever found of its type, with more than 70 per cent of its bones - excluding the head. Because all previously discovered supermassive dinosaurs are only known from partial remains, Dreadnoughtus offers an unprecedented window into the largest animals to ever walk on Earth. Gentle giant: The new supermassive dinosaur (artist's impression, pictured) measured 85ft (26 metres) long and weighed around 65 tons when it was alive, say scientists . Dr Kenneth Lacovara, associate professor at Drexel University's College of Arts and Sciences, who discovered the fossil, said: 'Dreadnoughtus schrani was astoundingly huge. In May scientists in Argentina revealed they had found the fossilised bones of the biggest dinosaur of all time. Scientists believe the species of titanosaur weighed in at 170,000 pounds, as heavy as 14 African elephants. A local farm worker found the remains which were captured by the BBC's Natural History unit. The fossils were then excavated by a team of palaeontologists from the Museum of Palaeontology Egidio Feruglio, led by Dr Jose Luis Carballido and Dr Diego Pol. They unearthed the partial skeletons of seven individuals - about 150 bones in total - all in 'remarkable condition'. According to the measurements of its gigantic thigh bones, the herbivore would have been 130ft (40m) long and 65ft (20m) tall. 'It weighed as much as a dozen African elephants or more than seven T-Rex. 'Shockingly, skeletal evidence shows that when this 65-ton specimen died, it was not yet full grown. 'It is by far the best example we have of any of the most giant creatures to ever walk the planet.' The fossil skeleton was found in southern Patagonia in Argentina according to the journal Scientific Reports from the Nature Publishing Group. The new dinosaur belongs to a group of large plant eaters known as titanosaurs, and the fossil was unearthed over four field seasons from 2005 through to 2009. More than 100 elements of the Dreadnoughtus skeleton are represented from the type specimen, including most of the vertebrae from the 30-foot (nine metres) long tail, a neck vertebra with a diameter of over a yard (0.9 metres), scapula, numerous ribs, toes, a claw, a small section of jaw and a single tooth. Dr Kenneth Lacovara, associate professor at Drexel University's College of Arts and Sciences, said: 'It was astoundingly huge. It weighed as much as a dozen African elephants or more than seven T-Rex' The new dinosaur  was unearthed over four field seasons from 2005 through to 2009. Here the articulated tail of Dreadnoughtus schrani is pictured . The skeleton that was unearthed was found 70 per cent complete with a 30-foot (nine metres) long tail, a neck vertebra with a diameter of over a yard, a scapula, numerous ribs, toes, a claw, a small section of jaw and a single tooth.Here paleontologist Kenneth Lacovara is pictured with the right tibia (shin bone) of Dreadnoughtus . Most notably for calculating the animal's mass, nearly all the bones from both forelimbs and hindlimbs including a femur over six feet (1.8 metres) tall and a humerus, were also present. A smaller dinosaur with a less-complete skeleton was also unearthed at the site. Before the discovery of Dreadnoughtus, another Patagonian giant, Elaltitan, held the title of dinosaur with the greatest calculable weight at 47 tons, based on a recent study. 'Titanosaurs are a remarkable group of dinosaurs, with species ranging from the weight of a cow to the weight of a sperm whale or more,' said Dr Matthew Lamanna PhD from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. 'But the biggest titanosaurs have remained a mystery, because, in almost all cases, their fossils are very incomplete.' An artist's impression of of two Dreadnoughtus schrani shows them menacing a smaller meat-eating dinosaur. Dreadnoughtus was an herbivore that likely spent much of its life eating massive quantities of plants to maintain its enormous body size . The 3D laser scans of Dreadnoughtus show the deep, preserved muscle attachment scars that can provide a wealth of information about the function and force of muscles that the animal had and where they attached to the skeleton. Dr Lacovara said: 'With a body the size of a house, the weight of a herd of elephants, and a weaponised tail, Dreadnoughtus would have feared nothing. 'That evokes to me a class of turn-of-the-last century battleships called the dreadnoughts, which were huge, thickly clad and virtually impervious.' As a result, Dr Lacovara chose the name 'Dreadnoughtus,' meaning 'fears nothing.' 'I think it's time the herbivores get their due for being the toughest creatures in an environment,' he added. Dreadnoughtus lived approximately 77 million years ago in a temperate forest at the southern tip of South America. Here, a pair of bones called a 'chevron,'  are pictured. These bones occur along the bottom of the tail . Dr Lacovara said: 'With a body the size of a house, the weight of a herd of elephants, and a weaponised tail, Dreadnoughtus would have feared nothing. Dig and skeleton, pictured . The species name, 'schrani,' was chosen in honor of American entrepreneur Adam Schran, who provided support for the research. To grow as large as Dreadnoughtus, a dinosaur would have to eat massive quantities of plants and researchers say it would be like having 'a life-long obsession with eating'. Dreadnoughtus lived approximately 77 million years ago in a temperate forest at the southern tip of South America. Until now the biggest titanosaurs have remained a mystery, because, in almost all cases, their fossils are very incomplete. Paleontologist Dr Kenneth Lacovara, is pictured next to Dreadnoughtus schrani's femur (femur) Dr Lacovara added: 'Every day is about taking in enough calories to nourish this house-sized body. I imagine their day consists largely of standing in one place. 'You have this 37-foot [11.3 metres] long neck balanced by a 30-foot [nine metres] long tail in the back. Without moving your legs, you have access to a giant feeding envelope of trees and fern leaves. 'You spend an hour or so clearing out this patch that has thousands of calories in it, and then you take three steps over to the right and spend the next hour clearing out that patch.'","An associate professor in Philadelphia has found a fossil belonging to an 'astoundingly huge' dinosaur .
The skeleton of the Dreadnoughtus schrani is seven times bigger than a T-Rex and the dinosaur weighed more than a Boeing 737 plane .
It is a species of titanosaur, among the largest dinosaurs to walk on Earth .
And it is also one of the most complete skeletons found, with more than 70 per cent of its bones found .

"A British family who lived in the overseas territory of Bermuda for 20 years were ordered to leave because its government is clamping down on immigrants from the UK. Stephen and Kirsty Tomlinson and their two children were given barely a month to get off the North Atlantic island after his workplace burned down. Now the couple have swapped sandy beaches and sunshine for concrete and drizzle after returning to Mr Tomlinson’s home town of Hull, east Yorkshire. They were ordered to leave despite their daughter Holly, 12 and son Joseph, six, being born in Bermuda. Dream over: Stephen Tomlinson, with his wife Kirsty and children Holly, 12, and and Joseph, six, near their new home in Hull.  The couple were ordered leave Bermuda last month after Mr Tomlinson's business burned down . Mr Tomlinson had worked as a spray painter, while his 41-year-old wife ran a beauty therapy business and had clients including Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas. Mr Tomlinson, 45, said: ‘My daughter is crying herself to sleep at night and the kids ask ‘When are we going home, Daddy?’ Bermuda is the oldest of Britain's Overseas Territories. Its Parliament first met in 1620, making it the oldest Commonwealth legislature outside the British Isles. Though Bermuda exercises a great deal of autonomy over its own affairs, the UK Government remains responsible for its external relations, defence and internal security. The question remains of whether the territory should cut its links with Britain, but the last time a referendum was held - in 1995 - only a quarter of the 58 per cent turnout voted for independence.Its current government, led by premier Paula Cox and her Progressive Labour Party, is in favour of independence - but the most recent opinion polls have consistently shown large majorities against it. ‘I don’t understand how they could do this to us after we’d been there so long. We had to sell all our belongings and get out, despite having worked hard and paid our way.’ Stephen had friends fight for their right to stay but the Bermudan Government refused to be swayed. He fears more ex-pats could be ordered to leave Bermuda as its government tightens up immigration and has called on the Foreign Office to intervene . While Bermuda has granted permanent residency to Britons living on the island since 1989, the couple missed the cut-off point by just two years. In 2010, the Government announced it would make it harder to gain and renew work permits in a bid to boost employment among citizens of the island. Only highly-trained foreigners with particular skills are being granted work permits. Painters and beauticians are among occupations that are among those professions that are 'proscribed'. The territory has even provided tax relief to those . firms who employ previously jobless Bermudans, who accuse British and . other immigrants of marginalising them. The Foreign Office says it is unable to stop the island’s Government forcing Britons to give up their jobs and sending them back to the UK. Mr Tomlinson said: ‘There are still people from Hull out there and more Britons will be sent home. You build a life up only to get kicked out.' Happier times: The Tomlinsons and their children playing on the beach near their former home in Bermuda . Idyllic: The family sit beside a plam tree near their cottage on the paradise island in the North Atlantic . Bad tidings: The letter the Tomlinsons were sent by the Bermudan government that gave them less than a months to settle up and leave . He was 24 when he moved to the group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean from Garden Village in east Hull in 1991. He met Kirsty, of Goole, who was also on a work permit and the two later married. Mrs Tomlinson said: ‘Stephen’s heart was in Bermuda and it is a lovely country. ‘My roots are in England and I class it as my home but I’ve learnt so much on the island.’ The couple’s dream life came crashing down when Stephen’s place of work burnt to the ground last year. Mr Tomlinson said: ‘We were all made redundant but the local paper ran a story saying people were prepared to help us find work. ‘Luckily, I still had job offer and I decided to take work at a Mercedes dealership.I applied for my annual work permit and it was declined. ‘We didn’t know what to do and everyone said it would be sorted but it wasn’t.’ Stephen was sent a letter from the Department of Immigration, which advised him to settle his affairs, giving him a deadline of less than a month to leave the island. The letter stated: ‘The Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, after having reviewed the request, has refused the application. 'You are now being advised to settle your affairs, together with your family and leave Bermuda.’ The family are being backed by Conservative MP Andrew Percy, who is vowing to take their case to ministers. However, they know it is very unlikely they will be able to return. Mr Percy said: ‘Although Bermuda is a British colony, it has control over its own immigration system. ‘It’s completely unjust that the Tomlinson family should be cheated in this way when they have lived there for so long. I will do everything I can to help them.’ Population: 64,000 . By the sea: Tourists flock to pink sands and snorkel through clear blue waters packed with wrecks and reefs .

"World boxing champion Kell Brook is in hospital in Tenerife after being stabbed in the leg on Thursday during an altercation while on holiday. The 28-year-old, who won the IBF welterweight title last month, is not believed to be in a life-threatening condition, though Spanish police claim ‘he lost a lot of blood’ from multiple wounds in his left leg and also suffered defence injuries to his arm in the 6am incident. Onlookers at the scene, close to the Golf De Sur resort in southern Tenerife, have described a trail of blood from an apartment at the Las Adelfas complex, to a second apartment where Brook is understood to have attempted to gain entry by smashing a patio window. VIDEO Scroll down for Kell Brook gives immediate reaction to IBF world title win . Recovery: Kell Brook is in hospital after he was stabbed in the leg whilst on holiday in Tenerife . Champion: The Sheffield fighter won a world title at the first time of asking after beating Shawn Porter . In action: Brook turned in a gutsy display to beat Porter and line up a potential fight against Amir Khan . Kell Brook's career-defining victory over Shawn Porter in Los Angeles last month finally proved what he'd always insisted, that he could mix it with the worlds best. The Sheffield star had won 32 fights as a professional before earning his shot at the IBF welterweight title, a journey that had more than it's fair share of roadblocks. Brook was the mandatory challenger to the great Manny Pacquiao as far back as 2010 but instead had to bide his time. A switch to promoter Eddie Hearn saw an upturn in his fortunes as he progressed from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas. Victory over Hector Saldivia two years ago manoeuvred him into position to fight then champion Devon Alexander but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled. Instead, he faced the undefeated Porter, outpointing the champion to become the sixth Brit to hold a world title in the division and the first since Ricky Hatton's brief stint in 2006. That victory should catapult him into the realm of mega-fights with a domestic dust-up with bitter British rival Amir Khan on the cards for next year. Martin Domin . Sportsmail has been told by a local source that concerned residents then contacted security and Brook was taken by ambulance to Candelaria hospital in Santa Cruz. Brook is understood to have been on a night out in Golf De Sur with his heavily pregnant partner, Lindsey, who left early and was not present when the altercation occurred. Brook is said to have met up with mutual friends after parting company with his girlfriend, before heading back to Las Adelfas in the early hours. It is believed he had spent time with his attacker. A Spanish police spokesman said: ‘This morning a 28-year-old British man was stabbed in the left leg and is hospitalised. He lost a lot of blood. There are no arrests at this time.’ The Sheffield fighter’s promoter Eddie Hearn, who had been in talks to make a blockbuster showdown with Amir Khan at Wembley next May, was on Thursday night planning to fly to Tenerife to check on Brook’s condition. Hearn told Sportsmail: ‘We are all worried about what has happened and we have not been able to speak to Kell. I am told he is stable.’ Brook’s next fight, scheduled for December 6 in Sheffield, is now a major doubt. It is the second time Brook has been stabbed, having also been attacked in his hometown of Sheffield in 2007. He was leaving the Cactus Club, in Earsham Street, when he was stabbed in the side and buttocks. Brook returned to fight six months later and has since amassed a perfect record of 33 fights and 33 wins. He clinched the IBF world welterweight title 20 days ago with a points victory over 26-year-old American Shawn Porter in California. Brook is being treated at Candelaria hospital and police remain at scene of both the scene of the attack . Pictures of blood splattered on the concrete which are said to be connected to the stabbing of Kell Brook . Flying the flag: Brook is an attractive opponent for Amir Khan having upset the odds to beat Porter in LA . In training: British boxer Brook, pictured in 2010, enjoys a run in his hometown of Sheffield . Rising: Brook is unbeaten in 33 fights. He was scheduled to return to the ring in December, but that's in doubt . Hearn failed with a previous £3million offer to Khan to fight Brook, but the Sheffield fighter has become a far more attractive opponent to Khan since beating Porter. Hearn had written in his MailOnline column this week that negotiations could be concluded within a month. 'Talks are ongoing over a fight between Kell Brook and Amir Khan. It is going well because I think everyone realises it makes sense,' wrote Hearn. 'Khan obviously wants a fight with Floyd Mayweather, as does everyone in the division, but he knows that while that fight might never happen, even if it did he would make more money fighting Kell. ‘Everything so far has been very straightforward and I am in talks with Wembley over a May date. They want us back there as soon as possible after the success of Froch-Groves – I have no doubt in my mind that we would fill that stadium again. I hope to have this tied up in the next month or so.’","The IBF  world champion not believed to be in life-threatening condition .

"At the age of 11, blonde-haired, blue-eyed twins Lamb and Lynx Gaede formed a band and saw themselves as the new faces of pop music. But instead, the girls from Bakersfield, California, would soon be labelled the 'new faces of hate'. Not surprising when you consider the group they created in 2003 was a neo-Nazi outfit called Prussian Blue -  named after a by-product of the poison used to gas millions of Jews in the Holocaust - at the suggestion of White Nationalist leader William Pierce. Now however, at the age of 20, the twins have radically transformed themselves from hate-spouting extremists to peace-loving hippies. And the reason for their change? Marijuana. Lamb and Lynx Gaede, seen here in Montana, have abandoned their racist beliefs and have become 'pretty liberal'... with the aid of medical marijuana . The sisters, pictured in 2005, formed a pop band called Prussian Blue, at the suggestion of White Nationalist leader William Pierce. It was named after a by-product of the poison used to gas millions of Jews in the Holocaust . The girls, who once wore smiley-face Hitler T-shirts, both now have medical marijuana cards, consider themselves 'healers' and say they are 'pretty liberal now'. 'I’m stoked that we have so many . different cultures,' Lynx said. 'I think it’s amazing and it makes me . proud of humanity every day that we have so many different places and . people.' Lynx . was diagnosed with cancer during her freshman year of high school, when . doctors removed a tumour from her shoulder. She was prescribed . OxyContin and morphine to deal with the pain. She also suffers from a . rare condition called cyclic vomiting syndrome. About two years ago, she began smoking to ease withdrawal symptoms and nausea. 'I have to say, marijuana saved my life,' she said. 'I would probably be dead if I didn’t have it.' Lamb, . who suffers from scoliosis and chronic back pain, leading to emotional stress, soon acquired a medical marijuana card of her own. They said the drug has reignited their creativity, which they now channel in other ways, such as painting. 'We . just want to come from a place of love and light,' Lamb said, adding, . 'I think we’re meant to do something more - we’re healers. We just want . to exert the most love and positivity we can.' 'I'm glad we were in a band, but I think we should have been pushed toward something a little more mainstream and easier for us to handle than being front-men for a belief system that we didn't completely understand at the time,' Lynx told the Daily Mirror. It is certainly a change of philosophy for the girls who were raised in a redneck community, where they were indoctrinated in extremist principles. Their grandfather, Bill Gaede, had a swastika on his belt buckle, painted it on his truck and even branded his cattle with the Nazi symbol. Such was their notoriety that they featured in a Louis Theroux documentary about Nazis in 2003. Pictured above, Lynx (left), mother April and Lamb, with Louis . But they blame his daughter, their mother April, for being the main influence on their skewed perspective. As a member of racist fringe groups such as the National . Alliance and the National Vanguard, she had a powerful hold over her children. By the time the twins were 13, in 2006, they had recorded a roster . of songs that were infuriating the nation, with titles including Aryan . Man Awake and Hate For Hate: Lamb Near The Lane, co-written by David . Lane - the late member of terrorist group The Order and Lamb's then . pen-pal. Lane was ten serving 190 years in prison for his involvement in the . murder of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg in 1984. Soon after the song's . release, the girls were labelled by the media 'the new faces of hate', . fuelling the firestorm with their angelic faces and smiley-faced Hitler . T-shirts. 'Adolf Hitler was a great man who was only trying to preserve his own race in his own country,' Lamb said at the time. 'Adolf Hitler was a great man who was only trying to preserve his own race in his own country' - Lamb Gaede, 2006 . The young teen Lynx added: 'Lots of things were exaggerated about the Second World War. We don't believe that 6million Jews were executed. I mean, there were not even that many Jews alive then. 'We know there were concentration camps but they had swimming pools and tennis courts - that's not how you would treat people if you were getting ready to kill them.' In 2005, they donated money to victims of Hurricane Katrina but insisted it go to whites only. Such was their notoriety that they featured in a Louis Theroux documentary about Nazis in 2003. The sisters now say, however, they simply didn't know better. Lynx, a painter and furniture restorer who still lives at home with her mother, said: 'My sister and I . were home-schooled. We were these country bumpkins. We spent most of . our days up on the hill playing with our goats.' Lamb, now a hotel maid who lives nearby, echoed: 'I was just spouting a lot of knowledge that I had no idea what I was saying. Their mother, however, still defends encouraging the extremist side project. 'I . thought it would just be a little fun thing to do,' she said, adding, . 'I didn’t expect it to get as big as it did. If the girls feel regretful . about it, I guess I would have to as well.' Lamb and Lynx said enrolling in public school and moving to northwest Montana has helped them become more open-minded. However, they said their mother still has dreams of forming an 'intentional' white community in Montana, called Pioneer Little Europe. But . they are reluctant to follow her lead. 'I’m not a white nationalist . anymore,' Lamb said. 'My sister and I are pretty liberal now.' The . sisters closed the door with Prussian Blue following the band's 2006 . European tour, and have spent the last few years 'lying low and trying . to live a normal life,' Lamb said. They do worry about a backlash from their former fans. 'There . are dangerous people in White Nationalism that don’t give a f***, and . they would do awful things to people who they think betrayed the . movement,' Lamb said, adding, 'We’re stepping on eggshells.' The sisters are not completely reformed, however. Asked . whether the Holocaust happened, Lynx replied, 'I think certain things . happened. I think a lot of the stories got misconstrued. I mean, yeah, . Hitler wasn't the best, but Stalin wasn't, Churchill wasn't. I disagree . with everybody at that time.' Lamb added: 'I just think everyone needs to frickin' get over it. That's what I think.'","Gaede girls sparked outrage with their pop group, formed in 2003 .

Alarm bells: The friends said that they became concerned that Tsarnaev actually had something to do with the bombings when they found these empty firework containers in his dorm room . Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov were already . in police custody at the time of their arrest and had been for over a . week because they were previously questioned about their license plate . that reads ‘TERRORISTA#1’. Authorities then held them on immigration . issues because they are in the country illegally after their academic . visas expired. The nature of these charges suggests that none of these young men helped plan the fatal Marathon bombing, which left three dead and more than 200 injured, but they did work to cover Tsarnaev’s tracks from investigators and evade capture. The detailed criminal complaint goes through the timeline of events according to each of the 19-year-olds, all of whom met Tsarnaev when they started school at UMASS-Dartmouth in the same semester in the fall of 2011. Like many throughout Boston, none of the three boys had any inkling that Tsarnaev was involved until the FBI released pictures of the two suspects, later identified as 19-year-old Dzhokhar and his 26-year-old brother Tamerlan. Friends in low places: Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov (left and center) were identified as the two friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) who have been held in Boston jail since April 20 . The American: Robel Phillipos, who was identified as this student by CNN, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with making false statements to police and obstructing justice in a terrorism investigation . On the same day that the FBI released pictures and video clips of the Tsarnaev brothers at the bomb scene, Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov removed items from the younger bomber's dorm room. That was just two days before the FBI searched the room. The criminal complaint lists that they removed Dzhokhar's backpack from his room and 'agreed to get rid of it after concluding from news reports that Tsarnaev was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.' Prison: The maximum sentence for Robel Phillipos' charge of lying to federal officers, is eight years in jail as opposed to the other suspects who face five years . The three friends- Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos- went over to Tsarnaev's on-campus dormitory after seeing the news reports. When the group arrived at the dorm, . Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about . to leave if you need something in my room take it.' He . did not specify where he was going, but Tazhayakov told investigators . that he felt that this meant he would never see Tsarnaev alive again. They were let in the room by Dzhokhar's roommate, who said that Dzhokhar had been there just a few hours earlier. The criminal complaint says that when there, the three friends watched a movie. Kadyrbayev 'knew when he saw the empty fireworks that Tsarnaev was involved in the Marathon bombing. Tazhayakov . was more alarmed because the tubes had been emptied but not destroyed, . meaning that Tsarnaev could have either used the explosives or planned . to use them. Kadyrbayev found Vaseline in the room, which he told the others Tsarnaev used to make bombs. Charged: Dias Kadyrbayev, left, and Azamat Tazhayakov, right, appeared in court together and waived their right to a bail hearing, meaning that they will remain in the jail until their next hearing on May 14 . At . one point in the police interviews, Tazhayakev said that during a meal a . month before the attack, Tsarnaev told he and Kadyrbayev that he knew . how to make a bomb. Kadyrbayev was reportedly the one who . 'decided to remove the backpack from the room in order to help his . friend Tsarnaev avoid trouble.' In . a slightly unexpected explanation, Kadyrbayev says that he took . Dzhokhar's laptop because he did not want to the roommate to think that . he was 'stealing or behaving suspiciously by just taking the backpack'. Though . the release of the photos is the first time that alarm bells went off . in the students’ minds, it is not the first time that they interacted . with the bomber since Monday April 15. Close: Azamat Tazhayakov, seen here with bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in an undated picture, told police that about a month before the Marathon attack, Dzhokhar said that he knew how to make a bomb . Texts: When the group arrived at the dorm, Dias Kadyrbayev (left) showed Tazhayakov (right) a text from the bomber that said 'I'm about to leave if you need something in my room take it' Happier times: Kadyrbayev told investigators that he suggested they take Tsarnaev's backpack and his laptop from the room, and later was the one to throw it in the garbage at his off-campus apartment . Both Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov- who shared an apartment in New Bedford- spent time with Tsarnaev two days after the bombing. Dzhokhar met with Kadyrbayev briefly, where Kadyrbayev noted that Dzhokhar 'appeared to have given himself a short haircut'. Tazahayakov . told police that he spent more time with Tsarnaev earlier that same . day, when Tsarnaev drove him to his off-campus apartment after class and . then they spent time hanging out in the apartment. Hunting for clues: The students reportedly disposed of materials for Dzhokhar at the garbage can at their house, which was transported to the Crapo Hill landfill, just nine miles from the UMass-Dartmouth campus . First suspects: Brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified as the first suspects . During . multiple interviews, Phillipos lied about various parts of the story- . at first saying that he never went to Tsarnaev's dorm room, then saying . that they didn't remove anything, then saying that they went to the dorm . but it was locked and they never entered. After repeating false versions of the same story, he recanted his previous testimony in the fourth interview on April 26. The . gravity of the situation did not appear to hit Phillipos until after . the trio returned to the off-campus apartment and they 'started to freak . out, because it became clear from a CNN report that we were watching . that Jahar was one of the Boston Marathon bombers.' The . Boston police were the first to announce the arrests via Twitter, and . they followed up their initial tweet by confirming that there is no . threat to public safety. Police initially investigated Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov after the discovery of their license plates (pictured) The news of the arrests comes one day . after the elder suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev’s wife Katherine Russell was . interviewed by investigators after they spent hours searching her home. FBI official first linked the bombings to brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, releasing photos of the pair last Thursday, three days after the fatal blast killed three and injured more than 250 people at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. They were able to confirm the identity of the two after the photos were released, and later that evening Tamerlan died after an altercation with police where he opened fire on officers and his younger brother ended up driving over him in the getaway car. College friends: The first reports claim that the three people in custody all went to college with Dzhokhar at UMass Dartmouth and were thought to have helped him cover up for the bombings after the fact . Dzhokhar was arrested the following day after a city-wide manhunt lead to his discovery inside a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar was arrested and transported to an area hospital where he remains in police custody. He was charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, though the legal proceedings came into question after police initially interviewed him- and he allegedly confessed- before he was read his Miranda rights. After hearing his rights, he reportedly stopped talking to police.","Three taken into custody helped Dzhokhar Tsarnaev cover up for the bombing after the fatal blasts .

"Redistribution? The family of President Robert Mugabe now control 39 farms seized from white farmers . Zimbabwe's policy of seizing white-owned farms and handing them over to black workers has cost the country £7billion in lost production over the past decade, it has been claimed. The extent of the agricultural collapse in the former British colony - once famed as the 'bread-basket of Africa' - emerged hours after the UN said it needs half a billion dollars in humanitarian aid this year. Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, and his family now own 39 farms which had been seized from their white former owners, said the Commercial Farmers' Union in Harare, the country's capital. Hundreds more have been 'stolen' from experienced white farmers and given to black workers and veterans of the war of independence - many of whom have little knowledge of farming. Union chief Deon Theron said food production had slumped by 70 per cent in Zimbabwe since President Mugabe began his policy of seizing white-owned farms in 2000. Mr Mugabe has always said that the land seizures were needed to correct colonial imbalances and that beneficiaries would get only one farm. Prior to the introduction of the policy, whites controlled about 70 per cent of Zimbabwe's arable land despite make up less than 1 per cent of the country's population. His officials have not yet commented on the union report, or the claims of farms in Mugabe family ownership. Anger: President of The Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe Deon Theron says that Mugabe's policies are destroying the country's agricultural industry . Mr Theron blamed the land seizures for food shortages and the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy over the past decade, saying it had destroyed the country's tax base. 'If the aim of the land reform was to evict whites and replace them with blacks, then it can be deemed a success,' Mr Theron said. 'However, if the aim was that it should benefit the majority and not only a chosen few, then it has been a failure.' His report was issued just hours after the UN appealed for more cash for Zimbabwe, saying the country needed almost half a billion dollars in humanitarian aid this year. Aid coordinator Allain Noudehou said 1.7 million Zimbabweans needed food hand-outs. Displaced: This 2002 photo shows a group of Zimbabwe white commercial farmers having their group photograph taken at the Mutorashanga Country Club, before meeting a government deadline to vacate their farms . Zimbabwe used to produce enough to feed itself and even to export but this was no longer the case, according to Mr Theron . He estimated that production of maize, a staple food largely grown by small-scale black farmers - the people supposed to gain most from land reform - is this year estimated to be just 50 per cent of 2000 levels. Cotton, seen as a cash crop for small-scale farmers, has fallen by 45 per cent, said Mr Theron, while tobacco, one of the country's main export earners and previously dominated by large-scale white farmers, has declined by 50 percent. Wheat, beef and dairy production had effectively collapsed, he added. Mr Theron said land had become a tool for dispensing political patronage and named five other close allies of Mr Mugabe whose families have taken control of at least five farms each. After years of economic meltdown, Zimbabwe abandoned its currency in 2009 and now uses the US and South African money. During the colonial era, much of the best land in the then Rhodesia was reserved for white people - a situation that President Mugabe vowed to reverse during his guerrilla war against white minority rule during the Seventies.","Robert Mugabe's family now control 39 seized farms .

"When it comes to air travel, India and Malaysia are the cheapest places to fly in the world according to a new survey on global transport. Finland and Switzerland are the most expensive places to catch a plane, with Denmark coming out top overall as THE most expensive country to travel overall on all forms of transport. The survey, carried out by Berlin based travel search website GoEuro, looked at 51 countries across five continents to work out the average price to . travel per 100 kilometres by plane, train and bus. It might have been cheaper to fly... India's airfare wars have cut costs dramatically . According to the results India came up . trumps costing just $10.36 (£6.28) on average to travel 100 kilometres on a . commercial flight. That's about a third of the cost of flights in the UK . and less than one thirteenth of the cost of flying in the most . expensive country in the world, Finland, where it costs $138.90 (£84) to fly . the same distance. In fact, Airfares in India are so low . that it is often cheaper to travel by air than take the train: According to . the survey, a 100 kilometre train journey in India costs $15.98 (£9.60) and going by bus the same distance $6.17 (£3.70). It might be pretty but it's pretty expensive too... Denmark's average travel costs are the highest globally . Flight cost index shows the cheapest and most expensive flights in the world . The . second cheapest country for air travel was Malaysia, where the cost was . an average $12.27 (£7.42) to fly 100 kilometres, South Africa was third at . $12.48 (£7.54) and suprisingly, Australia was number four costing $13.09 (£7.90) over the same . distance. India's current airfare war is the reason given for the low prices, as airlines compete for the country’s growing middle class sector and the number of domestic travellers is projected to triple to 159 million by 2021. So which countries should you avoid if you don’t want to burn a hole in your pocket? Denmark was followed closely by Switzerland as the second most expensive country overall costing an average of $39.84 (£24.10) and $38.28 (£23.15) respectively to travel 100km, putting them way ahead of the UK's modest $9.59 (£5.80).

"A potentially dangerous teenager has been released from jail after being acquitted on charges of attacking a female jogger last month in Bremerton, Washington. A judge decided Tuesday to free the unidentified 14-year-old suspect due to lack of sufficient evidence, and victim Jordan Monasmith says the local authorities are to blame. Detention officers washed the suspect's clothing after he was arrested, thus erasing any potential DNA evidence from their run-in. During the trial, Ms Monasmith's account of the attack was replayed in recordings of her calls to 911. Scroll down for video . Jordan Monasmith says she was attacked outside of her Bremerton, Washington apartment last month . However, the unidentified 14-year-old who attacked her has since been released after a judge ruled there wasn't sufficient evidence in the case . 'He tackled me to the ground and chocked me out and I fought him free,' she told the operator after escaping the teen last month and running back to her apartment. 'He grabbed my neck, so my neck is sore, but I’m OK. 'His body weight was too much for me to hold after running so we collapsed onto the pavement. His body was laying halfway on top of mine so I was pinned down to the ground. 'As all of this was happening, he said nothing. I then reached up with a free arm, grabbed the back of the male’s head and slammed it into the pavement approximately three times but he did not release his grip on my neck. 'I then pushed my thumb into his eye socket as hard as I could for about three seconds.' Ms Monasmith shows the area where she was attacked last month . After freeing herself, Ms Monasmith ran back to her apartment while the suspect continued on to a local YMCA where he was later arrested. Ms Monasmith suffered cuts to her legs in the assault and has been attending counseling twice a week since the traumatic incident. After hearing the judge's verdict on Wednesday, Ms Monasmith shook her head in disappointment. 'I’m absolutely disgusted by the procedures following the event and how the Bremerton Police Department handled it,' Ms Monasmith told Q13. The prosecution based their case off Ms Monasmith's testimony and the account of responding police officers, which the judge found insufficient. Detention officers reportedly washed the 14-year-old's clothing after he was arrested, thus erasing any DNA evidence. Above, Lt Pete Fischer of the Bremerton Police maintains they followed the rule of law . Detention officers deleted crucial evidence when they washed the suspects clothing after he was arrested. 'Any evidence of dirt or grit that might corroborate a scuffle on the blacktop driveway was not observed to or testified to,' said Mills. However, Bremerton police maintain that they investigated the case by the book. 'We followed the rule of law,' said Lt. Pete Fisher with the Bremerton Police Department. 'We don’t have any say in how a judge rules on a certain case.' Now Ms Monasmith worries that her attacker will find a new target. 'All he knows now is that it’s easy to get away with something like this,' Monasmith said. The case can not be appealed.","Jordan Monasmith was tackled last month while out for a job in Bremerton, Washington .

"Victim: Alan Smith was stabbed in a 'frenzied attack' in a diner after asking if the alleged killer's crying daughter was alright, a court heard . A father out celebrating his daughter's birthday was brutally knifed to death in front of his horrified family just because he asked if a crying child was alright, a court was told yesterday. Alan Smith, 63, was stabbed at least five times as he sat with his partner, daughter and son-in-law in a cafe in east London. His alleged killer, Matthew Quesada, became enraged when Mr Smith approached him in the BB Cafe to ask if his young daughter, who was crying, was okay, the jury heard. Quesada responded 'What's it to you? What's it got to f****** do with you?' before storming out of the cafe. 'Humiliated . and angered' by what happened and 'bent on exacting revenge' Quesada, . then aged 25, ran to his girlfriend's home to drop off the girl and grab . a weapon. With . a knife concealed up his sleeve,He then raced . after the family as they entered a second diner - the Roma cafe - where . they had gone to eat to avoid any further trouble. It was there that Quesada allegedly launched a . 'frenzied and wordless' attack, stabbing Mr Smith in the head and body. As Estelle Jenkins tried to get between her father and his . attacker, Mr Smith struggled up from the bolted down table before . falling to the floor where he kicked out in a vain attempt to stop the . onslaught, the court heard. Quesada . only fled when the victim's son-in law Mark Jenkins threw a chair at him, . halting the attack, as Mr Smith's horrified partner Denise Facey looked . on, the court was told. As Mr Smith's life ebbed away an air . ambulance doctor had to perform emergency heart surgery on a cafe table . that formed a 'make-shift operating table.' He was flown to hospital where he died from his wounds, three of which were fatal. Accused: Matthew Quesada's mother Victoria . Passley-Quesada, left, and girlfriend Maria Brigette are both  standing . trial alongside him accused of assisting an offender . Quesada, now 26, denies murdering Mr Smith on March 26 last year. Roger . Smart, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey jury Quesada accepts he stabbed . Mr Smith and the issue will be his state of mind at the time. The . court heard in the lead up to the alleged murder, Mr Smith was waiting . for his family to arrive at the BB Cafe in London's Leyton when Quesada . entered with his crying daughter. After a few minutes when the crying . did not subside and while Quesada washed his daughter's hands in the . sink, Mr Smith approached to ask if everything was alright with the . little girl, it was claimed. However, the father-of-two reacted . angrily and tried to push past a waiter to get into the kitchen but was . blocked, . He then tried to use the cafe's phone, but stormed off with his daughter after he wasn't allowed. The Old Bailey heard that as Quesada went next door to borrow a phone Mr Smith's family arrived. As . Mr Smith told them they would eat elsewhere, Quesada was overheard . saying 'I need the piece' over the phone as he stood glaring as Mr Smith . and his family left the cafe. As they walked off Quesada shouted out: 'You see. You? I'll see you.' Mr . Smart said: 'A warning. A man in an aggressive state. A man humiliated, . angered by what had happened inside the BB Cafe, bent on exacting . revenge.' 'Frenzied attack': Mr Smith's family tried to leap between him and alleged killer Matthew Quesada during the stabbing in Roma Cafe, the court heard . The time between the call and the murder was just four minutes, it was said. Minutes . later he was seen running after Mr Smith and his family as they entered . the Roma Cafe on the Lea Bridge Road where they had gone to eat . instead. Mr Smart said: 'He entered only a . minute or so after the deceased and his family had sat down in the cafe . and approached the table at which they were all sitting. 'Mark . Jenkins was facing the door to the cafe and noticed Quesada when he . approached their table. Mr Jenkins saw that the defendant had hidden a . knife inside the cuff of his sleeve. 'As he got to their table, the defendant leaned across and without uttering a word, lunged at Mr Smith. 'The defendant attacked Mr Smith in a frenzied knife attack, making a plunging motion and hitting the deceased's head and body. 'At . this point Mr Jenkins jumped up and stepped away from the table. The . defendant repeatedly lunged at Mr Smith across the table hitting him at . least five to six times. Confrontation: The court heard the attack was sparked when Mr Smith asked if the crying baby was alright as he waited to meet his family in the BB Cafe in Leyton . 'Mr Smith tried to get out from the bolted down table. He managed to get to his feet and his daughter Estelle Jenkins tried to get between her father and the defendant. 'Mr Smith fell to the floor and kicked out at Quesada, trying in vain to protect himself from the attack.' Warded off by Mr Jenkins, Quesada was spotted jumping over the back gardens from his girlfriend's flat before getting into a waiting car and speeding off. A day later Quesada who had shaven off his distinct Afro style hair and changed his clothes was arrested along with his mother Victoria Passley-Quesada inside her car in south London. He had on him his British passport, flight details for that day's flights to Sao Paulo in Brazil, along with a holdall. His mother Passley-Quesada, 54, of Purley, Surrey, is accused of hiding him from the police, looking up flights, and helping him in his bid to escape. His girlfriend Maria Brigette, 26, of Hibbard Road, Leyton, east London, is accused of updating him on the police investigation. Both deny assisting an offender. The trial, expected to last three weeks, continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Father Alan Smith, 63, had been celebrating daughter's birthday .

"Africa's population is set to double to more than 2.4billion over the next few decades due to improved health care and medicines, a new study found. Sub-Saharan Africa - the world’s poorest region - will record the largest amount of population growth of any area in the world between now and 2050, according to the Population Reference Bureau (PRB). But the massive baby boom could put huge strain on resources and fledgling economies in some of the world's most deprived areas, the PRB warned. Care: Wide-reaching vaccination programmes and medical care mean more children are surviving to reach adulthood . And the projected growth in population assumes that family planning will become more widespread in regions where, for religious or cultural reasons, contraception has not been widely adopted. The 10 countries worldwide with the highest fertility are all in sub-Saharan Africa. Today, women in sub-Saharan Africa average 5.2 children, a rate that rises as high as 7.6 in Niger. And improved access to medicine and health care mean millions more of these children will now survive to adulthood. Wendy Baldwin, the organisation's president and CEO, said: 'Nearly all of that growth will be in the 51 countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the region’s poorest. 'Rapid population growth makes it difficult for economies to create enough jobs to lift large numbers of people out of poverty.' In addition to high birth rates, the region’s population is also quite young, with 43 percent of the population below age 15. Population rise: Improvements in medicine and health care are leading to more children surviving infancy in sub-Saharan Africa (File picture) Devastation: Famine and illness had meant many children died long before they could go on to become mothers and fathers . Carl Haub, senior demographer and co-author of the data sheet, said: 'Given its youthful population, future population growth in Africa will depend upon the degree to which the parents of tomorrow use family planning. 'The projections that we cite assume that family planning will become more widespread. If not, Africa’s population will grow more rapidly, further constraining efforts to address poverty, create jobs, and protect the environment.' This year’s Data Sheet provides detailed information on 20 population, health, and environment indicators for more than 200 countries, and has a special focus on wealth and income inequality. Developing countries tend to have wide income gaps between rich and poor that are associated with dramatic differences in fertility and health. In Uganda, women from the poorest fifth of families have twice as many children as those from the wealthiest fifth. And children from the poorest families are much more likely to die before turning 5 than their counterparts in the wealthiest families. PRB’s 2013 World Population Data Sheet . shows the stark contrasts between rich and poor countries, illustrated . by comparing Niger and the Netherlands.

Even though the two countries have almost the same population size today, Niger is projected to nearly quadruple its population from about 17 million today to 66 million in 2050. The Netherlands’ population will likely grow very slowly from 17 million to 18 million over that same time. At the root of this 'demographic divide' are differences in the average number of births per woman and the share of the population in their childbearing years. Niger’s total fertility rate of 7.6 lifetime births per woman is more than four times the Netherlands’ rate of 1.7 per woman. One-half of Niger’s population is younger than age 15, compared with 17 percent of the Netherlands’ population.","Population expected to rise from 1.1billion today to 2.4 billion by 2050 .

"A uniformed French soldier on anti-terrorist duties in Paris had his throat cut by a knife-wielding man tonight. The savage attack follows the murder of a British soldier by two men using weapons including knives and a meat cleaver. One of the suspects said they were acting in the name of Islam. Today there were fears that the Paris attack was a copy-cat crime and that a radical Muslim might once more be responsible. Scene: Police investigators and forensic experts work at the site where a man armed with a box cutter attacked a French soldier patrolling a subway station . Eyes down: A police investigator works at the site . On guard: Police officers keep an eye on things at the site where a soldier was stabbed in the throat . French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said he believes the attack was aimed to kill the soldier. French president Francois Hollande said authorities were investigating any possible links with the attack on Drummer Rigby, who was killed in Woolwich, London, last week.. A Scotland Yard spokesman said he was unable to say whether police were connecting the incidents. Police in the French capital described the attacker as a being ‘bearded, of North African origin and wearing a light coloured jihab’ under a jacket. He pounced on the 23-year-old soldier outside a Virgin store in La Defence, the business district of the city which was packed with Saturday afternoon shoppers. The weapon used was said to be a 'cutter' - the sharp edged tools used to slice open cardboard boxes. The attack on a soldier in Paris was being treated as a 'terrorist incident', said a source at the Paris prosecutors office. 'The anti-terrorist branch of the prosecutors office is dealing with the matter,' the source added. Shock: French President Francois Hollande has said that 'theories' must be explored as to why the attack happened . The soldier was knifed as a he patrolled around the suburban railway station for RER A service which links the French capital with the suburbs. Pierre-Andre Peyvel, prefect of the Hauts-de-Seine district, said the soldier's wounds were 'serious enough'. The soldier is currently at the nearby Percy hospital. 'Thousands of people were in the area at the time of the attack,' said Mr Peyvel. 'It would have been quite easy to blend into the crowd and then disappear.' ‘The attack happened just after 6pm,’ said a police source. ‘The soldier was stabbed repeatedly, most notably in the throat. ‘The attacker ran away and the military are still looking for him, supported by the police. He is around 30 years old and of Arab appearance. ‘The wounded soldier was taken to a local railway station for treatment and then on to hospital.’ The source said that the soldier’s life was not in danger, but he was ‘badly hurt’. France's Interior Minister said the attack on the soldier could be compared 'to what happened in London' and that it was an attempted murder. 'There are elements, the sudden violence of the attack, which might suggest that it might have some kind of comparison with what happened in London,"" said Mr Manuel Valls. He added : 'But at this point, honestly, let's be careful and do everything we can to arrest this individual who undoubtedly wanted to kill the soldier.' According to the Nanterre prosecutor, Robert Gelli, the soldier was attacked from behind. The soldier was surrounded by comrades who are not thought to have heard the attacker 'say a word', said Mr Gelli. The attacker was described by Mr Gelli as being around 6ft 2ins tall. Shocking: The soldier in uniform was armed and was patrolling as part of France's Vigipirate anti-terrorist surveillance scheme . The soldier is in France's 4th Cavalry regiment, which has served in Afghanistan and has been on standby to fight in Mali.

'We . will not rule out any of them, we will look at all the elements' said . Mr Hollande, clearly referring to the possibility that the attacker may . have been motivated by what happened in London.

"A Brazilian man died after a cow crashed through the roof of his home and landed on top of him as he lay sleeping in his bed. Joao Maria de Souza, 45, had been in bed with his wife Leni when the animal suddenly fell through the ceiling of their home in Caratinga, south east Brazil. The cow is believed to have escaped from a nearby farm and climbed onto the roof of the couple's house, which backs onto a steep hill. Bizarre tragedy: A cow fell through this roof of this home in Caratinga, south east Brazil, and landed on top of sleeping Joao Marua de Souza, who later died from internal bleeding . The corrugated roof immediately gave way and the one-and-a-half-tonne horned bovine fell 8ft onto Mr de Souza's side of the bed. His wife, and the cow, both reportedly escaped unharmed. Rescuers took Mr de Souza to hospital with a fractured left leg but no other obvious injuries, reporting that he was conscious and talking normally. Tragic: Mr de Souza was conscious when he was taken to hospital but died from internal bleeding as he was waiting to see doctors . But hours later he died from internal bleeding while still waiting to be seen by doctors, according to his family. Mr de Souza's brother-in-law Carlos Correa told Brazil's Hoje em Dia newspaper: 'Being crushed by a cow in your bed is the last way you expect to leave this earth. 'But in my view it wasn't the cow that killed our Joao, it was the unacceptable time he spent waiting to be examined.' His grieving mother, Maria de Souza, told Brazil's SuperCanal TV channel: 'I didn't bring my son up to be killed by a falling cow. 'He nearly died when he was two and got meningitis, but I worked hard to buy medicines for him and he survived. 'And now he's lying in his bed and gets crushed to death by a cow. There's no justice in the world.' Civil police in Caratinga, Minas Gerais state, today launched an inquiry into the bizarre death. Police chief Ivan Lopes Sales said he would be hearing from Mr de Souza's family and hospital managers in the next 30 days. He added police officers were also trying to identify the owner of the cow, who could be charged with involuntary manslaughter. Grieving: Mr de Sousa's family lay him to rest.

"Switzerland are now higher than England in the FIFA world rankings. They topped their qualifying group for the 2014 World Cup.

He is only 5ft 6ins tall but what he lacks in height, he more than makes up for with his bulging thighs. That is where his power and pace are generated from and he uses a special elastic band in training to increase their strength. Shaqiri announced himself to English football fans when he set up two goals for Basel as Manchester United lost 2-1 and were dumped out of the 2011 Champions League group stage. He set the World Cup alight when he scored a hattrick against Honduras in the group stage to send Switzerland through. Charity worker . Vladimir Pet kovic . Position manager . Age 51 .

Tottenham fans will remember him for giving them a scare in the 2010 Champions League preliminary round, winning 3-2 at home while in charge of Young Boys before losing 4-0 in the second leg. He likens his style to Arsene Wenger and Fabio Capello. 'I tried to steal everything that I found to be good from other coaches in order to develop my own ideas,' said Petkovic, who speaks seven languages.

"At a South Carolina high school graduation, the valedictorian's speech began as planned but suddenly became a religious sermon in spite of his school district’s recent ban of prayers at school gatherings. Roy Costner IV, the top graduate of Pickens County, South Carolina’s Liberty High School submitted one speech for approval prior to the recent ceremony, but ended up tearing it up before a shocked crowd and giving an altogether different address. But it wasn’t entirely impromptu. 'Obviously I didn't do my job well enough,' Costner said after telling the crowd his speech had been approved by faculty. 'We're going to have to use a different one. Who cares?' Then he ripped his speech in two. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Imbued: Valedictorian Roy Costner tore up his speech and chose to address the crowd with the Lord's Prayer . ‘Those that we look up to, they have . helped carve and mold us into the young adults that we are today,’ he began again. ‘I’m so glad that both of my . parents led me to the Lord at a young age. And I think most of you will . understand when I say…’ Costner paused, threw caution to the wind and began reciting a speech his audience had likely heard before. ‘Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name…’ Costner’s approved convocation address suddenly sounded a whole lot like the Lord’s Prayer. Costner continued as the crowd’s initial spattering of applause became a roar: . ‘Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.’ Spirited: The crowd was shocked as Costner shredded his approved speech, but the shock soon turned to applause . ‘You couldn't even hear him doing the prayer anymore because everybody was clapping and cheering,’ attendee Brian Hoover told KSBW. But Costner pressed on, righteously pointing a finger in the air as he struggled to be heard over the crowd. ‘For Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever…Amen.’ The teenager’s zeal may have stemmed from the school district’s new rule banning prayers that reference specific religion in gatherings including school board meetings and, presumably, graduations. The rule has caused a stir in the southern jurisdiction, as it was widely perceived as a ‘ban on prayer in schools.’ Misconception? Costner went rogue, apparently as a reaction to new county rules barring 'sectarian' from school gatherings, a rule widely misconstrued as an explicit ban on prayer in the South Carolina county's schools . Pickens County School District superintendent Kelly Pew clarified the rule in a March blog post: . ‘What I find unfortunate are the mistaken and false representations that the Board or the District want to “ban” prayer from our schools,’ she writes. ‘The difference between the Board taking unto itself an invocation that previously was given by invitation, and some sort of wholesale anti-religious campaign, is vast.’ Despite going rogue in the face of the county’s decision, Costner won’t be facing any disciplinary action. According to a school publication, WYFF reports, Costner will be pursuing a bachelor’s degree at nearby Clemson University in the fall and wants to go on to be a ‘computer programmer overseas.’","Roy Costner IV went rogue in violation of his South Carolina high school's ban on 'sectarian' prayer at school gatherings by turning his commencement address into an impromptu sermon, to huge applause ."
"It may have been over 4,500 years since the Great Pyramid of Giza was built, but it still remains a mystery as to how the last of the world’s ‘seven wonders’ was constructed. Now physicists have suggested a new theory of how the blocks could - or at least should - have been moved with minimal effort. The method involves rolling large 12-sided chunks of limestone from local quarries. Roll with it! Researchers suggested strapping wooden rods to a scale block representing one of the massive cuboids used to build real pyramids in order to turn its profile from a square to a dodecagon (pictured) In an experiment, they have shown that transforming the rock cuboids into dodecagons  - 12-sided shapes - makes them easier to move. The Great Pyramid is made from 2.4million limestone blocks weighing around 2.5 tonnes each and it is thought that workers moved around 40 blocks a day, leading experts to assume that ancient Egyptians must have had a technique for shifting them relatively easily. Joseph West, a physicist at Indiana University, suggested the technique of strapping wooden rods to the building blocks in order to turn its profile from a square to a dodecagon. His idea centres around reducing both the drag and the amount of effort needed to move the blocks as well as the pressure exerted on the ground. The Great Pyramid of Giza (pictured) is made from 2.4million limestone blocks weighing around 2.5 tonnes each. There are many theories about how slaves managed to drag them miles from quaries . There are conflicting theories as to how the ancient Egyptians constructed pyramids and techniques probably developed over time. An illustration of the 12th Dynasty Tomb of Djhuihotep shows 172 men pulling a statue along on a sledge, leading some experts to suggest that huge block needed for the pyramids were transported using the same technique. This theory has been built on, with some experts suggesting that roads were coated in a layer of water to make them slippery and easier to slide sleds along. Some experts have suggested that workers rolled stones along. Dr H Parry said a cradle-like machine could have been used, while another expert suggested wooden curves could have been fitted to each block to make cylinders. Historical accounts suggest that ramps were built for workers to carry blocks up the structure, but an engineer recently put forward the idea that the giant structures were built from the inside out. While not as easy to roll as a cylinder, the new shape would have been easier to move than a cuboid. ‘The rods form the corners and new faces that transform the square prism into a dodecagon which can then be moved more easily by rolling than by dragging,’ Dr West wrote in the study. His team tested their idea on a scale model. Their concrete blocks measured 8 inches (20cm) square and 16 inches (40cm) long, weighing in at 66lbs (30kg). They fixed three chunky pieces of dowel to each rectangular face of the block and then tied a rope to the top of it. The physicists measured the force required to roll the block and said that that  a coefficient of dynamic friction equal to 0.3 was needed for a steady rolling motion. This means that a team of workers or slaves would only have needed to apply a force 0.15 times the weight of the stone to drag it along by the rope. They also worked out that 50 men would be needed to move a block weighing 2.5 tonnes at a speed of 20 inches (50cm) per second. ‘For full scale pyramid blocks, the wooden rods would need to be posts of order 11inches (30cm) in diameter, similar in size to those used as masts on ships in the Nile,’ they wrote in the paper. It has previously been suggested that the Egyptians strapped circular rockers to blocks needed to build the pyramids, (pictured) turning them into cylinders, but experts think this method could have damaged roads . Dr West wrote: ‘In this configuration, static friction acts in the direction of the desired motion, rather than opposing the motion. ‘In effect the block and rope combination becomes a 2:1 pulley, though the pulley was not yet formally known to the Egyptians at that time.’ Other theories as to how the slaves could have moved vast blocks effectively, include dragging them on sleds and lubricating roadways with water so they could be slid along. Dr West’s method may have proved more convenient for labourers, who could have reused the rods and wouldn't have needed to collect water from the Nile. It has previously been suggested that the Egyptians strapped circular rockers to blocks to turn them into cylinders, iO9 reported. But experts have discounted the technique because the cylinders would have exerted so much pressure on roads that they would have rapidly worn them out. Egyptians built an inner core of zigzagging ramps, using smaller, lighter blocks while the larger outer casing stones were placed on the outside using scaffolding, according to one engineer . For centuries it's been thought that the ancient Egyptians built their huge pyramids by hauling heavy granite blocks up specially crafted ramps. But in December, a Newport engineer called Peter James branded the idea ‘impossible’, claiming the ramps would need to have been a quarter of a mile long or else they would have been too steep to carry the large blocks up. He believes, instead, that the Egyptians built an inner core of zigzagging ramps, using smaller, lighter blocks while the larger outer casing stones were placed on the outside using scaffolding. This means the pyramid was built up in layers and the top would have been built using scaffolding on the outside. Peter James and his company Cintec are experts in construction and have been restoring the Egyptian pyramids for the past 18 years. Mr James told the MailOnline: ‘Looking at the pyramids from a builder’s point of view, and not an archaeologist’s, it’s clear that the current theories are nonsense. ‘Just look at the numbers. Under the current theories, to lay 2 million blocks, the Egyptians would had to have laid a large block once every three minutes. ‘It would have been impossible to build the pyramids using ramps around the outside, too, because they would have ended up being larger, in some cases, than the pyramids themselves. ‘Plus, what happened to the ramps once the pyramids were finished? I believe the Egyptians built the pyramids like a modern-day builder builds a house. ‘They would have set out the four corners a pyramid, like the four corners of a house. They then would have built four access points in the centre of the pyramid. ‘Next they would have established where the burial chamber would need to be built, and that would have been built using granite. ‘Starting from the walls of the burial chamber, the Egyptians could build ramps using the lighter, smaller rocks in zig-zags around the structure, placing these rocks on top of each other as they go in order to build the pyramid up in layers. Heavy blocks could then be either pulled up these ramps on sledges, or placed on the outside using scaffolding made from timber and lashings.’","Physicists at Indiana University, has suggested that the men who built the pyramids should have transformed blocks into dodecagons .

"The richest woman in Australia has caused a storm by calling her struggling fellow countrymen 'whingers' and telling them to get out of the pub and work harder. Billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart, who is also the world's richest woman, has never had a real job. But she has never had it so good, riding the crest of the resources boom in Western Australia. Outburst: Billionaire Gina Rinehart claimed it is people like her who do the most to help the poor . The controversial Mrs Rinehart has . also attacked Australia's 'class warfare' and insists it is billionaires . such as herself who are doing more than anyone to help the poor by . investing their money and creating jobs. Australian treasurer Wayne Swan joined a chorus of critics after Mrs Rinehart also suggested the government should lower the minimum wage of $606.40 per week - less than £400 - and cut taxes to stimulate employment. Reposte: Australian treasurer Wayne Swan described Rinehart's comments as 'an insult to millions of Australian workers' In her regular column in Australian Resources and Investment magazine, she warns that Australia risks heading down the same path as European economies ruined by 'socialist' policies, high taxes and excessive regulation. 'There is no monopoly on becoming a millionaire,' writes Mrs Rinehart, who has built a $20 billion-plus mining empire since inheriting lucrative tenements from her father, Lang Hancock, in 1992. 'If you're jealous of those with more money, don't just sit there and complain. Do something to make more money yourself - spend less time drinking or smoking and socialising, and more time working.' But her strident comments provoked a barrage of criticism, led by the Acting Prime Minister who earlier this month used the music of Bruce Springsteen to attack the 'massively wealthy'' to drown out the voices of ordinary people. Reigniting his feud with the miner, Mr Swan described Ms Rinehart's comments as an 'insult to the millions of Australian workers who go to work and slog it out to feed the kids and pay the bills.' Her comments provoked a sharp response from the union movement with Australian Council of Trade Unions President Ged Kearney claiming her views were 'stuck in the nineteenth century'. 'Gina Rinehart's comments are the . product of someone who has never had to earn a living and an insult to . millions of working Australians who didn't have the head start of . inheriting a fortune from their father and of being able to bully . politicians by virtue of their inherited wealth,' Ms Kearney said. Friends in high places: Queen Elizabeth talks with Rinehart during a State Reception held at Government House in Perth, Australia, during a 10-day royal visit last year . Rich rewards: Mrs Rinehart holds a piece of coal mined from the test pit of the newly opened Alpha Coal Project in the Galilee Basin, Central Queensland, Australia, earlier this year . 'She has no respect for the values of fairness and equality on which Australia was built, and displays absolute contempt for the people who work for her.' 'Her recipe would take Australia down the path of a nation divided between a super-wealthy elite and an underclass of working poor.' The daughter of the late Australian iron-ore mining magnate Lang Hancock, 58-year-old Mrs Rinehart was declared the world's richest woman in May. Wealthy family: Mrs Rinehart with her her father, the late Australian iron-ore mining magnate Lang Hancock, at business seminar in Sydney in 1982 . In calculations made by Australia's Business Review Weekly magazine, she was placed at the top of its Rich 200 list. Mrs Rinehart has easily surprised Forbes’ calculation of the £16 billion estimation of Christy Walton, widow of John Walton and holder of a major stake in the American retail giant Wal-Mart. In an extraordinary accumulation of riches from the mining industry, Mrs Rinehart’s wealth has grown by an unprecedented £11 billion this year alone. She makes more than £630,000 every 30 minutes, say financial experts.","Gina Rinehart urges Australians to 'spend less time drinking, smoking and socialising'

CLICK HERE to follow all the latest wheels, deals and steals with MailOnline's brilliant by-the-minute service, including breaking news, best pictures and videos. City captain Vincent Kompany tweeted Micah Richards to wish him luck in Serie A, posting: '#MCFC club legend! Proud to have played 6 years alongside this man. Congratulations and good luck at @ACF_Fiorentina my brother #forzaMicah.' Fiorentina are also interested in Richards' team-mate John Guidetti, but could face competition from Palermo. The 21-year-old Sweden striker was linked with Olympiacos last week. City fans might be a little concerned at the possibility of Guidetti following Alvaro Negredo out of the door, leaving them short of strikers. Richards, meanwhile, is out of contention at the Etihad and made only two Premier League appearances last season, including the 3-1 win at Upton Park. In total, he played only 10 games last season – including five domestic cup ties. He has played 13 times for England but injuries and a loss of form have seen him drop down the pecking order. Sources at West Ham were surprised he wasn’t prepared to take a huge drop in wages for first team football. Target: West Ham were interested in Richards but have been put off by his wage demands an a £1m loan fee . When Richards swaps northern England for the north of Italy, he might encounter a few differences. Here's a comparison of Manchester and Florence . Delicacy: Fish and Chips .

"Pam Oliver has spoken out after being dumped from her role as NFL sideline reporter in favor of Erin Andrews, saying all the new people on air are 'young, blonde and hot.' It was announced in July that Andrews, who was hired from ESPN two years ago, was to replace Oliver on the sidelines as part of Fox's NFL coverage with Joe Buck and Troy Aikman. Fox Sports president said Oliver would stay on as a sideline reporter, working with Kevin Burkhardt and John Lynch, who are often considered  the 'B team.' Pam Oliver, left, who has hit out after being bumped from her role on Fox Sports in favour of Erin Andrews, right . Now the 53-year-old has hit out at Fox Sports saying when they told her they wanted the network to look radically different, she assumes they meant they wanted it to look younger. Writing in Essence magazine she explained: 'It’s not difficult to notice that the new on-air people there are all young, blonde and hot.' 'That’s not to say that Erin isn’t capable. I think she’s very capable. She’s also popular on Twitter and social media, so I can see how that would also make her highly sought after.' 'Still, covering the NFL is a big deal. Stations like ABC and NBC entrust their programming to veterans. So when people talk about all networks making a turn to a particular type of girl on the sidelines, it doesn’t hold water.' The 53-year-old says Fox Sports told her they wanted the network to look radically different, which she assumes meant they wanted to look younger . Oliver pursued a career in broadcast journalism after excelling in college sports, notably track and field, where she was selected All-American. Oliver began working at ESPN in 1993, afterwards moving to Fox, where she worked as an NFL sideline reporter for 19 seasons. She also covered the NBA playoffs. Her new role will see her conduct interviews and commentary on other Fox and Fox Sports 1 shows, such as Fox Sports Live and Fox Sports 1 on 1 and sports beyond the NFL. One of her more memorable moments came last year when she was hit in the face by a wild throw from Indianapolis back-up QB Chandler Harnish  before a preseason game in 2013. She carried on with the broadcast and was able to laugh off the incident, in spite of later being diagnosed with a concussion. Andrews, pictured, joined Fox Sports in 2012 after previously working for ESPN . 'Who was talking about you?': Erin Andrews's interview with Seahawks cornerback Michael Crabtree became national headlines after the NFC Championship game . Andrews joined Fox Sports two years ago and during last year's NFL postseason was paired with Oliver on the field. After the NFC Championship game, it was Andrews, not Oliver, who got the sideline interview with Richard Sherman, where the adrenaline-fueled corner called out 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree. The rant went viral, and Andrews ended up doing a media tour that included an interview on Late Night with David Letterman. Andrews's arrival at Fox followed Oliver's trajectory, as the Dancing with the Stars host had covered college football and other sports at ESPN since 2004. It was reported that Fox Sports 'aggressively pursued' the 36-year-old to join the network after leaving ESPN in 2012 when her contract expired. Age: 53 .

"The right hand man of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed in a US airstrike in northern Iraq, according to senior security officials. Damaging blow: A key aide of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been killed by a US airstrike over Mosul, northern Iraq according to security sources . Two days after video showing the execution of Steven Sotloff was released, US warplanes struck a damaging blow at the heart of ISIS in Mosul, killing Abu Hajar Al-Sufi. And at the NATO summit in Wales this afternoon, Secretary of State John Kerry was seen to quietly pass President Obama a note during an address by British Prime Minister David Cameron,. After Cameron finished speaking, members of the press pool were cleared from the conference hall . While it has not been confirmed if Obama learned of Al-Sufi's death through Kerry's note, the president was noticeably absent for the beginning of a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine commission later-on at the summit. A senior Iraqi security official confirmed the news of the deadly air strike to NBC News and is the most significant blow against ISIS since the United States began action last month. Al Arabiya news quoted the Iraqi Defense Ministry to say Baghdadi's aide perished along with an explosives expert and the military chief in nearby town Tel Afar. It has not been confirmed when the airstrike took place but on Tuesday US military officials said a sortie against ISIS militants in Iraq damaged or destroyed 16 armed vehicles near the Mosul Dam. The confirmation of the deadly strike demonstrates that the US is clearly targeting ISIS's leadership and clarifies rumors circulating yesterday that al-Baghdadi himself was killed in the raid. Indeed, multiple sources, including former Iraqi army officers, told the Daily Beast on Wednesday that al-Baghdadi had died in Syria after being seriously injured in an Iraqi or American airstrike in the north of Iraq. While the significance of Al-Sufi's death for al-Baghdadi and ISIS is not yet clear, the loss of his right-hand man cannot be underestimated. The presence of Al-Sufi in Mosul shows that al-Baghdadi could be worried about losing Mosul to a combination of US airstrikes and Kurdish and Iraqi counter attacks. Sending his right-hand man there to oversee the fight would go a long way to confirming this, but regardless, Al-Sufi's death is a blow to the ISIS hierarchy. Scroll down for video . Important: Secretary of State John Kerry leans in to talk to President Obama and to pass him a note during the NATO summit today in Wales . Important enough to interrupt a president: Secretary of State John Kerry, center, passes a document to President Barack Obama as British Prime Minister David Cameron, right, speaks at a meeting of NATO leaders regarding Afghanistan at the NATO summit at Celtic Manor in Newport, Wales, on Thursday . Informed: The president reads the note passed to him by Secretary of State John Kerry during the NATO summit today at Celtric Manor in Newport, Wales . The strike against the terror groups leadership came as Western leaders at the summit ramped up their rhetoric against ISIS. Indeed, world leaders, nervously eyeing a growing threat from Islamic State militants, are seeking to build a united front this week against the violent extremist group and keep it from creeping beyond its borders. Yet international plans to counter the Islamic State group - with combined military might, diplomatic pressure on abetting partners and economic penalties - still pale in comparison to the extremists' ruthlessness and command of the swath of land it controls across parts of northern Syria and Iraq. For the second time in as many weeks, Islamic State militants released a video showing the beheading of an American journalist, and governments from Britain to Saudi Arabia to Australia warned of the potential of their citizens joining the fight - and then bringing the violence back home. 'Our objective is clear, and that is to degrade and destroy ISIL so that it's no longer a threat,' President Barack Obama said Wednesday during a visit to Estonia, using an alternate acronym for the Islamic State. He later headed to Wales for an annual meeting of leaders of the NATO military alliance. Separately, during an appearance in Maine, Vice President Joe Biden declared that the U.S. will pursue the militants to 'the gates of hell.' In Wales, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was considering joining a nearly monthlong U.S. airstrike campaign in Iraq against the Islamic State group, adding to military aid that London has already approved. 'We'll always ask ourselves what is in our national interest,' Cameron said, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper. 'Not ruling things out, but going forward in a deliberate, sensible, resolute way.' Cameron and Obama collaborated on an op-ed piece published Thursday in the Times of London, writing, 'Countries like Britain and America will not be cowed by barbaric killers.' And in the Mideast, the United Arab Emirates called for a coordinated international effort to tackle the 'global scourge' of terrorism, raising particular concern about the threat posed by Islamic State fighters. Airstrikes: The US launched raids on Mosul on Tuesday - although it is not clear if they killed Al-Sufi . Allies: British Prime Minister David Cameron talks with US President Barack Obama  on the first day of the NATO Summit 2014 at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, in Wales . Might: The United States began limited airstrikes against ISIS positions in northern Iraq in August after the terror group began to exercise control over large swathes of territory . Mobile: A convoy of vehicles and fighters from ISIS move through Iraq's Anbar Province. The Islamic State group holds roughly a third of Iraq and Syria, including several strategically important cities like Fallujah and Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria. It rules over a population of several million people with its strict interpretation of Islamic law . The heightened urgency reflected fears that the Islamic State was growing stronger in its quest to create a caliphate territory in the Mideast and systematically kill any who resist. The group is considered even more merciless toward its enemies than the al-Qaida terror network, and intelligence officials across the world warn that it may soon seek to seed its violence beyond its declared borders. So far, the Islamic State has beheaded two American journalists it held captive for what the militants called payback for more than 120 U.S. airstrikes on its assets in northern Iraq since Aug. 8. Journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were two of what the State Department has described as 'a few' Americans still being held hostage by the group. The Islamic State also had threatened to kill a British man it is holding hostage. March: ISIS fighters move through northern Iraq in January on their way to conquering huge slabs of territory across Iraq and Syria . In a statement Wednesday, a family spokesman said Sotloff dedicated his life to portraying the suffering of people in war zones, but was 'no hero.' The Islamic State group spearheaded an offensive in June, seizing vast swaths of northern Iraq, including the country's second largest city Mosul. In recent weeks the battle has raged between US backed forces and ISIS for the Mosul Dam which controls water and electricity across northern Iraq. 'ISIS keeps trying to take it back,' Rear. Admiral John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said at a briefing Tuesday. 'As long as they continue to pose a threat to the facility we are going to continue to hit them,' Kirby said. Each day ISIS militants fight Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by US airstrikes in the region. The US has launched dozens of airstrikes around the dam since ISIS abandoned it to Iraqi and Kurdish forces in mid-August. The United States fears not only the strategic significance of the dam for ISIS, but also the catastrophic threat posed if the terror group attempts to blow up the dam and flood the surrounding region. Family spokesman Barak Barfi told reporters gathered outside the family's suburban Miami home that Sotloff 'tried to find good concealed in a world of darkness,' and to give voice to the weak and suffering in the Arab world. Barfi said Sotloff was 'no war junkie,' but was drawn to the stories of the turbulent Middle East, and his family has pledged to 'not allow our enemies to hold us hostage with the sole weapon they possess - fear.' Sotloff, a 31-year-old who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines before he was captured in Syria a year ago, was also an Israeli citizen. But his Jewish faith and Israeli citizenship were not widely known before his death - in part because Israel's military censor apparently kept a lid on the story for his safety - and his killers are not believed to have known about his background. In Washington, Obama administration officials maintained that the U.S. will not launch a ground war against the Islamic State militants. But they stopped short of ruling out airstrikes against the group in its safe haven in Syria, as the U.S. has resisted for years. Obama has 'been clear that we're not going to be limited by geography,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. She described a range of actions being considered against the Islamic State, and noted that decisions and discussions were ongoing. Over the past day, Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration officials have reached out to leaders from Australia, the UAE, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Italy and Israel to discuss how to combat the Islamic State. Psaki said the discussions focused on what each country might contribute - including weapons, humanitarian aid and other resources - and noted that some nations already have. Obama 'wants to build an international coalition,' Psaki said. 'That's not going to be overnight. We need capabilities from many countries.' The push also mirrors concerns that the Islamic State will lure foreigners to the fight - who will then return home to launch attacks. A compilation of government estimates shows more than 2,000 people with European passports have fought or are fighting in Syria and Iraq, with most looking to join the Islamic State group.","US airstrikes kill Abu Hajar Al-Sufi - a key aide of ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .

"A groomsman at an Ohio wedding has been arrested for stealing thousands of dollars worth of cash and gift-cards from the newlyweds as they partied with family and friends at their wedding reception. Noah Howard, 29, allegedly stole 55 unopened wedding cards containing a total of $6,800 in cash and gift-cards from a safe at the reception venue - and then went back to celebrate some more with the bride and groom. The theft was discovered after an employee at the Webster Street Market, the reception venue, noticed the cards missing from the safe. Friend indeed: Groomsman Noah Howard allegedly stole $6,800 worth of cash and giftcards from the bride and groom whose wedding he had just taken part in before returning to the reception to party with the newlyweds . According to ABC News, Howard had asked staff if he could change clothes in the office. After the employee discovered the empty safe, the police were called. Before they could arrive, though, the cards were recovered in a Men's Warehouse garment bag that Howard had stashed behind some bushes near the entrance to the venue. Howard told police the money must have been placed in the bag by an employee who tried to steal the cards and then became scared and dumped them in Howard's bag. Joyful occasion: The bride and groom were celebrating their wedding at the Webster Street Market with their nearest and dearest when Howard went to an office to change and emerged with a garment back of cards . AJC reports that surveillance footage shows Howard enter the venue's office to change and then emerge holding the garment bag and swaying as he walked. “It’s just a very extreme thing to do, to take gifts at a wedding,” Mire said, adding he does not know if Howard has financial problems. Howard was booked into the Dayton county jail on suspicion of theft. According to the New York Daily News, Howard has known the groom for 12 years. Police are waiting for the newlyweds to return from their honeymoon before they can complete the investigation.","Noah Howard, 29, is accused of stealing gifts from his close friend and his wife on their wedding day .

"Manchester United have spoken to Sporting Lisbon about central midfielder William Carvalho as the ailing club try to beef up their squad before the transfer window closes on Monday. Manager Louis van Gaal needs reinforcements after a desperate start to the season that has seen his team take just a point from two Barclays Premier League games and crash out of the Capital One Cup 4-0 at League One MK Dons. The Dutchman is keen on a deal for Juventus and Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal, but United are also in contact with Sporting about Carvalho after the Portuguese club dropped their asking price to £23.8million. VIDEO Scroll down for Sporting midfielder William Carvalho's audacious lob . Target: Manchester United are considering a £24million move for Sporting Lisbon's William Carvalho (right) It is unlikely United will buy both players and chief executive Ed Woodward is concerned rival clubs will try to take advantage of United’s crisis by demanding inflated prices. He is also aware he has competition for Carvalho from Arsenal, who can offer the Portugal star European football. However, Van Gaal has made his needs clear in recent days and Woodward has permission from owners the Glazers to spend big once again after the British record £60m paid by United to Real Madrid for Angel di Maria this week. United only concluded a deal with Lisbon for defender Marcos Rojo last week and have concerns about getting involved again after the protracted nature of that deal. Wanted: United have also been interested in Juventus' Arturo Vidal (centre) and could yet launch a bid . Equally, though, they have concerns over Vidal’s knee after it needed surgery last season and they at least know their good relationship with Portuguese agent Jorges Mendes could help them get a deal done for 22-year-old Carvalho. Meanwhile, United have interest in Tom Cleverley and Danny Welbeck from ‘five or six’ clubs and either could leave before Monday. Welbeck, understandably, would prefer to go to a club at the top end of the league while Cleverley may choose to run his contract down. United also have offers for Japan playmaker Shinji Kagawa but perhaps unsurprisingly are struggling to move on Brazilian failure Anderson. The club will officially unveil Di Maria on Thursday and he will go straight into the team for Saturday’s game at Burnley.

"Europe has banned controversial airport 'strip-search' scanners over fears the X-ray technology could cause cancer. Experts have found the body scanners emit low doses of radiation and the EU has told member states not to install them until the risks are assessed. They will be completely banned in April if experts rule they are dangerous. Millions of people worldwide are believed to have passed through the security scanners. In the UK passengers are required to do so if asked. Controversial: A demonstration of the scanners that European bosses have failed to give the green light for. A full body scan is shown, left, and a screen showing the results of the scan, right . American use: More than 600 Advanced Imaging Technology units, using X-ray technology, have been installed at 140 airports across the U.S . Manchester Airport, the only airport in the UK which now has the scanners, installed 16 of the . £80,000 machines, and has been told it can continue using them . for another year. However, no new machines will be allowed at the moment to 'protect citizens' health and safety'. The scanners were introduced in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted 'underwear bomb' terror plot in 2009. They were used at Heathrow but scrapped amid complaints about invasion of privacy. They have also been tested in Germany, France, Italy, Finland and Holland. Research suggests that because of the large number of scanners in the U.S. - there are 250 - up to 100 passengers a year could get cancer. Britain, which argues the scans are a 'proportionate response to a very real terrorist threat', could be hit with a fine from the European courts if it ignores the ban. In July, hospital consultant Tony Aguirre told how he was grounded after he refused to go through a 'naked' X-ray scanner at Manchester Airport, claiming it could give him cancer. He was not allowed to board the plane to Zurich and was escorted out of the airport by police. Various Muslim groups have also protested against the scanners and some Islamic scholars have forbidden Muslim travellers to pass through full body scanners on the grounds that they violate religious laws. Last year two Muslim women who refused to be scanned on religious grounds were barred from a flight to Pakistan. Last November technology blog Gizmodo . revealed 100 images showing visitors to a Florida courthouse standing . inside a scanner machine as it took their photograph - with their . intimate body parts clearly visible. Gizmodo applied under the Freedom of . Information Act and put a selection online, taking care to mask the . identities of all involved. A female passenger also claimed she was made to feel like a terrorist for bringing breast milk she had pumped earlier through security at Phoenix airport. Stacey Armato had 12 ounces of breast milk with her and as per TSA guidelines, she requested the milk not be passed through the X-ray scanner because of possible radiation. And last month, a TSA agent faced dismissal after finding a sex toy in woman's bag and leaving her a note saying: 'Get your freak on girl'. The Health Protection Agency said: 'The radiation dose from an examination of two or three scans is less than that received from two minutes flying at cruising altitude.' At Manchester passengers selected for scanning are banned from flying if they refuse to pass through the device. The airport says around 10 passengers have been unable to board their flight after refusing tp pass through the scanners, known as 'back scatter' machines. A spokesperson for the airport said: 'Extensive tests by the UK Health Protection Agency and the U.S. health authorities have already confirmed that back scatter body scanners pose a negligible risk to human health. 'It is irresponsible to suggest that because Europe has yet to complete its own health study, our passengers should be concerned. 'European legislation issued this week has approved millimetre wave, another form of body scanner technology, for permanent use at airports. 'While its study is underway, an extension of the trial of back scatter body scanners at Manchester Airport has been approved by the European Commission until November 2012. 'Given that all of the relevant authorities support the use of back scatter body scanners, the trial will continue.' The EU has ruled that for the time being, only security scanners which do not use X-ray technology are approved for use. The use of any scanner is only allowed if they do not store, retain, copy, print or retrieve images. Vice-President Siim Kallas, the EU commissioner responsible for transport, defended the ban, saying: 'Security scanners are not a panacea but they do offer a real possibility to reinforce passenger security. 'Security scanners are a valuable alternative to existing screening methods and are very efficient in detecting both metallic and non-metallic objects. 'It is still for each member state or airport to decide whether or not to deploy security scanners, but these new rules ensure that where this new technology is used it will be covered by EU wide standards on detection capability as well as strict safeguards to protect health and fundamental rights. 'Experience to date shows that passengers and staff generally see security scanners as a convenient method of screening.' The first X-ray body scanner was developed in 1992 by Steven W Smith. He sold the technology and rights to Rapiscan Systems, which now manufactures and distributes the device. Fears about the health risks were raised in the U.S. as far back as 1998 when the machine known as the Secure 1000 was evaluated by a panel of radiation safety experts brought together by the Food and Drug Administration. They all expressed concerns about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should not be X-rayed unless there is a medical purpose. The machine’s inventor told panellists that the machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come. Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam was the first airport to implement the scanners in 2007. In the U.S. the Transportation Security Administration scanners sparked a heated debate over security concerns versus . travellers' privacy when they were first brought in autumn 2010. The machines have also been installed in some courtrooms. In response, New Jersey's legislature issued a resolution urging Congress to review the programme. Study group Electronic Privacy Information Center then filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of scanners at U.S. airports pending an independent review. In February 2011, a trial of new 'non-intrusive' body scanners started at Atlanta, Las Vegas, and Washington, D.C. before they were rolled out permanently in July. New York's Newark Liberty International airport followed in September, where more than eight million passengers boarded planes last year. Also in September, BAA, which owns Heathrow, said it will test the new 'privacy-friendly' scanner. The Italian government had planned to . install full body scanners at all airports and train stations but . removed them from airports, calling them 'slow and ineffective'.","EU introduces ban while danger of X-ray machines is fully assessed .

"A four-year-old boy has been expelled from school on his first day after his mother took to Facebook to complain about staff. After dropping off her son, Will, at Sonshine Christian Academy, in Callahan, Florida, Ashley Habat wrote a status on Facebook, questioning whether the school's staff were 'ignorant'. Ms Habat claims that the school decided to expel her son because of the post. Ashley Habat says her son was expelled because of a status she wrote about his school's staff on Facebook . The post, which Ms Habat (Ashley Raine on Facebook) thought was private, was seen by school staff . When Ms Habat dropped her son at his new school, she told a member of staff that she had not been given enough notice of picture day, WPTV reported. After being told all parents had been informed the week before, Ms Habat went home and posted her frustrations on Facebook. Thinking the post was private, and that the school would not see it, she said: 'Why is it that every single day there is something new I dislike about [my son's] school? 'Are my standards really too high or are people working in the education field really just that ignorant?' But because she tagged the school in the post, staff were able to see what she had written despite her profile being private. The next morning Ms Habat was called by the school, asking her to stop by when she dropped off her son. 'They just felt like we weren't the right fit of parent relationship with the school and that they didn't want him as a student anymore. He had done nothing wrong,' she said. 'I was in shock. Why would you expel a four-year-old over something his mom posts on her private Facebook page.' Ms Habat explained why she had taken to Facebook to vent her anger. Sonshine Christian Academy said Ms Habat's post questioned the staff's 'integrity and intelligence' She said: 'The administrator of the preschool checking him in, she's like, ""Well it's picture day, are you excited?"" and he just went on to class. 'But I had mentioned that they didn't give enough notice. And she's like, ""Well we put it in his folder last week,""' The four-year-old's mother has since received a letter of dismissal saying that she broke the academy's social media policy. It says: 'Your relationship with Sonshine did not get off to a very good start the first day of school. 'You utilized social media to call into question not only the integrity but the intelligence of our staff. 'These actions are also consistent with sowing discord which is spoken of in the handbook you signed.'","Ashley Habat vented frustrations with her son's new school on Facebook .

"A key prosecution witness in the trial of  a former Rutgers University student accused of watching his roommate’s intimate encounter via webcam testified Monday that he texted her multiple times as she was being interviewed by police to make the webcam video broadcast seem like an accident. ‘I think that he thought we were going to get in trouble, so he wanted to make it seem like it was more of an accident,’ Molly Wei, 19, told the court. Both she and defendant Dharun Ravi, who turned 20 today, viewed the web images of Ravi’s roommate, 18-year-old Tyler Clementi. Scroll down for video . Other versions of events: Molly Wei, who was also initially charged with some crimes related to the same event, testified earlier this week about her involvement in the webcam usage . The accused: Dharun Ravi listens to the testimony in court Monday which includes Miss Wei's who was initially charged in the case as well prior to making a deal with the court . She said Ravi was worried about what she was telling police, and asked her multiple times via text message what exactly she revealed to them. ‘Did you tell them we did it on purpose? What did you tell them when they asked why we turned it on? I said we were just messing around with the camera,’ Ravi said in some of his messages, ABC News reported. Wei responded saying that she told investigators ‘everything’ that happened the night of September 19, 2010 when Ravi set up a webcam in his and Clementi’s room after Clementi asked to have the room for himself. Clementi jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge days after that, as the rumours abounded that he was gay. Wei also testified Monday that she agreed to keep it a secret because it was so shocking to see the images - but that it wasn't under wraps for long. ‘First of all, it was shocking. It felt wrong. We didn't expect to see that. And now that what we did, it was like we shouldn't have seen it,’ Wei told the jurors. ‘We didn't want people to know what had happened.’ But within minutes, she testified, she and defendant Dharun Ravi were online chatting with friends about seeing two men kissing. Others knew: Defense attorney Steven Altman cross examined witness Scott Xu, a friend of Ravi's who played Ultimate Frisbee with him and claimed was told during a practice, among other teammates, that he had set up the webcam . Within the hour, Ms Wei said, she agreed to show a few seconds of the video stream to four other women who visited her dorm room. Still, she said, Ravi did not intend to humiliate his roommate. Ravi faces 15 criminal counts, including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation. To convict him of bias intimidation- the most serious charge he faces- prosecutors would have to persuade jurors that Mr Ravi acted out of bias toward gays. Wei was charged initially but entered a program that will allow her to keep her record clean if she meets a list of conditions, including doing community service, working or attending school full-time. She also agreed to cooperate with authorities and testify truthfully in Ravi's trial. She said she has completed about 250 of the 300 hours of community service required. There is one requirement that was changed for her. She was to go through a program on cyberbullying or dealing with people with ‘alternative lifestyles.’ Witness: Rutgers student Pooja Kolliri testified saying she saw seconds of the webcam's stream of two men kissing which she says shocked her . Since no program like that was offered in Middlesex County, she instead saw a psychologist. Unlike other more casually dressed . college students who have testified so far in the trial, Ms Wei wore a . black business suit. And unlike the others, she kept her voice audible . even during the most uncomfortable moments. She said that she invited Ravi, whom . she had known since middle school, to her dorm room for a snack a few . minutes after 9pm on September 19, 2010. When Ravi tried to go back, . she said, Mr Clementi told him that he wanted the cramped dorm room to . himself for a few hours. So Ravi returned. Family's attendance: Tyler Clementi's mother, Jane Clementi, attended the trial today (center) listening to a witness testify that her son had requested a room change days after his roommate set up the webcam . Charges: Middlesex County prosecutors are seen discussing the case that charges Ravi with invasion of privacy, bias intimidation and other crimes . Within a few minutes, she said, he . used her computer to view live images from his webcam. It was then, she . said, that she saw about two seconds of Mr Clementi and an older man . kissing. Even though she said they initially . agreed not to talk about what they had seen, she asked Ravi to tell a . friend about it during an online chat that began at 9.20pm and within . minutes, word got around the dorm. She said she agreed to turn the webcam back on at the request of a woman who was among a group dropped by her room. ‘It was the exact same image, except that they had taken their tops off,’ she said. ‘As soon as they saw it, I turned it off.’ Ms Wei was expected to be back on the witness stand for more cross-examination on Tuesday. Also Monday, jurors heard from university official William O'Brien that Mr Clementi requested a room change about 30 hours after the alleged spying - and a day before he killed himself. Mr O'Brien, associate director of residence life at Rutgers, told jurors that his staff did not see Mr Clementi's request for a new roommate until after he was reported missing from campus.

"Aston Villa are still waiting to discover if they have succeeded in a last-ditch attempt to take Tom Cleverley on loan from Manchester United. It appeared as though Villa would sign Cleverley in a permanent £7.5million deal on deadline day when United accepted their offer and the England midfielder headed to the Midlands for a medical. However, Everton attempted to hijack the transfer when chairman Bill Kenwright opened talks with United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward but saw his bid of £5.5m flatly refused.

Cleverley, who was forced to train with the reserves at Carrington last week, was in danger of being left in limbo before Villa boss Paul Lambert revived the deal just before Monday’s 11pm deadline. Villa were granted an extension by the Premier League until 1am to complete a loan move but the paperwork was not submitted until 1.15am. They are now waiting to find out if it will be ratified so the 25-year-old can move to Villa Park. Lambert has been looking to beef up his midfield despite adding Carlos Sanchez, Joe Cole and Kieran Richardson over the summer. He also sold Karim El Ahmadi back to Feyenoord and loaned Aleksandar Tonev to Celtic. Cleverley looks to have little future at Old Trafford with boss Louis van Gaal making him available for transfer and Hull were also interested before moving for Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa. The England midfielder has made 79 appearances for United, the last coming in their 1-1 draw at Sunderland two weeks ago. That was then: Cleverley was a regular under previous boss David Moyes but not under Louis van Gaal .

"Boost: Millions of us reach for a coffee to increase energy levels - but how effective is it? Millions of us reach for a coffee at least once a day to boost our alertness and counter flagging energy levels. But what if there was a free alternative that worked even better? Writer Gregory Ferenstein believes he has the answer - 30 seconds of high-intensity exercise such as push-ups whenever he feels drowsy. He discovered that the exercises gave him double the energy boost of his daily Starbucks - and saved him a considerable amount of cash in the process. Writing for The Daily Beast, he explained: 'Whenever I need a pick-me-up, I find a . quiet corner and perform some form of body-weight exercise that jolts my . heart up to at last 70 percent of the maximal beats per minute (for me, . that's about 170). He said his favourite exercises are 20 burpees (a push-up to . jumping jack) or 40 mountain climbers (push-up position, bringing knees . to elbows). He added: 'I've found that 30 seconds of high-intensity body-weight exercise gives me the same mental boost as a shot of caffeine.' To try and scientifically prove if that was the case, he applied his findings to a tool that assesses cognitive performance - the website quantified-mind.com. In his piece, Mr Ferenstein explains how he performed the tests after both 250mg caffeine and exercise, to see how it affected his memory and reaction times. For reference, a Starbucks Grande Cafe Americano has 225mg of caffeine. He said: 'Essentially, these types of games test if users are paying attention and if they can think on their feet (i.e. if I've got brain fog).' He found that his overall cognitive performance increased by six per cent after caffeine - but 12 per cent after exercise. The only benefit caffeine gave him was when it came to short-term memory, which improved by 26 per cent compared to 16 per cent with exercise. A wealth of research backs up his findings. Last year researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute found that high-intensity exercise boosts mental and physical health. Alert: Short bursts of high-intensity exercise such as push-ups could boost brain power and performance more than caffeine (file picture) Previously sedentary adults were put through four months of high-intensity interval training. At the end, their cognitive functions - the ability to think, recall and make quick decisions - had improved significantly, the researchers found. Last year researchers from the University of South Carolina  found that regular treadmill sessions also give a boost to the cell's powerhouses in the brain. Research leader Dr Mark Davis said this energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently.","Gregory Ferenstein says 30 seconds of high-intensity exercise such as push-ups gives him more of a mental boost than a cup of coffee .

"The shirt worn by the Navy SEAL soldier who shot dead Osama bin Laden will be put on public display this Sunday at New York City's 9/11 Memorial Museum in time for the 13th anniversary. It was secured by Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and will be become the latest exhibit at the $700 million museum dedicated to the memory of the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives that day. While the identity of the man who put three bullets into Osama bin Laden inside his secret Pakistan hideaway on May 2, 2011 has not been revealed, the simple brown shirt will be the most overt relic of the terror masterminds death at the memorial. Scroll down for video . New addition: The US Navy SEAL Team 6 shirt will go on display this Sunday - in time for the anniversary of the 9/11 terror atrocity at the World Trade Center's Twin Towers . 'This shirt is a symbol of the bravery of the US Navy SEAL Team 6, who risked their lives,' said Maloney. While the official line from the museum is that the shirt only belongs to a member of the SEAL team who stormed the Abbottabad complex, sources have told the New York Post that the shirt is the one worn by bin Laden's shooter. Displaying the shirt is an important exhibit for the museum, said Maloney, brushing off any hint of controversy about displaying it. 'It’s important that they tell the entire story, not just the story of the 9/11 attacks,' she said to the New York Post. While the actual shooters identity has never been revealed, snippets of information about the soldier who killed the most wanted man on Earth have trickled out over the past three years. Shot dead: Osama bin Laden was killed by the unidentified member of the special forces team on May 2, 2011 at his Abbottabad, Pakistan compound . Secret: The mission was years in the planning and was the least preferred option of President Obama's political team . Hearts in mouth: President Obama, with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and vice president Joe Biden, watched the raid unfold in front of their eyes back in Washington D.C. Now retired, it was revealed the special-forces solider has suffered a breakdown in his marriage and is so concerned about being identified that he refused to meet families of 9/11 victims to preserve his anonymity, said the New York Post. In an interview with Esquire magazine in February 2013, the shooter described in extraordinary detail the heart-stopping two minutes that changed the course of history. In the Esquire interview The Shooter reveals that once they were given their mission, the female CIA agent - portrayed by Jessica Chastain's Maya in Zero Dark Thirty - told the team that bin Laden was '100 per cent on the third floor' of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. 'We got him,' she told us. 'This is him. This is my life's work. I'm positive.' Once he locked eyes on his target, the SEAL remembers being surprised at his appearance. Bin Laden was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys, and skinny with a short beard and shaved head. He was holding his wife Amal in front of him as a shield and though The Shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles, bin Laden was in total darkness and could hear but not see. Secret: The Navy SEAL special forces soldier has never revealed his identity and has refused every effort by families of 9/11 victims to meet him, even in private . Remembrance: The 9/11 Memorial Museum opened last year at a cost of $700 and features an emotionally searing wall of every victim of the suicide plane attacks . He also said he feared she might try to blow them up. He added: ‘I don’t know if she’s got a vest and she’s being pushed to martyr them both. 'I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up]. 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath. 'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**. 'His forehead was gruesome. It was split open in the shape of a V. I could see his brains spilling out over his face.' The Shooter also says that the night before the raid, all the members of Team Six wrote letters to their loved ones - fully believing they would die in the mission to take down bin Laden. He described how he sat on his bed writing a letter to his kids to be delivered on the case of his death, 'something for them to read when they are 35'.","The brown combat shirt to go on display this Sunday in time for anniversary .

"A Turkish newspaper columnist has been heavily criticised after writing an article which said the Olympic Games is destroying the female figure. The piece - called Womanhood is dying at the Olympics' - was written by Yuksel Aytug and was published in the daily newspaper Sabah and on the paper's website. However, it soon spread around the world by saying the Games was distorting women's bodies and that extra points should be given to female athletes based on how feminine they looked. Under attack: Female Olympians - such as swimmer Rebecca Adlington (left) and Jessica Ennis (right) have been criticised for having masculine bodies by Yuksel Aytug . Disgrace: Team GB's Zoe Smith, 18,  has been the subject of vile internet abuse, with anonymous Twitter trolls telling her she looks like a 'lesbian' and a 'bloke' According to Hurriyet Daily News, he . said: 'Broad-shouldered, flat-chested women with small hips; [they are] . totally indistinguishable from men. 'Their breasts – the symbol of womanhood, motherhood – flattened into stubs as they were seen as mere hindrances to speed. 'I am not even talking about female javelin throwers, shot-put athletes, weightlifters, wrestlers and boxers.' He added that the appearance of many female Olympians was 'pathetic'. Following the publication of the article, Mr Aytug was strongly criticised by people on Twitter and his own female colleagues. He was accused of sexism and reducing the identity of women purely to appearance. Feminine: Yuksel Aytug has clearly not seen much of the beach volleyball competition. Team GB's Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin are pictured . His name was trending worldwide on Twitter for a number of hours, with people outraged by his comments. In his column, he also said the Olympic Games forced woman to look more like men so they could become successful. One Turkish columnist, Banu Tuna, sarcastically asked Aytuğ if he thought the term 'woman' meant just a collection of legs, hips and breasts. She also suggested that he watch lingerie fashion shows instead of the Olympic Games. Team GB's Zoe Smith, 18,  faced abuse about her appearance before the Games began. She was the subject of vile internet . abuse after appearing on a documentary earlier this year, with anonymous . Twitter trolls telling her she looks like a 'lesbian' and a 'bloke'.

Simple as that.’ She added that it was particularly ‘sad’ to see abuse from girls who labelled her ‘weird’ for her muscular physique. ‘You’d think that young women around the same age as us would commend us,’ she added.","The piece - called Womanhood is dying at the Olympics' - was written by Yuksel Aytug .

"Loic Remy celebrated his move to Chelsea with the winning goal as France heaped more misery on World Cup flops Spain. The former QPR frontman climbed off the bench to bag the only goal of the game 16 minutes from time when he thumped the ball past David de Gea to earn Didier Deschamps' side a deserved victory at the Stade de France. Spain dominated possession but they failed to muster a single shot on target as Hugo Lloris was a virtual bystander between the French sticks.

Following a disastrous World Cup campaign, Vicente del Bosque looked to the new generation after midfield duo Xavi, Xabi Alonso and David Villa decided to hang up their boots on the international stage. However, it was France who appeared the more dangerous on the counter attack in the first half in Paris. Karim Benzema was a constant thorn in Spain's side. He had the first sight of goal that was easily saved by De Gea, then failed to get a proper connection when the ball dropped to him in the box. Paul Pogba shot straight at De Gea, while Antoine Griezmann's thumping effort hit Sergio Busquets square in the face. Rebuilding job: Vicente del bosque's new-look spain side offered very little .

Benzema forced a good save out of the Manchester United man before the break, but eventually had the ball in the net at the beginning of the second half when he converted Moussa Sissoko's perfectly-weighted cross. However, the Real Madrid frontman was wrongly denied by the linesman's flag as the visitors escaped once again. Spain failed to create any clear-cut chances and a frustrated Diego Costa was withdrawn midway through the second half along with Chelsea team-mate Cesc Fabregas. However, while it was agony for two Blues stars, it was ecstacy for another minutes later. Sissoko's flick played in Mathieu Valbuena, and he cut the ball back for sub Remy to crash the ball past De Gea from eight yards into the top corner. Spain rallied, but David Silva failed to take a couple of chances to equalise as they slipped to another defeat ahead of their opening Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

"An overflow crowd in a Southern California community where protesters turned back Homeland Security busloads of immigrants gave a harsh reception to federal officials behind the decision to bring them to Murrieta in the first place. Local politicians calling for secure borders proved far more popular with the crowd Wednesday night. 'Send them back! Send the back!' the special-meeting crowd chanted, shouting down Chief Border Patrol Agent Paul Beeson after he took responsibility for transferring the Central American children and families to Murrieta from Texas, where the numbers are too much for facilities to handle. On Tuesday, the buses were rerouted an hour south to San Diego after they were met with flag-waving protesters in Murrieta.

'If we want to keep attracting the best and the brightest from beyond our shores, we’re going to have fix our immigration system, which is broken, and pass common-sense immigration reform,' Obama said at the ceremony today, according to The Washington Times. The Wednesday night crowd gathered at a high school auditorium that seats 750 in the desert city of 100,000 people, groaned when Beeson said four of the immigrants had to be hospitalized, two with scabies and two with fevers. And Beeson conceded that he did not know where Tuesday's immigrants nor several more waves slated to arrive from Texas in coming days will end up. 'We will make decisions when they arrive where it makes the most sense to put them,' he said. The federal government is working to deal with a flood of Central American children and families fleeing to the United States. More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been detained after crossing the Texas-Mexico border since October in what President Barack Obama has called a humanitarian crisis. Many are under the impression that they will receive leniency from U.S. authorities. Murrieta Mayor Alan Long, who urged locals to oppose the immigrant transfer plan before it began, said the city will track any spending it does over the issue and send a ""big fat bill"" to Washington.

That's how much they love this country,' Obama said in announcing the ceremony earlier this week. 'They were prepared to fight and die for an America they did not yet fully belong to. I think they've earned their stripes in more ways than one.' He said it is worth celebrating that the U.S. is 'a nation of immigrants.' 'We won this country's freedom together. We built this country together. We defended this country together,' he said. 'It makes us special. It makes us strong. It makes us Americans. That's worth celebrating. And that's what I want not just House Republicans, but all of us, as Americans to remember.' Obama participated in naturalization ceremonies at the White House in 2009, 2010, 2012 and last year. Friday's ceremony will also recognize internationally known celebrity chef Jose Andres for outstanding achievements by a naturalized U.S. citizen. Andres, who is 44 and was born in Spain, became a citizen last November and also will mark his first July Fourth as a citizen. Andres serves on the boards of the DC Central Kitchen and the L.A. Kitchen, in addition to international philanthropic work carried out through his World Central Kitchen. Andres runs restaurants in California, Nevada, Florida, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. He has prepared meals for White House and other Obama administration events, and Obama and the first lady have gone out to dinner at some of his Andres' restaurants in Washington.

QPR have already signed Alex McCarthy from Reading for £6million and Robert Green is their first choice. They recently allowed Brazilian World Cup goalkeeper Julio Cesar to leave for Benfica. Legend: Cech has gone down in history at Stamford Bridge after a glittering career with Chelsea . Appearances: 477 . Clean sheets: 220 . Trophies: . 1x Champions League . 1x Europa League . 3x Premier League . 4x FA Cup . 2x League Cup . 2x Community shield . It is believed that Cech was offered to QPR last week, ahead of them completing the signing of McCarthy from Championship club Reading. Paris Saint-Germain are set to test Cech's resolve to stay in England. They want to bring in the player - as well as Chelsea goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon - and would prefer to do a loan deal as it would help them in meeting UEFA's Financial Fair Play restrictions. PSG were ruled to have breached the rules last season and have been forced to limit transfer expenditure. PSG see Cech as the ideal man to help them win the Champions League, deeming him better than current No 1, Italian Salvatore Sirigu, and would have no problem matching his wages.","Chelsea have offered Petr Cech to Queens Park Rangers .

"Could you imagine living without ever hearing music? Concerts and songs are often taken for granted by many people with full hearing, but its an activity deaf people can't enjoy in the same way. Vodafone recently teamed up with Dutch composer Kyteman to create a song designed specifically to help people who have a limited range of hearing experience a live musical performance. The concert was then performed to 19-year-old Vera van Dijk who was born deaf, and wears a cochlear implant to boost the sounds she can hear. Scroll down for video .

The concert of 400 people was created as part of the Vodafone Firsts scheme. To ensure the sounds were audible to Ms van Dikl, the song was composed from scratch using the frequencies her cochlear implant enables her to hear. Vera started to hear a small number of musical notes when she received the implant two years ago. Because she had limited awareness of the type of music she may like, she asked the public to help her choose the song, via social media. They chose Stay With Me by Sam Smith. Ms van Dijk was also able to lip-read and communicate on her phone, to encourage friends and followers to listen to sample scores of music. This was another first for the teenager, who previously was only able to use a mobile phone to communicate by text. Before the concert Vera took part in one physical and one virtual recording session with Kyteman. The first, in Kyteman’s studio, was shared via a video call with her brother Kasper, who is a musician himself. The virtual studio session, took place on Vera’s phone, helping Kyteman to fine-tune his composition, which was played by an 18-piece orchestra, to match Vera’s hearing abilities.

"Lolo Jones was once one of the sporting world's most clean-cut stars, announcing on Twitter earlier this year that strong religious beliefs have kept her virginity in tact. But it has been revealed that the 30-year-old Olympic hurdler is in the midst of a nasty catfight with her own Team USA peers Dawn Harper and Kellie Wells, who verbally attacked Miss Jones on television this morning. Ms . Harper, 28, and Ms Wells, 30, who finished second and third respectively in . yesterday's Olympic 100m women's hurdles final, spoke bitterly about Miss Jones, who finished in . fourth place. Ms Harper said during an interview on NBC Sports, that Miss Jones is the media's 'favourite' and that her own life story is just as interesting as that of her heavily-hyped peer, who posed nude for ESPN the magazine in 2009. Rivals: Team USA track stars Dawn Harper (left) and Kellie Wells (below) have revealed there is a war between themselves and Lolo Jones (right). The pair have admitted they resent Miss Jones for hogging the limelight . At war: Kellie Wells (above) said this morning that the girls who earned their medals 'got them' in the end . Ms Harper said: 'Because their favorite [Miss Jones] didn't win all of a sudden . it's just like, ""We're going to push your story aside, and still gonna . push this one"". That hurt.' Michelle . Beadle, the show's host, then clarified the situation for the audience: . 'We're talking about Lolo Jones if you can't figure this out'. Ms Wells also spoke about Miss Jones, who has gained plenty of attention since outing herself as a virgin on Twitter earlier this year, during the interview. She said: 'Well, I think . that, on the podium tonight, the three girls that earned their spot, that got their medals and they worked hard and did what they needed to . do, prevailed. And that's all that really needs to be said.' At war: Ms Wells (left) and Ms Harper (middle) both expressed that there is serious tension among Team USA . Her side: Miss Jones (right) told Savannah Guthrie (left) this morning that the media 'ripped her to shreds' Miss Jones said on HBO's Real Sports in May that staying a virgin is  'harder than training for the Olympics'. She added that being a virgin is 'the hardest thing I've ever done in my life… harder than graduating from college'. 'When . I was 22, 24, it was cute,' she said. 'But 24 to 29, it's not cute. You . get judged a lot, a lot of guys won't return your calls after they find . out.' Ms Harper added that her own life story deserves the same type of attention Miss Jones' has attracted. She said: 'I feel I had a pretty good . story - knee surgery two months before Olympic trials in 2008, to make . the team by 0.007, not have a contract, working three jobs, living in a . frat house, trying to make it work. She continued: 'Coming off running in someone else's shoes, getting the gold medal. I'd say I was pretty interesting.' Success: Ms Wells (left) and Ms Harper (right) celebrated their achievements after yesterday's hurdles final . Defeat: Miss Jones (in furthest lane) was beaten by her outspoken Team USA teammates as well as Australia's Sally Pearson (front of picture) who won gold in the race . The host was clearly floored by her . guests' comments, simply telling the camera: 'Wow... you can cut the . tension in here with a knife.' Earlier . this morning, Miss Jones, a devout Christian who also appeared on the . cover of Outside magazine this year in a skimpy swimming costume that . resembled a strip of ribbon, emotionally attacked the media herself on . the Today show. During an interview with the show's co-host Savannah Guthrie, she spoke of her heartbreak over an article published by The New York Times . on August 4 which said: 'She will be whatever anyone wants her to be - vixen, . virgin, victim - to draw attention to herself and the many products she . endorses.' The article also read: 'She has played into the persistent, demeaning notion that women are worthy as athletes only if they have sex appeal.' It also included a quote from Ms Harper who admitted that she is surprised to learn how open Miss Jones has proved when it comes to her personal life. Regrets: Olympic hurdling star Lolo Jones featured on the Today show yesterday as well, above. She told host Savannah Guthrie that maybe she should 'zip it' when it comes to discussing her virginity . Contender: She competed in yesterday's hurdles final after running 12.68 seconds in her heat, above . She said: 'I've had family issues as . well, but I'm not willing to say all of them just so it can be in the . papers. I don't want that for myself or my family.' Miss Jones, who is actually named Lori, said this morning through tears: 'The fact that it [the article] was from a U.S. media... I mean they should be supporting our U.S. Olympic athletes. 'They just ripped me to shreds and I just . thought that was crazy because I worked six days a week every day for . four years for a 12-second race and the fact that they just tore me . apart... it was just heartbreaking.' She added: 'I think it's such a shame I have to deal with so much backlash.' The star, from Louisiana, . said just yesterday that she is thinking twice about discussing her . virginity so openly, obviously attracting further headlines. She told Ms Guthrie on another episode of Today that she should perhaps 'zip it' when it comes to discussing her religious beliefs. The . exotic beauty claimed that she was surprised her confession attracted so . much attention. She said: 'This is my path and I was just sharing my . life'. The Iowa-born star, who took part in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, has been linked to Tim Tebow in the past, but mainly due to their shared Christian beliefs. Glamour girl: Miss Jones, pictured left in New York in June, 2011 and right in Los Angeles in August, 2011, said in May that remaining a virgin is 'harder than training for the Olympics'. She has been linked to Tim Tebow . She was quick to quash the . rumours, responding on Twitter: 'I actually heard Tebow . has a girlfriend he just isn't saying it publicly. The search . continues…’ It was on Twitter earlier this year where she first announced to her almost 55,000 fans that she was a virgin. She said: 'I do not have a hard time finding dates . but I do have a hard time finding a guy that I want to date that has . good morals, that's willing to wait.' Miss Jones told Women's Health magazine in 2010 that she listens to 'a lot of Christian music' to help calm her during training seasons. Miss Jones also revealed that she has tried using various online dating sites, as well as Twitter, in an attempt to seek out a boyfriend. She also said on the program that she has grown accustomed to being rejected by men as a result of her beliefs. She . said: 'Here's the two things that happen when you tell a guy you're a . virgin, this is the honest truth. One, you tell them [and they say] ""oh . ok, I respect that"". But you can already see in their eyes [that they're . thinking] ""she's lying about this and I'll crack it"". Confessions: She spoke in detail about her personal life - and virginity - on Real Sports, which aired in May . Conquer: The star is seen at the end of yesterday's heat, learning that she had qualified for the 100m final . 'So we'll talk usually one to three months [later], then they're like ""oh shoot, she was serious"". Time for me to exit.' The athlete also jokes about how she would like to be the next 'candidate' for a sequel to the film The 40-Year-Old Virgin. 'I'm a little bit awkward like Steve Carell,' she said. 'I could definitely play that role... I would love to.' The cover model athlete was left heartbroken after her performance at the 2008 Olympics. She . had been leading the final of the women's 100-metre hurdle competition . before clipping the second-to-last hurdle on the home stretch. She finished seventh in the race. On the flip side, she told Allure magazine just last month that Beijing had helped her finally feel pride for her body. She admitted that 'growing up, I felt insecure about my build. I didn't feel very feminine'. Miss Jones admitted to Real Sports that she has been tempted to have sex in the past. Cover girl: She appeared on the cover of Spikes magazine in 2010 (left) and Outside magazine (right) as well . 'I've had plenty of opportunities… please understand this journey has been hard,' she said. 'I just don't believe in it… it's a gift I want to give to my husband.' Miss Jones, who has trained 'four to six hours a day, six days a week' for the past 12 years, was raised amid less than perfect conditions. She and her family were forced to live in the basement of a Salvation Army at one stage of her life, due to financial hardships. She revealed that her family once used food stamps to purchase staple items such as cheese and beans in supermarkets. She is not the only female Olympic star to have spoken of her religious beliefs so openly. Jennifer Nichols, a 28-year-old archer from Wyoming opened up just last month about her . decision to remain celibate before marriage. She told Us Weekly magazine: ''I saved my first kiss for the man I knew I was going to marry - my . fiance. I made that commitment when I was . about 13 years old.'","Olympic hurdler Lolo Jones, 30, declared that she was a virgin on Twitter earlier this year .

"American families may soon be using waterless toilets and recycling their urine, according to new research. Chemical engineers at the University of Florida have been looking at ways to extract phosphorus - a life-sustaining element - from urine, before it enters the sewage system and becomes diluted. Since estimates suggest that phosphorous - which occurs as phosphate rocks and is mined for crop fertilizer - could be exhausted in the next 50 to 100 years, urine recycling may be the key to conserving the non-renewable resource in the future. Natural resource: Scientists at the University of Florida say waterless toilets, which make it easier for life-sustaining element phosphorus to be extracted from urine - may be installed in U.S. homes in the future . Phosphorus, an element we take into our bodies in the form of phosphates from foods like bran, cheese and nuts, is essential for human health, . especially for bones and teeth. According to Healthaliciousness.com, a phosphorus deficiency can lead to lost appetite, anemia, muscle pain, rickets and a weakened immune system. But with the extensive mining of phosphate rocks for crop fertilizer, it risks becoming scarce in the near future - an issue the scientists at the University of Florida sought to address in their research. Under lab conditions, the researchers were able to successfully extract about 97per cent of the phosphates in urine within five minutes. They achieved the extraction with a scientific technique called ion-exchange using HAIX resin, which may form the basis of systems to be installed in U.S. homes in the future. David Brown, chief executive of the Institution of Chemical Engineers, said of the findings: 'Our attitude and whole approach to recycling will need to change as we come under increasing pressure to conserve valuable, non-renewable resources like Phosphorus. 'The research is another great example of chemical engineers providing alternative approaches and solutions to the creation of more sustainable approaches to issues like waste water management and recycling.' If urine-extracting toilets actually came into use, it wouldn't be the first time we have utilized our bodily functions in such a way. According to ABC.net, ancient cultures in Greece and Asia commonly used their own urine to provide nutrients to fertilize crops. And in parts of Europe, phosphate extraction from human urine is already underway. In 2002, the tiny Swedish town of Tanum launched an initiative requiring homes to only have 'urine-separating' toilets, to help combat the future global shortage of phosphorus.","Phosphorus, which occurs naturally and is mined from phosphate rocks for crop fertilizer, may run out in the next 50 to 100 years .
Urine also contains a high level of phosphorus .
Introducing waterless toilets, so that phosphates may be more easily extracted from urine, may be the key to saving this non-renewable resource ."
"Peter Moores has warned England’s under-achieving one-day cricketers that no one’s place is safe after the series defeat by India and he is considering making key changes just five months before the World Cup. The crushing 3-1 loss, alleviated slightly by a much improved performance at Headingley on Friday, means England will shuffle their pack ahead of the series in Sri Lanka in November in another attempt to find a winning one-day formula. It remains highly unlikely England will replace Alastair Cook at this stage, even though Moores refused to guarantee that a captain who has spent most of the summer defending his position will lead the side in Australia and New Zealand. Cuts: Peter Moores is ready to wield the axe and rid England of its under-performing players . Yet while Cook probably stays, others who may not make the cut include Ian Bell, Harry Gurney, Gary Ballance and perhaps even Eoin Morgan, who is under pressure when he leads the Twenty20 side against India at Edgbaston today. England will consider bringing back Ravi Bopara and James Taylor, while Reece Topley has emerged as a left-arm alternative to Gurney and Samit Patel, persona non grata under the Andy Flower regime, has support for a return. It is hardly ideal to still be in a state of flux so close to the most important competition in limited-overs cricket but England know changes have to be made even though they displayed a glimpse of their potential in Leeds. Danger: Ian Bell, Gary Ballance and Eoin Morgan are all in danger of being dropped from the England squad . Moores, who told his squad of his expectations after Friday’s win, is adamant there is nothing wrong with a game plan that has been derided as outdated by high-profile critics such as Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan but it is the execution of those plans that needs improving. Bopara was unlucky to be left out of the India series but it has become clear that his omission was far from terminal and he will be given the chance to prove that he can bat in the top six and become England’s sixth rather than fifth bowler. It remains a mystery why Taylor, who scored 114 for Notts in the One-Day Cup semi-final yesterday, has not had many more opportunities in all formats but, like Bopara, he may be handed a chance to show what he can do both today in Birmingham and in the seven-match 50-over series in Sri Lanka. Gurney looks too one-dimensional to have a long-term future in international cricket and, with Moores wanting a left-arm seamer, a late chance could come for Topley ahead of Chris Wood as long as he is fully fit. World Cup: England need to make major changes if they are to stand any chance at the World Cup . Perhaps the biggest issue facing England is the woeful form of their key one-day batsman Morgan, who is in desperate need of a big score today to ease concerns about his form. It is becoming clear that, when England do decide the time is right to replace Cook as captain, Joe Root is the favourite to take over in all forms of the game, probably usurping Morgan as captain-elect in one-day as well as Test cricket. The selectors will consider their options over the next two weeks before naming a squad for Sri Lanka that, barring the injured Stuart Broad, will go on to the World Cup. ‘It’s been extremely disappointing,’ said Morgan of a barren run that goes back to his brilliant century against Australia in Brisbane in January. ‘I’ve worked incredibly hard this year but I’ve been light on runs. Series: England 3-1 defeat to India in their one-day series highlighted the need for change . ‘I’ve been finding different ways to get out. I’ve gone through periods like this and I’ve always come back so I’m confident I will this time.’ It will be fascinating to see how the big-hitting Jason Roy performs today but he remains a big outsider for a World Cup place, not least because England are conscious of the massive gap between international and county cricket. It is naive to expect a batsman who can whack the ball in the domestic game to instantly produce the goods at the highest level against two new white balls in international one-day cricket. The difficulties in stepping up have been highlighted by Alex Hales, who was quickly worked out by India’s bowlers in the one-day series and has to counter tactics which have stifled his natural desire to stay leg-side of the ball and hit through the off side. Despite Hales’s success in international Twenty20 cricket, his example will make England wary of promoting too many county form horses for the World Cup even though they are open to late change.","Peter Moores ready to wield the axe before the World Cup .

"If the U.S. soccer team were hoping for the home advantage during Saturday's Gold Cup final then they were in for a nasty surprise. Despite being the 'home' side in California's Rose Bowl stadium, the majority of fans - most of them American born of naturalized Mexicans - booed and jeered the U.S. team. The surprising scenes were followed by angry outbursts from U.S. team goalkeeper Tim Howard, who was visibly shaken after the entire post match ceremony was conducted in Spanish. Divided: Despite the good natured banter of the crowd, the U.S. team was visibly shaken by the consistent booing from the Mexican support . Outnumbered: Support from Americans with Mexican origins vastly outnumbered those cheering for the 'home' team . Speaking after the game, Howard said: '[tournament organisers] CONCACAF should be ashamed of themselves. 'I think it was a [expletive] disgrace that the entire post match ceremony was in Spanish. 'You can bet your ass that if we were in Mexico City, it wouldn't be all in English. 'It never ceases to amaze me all that stuff.' Tempering his comments, the ex-Manchester United keeper added: 'It was a good crowd today. 'They were up for it, doing the wave, it was what we expected. We know it's going to be like this.' Speaking to the LA Times, Mexican supporter Victor Sanchez said: 'I love this country, it has given me everything that I have, and I'm proud to be part of it.' The 37-year-old Monrovia resident reflected the sentiment of most of the 93,000 strong crowd when he added: 'But yet, I didn't have a choice to come here, I was born in Mexico, and that is where my heart will always be.'

'Obviously … the support that Mexico has on the night like tonight makes it a home game for them. 'It's part of something we have to deal with on the night.'

South rises: In many South states, the Hispanic . population has doubled on ten years ago, with Hispanics outstripping . whites for the first time in New Mexico - 46 to 40 per cent . It . is the first time that this has been the case and the change reflects a . growing age divide between mostly white, older Americans and . predominantly minority youths that could reshape government policies. Preliminary . census estimates also show the share of African-American households . headed by women - made up of mostly single mothers - now exceeds . African-American households with married couples, a sign of declining . U.S. marriages overall but also continuing challenges for black youths . without involved fathers.

"Republican Rep. Peter King said Sunday that President Barack Obama should take the threat of expatriates turned jihadists returning home to commit acts of terrorism as seriously as British Prime Minister David Cameron. King, a member of the House of Representatives' Intelligence committee and the former chair of it's Homeland Security committee, said that 'the United States is always the main target of these terrorist organizations,' so he is 'very concerned' about an attack from Islamic radicals. 'And i would say, I wish our president was showing the same leadership that David Cameron showed,' he added. 'What is President Obama waiting for?' President Barack Obama and Rep. Peter King of New York walk down the steps of the House following a St. Patricks Day luncheon at the Capitol in March. King, a Republican, said Sunday he wishes Obama were more like British Prime Minister David Cameron . On Friday Cameron raised his country's terror threat level to 'severe' - the second highest alert level in Britain's five category system - for the first time in three years. In making the announcement, Cameron called the Islamic State a 'greater and deeper threat to our security than we have known before.' 'People are rightly concerned about so-called foreign fighters who travel from Britain to Syria and Iraq, taken part in terrorist acts, and now come back to threaten our security here at home,' he said. 'And the scale of this threat is growing.' The White House opted not to issue it's own terror advisory ahead of the Labor Day holiday, saying: 'We don’t at this point see a reason to change the threat level in this country.' Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement that his agency was 'unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland.' Rather, 'violent extremists who support ISIL have demonstrated the intent and capability to target American citizens overseas, and ISIL constitutes an active and serious threat within the region,' he said. Johnson assured Americans that DHS had beefed up security at airports throughout the past few weeks, just like its counterparts across the pond, and said the U.S. had 'taken a series of steps to track foreign fighters who travel in and out of Syria.' In a . segment with King on CBS' Face the Nation news program on Sunday . morning, Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat and the ranking member on the House . Armed Services Committee, reiterated that 'there's no evidence at this . point,' that ISIS is planning specific attacks against 'Western targets . like Al Qaeda was...almost a decade before 9/11.' 'These . groups, they don't need an excuse, they will attack us whenever they . can,' King countered. 'The longer we wait, the more dangerous ISIS . becomes.' House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers voiced similar concerns on Fox News Sunday. 'I'm very concerned because we don't know every single person who has gone and trained and learned how to fight,' he said. Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron walks to Parliament on Monday.

"A young father who lost all four of his limbs when a common cold turned into a flesh-eating bug has endured a  20-hour operation to rebuild his lips. Alex Lewis, 34, lost his arms, legs and parts of his face to a deadly virus but has now had his face transformed using flesh from his shoulder. The quadruple amputee underwent two days of gruelling surgery to open his mouth back up and give him back his lips. Mr Lewis spent six hours in the operating theatre at Salisbury District Hospital while surgeon Dr Alexandra Crick opened up his mouth and stitched in a temporary sponge foam. Scroll down for video . Alex Lewis, 34, lost all four of his limbs as well as his lips when a common cold turned into a flesh-eating bug last November . The father-of-one has now undergone a 20-hour operation to rebuild his lips using flesh from his shoulder . His lips were then built up using flesh from his shoulder and two veins were fused into his artery so his new flesh has its own blood supply. Extra skin was finally stitched onto the left side of his mouth, which will be removed in two weeks if there are no problems with the healing process. The new skin around Mr Lewis’ lips will eventually turn the same colour as his face, the skin will shrink and there will be no scarring. The operation left Mr Lewis ‘petrified’ but he said he is now confident that one day he will smile again. Mr Lewis, who lives in Stockbridge, Hampshire, with wife Lucy and their three-year-old son Sam, said: ‘This feels like an incredible step forward to the end result. ‘I feel now the worst is over and I can now look forward to the healing process of my face changing. ‘I know it will look like me, just with a few cuts and bruises along the way. ‘But I have never felt so scared. I was absolutely petrified. ‘I could see the puffiness of my lips and the big flap of skin on the left hand side of my mouth and thought ""my God"". The former pub landlord (pictured with his wife Lucy and son Sam) credits his family and friends for their support over the last nine months . ‘It started a complete mind melt down. I started tripping about where I was, I couldn’t wake up, I couldn’t stay awake, I couldn’t move, I couldn’t focus. ‘That series of different nightmares went on for hours.’ In November, Mr Lewis battled against the odds to make a remarkable recovery after doctors gave him a three per cent chance of survival. Doctors were forced to amputate both legs above the knee as well as his left arm, when a Strep A infection developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome. Group A streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin. The vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses, such as strep throat and impetigo. Occasionally, however, the bacteria can become life-threatening if it enters parts of the body where it is not usually found - such as the blood, muscles or the lungs. The bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores. Invasive group A streptococcal disease, which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body’s defences, is a severe and sometimes life-threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs. Two of the most severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal disease are called necrotising fasciitis (infection of muscle and fat tissue) and toxic shock syndrome (a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs). The early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site.The early symptoms of toxic shock syndrome may include fever, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, rash and abdominal pain. He lost his lips to the deadly bug and spent a week in a coma as the deadly bacteria wreaked havoc through his body. But he said this latest operation has been one of the toughest for him to come to terms with. He said: ‘It’s the strangest thing, when it comes to limb loss, you can cope with it. ‘It is something you can adapt to because you know long-term you will walk again and you will use your arms again in some form. ‘When it comes to facial reconstruction or facial disfigurement, I think vanity gets the better of you. ‘I started thinking ""what does Lucy see now?"" Physically it’s not all there. There are vast amounts missing. That’s very hard to get your head around. ‘I think following the latest surgery the level of my disfigurement became apparent. ‘It was the shock factor. I didn’t know I’d wake up to this face and then it suddenly became everything. ‘I got used to having such a small mouth for so long so to wake up and find I’ve now got skin everywhere all over my face, felt very alien. I just didn’t look like me any more. ‘I saw my mouth opening and thought ""wow, that’s amazing, I’ve got my mouth back"". ‘I shut my eyes and thought ""great, I can eat whenever I want"" but then I thought of noodles. ‘I love noodles but I can’t twist a fork around for noodles because I haven’t got a hand. ‘I felt so deflated by that one notion of not being able to eat noodles properly. ‘I soon snapped out though. I was guilty of thinking about the here and now rather than what the future holds for me. ‘And you can’t underestimate the effects of the anaesthetic.' In six months he will undergo more surgery to chisel in the shape of his lips and shadow lines before having the texture tattooed on. Mr Lewis says he hopes people will appreciate the level of surgery and skill that was undertaken to build his new mouth, although he admits he finds he finds looking at pictures of his new lips 'funny in a macabre way'. He is pictured following the first stage  when surgeons attached foam to help create his new lips . Mr Lewis (pictured with son Sam) wants his photos to be published so he can be a role model to his son and send a positive message to others with facial disfigurements . Mr Lewis wants his photos to be published so that he can be a role model to his son Sam. He said: ‘I think a lot of people I know will thankfully appreciate the level of surgery and the skill that was undertaken in it all, and they won’t just see two huge puffy lips. ‘It is quite comical to look at. I do find it funny in a macabre kind of way, a weird funny. ’I won’t shy away from it though. It will affect me at times and I’m sure I’ll see myself in the mirror and think ""look at the state of that"" but that’s part of it. ‘I want my son to be proud of me and at ease in his skin and with everything he does. ‘You have no clue what life is going to throw at you and you have to deal with it as it comes. ‘I don’t want him to stress about the little things in life.' He added that the experience has made him less concerned about body image. He said: ‘I am far more comfortable in my skin now than I ever was. Extra skin was sown on to the lips, which will be removed soon if the healing process goes to plan . ‘I always tried to look my best when I went out but I won’t ever miss those days again. I have got a whole different view on vanity now. ‘I used to have body issues. I used to hate my legs, which is ironic because I haven’t got any now. I don’t have those fears any more or those worries.' The support of family and friends has been integral to his recovery over the last nine months, as setback after setback left him feeling like he was ‘falling to the ground’. Mr Lewis said: ‘The way my life is in this whole interesting chapter; losing arms, legs, skin grafts, dialysis, everything that can possibly be chucked at me, I can only describe it like I was falling to the ground really quickly. ‘But the people around me are like a huge parachute and as the process has gone on, the parachute has come out making sure I don’t fall to the ground.' And though nervous about people’s reactions to his new face, he is looking forward to showing off the impressive surgery to the outside world and sending a positive message to others with facial disfigurements. He said: ‘This whole process has made me see what I’ve got which is just so amazing. ‘Of course I wish I didn’t have to go through this to find what I have but I have changed for the better as a result. ‘And every hour of surgery, every hour of rehab, every minute of looking at the ceiling thinking when can I go, when can I leave, what’s it going to be like when I go, will be worth it because if it enhances my life in that way, then that’s something.’ He added that his ordeal has grounded him and given him a valuable sense of perspective as well as vast amounts of hope for the future. He said: ‘I have a clearer perspective on what things are all about now. I certainly won’t look at other things in such disastrous proportions. 'At this moment I am 100 per cent at ease with myself and I don’t feel concerned for what the future holds. I think the future is good.' Mr Lewis has set up the Al Lewis Trust to raise money for rehabilitation costs and help other civilian amputees.

"Fired: Frank Phillips, 47, pictured, was been found 'unsuitable for continued employment,' according to a termination notice posted Sunday night on the Knox County Sheriff's Office's website . A sheriff's deputy in Knox County, Tennessee has been fired after he was caught on camera allegedly choking a university student Saturday night. Frank Phillips, 47, was been found 'unsuitable for continued employment,' according to a termination notice posted Sunday night on the Knox County Sheriff's Office's website. 'In my 34 years of law enforcement experience, excessive force has never been tolerated. After an investigation by the Office of Professional Standards, I believe excessive force was used in this incident,' Sheriff Jimmy 'J.J.' Jones said. 'Therefore, Officer Phillips' employment with the Knox County Sheriff's Office is terminated immediately.' Jones added that the investigation will now be turned over to the Knox County Attorney General's Office to determine any further action. John Messner, a freelance photographer in Knoxville, captured Phillips with both hands around the neck of University of Tennessee student Jarod Dotson in Fort Sanders after a party. The 21-year-old can be seen falling to his knees after the man's grip apparently renders him unconscious. Phillips has been with the Sheriff's Office since 1992. Dotson, of Powell, is an architecture major at the college. Authorities say Dotson was publicly intoxicated and drinking from a cup 'that had an odor of an alcoholic beverage' at 23rd Street and Laurel Avenue, when he was arrested. He was charged with public intoxication and resisting arrest. He was released Sunday morning on a $500 bond, the sheriff's office said. Use of force: The officer begins to choke the student, Jarod Dotson, center, or activate some kind of pressure point to render him unconscious . Three to one: The young man did not resist arrest, according to the photographer who shot the images . College party: As he's handcuffed, the student's knees begin to buckle as he loses consciousness . The report said Dotson ignored 'repeated . instructions' to go inside and apparently 'began to physically resist . officers' instructions to place his hands behind his back, and at one . point grabbed on to an officer's leg.' University . of Tennessee Police officers called for backup after the party 'became . unruly' and some of the approximately 800 partygoers began throwing beer . bottles, Knoxville Police Department Sgt. Mike McCarter told . knoxnews.com. UT . student Nicolas Oramas told wate.com of the party: 'When the cops . showed up we saw people throwing bottles at their cars. They had police . dogs out there.' His officers responded at 11:56 p.m. to the 'disturbance,' which was spilling into the street. McCarter . said estimated 60 officers from three agencies were present at the . party, where at least 10 people were arrested and charged with public . intoxication and/or disorderly conduct. Distressing: The officer's hands are still on the student's neck even as he passes out . Incapacitated: The young man sinks to the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back . Messner . captured the frightening moment in a sequence of photographs that show . the young man complying with Knox County deputies as they lead him to a . police van at the University of Tennessee, before an officer uses two . hands to choke the student until he is unconscious. Dotson was arrested, along with a number of friends, during a wild college party celebrating after a week of finals. Police . were called to clear the area at the intersection of 21st and Laurel . Streets in Fort Sanders, an area with a high concentration of college . students. According . to photographer John Messner, some college students began to throw beer . bottles at police, who called for backup from the Knox County Sheriff's . office. Dotson was arrested and handcuffed, then walked a block to a waiting police van at the University of Tennessee. Wild party: College students celebrating the end of finals spilled out onto the street Saturday night and police were called to clear the area . Unresisting: Dotson, seen here before the alleged assault, does not appear to resist as police remove one set of handcuffs to replace them with another . Threatening: An officer much larger than the student, who still has his hands behind his back, approaches and lays his hands on the young man's neck . He went willingly and did not resist arrest, said Messner. When . they got to the police van, the arresting deputy's handcuffs were . removed from the young man's wrists and replaced with cuffs from the . vehicle. During the brief moment his wrists were uncuffed, Dotson let his arms fall by his sides. As two officers twist his arms behind his back, another deputy walks in front of the young man and wraps his hands around his neck. The disturbing sequence of shots show the 21-year-old appear to lose consciousness, his knees buckling as he sinks to the ground, while the deputy continues to choke him or activate a pressure point that renders him unconscious. The officers behind Dotson fiddle with his handcuffs even as he's being choked.

Student: Dotson, pictured left and right, is a student at the University of Tennessee . When . the young man was unconscious, the police picked him up and the officer . who choked him slapped him around the head a few times before walking . off, reports Messner. All three officers are Knox County deputies assisting the Knoxville Police Department. In . 2011, Knoxville County officers stopped a carload of teenagers and . forced them to run in circles around a bat he kept in the trunk of the . car. Sherriff Jimmy 'JJ' Jones demoted the five officers involved in the incident. Jones' action in disciplining the officers was well-received by the community.

"She said the lady was not for turning on Greece - but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has in fact made a sharp U-turn and now wants to stop Athens from leaving the eurozone at all costs. 'For the German leader, it is essential to avoid the consequences of a Grexit before national elections next year,' said influential national news magazine Der Spiegel today. 'Merkel has already made up her mind. After long hesitation, she has sided with French President Francois Hollande and the European Commission. Scroll down for video . Could it be worse than 2008? Mrs Merkel, pictured at the Bundestag today, is very concerned about the affect a 'Grexit' could have on the German economy . 'The report from the troika - which . consists of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and . the European Central Bank and which departed on its fact-finding tour . last week - will undoubtedly conclude that Greece can remain in the . eurozone.' Sources . close to the chancellery say Mrs Merkel fears a worse impact on the . German economy if Greece is forced out than the fallout from the . collapse of the American bank Lehman Brothers in 2008. Crunch talks: Mrs Merkel and Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras in Berlin last month, shortly before the German leader's change of heart . That implosion cost Germany five per cent of its GDP and hundreds of thousands of jobs. Der . Spiegel added: 'Until recently, Merkel was prepared to drop the country . if it failed to meet its commitments. 'She now regards a Greek . departure from the eurozone as entailing too many risks. 'But the political costs are also too high for Merkel. 'If Greece withdrew from the eurozone, her advisers fear that this could mean that it would eventually be necessary to create a common ""debt union"" to stabilise problem countries like Italy and Spain. 'It would be a paradoxical situation: Germany would take a hard-line approach with Greece, but might subsequently have to accept jointly issued euro bonds, which German voters widely oppose.' The ECB's controversial decision last Thursday to purchase, if necessary, unlimited quantities of sovereign bonds from struggling eurozone member states has chilled the hearts of German voters - some 54 per cent of people oppose the move, according to a poll published today. Mrs Merkel, who has been widely criticised for wanting to lead Europe without a concrete plan to do so, is facing further criticism for her U-turn on Greece. Great risks: If Greece left from the eurozone, it might eventually be necessary to create a common 'debt union' to stabilise problem countries like Italy and Spain . The future's orange: The chancellor looked worried at the first session of the budget 2013 debate in Berlin . Der Spiegel added; 'So the chancellor has made up her mind, and will now continue to muddle along as usual. The problem will be put on ice for now, and re-addressed sometime after the 2013 Bundestag election - when the current rescue program has ended. 'It's clear, though, that it will probably take decades for cash-strapped Greece to modernize itself. The risks and possible side effects of Merkel's approach are obvious. Once Greece receives more money, the danger increases that the government in Athens will postpone its promised reforms. It wouldn't be the first time.' 'Muddling along': Mrs Merkel, pictured shaking hands with her finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, has been criticised for wanting to lead Europe without a concrete plan to do so . The magazine went on: 'When Greek Prime Minister Samaras visited Berlin recently, he was left in the dark about the degree to which the Germans' view has changed. Instead, Merkel announced internally that it was necessary to continue to exert maximum pressure on the prime minister so he would implement the required reforms. At the same time, she praised her counterpart from Athens.' Mrs Merkel said that Samaras is playing a 'historic role' for his country, adding that she was very impressed with what he had to say. 'We have to give him a chance,' she said. 'And Merkel intends to see that he soon gets his opportunity. Her plan calls for the troika's report to present the situation in Greece as less disastrous than previously expected, as this is a necessary prerequisite for disbursement of the next tranche of aid.' She told her staff last week: 'We have to find a solution,' Mrs Merkel is said to be optimistic that they will eventually go along with her approach. The IMF statutes may be strict, but the agreements with aid recipients - in this case Greece - nevertheless offer a great deal of leeway. Der Spiegel added: 'Merkel, whose father was a pastor in communist Eastern Germany, has suddenly discovered a deep affection for the downtrodden people of Greece. She compassionately expressed empathy for 'what many in Greece have to suffer', and said 'it does make one's heart bleed.' We can't afford to cast Greece out: Mrs Merkel believes the cautious electorate will soon come around to her way of thinking . This is code for her and her ministers being acutely aware that if Greece falls, Germany will have to pay - and the bill will come to almost exactly €62billion euros: the sum Greece owes the Fatherland. New take: Mrs Merkel has now sided with French President Francois Hollande, pictured and the European Commission . Of course, that would not be the end of the euro tragedy: to protect the remaining financially weak countries like Portugal and Ireland, along with Spain and Italy, hundreds of billions of euros would have to be mobilised. Spiegel went on to say that 'Merkel is keeping her eye on the ""big picture"".' The chancellor reportedly feels that the EU cannot afford to allow democracy to falter in a member state. She also points out that Greece is a NATO member and an important ally in the eastern Mediterranean - a region that has enough flashpoints as it is. 'Her new, lenient approach has the advantage that it could allow her to reach the election next September without the turbulence of a Greek exit from the monetary union,' said the magazine. 'In return, she is prepared to play for high stakes. 'She is putting off dealing with Greece until sometime in the future.' If she's lucky, the Greeks will have got back on their feet by then, and will need less money because the reforms pursued in their country will have finally proven effective. If she's unlucky, Merkel will be plugging holes by making new ones elsewhere - and it may all come to a head once the election is over. 'Another possibility is that the Greek economy performs so poorly that the money runs out before the rescue package expires. This would be the worst-case scenario for Merkel. Nevertheless, she is consciously taking this risk. She sees it as manageable - unlike a Greek exit from the eurozone.'

"A mother feasted on sponges and sand after developing insatiable cravings for both throughout her pregnancies. Kelly-Marie Pearce’s strange 20-a-day habit saw her munch her way through thousands of washing-up sponges, washed down with piles of sand when she was pregnant with baby Lola and son Lucian. But despite her fondness for the bizarre snack - which she would often stack together to make sponge and sand sandwiches -  both her children were born healthy and unharmed. Mrs Pearce, 28, from Wolverhampton, said: 'It tasted really good at the time.' Kelly-Marie Pearce, 28, with her two children Lucian, 4, left, and Lola-Ruby, 7-months-old, right. Mrs Pearce  feasted on sponges and sand after developing insatiable cravings for both throughout her pregnancies . 'It was really satisfying. It was exactly what I needed. I was getting through bowls and bowls of sand a day. I wasn’t eating anything else but sand and sponges. 'It’s like when you really fancy a bit of chocolate and you finally get a piece and its so satisfying.' The full-time mum suffered from Pica disorder throughout the pregnancies, which causes victims to crave objects that are not food. Her unusual cravings started five months into her first pregnancy with Lucian, now four, and were sparked when her mother-in-law was changing the sand in her parrot’s cage. She explained: 'I kept getting this weird taste in my mouth. I knew I was craving something but could not put my finger on what until I saw the sand and that’s when I knew I wanted it. 'Then when I saw her change the sand in the parrot’s cage I thought ""I could just eat that"" and I asked her if I could have some and I started eating it. She thought it was mad but let me carry on.' When sand didn’t hit the spot, she turned to sponges and scoffed her way through packets a day and even combined the two to make sponge sand-wiches. 'I was in the bath one day and I looked at the sponge. It was new and I just started eating it. 'I would have a small bite then chew it for a bit until it went soft. I even dipped them in the sand - it tasted really good,' she added. The bizarre craving saw her chomp on 5,000 washing-up sponges and sacks of sand while she was expecting. But both her children were born healthy and unharmed . 'Then I started eating washing up sponges but ripping the rough side off. 'I went through loads and had to keep buying sand from the pet shop and lots of sponges. 'I could not go anywhere without taking sand or sponges with me. It’s very different to your normal pregnancy cravings.' The habit of eating non-edible objects could arise from some sort of deficiency. Some sufferers eat dirt and many of them are found to lack iron, which is present in soil. Others develop the condition because of extreme stress, though it is not clear why. A desire to eat cleaning agents may be linked with obsessive-compulsive disorder or just a liking for fragrances. Pica can lead to dangerous complications in the body's metabolism. One type of treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy with an experienced psychologist. Then when Mrs Pearce fell pregnant again last year with Lola, now seven months old, the crazy cravings returned and she went through the same routine of only eating sand and sponges all over again. Her husband Damian, 31, was worried her diet was harming his unborn children, but when the midwife told them it was fine, his wife continued. 'I couldn’t stop her then. She was completely addicted,'  he said. A spokesperson for Beat, the eating disorders charity, said: 'We do on occasion get people coming to us to say they are suffering from this condition. It doesn’t provide any nutritional intake at all and can have long term health implications. 'Particularly when someone is pregnant, it’s important to provide suitable nutrition for them and the growing baby. 'It’s important that any individual has a well-balanced diet and if they are worried that something like this is affecting them they should seek help at the earliest opportunity. 'It is worth exploring with a good GP to see if there are serious issues that need to be resolved and whether cognitive behavioural therapy might be appropriate. 'We would urge GPs to make themselves more familiar with this condition and other disordered eating patterns so people can get the help they need. 'Obviously the earlier the individual seeks help, the more likely it is that their problem can be overcome.'

"Extradition: Amanda Knox (appearing on NBC News' Today show in September 20, 2013) could be sent to Italy to serve her 28 year and 6 month sentence if the Italian supreme court upholds her guilty conviction for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher . American authorities could have no choice but to hand over Amanda Knox to Italy if her latest appeal fails according to a Harvard law professor - but the ultimate decision still lies with President Obama and his administration. Following her conviction on Thursday by an Italian appeals court for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, Knox, 26, faces a nervous wait to see if the nation's supreme court upholds her sentence of 28-years and six-months. If it does, Italy would then have to seek her extradition under the terms of a 1983 treaty - which would then have to be approved or rejected by US Secretary of State John Kerry and forwarded to the US Department of Justice for processing. However, if the conviction is upheld, Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard University believes that the United States would have little choice but to send her to Italy to serve her sentence. 'The United States seeks extradition of more people than any country in the world. We’re trying to get NSA leaker Edward Snowden back and we’re not going to extradite someone convicted of murder?' he told NBC News. Indeed, even if Secretary Kerry and President Obama refused to extradite the US citizen then Knox would then face the prospect of becoming a virtual prisoner inside America. Guilty: Amanda Knox, pictured in Seattle, today was with her family in America when the guilty verdict was . announced, and right, her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito talking to . lawyers this morning . If she left the country she would be continually under the threat of arrest and deportation to Italy if she travelled to any country with an extradition treaty with Rome. That list currently includes Western Europe, Australia, most of South America and Canada. So far the State Department has refused to be drawn on a position regarding the outcome of the Knox re-trial. Spokesman Patrick Ventrell was asked in March last year what would be the likely decision and only offered that the verdict was still months away. 'We can’t really comment beyond that,' Mr Ventrell told reporters according to the Daily Telegraph. 'We never talk about extradition from this podium in terms of individual cases.' In the immediate aftermath of Thursday's guilty verdict, many legal commentators and Knox's own legal team have consoled themselves with the notion that she is protected under the concept of double jeopardy - which is enshrined in the US Constitution. That means she could not be tried on the same charge twice. But, the US-Italy extradition treaty protects US citizens from prosecution in Italy only against crimes of which the defendant has been tried under in the United States' legal system. Verdict: The Courthouse of Florence reads the guilty verdict of the Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito retrial at the Nuovo Palazzo di Giustizia on January 30, 2014 in Italy . This is not the case with Knox - who has gone through three trials, all in Italy. Furthermore, Dershowitz doubts if Knox even qualifies for double jeopardy because she was found guilty first and her acquittal was heard in an intermediate appeals court. 'If that happened in the U.S., it wouldn't be double jeopardy,' he said. This high profile case though, brings a particular set of problems for the Obama administration because of the high emotions if elicits on both sides of the Atlantic - not just in Italy and America, but in the United Kingdom too. The United States and Italy enjoy a successful extradition relationship, with cooperation high on busting organised crime. Tough decision: Secretary of State John Kerry and the Obama administration would be responsible for either approving or denying an extradition request by the Italian government for Amanda Knox . It would cause a potential diplomatic row should the president and John Kerry choose not to send Knox to Italy if her appeal fail. However, on the flip side, Italy may choose not to anger their most powerful ally over such an emotive case. Knox herself has said that she would not return to Italy and that would only do so, 'kicking and screaming.' Regardless, any decision on whether to extradite the 26-year-old from the U.S. is likely months away, at least. Experts have said it's unlikely that Italy's justice ministry would request Knox's extradition before the verdict is finalized by the country's high court. If the conviction is upheld, a lengthy extradition process would likely ensue, with the U.S. State Department ultimately deciding whether to turn Knox back over to Italian authorities to finish serving her sentence.","Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said that if the conviction is upheld, the US will have to extradite Amanda Knox .

"The Premier League cash cow is set to produce a record £4billion deal when the television broadcast rights for 2016-19 are sold on Tuesday. But Sportsmail can reveal the staggering extent to which the Premier League already dwarfs Europe's other big leagues in terms of TV cash earnings, even before the new deal. England's top flight rakes in so much money that Manchester United earned over three times more than German champions Bayern Munich last season - and even Cardiff City, who finished bottom of the league and were relegated, took home double that of the Bundesliga giants. The combined TV earnings from Europe's top leagues last season - led by the Premier League . Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga but earned less from TV than every one of the 20 Premier League clubs . Cardiff were relegated from the Premier League last season but earned twice as much TV money as Bayern . The Bluebirds' limp fight against the drop earned them £62.1million while Pep Guardiola's juggernaught were awarded £27.34m. Just as remarkably, Cardiff also raked in around double the amount of Atletico Madrid, last year's La Liga champions. Diego Simeone's side were just the fourth-top earners in Spain, behind Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia, with £31.12m. United, despite finishing outside of the Premier League's top four, also easily outstripped Bayern. The embarrassment of falling from champions to flops under David Moyes didn't prevent £89.2m from flooding into the coffers at Old Trafford. Perhaps even more staggering is that United and Everton both earned more from the Premier League than the combined total awarded by the Bundesliga to the three teams other than Bayern who qualified for the Champions League. Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke took home a combined £75.88m, while the Toffees pocketed £85m. Liverpool, who finished second, earned far more than Manchester United who struggled under David Moyes . Real Madrid earned more than £100million, the same as Barcelona, but three times as much as rivals Atletico . Atletico Madrid won the La Liga title despite their earnings being dwarfed by rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona . Liverpool (£97.5m) earned the most TV money of any Premier League club last season, despite being pipped by Manchester City (£96.6m) to the title. Chelsea were third-top earners with £94.6m. And all three English giants earned more than the three top-earning clubs in France's Ligue 1 combined. Those French 'minnows' are PSG, Marseille and Lyon. The money awarded to English clubs is, strictly speaking, derived from Premier League central funds. The vast majority of this is TV money, but each club is also awarded £4,270,850 from central commercial income. That includes revenue from the likes of Barclays' sponsorship of the league and Nike, who sponsor the matchballs. Bayern have long been Germany's dominant club but earn only slightly more than Borussia Dortmund . Earnings of close to £30m have not prevented Dortmund facing a relegation battle this season . The huge sums handed down to even the most underachieving Premier League clubs make for staggering reading, but so too does the vast inequality between the haves and have-nots in Spain. Simply, that means Real Madrid and Barcelona on one side and every other club on the other. Real and Barca both trousered a whopping £103.74m last season, which makes them Europe's chief beneficiaries from domestic TV broadcast rights. The five lowest earners in La Liga - Granada, Elche, Valladolid, Rayo Vallecano and Almeria - all took home just £13.34m last term. That means Real and Barca scooped almost eight times more than the Spanish strugglers. By contrast, although each Premier League club is awash with cash, the differential from top to bottom is much fairer. Liverpool were handed 1.6 times more money than Cardiff last season. Juventus continued their domination of Serie A last season, and also earned £10m more than Inter Milan . Spanish daily AS are reporting that the LFP, the body in charge of La Liga and the Spanish second division, want to address the huge gulf between top and bottom by selling their TV rights centrally, rather than letting Real and Barca negotiate their own separate deals. The aim is for the lowest-earning La Liga club to take home no less than £29.7m per season. That would be more than third-placed Valencia were given last season, and more than Bayern and PSG reaped in winning their domestic leagues. But with Sky Sports and BT Sport set to up their bids for Premier League TV broadcast rights amid competition from Discovery and beIN sport, even that figure will look paltry compared with the embarrassment of riches in England. Paris Saint-Germain topped Ligue 1's TV money chart and also topped the table last season .","Liverpool earned £97.5m last season, the most in the Premier League .
Manchester United earned £89.2m, three times that of Bayern Munich .
Bayern won the Bundesliga while United were seventh in Premier League .
Relegated Cardiff earned twice as much as Bayern and Paris Saint-Germain .
Despite winning La Liga, Atletico Madrid rank only fourth in Spain .

"The virus, called 'Flame' is  the third major cyber weapon uncovered after the Stuxnet virus that attacked Iran's nuclear program in 2010, and its data-stealing cousin Duqu, named after the Star Wars villain . A computer virus described as a 'cyber weapon' - the most complex ever created - has been discovered in thousands of computers in the Middle East. The virus, discovered by security experts Kaspersky Labs, marks a new era in cyber warfare. The virus, called 'Flame' is  the third major cyber weapon uncovered after the Stuxnet virus that attacked Iran's nuclear program in 2010, and its data-stealing cousin Duqu, named after the Star Wars villain. The virus is 100 times more complex than normal PC viruses, and designed to steal information - it can even turn on microphones on infected PCs to listen to conversations. All the viruses are so complex they are said to have required the resources of a nation state to create. Many security experts - including U.S. officials - have said that it was likely that Stuxnet was made by the U.S. But Flame is the most complex piece of malicious software discovered to date, said Kaspersky Lab security senior researcher Roel Schouwenberg, whose company discovered the virus. The discovery by one of the world's largest makers of anti-virus software will likely fuel speculation that nations have already secretly deployed other cyber weapons. 'If Flame went on undiscovered for five years, the only logical conclusion is that there are other operations ongoing that we don't know about,' Schouwenberg said in an interview. The Moscow-based company is controlled by Russian malware researcher Eugene Kaspersky, and gained notoriety in cyber weapons research after solving several mysteries surrounding Stuxnet and Duqu. Researchers at Kaspersky said they were only starting to understand how Flame works because it is so complex. The full significance will not be known until other cyber security firms obtain samples of Flame. The Lab's research shows the largest number of infected machines are in Iran, followed by the Israel/Palestine region, then Sudan and Syria. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, center, visits the Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility some 200 miles (322 kilometers) south of the capital, Tehran, Iran . The virus contains about 20 times as much code as Stuxnet, which attacked an Iranian uranium enrichment facility, causing centrifuges to fail. It has about 100 times as much code as a typical virus designed to steal financial information, Kaspersky Labs said. Flame can gather data files, remotely change settings on computers, turn on PC microphones to record conversations, take screen shots and log instant messaging chats. He said there was evidence to suggest the code was commissioned by the same nation or nations that were behind Stuxnet and Duqu, which were built on a common platform. Security experts have detected the malicious software by 'keys' in Stuxnet itself, which appear to be looking for other 'family members' to communicate with. Earlier this year, Kaspersky labs said that Duqu and Stuxnet were part of a 'family' of viruses created in the same place. Duqu - a 'trojan horse' program related to Stuxnet which was detected in industrial systems earlier this year, also searches for Stuxnet and Duqu-infected machines. Duqu is designed to steal information which could be used in cyber attacks on industrial control systems. It's a 'scout' program that could be used in preparation for a crippling cyber attack. Both appear to be searching for three other 'relatives' that have never yet been found.","Third major cyber weapon after attack on nuclear plant .

"No sale: Tracey Trigg, 51, pictured with her son Josh, 24, and daughter Ella, 13, was stopped from buying alcohol twice in a week at an Asda store . Asda checkout staff are blocking parents from buying alcohol if they have their children with them. Although it is legal for anyone over the age of 18 to buy alcohol, over-zealous workers are saying no to parents who take their children shopping with them. And rather than apologising, Asda bosses have backed their staff, saying it is better that they were ‘over cautious’ rather than face prosecution for selling alcohol to under-18s. Most supermarkets have introduced a policy on drink sales where staff are expected to challenge anyone who looks under 25 to prove they are over 18. They are also able to ban shoppers from buying alcohol if there are ‘reasonable grounds’ to believe it might be passed on to someone aged under 18. Supermarket executives have handed the power to police the system to checkout workers, who have autonomy over who they stop and refuse to serve. The issue has been highlighted by  51-year-old mother-of-three Tracey Trigg, from Boston, Lincolnshire, who was stopped from buying drink along with groceries twice in a week at an Asda store. In the first case, she was buying a bottle of wine with some food and was with her 24-year-old university graduate son, Josh, who was helping to carry the bags. The second time she was with Josh and her daughter, Ella, aged 13, who were helping with the shopping, which included some beer and wine for Christmas. Mrs Trigg, who works in social care, said she was twice stopped from making a legal purchase. The first refusal was because Josh had no ID to prove he was over 18, and the second because Ella had no ID. Controversial: Asda bosses claim it is better to be 'over cautious' than to risk prosecution for selling alcohol to under-18s. However Mrs Trigg, right, claims the ages of her children should not affect her right to buy alcohol . Mrs Trigg said the ages of her children were irrelevant, but checkout staff told her the heavy-handed tactics were necessary because they can be prosecuted and given an £80 on-the-spot fine for selling drink to someone who passes it on to someone under 18. She said: ‘There can be no doubt in anyone’s mind that I am old enough to buy wine and beer. These are legal products, it is not like I was trying to buy a caged wild animal.’ She added: ‘It really should not be so difficult for a working mum to be able to go and buy some drink for Christmas. My kids were just there helping to pack the trolley and bags. When I am carrying heavy things, I need the help. Examples of heavy-handed supermarkets stopping adults buying alcohol: . Sept 2013: Father-of-three Charles Brown, aged 50, was stopped from buying a bottle of whisky by a cashier at Morrisons, in Huddersfield, who asked him to prove he was over 18. Aug 2013: A mother with a broken hand was left angry and embarrassed after being told she could not buy alcohol in a Leamington supermarket because her 17-year-old daughter was helping her pack. July 2013: Staff at a Tesco in Taunton refused to allow a 43-year-old woman to buy drink for a barbecue because she was with her 17-year-old son. June 2013: A 77-year-old man was stopped from buying a crate of lager from a Co-op in Bishops Lydeard, Somerset, because he had his 13-year-old grandson with him. Dec 2012: A seriously ill teenager, aged 18, was stopped from buying Christmas gift sets containing alcohol at an Asda in Lowestoft. Staff stopped the purchase because the 18-year-old was with her sister, aged 17, who had lifted the items on to the conveyor  belt at the till. ‘These policies make going through the till very stressful. Do parents have to start being devious and telling youngsters to wait by the front door while they put the shopping through the till? ‘I am an adult and a mother. Why does a supermarket or the state feel they can tell me whether or not I can buy products that are legal?’ Asda defended its policy, saying: ‘Although it may seem a bit heavy-handed, we don’t blame our colleagues for being over-cautious. 'If they serve alcohol to anyone under the age of 18 the law says they will be held personally responsible and could be handed an on-the-spot fine. 'Where there is any element of doubt we support our colleagues to make the right decision. We are committed to selling alcohol responsibly.’ Other leading supermarkets, including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and the Co-op, said they also expected checkout staff to demand ID where a shopper appeared to be under 25. They said workers can also refuse a sale if they have ‘reasonable grounds’ to believe the drink might be passed on to someone under 18. The idea of ‘reasonable grounds’ is such a grey area that it effectively gives till workers freedom over whether to allow adults to buy drink. As a result, there is an increasing number of examples of adults being turned down. Despite cracking down on parents trying to buy a bottle of wine with their children, supermarkets have been keen to take advantage of more relaxed licensing laws. According to Home Office figures, 963 big supermarkets sell alcohol round the clock. They make up 13 per cent – or one in every eight – of all bars, shops, hotels and pubs licensed to open 24 hours. Police have declared 24-hour drinking a failed experiment which has led to widespread disorder on Britain’s streets. Officers have blamed the sale of alcohol by supermarkets for much of the problem.","Staff are blocking parents from buying alcohol if they are with children .

At this 2004 anti-war event, a group of musicians, including Psy, performed Dear American, a protest song written by Korean rock band N.E.X.T.

'The song I was featured in - from eight years ago - was part of a deeply emotional reaction to the war in Iraq and the killing of two innocent Korean civilians that was part of the overall antiwar sentiment shared by others around the world at that time,' Psy's statement read. 'While I'm grateful for the freedom to express one's self I've learned there are limits to what language is appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted. 'I will forever be sorry for any pain I have caused anyone by those words.' 'While it's important we express our opinions, I deeply regret the inflammatory and inappropriate language I used to do so. 'In my music I try to give people a release, a reason to smile. 'I have learned that though music, our universal language we can all come together as a culture of humanity and I hope that you will accept my apology.' Psy's unique 'sexy horse' dance has been performed by celebrities and politicians, including everyone from Madonna to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.
