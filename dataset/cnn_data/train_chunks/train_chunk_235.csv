"(CNN) -- Baseball is a dirty game, we know that. Grass stains. Rosin bags. Pine tar. Dust. Sweat. Spit. Tobacco drool. But just how filthy IS it? Exactly how many cheaters do we have out there, anyhow? Are there no angels in our outfields? The hot rumor is Major League Baseball is about to throw the book -- harder, this time -- at players who allegedly got a boost from performance-enhancing drugs. As many as 20 players might be suspended, according to a report on ESPN.com. Some of the bans might be for as long as 100 games. A feel-good Florida fellow named Tony Bosch ran Biogenesis, a Miami wellness clinic that is now closed. ESPN says sources indicated Bosch will be cooperating with MLB's top brass in identifying which pro athletes, among his clientele, were being supplied with PEDs. Names being bandied about: Alex Rodriguez, three-time American League MVP; Ryan Braun, 2011 National League MVP; Melky Cabrera, 2012 All-star Game MVP; and, well, the rest of the lineup will be asked to line up. Throw the bums out, some will scream. I am totally OK with this. Who's legitimate and who ain't? That's all we want to know anymore. We have spent much of this century wondering which individuals in the national pastime are squeaky clean and which are as stained as a dugout floor. What about Barry Bonds, No. 1 on hitting's all-time home run list -- and who was convicted in 2011 of obstruction of justice for impeding a grand jury investigating the use of PEDs? What about A-Rod (No. 5 on the list), who in 2009 publicly confessed to steroid use between 2001-03? What about Sammy Sosa (No. 8), who the New York Times reported was among the players who tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug in 2003? Mark McGwire (10), who in 2010 admitted to steroid use during the 1990s? Rafael Palmeiro (12), suspended in 2005 for a positive drug test? Manny Ramirez (14), suspended in 2009 for the same thing? Did any or all bring a little ""extra"" to the plate when they stepped up to bat? I don't know. All I do know is, we're sick of it, man. Baseball's zero-tolerance policy is an absolute must. Oh, the players' union reps will surely react and be appalled and appeal. But if swingers and throwers are found to be dirty, they've gotta go. No slaps on the wrist. It's gotta hurt. Back when he got booted for 50 games in 2009, Manny Ramirez was a big star. He has barely been heard from since. Manny and his 555 home runs (more than Mickey Mantle or Ted Williams or Lou Gehrig) have pretty much taken a powder since MLB suspended him that season for PEDs. When they pointed a finger his way for another possible violation in 2011, he chose instant retirement instead. A couple of strikes and you're out. A-Rod's in a jam. His reputation is already in disrepute from his 2009 mea culpa. He is 37 and his future is in doubt. He is injured and hasn't played a single inning for the Yankees so far in 2013. Now the 14-time All-Star with 647 lifetime home runs finds his name has come up again in this Biogenesis business in Miami, the town where he went to high school. Braun is a puzzler. A 29-year-old outfielder for the Milwaukee Brewers, he was NL Rookie of the Year in 2007, MVP in '11. Then he got suspended for PEDs. Then he got un-suspended, successfully challenging the decision. Now he's on the hot seat again, although he seems adamant that the truth will set him free. We will see. Then there is Cabrera, 28, the man named Melky, whose pals call him ""Leche,"" whose fans in San Francisco came to games dressed like milkmen. In 2012, the Melk Man was hitting a healthy .346 and had just been voted the star of stars in the All-Star Game when he got banned 50 games for the detection in his bloodstream of ""synthetic testosterone."" He missed the rest of the season. He was eligible for the World Series, but the Giants didn't reinstate him. A day after they won it, they released Cabrera from the team. Today he is a Toronto Blue Jay, persona non grata in the Bay Area where he was once so wildly popular. A second suspension could be in store for Cabrera if reports are correct that he could be snagged in the Miami net. ESPN ran a long list of players besides Rodriguez, Braun and Cabrera ""who might ultimately face discipline."" A couple of these guys are among MLB's fastest-rising young stars. Guilty parties, you know who you are. Major League Baseball, you are slowly but surely figuring out who they are. Get out your pail and mop. If you have found more dirt by your plate, do this game a big favor. Clean it up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Downey.","Mike Downey: ESPN reports as many as 20 baseball players could get suspended for PED use .

"Washington (CNN) -- In one move Wednesday, President Barack Obama managed to reshape his national security team, bring longtime confidante Susan Rice to the White House and annoy Republican critics of the U.N. ambassador. Obama announced in the White House Rose Garden that Rice, who got caught up in political controversy over the Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attack, will replace the retiring Tom Donilon in the influential foreign policy post of national security adviser. Donilon will step down in July following this weekend's meetings between Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The president also said he would nominate Samantha Power of the National Security Council to succeed Rice at the United Nations. By choosing two women known as advocates for human rights, including the NATO-led intervention in Libya with U.S. support, Obama signaled a potentially more robust foreign policy in his second term. At the same time, his decision to make Rice the head of his national security team angered Republicans who are demanding further details on what they believe was a politically motivated effort by the administration to downplay the Benghazi attack in the middle of last year's election campaign. While Obama made no direct reference to the politics of the announcement, he praised Rice for being ""fearless, tough"" and a great patriot who champions justice and human dignity. ""I'm absolutely thrilled she'll be back at my side, leading my national security team for my second term,"" Obama said with a smiling Rice at his side. Rice became the focus of Republican criticism after the terrorist attack last September 11 on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Five days after the assault that came on the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks, Rice appeared on Sunday news shows to say it was a spontaneous development during a protest, rather than a terrorist strike. She had been considered a top contender to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the start of Obama's second term, but Republican opposition over the erroneous CIA talking points she had delivered forced her to withdraw her name from consideration in December. Biden on Susan Rice: She speaks for the president . Obama ultimately nominated former U.S. Sen. John Kerry for the post. As national security adviser, Rice will play a key role in developing and guiding the administration's foreign policy. Unlike a Cabinet post, the appointment requires no Senate confirmation, allowing Obama to avoid a showdown with Republicans in giving a new job to one of his most public foreign policy voices during the 2008 presidential campaign. Rice also has been a deputy secretary of state and was previously considered a possible candidate for the national security adviser job when Obama appointed Donilon. She said Wednesday that she was ""humbled"" to serve as Obama's national security adviser and thanked the president for his confidence in her. Mindful of the need to work with the various government, law enforcement and military entities involved in national security, she declared her admiration for ""the exemplary work done every day by our colleagues at State, Defense, the intelligence community and across the government"" to keep the nation safe. To columnist and CNN Contributor John Avlon, Obama's choice of Rice and Power showed the freedom he felt now that he won the last election of his career last year. ""Susan Rice is not on the Republicans' Christmas card list, but this appointment, which doesn't need Senate confirmation, is being read as a slap in the face,"" Avlon said. ""President Obama says he doesn't much care. He is rewarding Susan Rice for her loyalty to his administration and moving her into the White House. She can have more influence now than she ever did on White House policy."" He called it a ""fascinating, decisive move"" by a president ""who is apparently liberated by a second term, who is not worried about burning bridges with Republicans and Congress who are already his critics."" Republicans immediately criticized Obama's choice, with conservative GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah tweeting: ""Judgement is key to national security matters. That alone should disqualify Susan Rice from her appointment."" Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a leading Republican voice on foreign policy, tweeted that he disagreed with Obama's appointment but added that he would ""make every effort to work"" with Rice on important issues. In a statement later Wednesday, McCain expressed support for Power, calling her ""well-qualified"" for the job as U.N. ambassador and saying he hoped the Senate would act quickly on her nomination. Power worked for Obama's campaign in 2008 until she resigned after referring to Clinton -- the other leading Democratic contender at the time -- as a ""monster."" She is senior director for multilateral affairs and human rights at the National Security Council and a former special assistant to the president. Power also has written extensively on preventing genocide, with criticism of the United Nations for failing to stop attacks in Bosnia and Rwanda. Avlon called Obama's move ""a coalescing within the Obama administration"" by promoting ""two women who are in policy terms not that far from their Republican critics. "" ""The president is circling the wagons, appointing stronger supporters from his inner circle. That's what second-term presidents do,"" Avlon said, adding ""these are actually strong, confident moves in a Democratic foreign policy that believes in humanitarian intervention."" Now, he said, the roles of Rice and Power raise ""real questions about what the administration will do going forward in Syria,"" where critics at home and abroad contend the Obama administration has failed to intervene as needed. Obama called himself ""wistful"" to be losing Donilon, the former deputy national security adviser who Obama picked to replace retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones in October 2010. Donilon was heavily involved in the raid to kill Osama bin Laden in 2011, as well as the administration's strategic shift of foreign policy focus to Asia. Donilon, who also was chief of staff to Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Clinton administration, is married to Cathy Russell, whom Obama recently nominated to be the State Department's ambassador at large for global women's issues. The president lauded Donilon's commitment, including in-person briefings almost every day in recent years on a portfolio that covered ""literally the entire world."" ""I'm personally grateful for your advice, for your counsel, most of all for your friendship,"" Obama said, adding that ""a president can't ask for anything more"" than the contributions and service of Donilon. When he finished, the two men shook hands and embraced. Obama nominates three to bench, courts political fight .

"(CNN) -- A handwriting expert testifying for the defense said Wednesday that former Kansas police officer Brett Seacat did not forge a suicide note for his wife, Vashti, whose body was found inside the couple's burning home in 2011. But in a possible blow to the defense, Avis Odenbaugh conceded in cross-examination that she is not currently certified by any forensic document examination organizations. Brett Seacat is on trial for first-degree murder in Vashti Seacat's death. Prosecutors say Seacat shot his wife and set fire to their home. The defense says it was Vashti Seacat who pulled the trigger after starting the fire. Brett Seacat told investigators that his wife was depressed. The alleged suicide note asks Brett Seacat to take care of their two boys: ""Hold them both and tell them 'mommy loves them' every night."" Did Kansas cop kill wife, burn down their home? It ends with a message to the children, telling them, ""I love the two of you and will be watching over you from Heaven."" A prosecution expert earlier had testified that the note had not been written by Vashti Seacat. But Odenbaugh testified she concluded that the handwriting in the note matched the handwriting of the person who wrote in Vashti Seacat's journals. The prosecution was able to score a point during cross-examination, however, by getting Odenbaugh to admit she is not currently certified and is semi-retired. Prosecutors also displayed a board with another sample of Vashti Seacat's writing alongside the suicide note. The expert admitted there are discrepancies between the two. Jurors got to take a closer look at the two samples on handouts provided by the prosecution. CNN's Ted Rowlands said they seemed to be nodding in agreement that the samples had differences. One of Brett Seacat's co-workers testified earlier in the trial that Seacat had asked for an overhead projector the day before his wife's death. The prosecution suggested in opening statements that Seacat used the projector to forge the suicide note. Seacat has said he was sleeping downstairs on the night of the fire, CNN affiliate KWCH reported. He heard a noise, and moments later his wife called him on his cell phone, saying he should get their two boys before they got hurt. He then purportedly heard two pops. Brett Seacat went upstairs and saw flames. He reportedly said he found his wife in their bedroom and tried to save her. But prosecutors say Brett Seacat's story doesn't makes sense. For one, he had no soot or blood on him, they say, according to KWCH, and only a small burn on his foot. He and the couple's sons escaped from the blaze unharmed. The Seacats' home in Kingman, Kansas, sits not far from the courthouse where Brett Seacat is standing trial. Despite extensive fire damage, the house still stands; a brick chimney pokes out of the charred remains. ""I'm smart enough that if I wanted to kill my wife ... I could've come up with something better than this,"" Seacat told investigators about the shooting and the fire. ""This is what a crazy person does.""","Brett Seacat is on trial for murder, accused of killing his wife, Vashti .

"(CNN) -- [Breaking news update at 11:44 p.m. ET] . The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long (""Snow Dragon"") is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the expedition vessel struck in ice in Antarctica, the icebreaker's captain told CNN. He said he expects to reach the stranded vessel late Friday local time. [Previous story, published at 8:57 p.m. ET] . Antarctic ship trapped in sea ice should be rescued by Friday . (CNN) -- The first of three ice-breaking rescue ships is expected to reach an expedition vessel trapped in frozen seas off Antarctica by Friday, the voyage's leader told CNN via Skype. ""We just want to assure family and friends, everyone is fine, the vessel is safe, and we're looking forward to getting home and having a decent cup of coffee soon,"" said Chris Turney, expedition leader and professor of climate change at University of New South Wales in Australia. He said crew members, researchers and tourists aboard were doing ""amazingly well."" ""Morale is remarkably high,"" he added Thursday in the Skype interview, whose video displayed a whited-out scenery. The MV Akademik Shokalskiy, with 74 people aboard, became locked in sea ice Monday night and spent the next 12 hours with all aboard hoping that high winds would subside. They didn't. So, the ship spent Christmas at a frozen standstill 100 nautical miles east of the French base Dumont D'Urville, about 1,500 nautical miles south of Hobart, Tasmania. ""We had a great Christmas,"" Turney said, though everyone was frustrated about not being able to venture out into the open ocean. ""This is an area of enormous change. We're in an area of a big driver of global climate,"" Turney said. ""We wanted to come here to see how much change has taken place. ""Ironically, this is actually giving us extra time to do research,"" he said about being stuck in the frozen waters. He joked that he gave researchers the day off on Christmas, though. ""We're looking at life under the sea ice,"" he added. A Chinese ice breaker called the Snow Dragon, or Xue Long, was en route from Freemantle, Australia, to the Ross Sea at Antarctica and could reach the stuck vessel by Friday. Meanwhile, the French vessel Astrolabe is just 17 nautical miles away and is also expected to reach the trapped researchers and tourists by Friday. An Australian ship, the Aurora Australis, is expected to arrive later, the expedition's website said Thursday. ""Between the three of them, we're hoping to get out relatively quickly,"" Turney said. A British rescue coordination center received a satellite distress signal on Christmas morning from the Russian-flagged ship and contacted the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which handles the Southern Ocean region where the vessel was stuck, a safety authority statement said. Turney said everyone aboard the expedition vessel is scheduled to return to southern New Zealand by January 4. Expeditions Online, a polar booking agent for the MV Akademik Shokalskiy, said on its website that the ship got stuck ""partway through her Australasian Antarctic Expedition towards Mawson's Hut at Cape Denison."" The Expeditions Online website described the ship as ""a fully ice-strengthened expedition vessel"" for working in polar regions. ""This class of vessel is world-renowned for polar exploration, because of its strength, maneuverability and small passenger numbers,"" the company's website said. CNN's Brianna Keilar, Tom Cohen, Kevin Wang, CY Xu and April Ma contributed to this report.","NEW: A Chinese icebreaker is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away from the vessel .

"(CNN) -- Heman Marion Sweatt and Abigail Noel Fisher both wanted to attend the University of Texas at Austin, and both claimed race was a primary reason for their rejection. They filed civil rights lawsuits and the Supreme Court ultimately agreed to hear their appeals, filed more than a half-century apart. Questions over academic competition, fairness, and demographics as well as the role of government in promoting political and social diversity populated their claims. But it is the key difference between the plaintiffs that now confronts the court: Sweatt was African-American, Fisher is white. The justices are poised to rule this month in Fisher's appeal, possibly in coming days, on the use of race in college admissions. Sweatt's 1950 case produced a landmark court ruling that set the stage for the eventual end of racial segregation in public facilities. The question around Fisher could come down to whether a majority believes affirmative action has run its course, no longer necessary in a country that has come far to confront its racially divisive past. ""There's a good chance that affirmative action, at least in the case of education, is on the chopping block,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a Washington appellate attorney and SCOTUSblog.com editor. Read selected quotes from arguments . ""The Supreme Court 10 years ago approved the use of race as a factor. But it's just changed. [Now retired Justice] Sandra Day O'Connor isn't there and she was the decisive vote. And the current conservative majority is just very suspicious of the use of race in government decision-making,"" Goldstein said. Specifically in Fisher, do race-conscious admission policies at the University of Texas, the flagship state college, violate the rights of white applicants? Other, similar cases on docket . The timing of the decision is not lost on the justices. The court is also set to rule by month's end on two other contentious appeals over classification -- voting rights enforcement, and same-sex marriage. Fisher sued the state university after her college application was rejected in 2008 when she was a high school senior in Sugar Land, Texas, outside Houston. She claims the individualized, discretionary admission policies violate her rights, and favor African-American and Hispanic applicants over whites and Asian-Americans. The state of Texas provides for a hybrid admission policy: Automatic acceptance to its university's main campus in Austin for in-state students finishing in the top 10 percent of their high school class. Three quarters of the in-state student body gets in this way, which ensures a measure of non-subjective diversity. Fisher just missed that opportunity, so she had to compete in a separate pool of students seeking to attend the highly competitive school. It is that a selection process that is before the court. ""If any state action should respect racial equality, it is university admissions,"" she and her lawyers told the high court in their written brief. ""Selecting those who will benefit from the limited places available at universities has enormous consequences."" The school, with a large 52,000 student body, defends the educational benefits of its . ""holistic"" policy of considering race as one of many factors -- including test scores, community service, leadership and work experience -- designed to create a diverse campus. ""We must have the flexibility to consider each applicant's unique experiences and background so we can provide the best environment in which to educate and train the students who will be our nation's future leaders,"" said school administrators. A summary of major upcoming Supreme Court decisions . Obama administration backs school . The Obama administration agrees, and is backing the school, saying to grow a nation built on differing complexions and backgrounds will depend on future leaders ""who possess the understanding of diversity that is necessary to govern and defend the United States."" The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund is among more than five dozen outside groups that filed legal briefs in support of the school. Many of them worry the conservative high court majority is poised to strike down or severely limit affirmative action. ""A broad ruling could have very far reaching effects and could possibly affect the pathway to opportunity for minority students at a range of universities,"" said Debo Adegbile, the group's special counsel. ""Not just at state universities, but at all institutions of higher education."" But groups opposed to the state's policies think the time has come to rethink how affirmative action will be applied in the future, if at all. ""Using race in admissions decisions, to achieve diversity, amounts to stereotyping people by their race,"" said Joshua Thompson of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, which filed a legal brief in support of Fisher. ""Racial diversity in a student body does not guarantee a diversity of experience and perspectives. It is unrealistic and wrong to try to pigeonhole people by their race."" A bigger debate . A larger social debate is whether race-conscious policies serve their ultimate purpose -- to help minority students ultimately achieve success, especially in high-profile professional positions. ""What we're seeing now is affirmative action is backfiring quite badly,"" said Gail Heriot, a law professor at the University of San Diego and a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She and two fellow Commission members filed a brief, citing recent studies that race preferences are doing more harm than good, and suggesting there are fewer African-American professionals than would have been with race-neutral methods. ""The problem is what is called mismatch,"" said Heriot. ""As a result of affirmative action, black students in particular, Hispanic students as well, are likely to go to a school where their entering credentials put them towards the bottom of the entering class,"" at top schools like Harvard or Texas. Their lower grades as a result, said Heriot, means those students are much more likely to give up on the ambition to major in science, or go into medicine or the law. Many social scientists and civil groups, including the NAACP, reject that analysis. ""I think those studies and arguments don't really jive with the real world,"" said Adegbile. ""The admissions officers are best situated to make the determination and some of the tradeoffs, to have a mix of students that can accomplish all of the things that college and universities are engines to do."" The high court has had an evolving record on the discretion of state officials to decide who attends their institutions. The justices said in 2003 that state universities can narrowly tailor their admissions policies to consider an applicant's race, to achieve a ""critical mass"" of minority students. But they reaffirmed existing limits -- bans on the use of quotas, extra ""race"" points in selective criteria, or ""balancing"" measures to reflect the larger population. That landmark case from the University of Michigan is the subject of a separate pending high court case over a state ballot measure designed to eliminate any racial criteria. A divided federal appeals court had concluded the voter-approved ban on ""preferential treatment"" at public colleges and universities was unconstitutional, and ""alters Michigan's political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities."" The justices have accepted that case for review, and will hold oral arguments in the fall. It has the potential to complement, or surpass in impact, the separate Fisher case. But her appeal is complicated by the issue of ""standing"" and whether Fisher should even be allowed to bring her lawsuit. Fisher graduated from another school . She graduated last spring from Louisiana State University, where she went after being rejected by the University of Texas -- and school officials had argued she has no ""live"" controversy or claim necessary for the high court to intervene. They said her only ""harm"" would be trying to recoup nonrefundable application fees. Through her lawyers, Fisher said she did not want to be interviewed separately by CNN. But after October's argument she told reporters, ""I hope the court rules that a student's race and ethnicity should not be considered when applying to the University of Texas."" In hearing the case, the high court made no mention of whether the standing issue would affect its ultimate ruling. Another wildcard: Justice Elena Kagan will not participate in the case since she apparently had been briefed on the issue as the Obama administration's solicitor general, before joining the high court. That leaves the possibility of a 4-4 ruling, meaning Fisher would not prevail, but leaving undecided the larger constitutional questions presented. The University of Texas proudly touts its diversity: The most recent freshman class is about 46 percent white, 25 percent Hispanic, 18 percent Asian, and 5 percent African-American. Some states, including California, do not allow race considerations in college admissions. The issue now before an arguably more conservative high court is whether the Texas policies should be re-evaluated, as states have had nearly a decade to re-evaluate such diversity considerations. Impact of Sweatt . A final word about Sweatt. When the Houston mailman applied to the University of Texas in 1946, no African-American at the time could be admitted to any law school in the state, and there were even no black-only law schools. School administrators cited the established white-only policies for their rejection and instead offered Sweatt an out-of-state scholarship. He refused and took his case to court. The high court unanimously found in favor of Sweatt and he became the first African-American ever ordered admitted to an all-white institution. His legal victory was an important legal landmark-- a building block that culminated three years later in the 1953 Brown v. Board case, where the justices ordered a permanent end to state-mandated public, racial segregation. Sweatt's personal victory was bittersweet. He entered the UT law school, but later dropped out, following ill health as well as hostility from white classmates. He died in 1982, and the Travis County civil courthouse in Austin was renamed in his honor. The current case is Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin (11-345). Court transcript .

"New York (CNN) -- The World Food Programme is ramping up its Syria operations in anticipation of greater demand from inside and outside the country, but lack of access is proving problematic, the U.N. group's executive director told reporters Tuesday. ""Most of my time has been spent with donors as well as the representatives from the neighboring countries regarding our operation in Syria,"" Ertharin Cousin said at the Social Good Summit, which coincides with the meeting of world leaders here at the U.N. General Assembly . The program, which provides services to 3 million Syrians inside the country and 1.2 million outside, is making plans to boost those numbers next month to 4 million inside the country and 1.5 million to 1.7 million outside, she said. The program has 80 international staffers and 300 national staffers supporting the region. Though some of them are working from Amman, Jordan, others are spread across all 14 governorates of Syria, she said. But the group has had access ""issues of access"" to some areas ""for some time,"" she said. Cousin did not say whether those issues were caused by the government or rebel forces. ""What I've said is that bullets don't tell you what side they come from,"" she said. ""There's enough complicity to go around we need all parties to provide us with access."" WFP is not involved in politics, she said. ""We deal with the consequences of failed politics."" Because of their apolitical stance, WFP representatives are able to talk to all sides in the civil war, ""and that's what we do,"" she said. But the outlook is grim if access is not gained soon. Cousin predicted that images of children suffering from severe malnutrition will emerge from the country this winter for a third year in a row. ""Those pictures will get worse and we, as the international community, should not wait until we have famine-like conditions before we bring attention to the fact that we don't have access to too many of these areas."" She credited aggressive planning with helping authorities avert a famine last year in Niger. The challenges can go beyond meeting nutritional needs, she said, citing one Syrian man's anger over the bread offered to him in a refugee camp in Jordan where she was visiting recently. ""He said, 'This is not Syrian bread; it is Jordanian bread, and they have their own recipe for bread,' "" she recalled. The program worked with Jordanian bakers to rejigger the recipe. ""When we have the opportunity and the ability to meet not only nutritional needs but cultural needs, we try to comply,"" she said, adding that that was not always possible. Last year, WFP fed nearly 99 million people in 88 countries, she said. It is 100% voluntarily funded, and each year it must raise the funds it expects to use by asking for them. Last year's total was just over $4 billion. But its resources are finite. Some 10 million people in Yemen are ""food insecure,"" meaning they live in hunger or in fear of starvation, she said. And Haiti has reduced the size of its school feeding program, despite ongoing need, ""because we're underresourced,"" Cousin said. Over the long term, more challenges await. She said WFP is working with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization to prepare for the effects of climate change by getting more drought-tolerant seeds to farmers.

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department will never prosecute journalists for doing their jobs, and recent probes into national security leaks targeted government officials, not reporters, Attorney General Eric Holder said in remarks to a Senate committee Thursday. Holder, amid a cloud of controversy for investigations in recent years involving The Associated Press and Fox News, said he has launched a review of existing Justice Department guidelines on investigations involving the press, and he is meeting with journalists to discuss those guidelines. ""The department goal in investigating leak cases is to identify and prosecute government officials who jeopardize government secrets,"" Holder told the Senate Appropriations Committee during a wide-ranging budget hearing that included questions about the federal prison system, drone strikes and the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay. He added that as long as he is at the Justice helm, he will never prosecute a reporter for doing her or his job. After Holder's testimony, the House Judiciary Committee asked him in writing to appear this month to explain testimony he gave May 15 concerning the Fox News case, in which a reporter was labeled a criminal co-conspirator during a leak investigation. Switching directions during his allotted time to speak Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, raised questions about this week's report that the National Security Agency and FBI were monitoring Americans' phone records. He asked specifically whether Holder could assure him that no member of Congress had been monitored, as it might give the executive branch leverage over the legislative branch. Holder responded that it wasn't an appropriate venue to answer the question, to which Kirk said the appropriate answer was, ""No, we stayed in our lane, and I assure you we did not spy on members of Congress."" ""There has been no intention to spy on members of Congress and members of the Supreme Court,"" Holder said. Sen. Barbara Mikulski, chairwoman of the committee, interrupted the back-and-forth to say that the matter deserved a briefing before the entire Senate, and involving the NSA and Holder. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, the ranking GOP member of the committee, opened his remarks by saying the Justice Department was ""mired in a controversy of late"" that raised questions about the Justice Department's ""adherence to the rule of law"" and Holder's ability to lead. He further said Americans deserved an attorney general ""not distracted by controversies of his own making."" Holder emphasized he was ""fully engaged"" in efforts to resolve these problems and evaluates his own performance on a daily basis. ""I have not done a perfect job. I think I've done a good job, but I think I could do better,"" he said, adding that his meetings with journalists are aimed at formulating new policies and regulations ""and hopefully get that behind us."" Responding to Shelby's query about whether there would be a tipping point at which Holder might need to step down, Holder -- who has suggested he might not serve for President Barack Obama's entire second term -- said he had more goals to accomplish before he sat down with Obama to discuss a transition. ""The tipping point might be fatigue,"" Holder told Shelby. ""You get to a point where you just get tired."" Sen. Dianne Feinstein did not continue the line of questioning regarding the leaks but defended Holder and lamented that the hearing was used to berate him. ""I believe in your integrity,"" she said. ""I believe you're a good attorney general. I believe you've had undue problems that are hard to anticipate. I believe you're responding as best you possibly could."" Holder is under fire for two instances, in particular. The first involves his Justice Department obtaining two months of phone records from The Associated Press as part of an investigation into the news agency's May 2012 coverage of a foiled airline bomb plot in Yemen. The second case involves Justice obtaining the phone records, e-mails and security badge information of Fox News' James Rosen, who reported on classified intelligence about North Korea in 2009. No reporters were singled out as potential criminals in the AP case, but in the Fox case, an FBI agent said Rosen might be an ""aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator"" to disclosing secret information. The Rosen case has been of most interest to Holder's critics because of a May 15 remark he made to Congress about the leaks. ""With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something that I've ever been involved in or heard of or would think would be a wise policy,"" Holder said. Republican Rep. Darrell Issa called Holder's statement ""a lie, by most people's standards,"" and the GOP-controlled House Judiciary Committee is investigating whether the attorney general lied under oath. Holder wrote Sens. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, and James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, of the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, saying -- as he did before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday -- that he was reviewing his department's guidelines regarding investigations involving the media. ""As part of this review, I have hosted a series of productive meetings with representatives of news organizations and other interested parties in order to solicit their valuable input,"" Holder wrote. ""I welcome your contributions to this process and hope that both of you will join the Deputy Attorney General and me when we schedule meetings with interested members of Congress."" Read Holder's letter (PDF) Goodlatte replied in a letter signed by every GOP member of the House committee -- but no Democrats -- that none of Holder's statements so far, nor those of his subordinates, ""constitutes a satisfactory on-the-record response."" Goodlatte asked Holder to appear before the committee June 18 or, if that isn't feasible, to pick a date between then and June 28, Goodlatte told Holder. Referring to Holder's May 15 testimony, the letter said, ""This statement left members of the Committee and the American people with the clear understanding that the Department had never taken the unprecedented step of characterizing a member of the media as a criminal co-conspirator in a sworn court document."" Read Goodlatte's letter (PDF) The White House and Justice Department have both issued statements saying Rosen was never prosecuted, so any assertion that Holder lied is wrong. The Justice Department has also said that Holder recused himself from the AP probe because he had been interviewed about the leak during the investigation, but Republicans say the statement was missing a key piece of information: When did he recuse himself? After hearing concerns that the Justice Department's investigations had put reporters at a legal risk for simply doing their jobs, Holder sat down with various news executives last week. He is continuing those meetings this week. ""We expressed our concerns that reporters felt some fear for doing their jobs, that they were concerned about using their e-mail, using their office telephone and that we need to have the freedom to do their job,"" Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said after the meeting. Holder told NBC News on Wednesday that he would not step down amid criticism over security leaks investigations.","NEW: Judiciary Committee asks Holder to appear to explain Fox News statements .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Michele Bachmann boasted of having a ""titanium spine"" in an interview broadcast Sunday, the day before she formally enters the race for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. However, Bachmann had some difficulty in clarifying her stance on key issues and explaining federal funding that benefited her family in the interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" and another one with the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""I have a titanium spine for doing what we need to do"" to get the country turned around, Bachmann told Fox, later challenging a question about whether past misstatements showed she was ""flaky"" by saying: ""I think that was insulting to say something like that, because I'm a serious person."" The 55-year-old Tea Party favorite from Minnesota has bolted into leading contention among Republican candidates so far after a strong performance earlier this month in a New Hampshire GOP debate. She will announce her candidacy on Monday in Iowa, the state where she was born and an important first destination in presidential campaigning. ""I have a distinct advantage there, I think,"" Bachmann said of Iowa. She listed her accomplishments as a tax lawyer, legislator and mother, and cited her sincerity as a major strength in comparison to the other leading GOP contender early in the campaign -- former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. ""What people know about me is I do what I say and I say what I mean,"" Bachmann said on Fox, calling herself a ""fighter"" and a ""common-sense voice."" ""I think people recognize I'm very sincere in what I say."" However, she stopped short of calling Romney insincere, though she noted he has changed positions in the past on key issues including abortion. Bachmann, a deficit hawk who backs deep spending cuts to balance the federal budget, adopted a defensive posture when asked about a Los Angeles Times report Sunday on federal money that benefited her family -- including nearly $30,000 for a counseling clinic operated by her husband and almost $260,000 for a family farm. The money didn't directly benefit her family, she explained, saying the $30,000 was for training employees and the farm that got the $260,000 was owned by her father-in-law, so she and her husband didn't get any of it. Asked about another roiling social issue -- gay marriage -- Bachmann said she supported both the right of states to pass laws on the matter and the superseding authority of a federal constitutional amendment on the issue. New York's state legislature and governor have the right under the Tenth Amendment to pass the law legalizing gay marriage, which happened Friday, Bachmann said. She also backs a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and a woman, saying that would decide the issue once and for all. In the end, Bachmann said, it would be better to settle the matter with citizens voting on a constitutional amendment rather than Supreme Court judges issuing a decision. Asked on CBS whether she believes homosexuality is a choice, Bachmann said it was up to individuals to make their own decision and that she wasn't judging anyone on the issue. She described herself as a Christian who gave her heart to Jesus Christ at age 15 and now gets guidance in her life and political career through prayer. Her doctrine is rigid conservatism on economic and social issues, and she responds to most policy questions -- especially on the economy with withering criticism of President Barack Obama. ""The president doesn't seem to have an understanding of how the economy works,"" Bachmann said on CBS. ""It doesn't seem he has a basic understanding of how do the job of president of the United States."" She challenged the contention by the White House, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and economic analysts that failing to raise the federal debt ceiling by August 2 would cause a negative market reaction. ""It is scare tactics,"" Bachmann said of such warnings, adding that the government takes in plenty of money to pay the interest it owes on federal debt and avoid default. In that case, she conceded, other spending such as funding the military would have to be cut. ""It would be very tough love,"" she conceded, adding that she had no intention of voting to raise the debt ceiling at this time. If president, Bachmann said, she would cut corporate taxes in several ways in order to spur job creation, but she stopped short of endorsing a call from her past to eliminate the minimum wage. Bachmann has a history of statements that media fact checkers such as PolitiFact.com have revealed to be untrue, including false claims that Obama's trip to India cost taxpayers $200 million a day and that Obama had only issued one drilling permit since taking office. Asked about that record, she responded: ""I haven't misled people at all."" As a newcomer to presidential politics, Bachmann wasn't asked Sunday whether she would accept an invitation to run for vice president if defeated by another Republican candidate. She may have inadvertently tipped her hand on Fox, though, when she accidentally referred to Romney as ""President Romney"" before correcting herself.","NEW: Bachmann says she hasn't misled anyone despite erroneous statements .

"Naypyidaw, Myanmar (CNN) -- Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is blunt and unapologetic. ""I want to run for president and I'm quite frank about it,"" she told a panel during the first day open discussion at the World Economic Forum in Myanmar on Thursday. ""If I pretended that I didn't want to be president, I wouldn't be honest and I would rather be honest with my people than otherwise."" Suu Kyi's determination to drag her country free from the stifling restraint of an military regime is finally being realized more than two and a half years after her release from years of house arrest. However, two years into the presidency of Thein Sein, she says that the vast majority of Myanmar's people are not seeing the benefits of reform. ""If you talk to the man on the street, if you talk to people in villages, the great majority of them would say that their lives have not changed since 2010. "" Suu Kyi criticizes two-child limit on Muslims in western Myanmar . 'This is a transformation time' Her assertion was backed by a number of people in the busy Bogalay Market in downtown Yangon. Win Shwe stood in a long coat at the market entrance, raising his hand every now and then as if to bless passersby. The 72-year-old was begging for a note or two of the local currency, the kyat . ""This is a transformation time. But for poor people, nothing's changed. The government mechanism is corruption,"" he said. Sitting beside her daughter nearby at a flower stall, Khin Than Win, 52, said: ""I agree that this is a transformation time. But I see that the streets and the roads are wider than before. That's the only change."" People ""want to feel that they have been included in the process of change,"" Suu Kyi told the panel. ""And that's nothing to do with the number of cars that you now see in Rangoon (Yangon) or the number of magazines that you can buy because the vast majority of our people have no access to those."" Suu Kyi wins re-election as Myanmar opposition leader . Suu Kyi: Amend constitution . To clear the way for her presidency, Suu Kyi said the country's constitution had to change. As it stands, the former political prisoner is ineligible to contest the presidency because of a clause that bans anyone with a foreign spouse or child. Suu Kyi's late husband, Michael Aris, was English and her two sons have British passports. Asked whether she was reasonably optimistic that those changes would be made, Suu Kyi said, ""I don't believe in indulging in optimism. Let me put it this way. I've always said hope has to be backed up by endeavor. ""So, rather than being optimistic or hoping that the constitution will be amended we're going to work for the constitution to be amended."" But while many see Suu Kyi as the country's best chance for the future, she's been criticized for not being vocal enough in defense of the rights of Rohingya Muslims in the western Rakhine State. Human Rights Watch has accused the Myanmar government of the ""systematic and wide ranging persecution"" of the Rohingya who it also says have been the target of ethnic cleansing. Opinion: At last, a hero for democracy . Minister: Change needs time . Suu Kyi says she has been speaking out ""but it's just that they're not hearing what they want to hear from me."" ""I cannot doctor my answers to please everybody. I have to say what I believe in. And I believe that the rule of law is the first step towards any kind of solution to the problem in Rakhine State and other parts of the country."" ""We must get to the point of reassessing the law to see if it comes up to international norms or not."" She added, ""I would like all of the world to understand that we are aware of the difficulties in our country and we're doing our best to cope with it. When I say 'we,' I'm not talking about the government, I'm talking about ordinary people in Burma."" A government minister also on the panel said he agreed that the constitution had to change, but stressed that decades of military rule had created binds that would take time to unravel. ""We need time. We are in the dark ages. The other system was in place about 60 years. We have an idea to arrange for everything we have to change, but we need time,"" said Union Minister Soe Thane. ""We have to untie the rope. It's very difficult but we must do it. We must think about the democracy. We must think of the economic development of 60 million people.""

"(CNN) -- The mega-wealthy Mitt Romney foolishly said the issue of income inequality should be discussed ""in quiet rooms."" He was wrong about that -- and it would be wrong to discuss press freedom and national security in an off-the-record setting. It's kind of awkward to have a secret conversation about greater transparency. To their credit, media outlets like CNN, the New York Times, Fox News, The Associated Press and CBS have all refused to participate in such an off-the-record session. There is a better way: bring the conversation out into the public square. Attorney General Eric Holder, a principled, decent public servant, needs to listen to his better angels and hold a very public discussion about the issues that led his Justice Department to obtain the phone records of as many as 100 Associated Press journalists and name a Fox News reporter as a ""co-conspirator"" in a leaks case. As a former government official, I want my government to keep some things secret. Now, as a member of the media, I also want sunlight to disinfect as much as possible. Leaks truly can cost lives, and no member of the media should sugarcoat that reality or shirk their responsibility to public safety. And yet secretly pawing through phone records, targeting journalists, these actions are inconsistent with a truly free press. It is a balancing act, to be sure. But based on the reports we have seen, Holder's Justice Department has lost all balance. This continues a troubling trend. The Bush administration was no great friend of the free press -- and the media shamefully marched in near-lockstep to the deeply dishonest Bush-Cheney drumbeat for war in Iraq. Because our government deceived and our media (with some notable exceptions) didn't dig out the truth, America made what national security journalist and author Thomas Ricks has called ""the biggest mistake in the history of American foreign policy."" I wish there had been more leaks in the run-up to the Iraq War. And yet there have been times when I have seen what looks like operational details of counterterrorism efforts in the media and thought, ""Why didn't they keep that secret? Now al Qaeda knows what we're doing."" So how do we balance the right to publish against the responsibility to protect the nation? How do we walk the line between freedom and security? It is a question as old as the republic. And it is one that needs to be debated robustly -- and publicly. Holder should bring the whole debate out into the public square -- and the more public, the better. He should ask a high-powered group of leading public citizens to examine the issue fully and, if need be, loudly. Veteran journalists like NBC's Tom Brokaw and CNN's Bernard Shaw have covered war and peace for decades. Current practitioners like CBS's Mary Walsh, who covers the Pentagon expertly, and the Washington Post's Walter Pincus, who has deep sources in intelligence, might be asked. National security veterans like Leon Panetta, Bob Gates, Bob Kerrey and former CIA head Mike Hayden could give powerful voice to the very real threats posed by leaks. Former military officers like retired Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks have seen the intersection of intelligence and war-fighting, and I'd sure like to know the perspective of retired Gen. Stan McChrystal, whose military career was done in by incendiary comments by his staff to the press. Marquee names not only bring experience, they bring attention. Academics like Harvard's Tom Patterson (the Benjamin Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press; how perfect is that?) and NYU's Jay Rosen could perhaps contribute a less self-interested perspective than either the journos or the government officials. It's probably a mistake to name names, and I'm sure others can come up with a first-class lineup. But blue-ribbon panels sometimes get a bum rap. Far better to have this conversation, which goes to the heart of our democracy, in the open, on the record in full view of we, the people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Eric Holder under fire for Justice Department inquiry of media phone records .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the days immediately following the presidential election, Martin Mendez was in a blue funk. A Latino Republican, he watched with dismay as poll after poll revealed that not only did President Barack Obama win a second term in office, but he did so with a sizable portion of the Hispanic vote. The loss was especially painful for Mendez, who spent hours knocking on the doors of Hispanics around Denver in an effort to convince them to give the GOP a try. ""Out in the field in Denver, the comments I got ... the feedback was Mitt Romney's for the millionaires. We're these poor Hispanics, so we're going to vote for Obama because he's for the little guy,"" Mendez said, his voice full of exasperation. ""There is this class warfare game that Democrats play every single election cycle. We have to start now, reaching out now and not sit on the sidelines until the next cycle,"" he said. The growing influence of Latinos, blacks, women and young people in America is not a new story. Demographers have known that at some point the country would become more non-white than white. Social scientists knew that the American landscape was changing, and that change would begin to have profound impact on the nation's shifting identity. Seven ways religious diversity played in the election . Earlier this year, even Romney, in the secretly-recorded video where he attacked the so-called ""47%,"" understood what was going on. ""So we can capture women's votes, we're having a much harder time with Hispanic voters,"" he told a gathering of conservative donors. ""And if the Hispanic voting bloc becomes as committed to the Democrats as the African American voting bloc has in the past, why, we're in trouble as a party and, I think, as a nation."" For generations, those who knew politics predicted this change would happen one day. On Tuesday, it did. For several election cycles now, women have represented more than half of the electorate yet have been an under-appreciated voting bloc. Add to that the explosive growth of and increased political activism among Latinos, many of whom are younger, under 35. Then there is the generations-long fight for political gains among African Americans, helping culminate in the re-election of the nation's first black president. The growing political power among other minority groups and vocal youth vote has meant that the party these groups largely back -- Democrats -- netted huge gains during this election cycle. The New America: What the election teaches us about ourselves . The new American electorate, it seems, has arrived. And it may be spelling big trouble for Republicans. ""The minority groups that carried President Obama to victory are on track to become a majority of the nation's population by 2050,"" researchers Paul Taylor and D'Vera Cohn wrote in an analysis piece for the Pew Research Center. Taylor added that those groups account for 37% of the population, and cast ""a record 28% of the votes in the 2012 presidential election."" For the first time in the nation's history, women and minorities will hold the majority of the Democratic Party's House seats, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News. However, the Republican side of the aisle will remain largely white and male. Opinion: GOP voter suppression fueled black turnout . More women voted for Obama than Romney . While it is too early to tell what type of long-term impact these newly powerful Americans will have on the nature of politics, exit polling suggests their impact was felt in both top of the ticket, down-ballot races and state initiatives across the country. According to CNN's exit polls, 55% of women and 45% of men voted for Obama, while 44% of women and 52% of men voted for Romney. That level of female support for the president made an especially big impact in swing states like Ohio where the gender breakdown mirrored the national figures. Obama garnered 44% of the Hispanic vote, numbers which likely helped him in places with high Hispanic populations such as Nevada, Colorado and Florida. Over the next several generations, the wave of minority voters -- who, according to U.S. Census figures released earlier this year, now represent more than half of the nation's population born in the past year -- will become more of a power base in places like Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. That hold will extend across the Southwest all the way to California, experts say. The coming political revolution could result in a massive changing of the guard on nearly every level of government, potential cultural clashes from big cities to rural towns, and the type of political alliances that are now considered rare. ""I do think that the era that began with Ronald Regan where there was a conservative dominance powered by conservative voters and Southern whites. That era is over,"" said David Bositis, a senior political analyst, at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies. ""Any candidate that wants to run a campaign [now] only at whites is going to lose."" GOP problem: 'Their voters are white, aging and dying off' Obama failed to deliver on a first-term pledge to tackle comprehensive immigration reform. So moving forward, legislative battles over immigration will test the newfound political sway of minorities and the GOP's ability to redirect on the issue, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. ""This will be a test on whether or not Republicans get the message,"" Gillespie said, adding, ""Strategically, Obama needs to identify pro-immigration Republicans and get them on board pretty quickly. He's got to figure out which Republicans are hip and realize the game has got to change on immigration and help protect them (so) they feel comfortable enough to defect."" Both parties will also work with a Congress that has seen more women added to its ranks. How women ruled the 2012 election and where the GOP went wrong . In Congress, a record 20 women will hold U.S. Senate seats next yearâ€”including newly-elected Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, the first openly lesbian senator. The New Hampshire congressional delegation will be all female and, in Obama's home state of Hawaii, Democrat Mazie Hirono will represent the islands in the Senate. In Nebraska, Republican Sen.-elect Debbie Fischer will represent that state. However, there are still hurdles to overcome, said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University. ""Because of very clear and specific targeting, Democrats were able to win women,"" Lawless said. But, she continued, that ""doesn't mean that is how they govern. Moving forward in the direction that will improve women's social, economic and political autonomy takes time."" Analysis: Obama's new Democratic majority . Changes at the local level, too . A mix of ballot initiatives across the country suggests that, despite the political power gains among women and minorities, those groups are not always united on issues. And in places where those groups are outnumbered, state and local laws may not always favor their causes. In Florida, voters rejected a proposal that would have blocked state employees from using their health insurance for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is threatened. In Montana, voters passed a measure requiring parental notification before a doctor can perform an abortion on a minor aged 16 or younger. In Maryland, voters overwhelmingly passed a state version of the DREAM Act allowing undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition. In Montana, roughly 80% of voters approved blocking illegal immigrants from getting such state services as student aid and disability benefits. Maryland and Maine both passed marriage equality initiativesâ€”a topic that polling suggests is broadly supported among young voters in particular. Opinion: How GOP can attract Latino voters . The League of Young Voters, a group which targets non-college, minority youth and encourages them to vote, is especially excited by the demographic sea change. Over the next several election cycles, voters can expect to see topics such as immigration reform, climate change, marriage equality and improving juvenile incarceration rates become more of the public policy conversation, said the group's executive director Rob ""Biko"" Baker. ""Young people are extremely concerned about climate science and climate change .... a smart elected official will try and connect that with jobs packages, Baker said. ""There needs to be a big conversation about marriage equality. Young people are more tolerant of marriage equality."" As for Mendez, he's feeling a bit better following Thursday night's Colorado Hispanic Republicans dinner designed to reach out to Latinos. After all, he was once a Democrat who switched to the GOP after realizing the party was most closely aligned with his own views on abortion, guns and taxes. He's feeling a bit better that maybe others can be convinced to do likewise. ""The last two days, I've been down in the dumps about this election,"" he said. ""But today I'm excited. We don't have to move a mountain here, we just have to move a little bit."" Carville: GOP routed by reality .","The demographic sea change in political power is here, experts say .
Political gains among women, youth, and minorities will help shape the political conversation .

"(CNN) -- The leaders of the world's arguably two most powerful nations are due to meet Friday in southern California. President Barack Obama of the United States and President Xi Jinping of China will hold talks that could shape relations between Washington and Beijing for years to come. ""This is an attempt to set out the ground rules for how our two countries will work together in the 21st century,"" said Kurt Campbell, who recently served as U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Officials in Beijing are also trumpeting the potential importance of the event, the first time the two leaders have met in person since Xi became China's paramount leader. The meeting is of ""profound historic and strategic significance,"" Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said Thursday. The setting of the meeting, in the Sunnylands estate outside Los Angeles, is unusually informal and a far cry from the elaborately choreographed summits typically held between Chinese and American leaders. ""This is the first time in 50 years that leaders will sit down, somewhat unscripted, to have a real conversation about our relationship,"" Campbell said in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""It's long overdue and important."" Hacking allegations . The issues of cybersecurity and North Korea are expected to top the agenda. The United States has recently become more vocal about linking cyberattacks on American businesses and government agencies to Chinese authorities. The attacks allegedly to involve attempts to steal secret military and corporate technology and information. Beijing has repeatedly denied the accusations, saying that hacking is a global problem, of which China is also a victim. But the chorus of voices arguing that the Chinese stance is untenable is growing. ""In the past, rogue behavior such as cybertheft may have provided a shortcut to greatness,"" the editorial board of the Washington Post wrote this week. ""But no longer. If China fails to evolve toward more responsible behavior both abroad and at home, a backlash that is already forming in the United States and among its neighbors will swell."" Some observers, however, have noted that Obama will have to raise cybersecurity and spying issues with Xi against the unflattering backdrop of recent reports alleging widespread surveillance of phone and Internet data by U.S. intelligence agencies. North Korea . The two leaders may make progress on the North Korea question, according to Campbell. ""I think the Chinese have just about had it with North Korea,"" he said. ""They recognize that the steps that they have taken -- nuclear provocations -- are creating the context for more military activities on the part of the United States and other countries that ultimately are not in China's best strategic interests."" Tensions spiked on the Korean Peninsula in March and April as the North unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea. The menacing rhetoric came amid U.S-South Korean military drills and after the United Nations had stepped up sanctions on Pyongyang in response to the latest North Korean nuclear test in February. The U.S. officials called on China, North Korea's key ally, to rein in the provocative behavior of Kim Jong Un's regime. The situation in the region has become calmer in recent weeks. The clearest sign of a possible thaw in relations came Thursday when North and South Korea agreed to hold talks about reopening their shared industrial complex that Pyongyang shut down in April. OPINION: What Obama should tell China's Xi about North Korea . Previous meeting . Friday isn't the first time Obama and Xi have met. The two leaders held talks in Washington last year, while Xi still held the title of vice president. During that visit, in addition to the more formal engagements, the Chinese leader visited a small town in Iowa, where he had stayed in the 1980s, when he was a provincial official. He also took in a Lakers game in Los Angeles. OPINION: 'AmeriChina' looking for trust at the top .

"(CNN) -- There have been bigger storms before, with stronger winds. Still, Tropical Storm Andrea is already packing a wet wallop -- and it is expected to soak millions along the Eastern Seaboard by the time it runs its course. It still packed damaging winds. A woman in Palm Beach County, Florida, was seriously injured Thursday night when she was hit by debris from an oak tree that flew through a bedroom window, the National Weather Service in Miami said. Flash-flood warnings extended from the Sunshine State through coastal communities north to Virginia. An even broader swath of the East Coast -- including parts of 13 states, from Georgia to Maine -- is under flash-flood watches, meaning a sudden deluge of rain could overwhelm sewers, cause rivers and creeks to overrun their banks and more through the weekend. The watch area includes Washington, which the National Weather Service predicts could get up to 6 inches of rain Friday, and New York City, where forecasters say 1 to 2 inches of rain an hour could fall at times into Saturday. Even Maine's coast, including Portland, could see as much as 3 inches of rain by the time this weekend is done. Follow the storm on CNN.com's hurricane tracker . All this comes from a storm that, as it passed through the Gulf of Mexico, never ascended to hurricane status -- it needed to have sustained winds of 74 mph or more to get that honor -- and then weakened, as far as wind speeds, as it passed over land Thursday evening. As of 11 p.m. Thursday -- five hours after making landfall in the swampy, sparsely populated Big Bend region of Florida, about 180 miles north of Tampa -- Andrea was centered about 40 miles west of Jacksonville, Florida, and 65 miles east-southeast of Valdosta, Georgia. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, down substantially from when it made landfall, according to the National Hurricane Center. Despite warnings that storm surges plus torrential rains could equal major flooding, Taylor County Emergency Management Director Dustin Hinkel said Andrea was bringing precipitation and high winds, but little trouble. Predictions for 2013 Atlantic hurricane season . ""We've had good luck with the storm coming ashore during low tide, so we have had some very, very minor coastal flooding so far,"" Hinkel said. ""The rain has been very manageable here."" His county issued only a voluntary evacuation call as the storm neared, aimed at people living in mobile homes and older buildings, Hinkel said. No evacuations were ordered in Dixie County, to the south, said Tim Alexander, the emergency services director there. On Thursday night, a tropical storm warning extended from Flagler Beach, Florida, to Cape Charles Light, Virginia. It's also in effect for the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds and the lower Chesapeake Bay south of New Point Comfort, Virginia. Such a warning means that tropical storm conditions -- with sustained winds in excess of 39 mph -- are likely within the next 36 hours. The forecast calls for Andrea to keep its strength ""during the next day or so (before losing) its tropical characteristics by Saturday,"" the hurricane center says. Fast facts on hurricane season . Andrea chugged inland over northern Florida on Thursday night, with wind and rain bands ""spreading northward well ahead of the center,"" the Miami-based center reported.

"(CNN) -- Chrysler says it will recall 630,000 newer model Jeeps worldwide to fix a software glitch in its side airbag and seat belt mechanism and transmission fluid leak problems. No accidents or injuries happened because of these defects. But it refuses to recall 2.7 million older Jeep models with a fire hazard that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says caused more than 50 people to burn to death. Chrysler's refusal to comply with the highway administration's request to recall 2.7 million 1993 to 2004 Cherokee and 2002 to 2007 Liberty models puts profits over safety, putting people who ride in them everyday at risk of their car being hit from behind and going up in flames. These modern day Pintos for soccer moms have been involved in 37 rear-impact fatal fire crashes. Fifty-one people burned to death in those crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Compare that with the Ford Pinto: 26 people died in Pinto rear impact fires before it was recalled in 1978. A recall would cost Chrysler no more $300 million to fix the problems and return the SUVs. Chrysler would not exist today but for a $10 billion bailout loan from the U.S. government. As a return for the bailout, Chrysler should spend a fraction of that to recall the Jeeps. The refusal to recall these rolling firebombs is an insult to American tax payers and Chrysler's Jeep customers. The Grand Cherokee is 21 times more likely to be involved in a fatal rear impact crash in which fire is the cause of death than its biggest competitor, the Ford Explorer. The Jeep crashes in which people died in fires were readily survivable crashes. A rear impact crash at 70 mph in a vehicle similar in size to these Jeeps is no more severe than that of a front barrier crash at 35 mph, performed in the traffic administration's 5-Star Safety Ratings. Large seat backs spread the force of the crash better than small airbags, making 80 mph rear impacts survivable. But a car crashing into the rear of these Jeeps can rupture their fuel tanks at speeds less than the 50 mph rear-impact standard. The Center for Auto Safety conducted a 40 mph rear impact crash test of a 1996 Grand Cherokee in which the Jeep's tank ruptured and spilled all the fuel. The 50 mph standard has 35% more energy than the Center's 40 mph test. The Grand Cherokee and Liberty fuel tanks hang lower than the rear bumper, so they are particularly vulnerable to low-speed hits from vehicles that are lower to the ground. Many low-profile cars have sloping front ends that can directly hit the tank. Even 10 mph rear impacts crush the not-so-protective brush guard. In 1978, Chrysler engineers cited the safety benefits of placing the fuel tank in front of the rear axle and noted that placing the fuel tank behind the rear axle in SUVs may require a shield because of bumper mismatch. Chrysler moved the fuel tank in front of the rear axle in the 2005 Grand Cherokee and in the 2008 Liberty. There has not been a single fire death in a rear impact of the newer Jeeps with the more protected fuel tank location in all the years since. The devastating effect of the fire defects in these Jeep models is that children riding in the back of Jeeps have been killed and injured. Chrysler sold these Jeeps as family vehicles. Parents put their kids in child seats in the back because that's safer. Tragically, children have been trapped in the seats and suffered horrible burns and deaths because they could be pulled out in time. Fiat CEO John Elkann -- Chrysler is a subsidiary of Fiat -- and Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne are good people with families who should respond to the tragic deaths of their customers and could order a recall today. They owe it to the American public. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clarence Ditlow.","Chrysler recalls Jeeps for software fix, but not models in which 51 people burned to death .

"(CNN) -- The United States and the United Arab Emirates have signed a deal for a missile-defense system in the Persian Gulf country, the Pentagon said Friday. The $3.48 billion agreement was signed December 25, according to press secretary George Little. It was not clear why the deal was announced Friday. The vital Strait of Hormuz separates the UAE and Iran. The Obama administration said Iran has been ""saber-rattling"" over its threat to block the strait. The pact will deliver two anti-missile batteries, 96 missiles, radars, training and logistics to the UAE, the Pentagon said. ""Acquisition of this critical defense system will bolster the UAE's air and missile-defense capability and enhance the already robust ballistic missile-defense cooperation between the United States and the UAE,"" the Pentagon said. The two countries ""enjoy a strong bilateral defense relationship, driven by common interests in a secure and stable Gulf region,"" Little said in a statement. Raytheon Company said it will provide two radars and services through 2018 to the country.

"(CNN) -- A 24-year-old surfer was killed last weekend in a shark attack off the coast of Western Australia, marking the fifth such reported incident in ten months. The deaths have reopened the debate about our understanding of sharks and whether more should be done to control their population. How many shark attacks have occurred in Australia? Since 1791, there have been 689 unprovoked attacks recorded in Australia by the Australia Shark Attack File, 200 of which were fatal (29%). In the last decade, fatalities have occurred primarily in the states of New South Wales and Queensland, with the others in Western Australia and South Australia. Has there been a sudden increase in shark attacks in Western Australia? ""The events in Western Australia over the last two years are unusual in that they occurred in one state,"" said John West, curator of the Australian Shark Attack File and Manager of Life Sciences Operations at the Taronga Conservation Society Australia. Over the past century, there were five years that saw more than 10 annual fatalities, and eight years when five fatalities occurred over a two-year period, he said, citing the Australian Shark Attack File. At the same time, ""there is no scientific evidence to suggest that the shark-related fatalities in Western Australia are a reflection of an increase in the population size of white sharks,"" said Ryan Kempster, a shark biologist and founder of Support Our Sharks, reiterating his comments after the fourth attack. ""It is more likely a combination of factors, including more people in the water and white sharks being present around the southwest coast this time of year."" What brings sharks to Western Australia? The recent attacks are believed to involve white sharks. For millions of years, white sharks in particular have been migrating along the coast of Western Australia between feeding and possibly mating grounds, explained West. While they do not lie in wait for food at beaches, he said, white sharks are particularly inquisitive and will investigate floating objects, including cigarette packets, buoys, surfboards and humans. Historically, human encounters with sharks have typically occurred during the summer, West said. But due to improvements in wetsuit technology, people engage in water sports outside of the summer season and for longer periods, leading to shark encounters year-round. Should I be worried about future shark attacks? ""The chance of encountering a shark remains very low, and...even if an encounter occurs, the chances of being attacked are very small,"" said West. Over the last decade, an annual average of 16 shark encounters has been recorded, with 27% of cases resulting in no injury or death, he said. Comparing the figure with the annual average of 87 drowning deaths at Australian beaches, he commented, ""People should be more concerning with swimming at a beach than being killed in a shark attack."" ""It has been said that humans are not on the shark's menu -- they are just in the way!"" West added. ""History seems to support this observation."" ""Shark bite incidents are a rare occurrence and almost impossible to predict,"" Kempster said. ""People need to realize that when they enter the water they are taking a risk -- albeit minimal --of encountering a large predatory shark."" What are people doing wrong? Kempster urged beachgoers to have a sense of personal responsibility, as he pointed out that, ""after the most recent attack, there were surfers in the water at the same beach the attack occurred, even though there were clear signs warning people not to enter the water."" West echoed that people should avoid areas where dangerous sharks are known to gather, as well as far-offshore areas, deep channels, drop-offs to deeper water, and areas with poor underwater visibility. People should swim at beaches patrolled by Surf Live Savers and swim with companions (although not pets, as non-aquatic animals can attract sharks.) The Department of Fisheries recommends that all shark sightings should be reported to the water police. What is the Western Australia government doing to address the situation? The Department of Fisheries announced that it will spend AUD 13.65M (US$ 14M) over five years to research shark populations and movements and improve attack response procedures. This includes setting up the Shark Response Unit and extending its white shark monitoring program for two years under the unit, which includes tagging white sharks with acoustic transmitters to track their movements.","Five deaths from unprovoked shark attacks reported within ten months in Western Australia .

"(CNN) -- A medical helicopter crashed on its way to pick up an ailing child in southwestern Tennessee Tuesday morning, killing the pilot and two Memphis children's hospital workers, officials at the hospital said. The helicopter crashed around 6:20 a.m. near Somerville, about halfway between Memphis and the crew's destination of Bolivar, officials at Memphis' Le Bonheur Children's Hospital told reporters Tuesday morning. Killed were registered nurse Carrie Barlow, 43, of Halls; respiratory therapist Denise Adams, 43, of Arlington; and pilot Charles Smith, 47, of Eads, according to the hospital. The crew planned to pick up a boy who was in renal failure at a Bolivar hospital and take him to Le Bonheur, but the helicopter never reached the destination, Le Bonheur CEO Meri Armour said. Aerial video of the crash site from CNN affiliate WMC showed smoke rising from wreckage in a wooded area. Officials said they didn't have information about what led to the crash. ""They have taken care of so many kids in their short lives,"" Dr. Jay Pershad, medical director of Le Bonheur's air transport program, said of the crew Tuesday. ""I can't tell you how incredibly difficult it is for the entire team."" Medical helicopter crashes kill 3, hurt 4 and prompt more scrutiny . The boy who was supposed to be flown to Memphis was taken by ambulance to Le Bonheur Tuesday morning after officials learned of the helicopter crash, Armour said. The fatal crash is the second in roughly three years for Hospital Wing, the air ambulance service that operated the helicopter, company CEO Bill Conway said. In March 2010, three people died when a Hospital Wing helicopter crashed near Brownsville, Tennessee, authorities said at the time. In that 2010 crash, the helicopter was returning to Brownsville after dropping off a patient in Jackson, officials said. It's unclear what led to Tuesday's crash, Conway said, adding that the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. ""It saddens me more than you can know. All three of these crew members were personal friends of mine,"" he said. Hospital Wing serves hospitals in Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi, transporting about 150 patients a month, the company's website says. Le Bonheur Children's Hospital staff members go on about 400 helicopter flights a year, Pershad said. Medical helicopter crashes after taking patient to hospital .

"(CNN) -- They've mirrored each other at Merion. And now it looks like both Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy won't be in contention on the final day of the U.S. Open. Woods shot a six-over-par 76 Saturday on Merion's unforgiving East Course and McIlroy, second only to Woods in the world rankings, carded a 75. They were paired together for the third straight day, hitting identical 73s in first round and 70s in the second. While the top-ranked duo were only four shots behind co-leaders Phil Mickelson and Billy Horschel through two rounds, McIlroy had slipped a further two shots behind the clubhouse leader, Australia's Jason Day, and Woods was seven shots behind Day. It got worse after Mickelson, a five-time U.S. Open runner-up, completed his round and took a one-stroke overall advantage. McIlroy drifted to nine shots behind and Woods 10. It means Woods' wait to end his five-year drought at majors appears set to continue. Woods, bothered by a left arm injury he sustained en route to winning The Players Championship last month, raised hopes among his fans when he struck a birdie on the first hole. Woods, though, wouldn't hit another birdie for the rest of the round. Instead he registered seven bogeys. McIlroy, in search of a third major, wasn't much better, hitting one more birdie than Woods. The low scores at Merion have failed to materialize, and Sergio Garcia needed 10 shots to complete the par-4 15th hole. Despite the disastrous hole, he still managed to match McIlroy and shoot a 75 which left him tied for 44th with defending champion Webb Simpson. Garcia said he was heckled in the first round and a fan blurted out, ""fried chicken"" before he teed off at his first hole Saturday. It was a reference to the ""fried chicken"" jibe Garcia directed at Woods last month. Garcia issued a public apology and left Woods a note this week leading into the tournament. Day, the 2011 runner-up, ended the third round in eighth place after a two-under-par 68. He was overtaken by the late groupings as Mickelson carded 70 to be one-under 209 after 54 holes. Mickelson finished birdie-bogey, having dropped shots at 3 and 5 before recovering them at 10-11. ""I've had opportunities in years past, and it has been so fun, even though it's been heart-breaking to come so close a number of times and let it slide,"" said the four-time major winner, who turns 43 on Sunday. ""But I feel better equipped than I have ever felt heading into the final round of a U.S. Open. My ball striking is better than it's ever been. My putting is better than it has been in years, and I feel very comfortable on this golf course. I love it."" His fellow veteran Stricker matched that 70 to be tied for second alongside Ryder Cup teammate Hunter Mahan and South Africa's 2011 Masters winner Charl Schwartzel, who both shot 69. Former world No. 1 Luke Donald had been in the lead but the Englishman dropped a shot at 17 and double-bogeyed the final hole to fall back to 211 alongside compatriot Justin Rose -- who matched his 71 -- and Horschel. Horschel, playing his first major as a pro having missed the cut as an amateur back in 2006, played the difficult closing holes in par to sign for a 72. American Rickie Fowler carded the best round of the day, a four-birdie 67 which moved him up to ninth -- one shot ahead of leading amateur Michael Kim. Kim, born in South Korea but raised in San Diego, had been in a tie for third after firing four birdies in six holes but a horrendous finish -- bogey, double bogey, bogey -- meant he ended with a 71, five shots behind Mickelson. He is seeking to become the first amateur to finish in the top 10 since 1971, and the first to win the U.S. Open since 1933.","Tiger Woods cards a six-over-par 76 to fall further behind the leader at the U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's newly launched satellite marks a ""big deal"" for Pyongyang, the crossing of a major threshold and a public relations win for the secretive country's new leader, Kim Jong Un, experts say. The success, after years of failed attempts, triggered worries among world leaders about nuclear weapons, Iran and the balance of power in the Pacific. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the launch ""clear provocation."" Experts do not believe North Korea has a nuclear warhead small enough to fly on the kind of missile that Pyongyang has now proved it can send long-distance. And the United States believes the North Koreans may not have full control of the satellite they launched into space Wednesday, according to one U.S. official who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information. But the launch allowed the regime to flex its military and technological muscle on the world stage. Panetta told CNN he is ""very confident"" that if North Korea were to launch a missile at the United States, the U.S. military could guard against it. North Korea silences doubters, raises fears with rocket launch . ""Obviously the hope is that we never have to face that kind of threat,"" Panetta said. A central reason the United States is working to ""rebalance the Pacific"" is to deal with ""the threat from North Korea,"" he added. There is ""a path for North Korea to end its isolation, but that requires abiding by its international obligations,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. ""... It has chosen not to, and therefore, there will be consequences for that."" Washington is leading the global response, threatening to impose sanctions on Pyongyang like those that have helped devastate Iran's economy. Those efforts were under way Wednesday in Security Council meetings at U.N. headquarters in New York . ""Members of the Security Council condemned this launch,"" the council said in a statement, calling it ""a clear violation"" of previous resolutions -- including one in April that demanded North Korea halt any launches using ballistic missile technology. Success raises stakes for U.S. missile defense system . The council considers the issue urgent, the statement said. Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, called the statement one of the swiftest and strongest she had seen the council make about North Korea. ""Now we go into the second phase"" of discussions, she said: negotiations about what to do. China and Russia, North Korean allies and two of the council's permanent members, could exercise their veto power. The United States and other nations may impose unilateral measures, senior administration officials warned. But Pyongyang has ignored such threats before. New U.N. sanctions are unlikely, but the council might step up pressure on North Korea in other ways, said George Lopez, a professor with the University of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, who last year served on a U.N. panel of experts monitoring sanctions already in place against North Korea. The council's sanctions committee could add more North Korean entities to the sanctions list, he said. It could also do more to enforce sanctions already in place, for example by increasing inspections of cargo leaving North Korea to ensure no weapons technology is being shipped out. North Korea may not have 'full control' of satellite, U.S. official says . What the launch means . Wednesday's success was a breakthrough for the reclusive, nuclear-equipped state. North Korea ""could sell this technology to others, including Iran and Pakistan, who have been regular customers of North Korea's other missiles,"" warns Victor Cha, who analyzes the region for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""They still have other technological thresholds to cross (miniaturized warheads, reentry vehicle), but this was undeniably a major one."" The rocket blasted off from a space center on the country's west coast and delivered a satellite into its intended orbit, the North Korean regime said. The launch followed a botched attempt in April and came just days after Pyongyang suggested that a planned launch could be delayed. China reaction key as neighbors decry North Korea rocket launch . North Korea's previous claims of successful launches have been dismissed by the United States and other countries. But this time, a U.S. official confirmed that the object is in orbit. U.S. officials were looking into whether it is an operating satellite, the official said. The regime's state-run Korean Central News Agency said the satellite, named Kwangmyongsong-3, was ""fitted with survey and communications devices essential for the observation of the earth."" The satellite itself is probably not very sophisticated, said David Wright, a senior scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. The regime showed it in April, and it was a small box with solar panels and a simple camera with some basic communication devices, he said. Opinion: Name and shame China over North Korea launch . He compared it to Sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite that Russia launched into space in 1957. The value lies in the launch rather than in the object that North Korea now has floating above the Earth, Wright said. The regime doesn't ""really care so much what's in it."" It's a statement, Wright said. In Japan and South Korea, people will hear about North Korea's achievement -- and will probably be struck by its power, he said. Any show of might can help strengthen North Korea's position in international talks on numerous issues, including nuclear negotiations. The South Korean government said the launch was confrontational and a ""threat to the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the world."" Japan called it ""intolerable."" The cost of launching a rocket . Iran praises the launch as much of the world assails it . Iran, meanwhile, praised North Korea's move. Gen. Masoud Jazaeri, a senior Iranian military official, expressed happiness about the launch, the semiofficial Fars News Agency reported. ""Experience has shown that independent countries, by self-confidence and perseverance, can quickly reach the height of self-sufficiency in science and technology. Hegemonic powers, such as the United States, are unable to stop the progress of such countries,"" he said. China expressed regret that the launch had taken place, noting ""concerns among the international community."" ""We hope relevant parties stay calm in order to maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" said Hong Lei, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. Several governments criticized Pyongyang's decision to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on its rocket program rather than on assisting its poor, malnourished population. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he deplored the fact that North Korea ""has chosen to prioritize this launch over improving the livelihood of its people."" The North's failed launch in April ended a deal for the United States to provide thousands of tons of food aid to the country. In his father's footsteps . ""I think this is very important to Kim Jong Un to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people,"" said James Schoff, a North Korea specialist with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""He is doing this despite the fact that he knows he is going to come into a lot of criticism in the region for it."" The launch has taken place during a period of power consolidation for Kim in which he has purged senior military officers in an apparent effort to stamp his authority on the regime's leadership. ""If Kim Jong Un pulls off a successful long-range missile test, it's a very important signal saying that 'Yes, I, Kim Jong Un, have replaced the powerful generals,' "" said John Park, a Stanton junior faculty fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""It shows that 'I have found the right balance and I am now in charge.' "" Opinion: One small step for Kim Jong Un . The launch also ties in with important dates for the regime's ruling dynasty. Pyongyang had said this rocket launch would be ""true to the behests"" of Kim Jong Il, the late North Korean leader and father of Kim Jong Un. Kim Jong Il died on December 17 last year, so the rocket launch took place just days before tearful mourners are expected to gather for the first anniversary of his death. Experts had also speculated that North Korea wanted this launch to happen before the end of 2012, the year that marks the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Another factor may also be at play: The launch took place ahead of national elections in Japan on Sunday and in South Korea on December 19. North Korea is a crucial foreign policy issue in both of those countries. The rocket took off Wednesday morning and flew south over Japan's Okinawa islands. There were conflicting reports about how many parts fell into the sea. Read more: What does North Korea's planned rocket launch mean? A launch had seemed unlikely to take place so soon after North Korea announced Monday that it was extending the rocket's launch window into late December, citing technical issues with an engine. Previous attempts by the North in 1998, 2006, 2009 and April of this year failed to achieve their stated goal of putting a satellite into orbit and provoked international condemnation. The rockets launched in 1998 and 2009 flew for hundreds of kilometers but didn't succeed in deploying satellites, other countries and experts said at the time. North Korea nonetheless insisted that both satellites did reach orbit, with KCNA reporting that they were transmitting ""immortal revolutionary"" songs back to Earth. The 2006 launch failed soon after takeoff and wasn't reported by state media. In April, the North Korean regime invited members of the international news media, including CNN, into the country to observe the preparations for its planned launch. But the strategy backfired when the rocket broke apart shortly after blasting off. On that occasion, state media took the unusual step of admitting the launch's failure.

"CNN -- Lew Frankfort is widely credited with helping transform a stodgy old leather goods company into a fashion icon. Coach was founded in New York City in 1941, an old-world firm cranking out hard leather brief cases. But it wasn't until a major overhaul in the 1990's that the company caught the eyes of the fashion world, introducing so-called ""affordable luxury"". Lew Frankfort, CEO, Coach. Since then, Lew Frankfort has expanded the brand from trendy hand bags to gloves, and other accessories, bringing his by-the-numbers management style to the fickle world of fashion. CNN's Maggie Lake interviewed Lew Frankfort and started by asking him what had prepared him for a life in the fashion world and how much he cared about clothes and trends in his youth. Frankfort: When I was young I didn't have the slightest clue about brands. I actually was more interested in the social movements of the 1960's, the civil rights movement, the anti-war movement and found myself in government actually for ten years after college before I came to Coach. Lake: So, how did you make the transition to the world of fashion? Frankfort: What I joined was really just a manufacturer of leather products. Over the years, we migrated to become a modern lifestyle fashion accessories brand and I guess I just learned along the way. Lake: How do you stay on top in a very fickle world of fashion because that's what you're dealing with now? Frankfort: One of the ways we think at Coach is as a company that is run as a blend of logic and magic. Magic is the touch and feel and instinct of good product, good looking product, of understanding trends, and logic is using all of the knowledge that is available to you, so you can really understand where consumers are today and where they're going tomorrow. So, for example, we do a considerable amount of quantitative research, measuring attitudes and trends in the marketplace, purchase satisfaction and satisfaction with our visits. Lake: Some people said that you have democratized luxury, made it accessible to more people. Is that how you see it? Frankfort: We actually see Coach as an egalitarian brand. America is really a melting pot of the world and we don't have a class system in America. Anyone can be anything in America. Lake: Is there a risk by making your products very accessible that somehow you cheapen them? I mean if everybody has it, what's so special about it? Frankfort: Some consumers perceive us as the penultimate luxury and other consumers step down to buy a Coach. We like it that way, and we like to have a broad array of price points that can appeal to an aspirational consumer who can just enter the world of Coach with a small accessory for as little as $28, or to the aficionado we offer $10,000 exotic handbags. Lake: Do you think that recipe can work globally? Frankfort: It is working globally. We are very successful in Japan, in Korea, and emerging markets such as Thailand and Indonesia and in developing countries. We're a very desirable alternative to the European luxury brands because our price points are less than half of their price points; yet, the materials are the very same materials that go into their products and ours are at least as well-made. Lake: What do you worry about? What keeps you up at night? Frankfort: Honestly, everything keeps me up at night, but I think I am primarily a serial worrier. I worry about the current situation and more often than not now it's about people, it's about the next generation in leadership, it's about how I can fill organizational voids.

"Tongchang-ri, North Korea (CNN) -- As North Korea presses forward with a controversial rocket launch, journalists were granted a rare glimpse Sunday of the reclusive country's preparations. CNN was part of a group taken to the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri, in the northwest part of the country. North Korea announced last month that it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite between April 12 and 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the Communist state. His birthday on April 15, known as the ""Day of the Sun,"" is a key public holiday in the North Korean calendar. Pyongyang says the operation is for peaceful purposes, but Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. Firing the long-range rocket would breach U.N. Security Council resolutions, and Washington has suspended a recent deal to provide food aid to North Korea as a result. Japan has said it will shoot down any part of the rocket that enters its territory. ""If you look for yourselves with your own eyes, then you can judge whether it's a ballistic missile, or whether it's a launch vehicle to put a satellite into orbit,"" Jang Myong Jin, head of the launch site, said through a translator. ""That's why we've invited you to this launch site."" Journalists -- who were not allowed to take laptops or cell phones to the site, but were permitted to film -- were shown the control center and the satellite that officials said would be shot into space. The rocket itself is 30 meters, or about 100 feet, long. It was white, with some red and blue paint. International leaders have urged North Korea to cancel the launch, but Pyongyang has refused to back down, insisting that the operation is for scientific purposes. The last time Pyongyang carried out what it described as a satellite launch, in April 2009, the U.N. Security Council condemned the action and demanded that it not be repeated. An independent European analyst who visited the launch site said he saw nothing obvious that raised red flags. ""I don't know what they want to do in the future, but today what we see is a space launcher,"" said Christian Lardier.","North Korea says it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite this month .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-three years ago, Scott Silverman found himself at an open, 44th-story window, on the brink of suicide. Two decades of escalating substance abuse, blackouts and depression had brought him to this moment. Scott Silverman started Second Chance to help people in shelters, the homeless and inmates leaving prison. ""I didn't think of myself as depressed, but then my drinking got so bad at the end, I felt my life was over,"" Silverman recalled. Just then, a colleague entered the room and asked him what he was doing. Silverman entered rehab the next day and has been sober ever since. Fast forward to 2008. Silverman has turned not only his own life around but also the lives of thousands of others. Rehab and volunteering brought him close to a community of others in need: people in shelters, those who were homeless, others who had come out of jail. They all shared one problem, Silverman saw: They were unable to find and keep a job. ""I thought, I've been in treatment, I've lost jobs, but I got lucky and had a very supportive family. I had to find a way to help them more effectively,"" he said. The vehicle for that assistance is his Second Chance program in San Diego, California. It provides job readiness training, housing for sober living, and mental health and employment support services for what Silverman calls a ""difficult-to-serve"" population. Started in 1993, Second Chance has provided services to more than 24,000 individuals. It helps graduates with job placement and follows up with them for two years. Of 219 Second Chance graduates in 2004, 169 found employment, the organization says. Three-quarters of them remained employed two years later. One key to its success, Silverman said, is that the Second Chance program begins with transitional, sober-living housing for its clients. ""You've got to have an address to get a job, and you have to have a job to keep an address,"" he said. ""I started with a little tiny house that we rented downtown, and in 2008 we have eight single-family homes and our main office where all the programs are run.""  Watch Silverman describe the moment that changed his life » . As part of its work, Second Chance targets those leaving prison. California has one of the highest repeat-offender rates in the country. Nearly two of three released inmates return to state prisons within three years. Silverman's staff regularly enters the California correctional system to introduce their services to prisoners anticipating parole. Those who are accepted into his program are transported to sober-living housing the day they're released and given 60 days of immediate free housing, clothing, incidentals and enrollment in job readiness training. Anthony Panarella is an ex-convict who recently graduated from Silverman's prisoner re-entry employment course. There, he learned how to write a resume and cover letter as well as how to stand out in a job interview. ""This is a big accomplishment for me."" he said. ""I've never finished anything all the way through ever in my life. I'm going to make it.""  Watch Panarella describe his transition from prison life » . To Silverman, that attitude is what convinces employers to take on those who otherwise face significant barriers to finding work. ""We send in individuals job-ready, smiling, professionally dressed and ready to go to work,"" Silverman said. ""We work with employers. We make repeat referrals and they make repeat hires. So we're their partner, and that makes a big difference."" The city agrees. Last month, San Diego declared one day as ""Scott Silverman Day."" Panarella says it's a much deserved honor.

"(CNN) -- The old met the new. At one end of the court, the young man nicknamed ""Baby Federer"" -- at the other was one of the all-time tennis greats, albeit one who is battling to show that he's not a spent force. One of them has 77 career titles, but only one this year, while the other -- a former top-ranked junior -- won his first on the ATP Tour last weekend. And after losing the first two games, despite a vociferous home backing, it certainly looked like Roger Federer might be headed for another disappointing defeat. But the Swiss legend battled back to show why he is the holder of a record 17 grand slam titles as he denied Grigor Dimitrov -- 10 years younger at 22 -- a famous victory in Basel. Federer, now ranked a comparatively lowly sixth by his high standards, eventually triumphed 6-3 7-6 (7-2) against the Bulgarian as he also came from behind in the second set to force the tie-break. ""It was very important to win in two sets,"" said Federer, who notched his 50th win in his home city event -- a feat he had previously managed only in the four majors. ""There were a lot of free gifts out there in some games. When I saved three set points I just told myself to play one point at a time and hope to get there. ""I broke him and that made it difficult for him. I was able to come through well in the tiebreaker. It always feels good to win at home."" If Federer can next beat Canada's Vasek Pospisil in the semifinals of the Swiss Indoor s event and then win it for a record-extending sixth time, he will qualify for the ATP World Tour Finals in London with one tournament to spare -- next week's Paris Masters. See the similarities between Federer and Dimitrov . That there has been doubt Federer might not participate in next month's season-ender -- a tournament he has won six times since 2003 -- is a measure of how much he has struggled this year. If 2012 was his return to the top, a year in which he won Wimbledon a record-equaling seventh time, regained the No. 1 ranking and broke the milestone for most weeks at the summit, then 2013 has been a major comedown. After reaching the semifinals at January's Australian Open, he lost in the quarters at Roland Garros, the second round at Wimbledon and in the last 16 in New York. Injuries and experiments with new rackets have taken the edge off his once invincible aura, giving players like Dimitrov real hope that they can claim a never-to-be-forgotten scalp. But not this time. Federer will next face a 23-year-old ranked 40th in the world, with a 17-16 record this year. But Pospisil is showing a return to the form that helped him beat world No. 6 Tomas Berdych in Montreal in August, reaching his third ATP Tour semifinal this season with a 7-6 (11-9) 6-4 win over Croatia's Ivan Dodig. Saturday's other semi will be between defending champion Juan Martin del Potro, who beat Federer in last year's final, and Frenchman Edouard Roger-Vasselin. Del Potro, who has already qualified for one of the eight places in London, became just the sixth Argentine to register 300 career wins as he defeated qualifier Henri-Paul Mathieu 6-4 6-4. The world No. 5, who now has a record of 300-120, is seeking his fourth title this year. Meanwhile, world No. 3 David Ferrer continued the defense of his Valencia Open title by reaching the semifinals with a 6-4 4-6 6-0 win over Polish fifth seed Jerzy Janowicz. The Spaniard will next play compatriot Nicolas Almagro, while Russians Mikhail Youzhny and Dmitry Tursunov will contest the other semi.","Roger Federer reaches semifinals of his home Swiss Indoors tournament .

"(CNN) -- A return to democracy hung in the balance in impoverished Mali on Wednesday as supporters of the West African nation's military coup leader clamored for him to head the interim government. Capt. Amadou Sanogo's supporters called for the resignation of Dioncounda Traore, who was beaten and rushed to a hospital with head injuries after hundreds of protesters stormed the presidential palace Monday. Traore, 70, left Mali on Wednesday for medical treatment in Paris, said a presidential aide who did not want to be named for security reasons. Bamako, the capital, was calm but tense Wednesday evening amid a strong police and military presence. ""The people want Sanogo to come back for the transition of power,"" said El Hadj Bamba Mohammed, a spokesman for one of the groups backing Sanogo. Traore's term as interim president had been set to expire Tuesday. However, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which has tried to broker a return to civilian rule after the March 22 coup, decided to let Traore remain in charge for a year to oversee a transition back to democracy. That deal included recognizing Sanogo as former head of state, with a salary and mansion. Over the weekend, Sanogo agreed to abide by the decision. But his supporters stood defiantly against the regional bloc. Mali experienced two decades of democratic rule and was hailed as an example of African stability. But it plunged into chaos after the coup that ousted President Amadou Toumani Toure from power. Sanogo and his fellow officers complained that Toure had failed to properly equip soldiers battling a growing insurgency by separatist Tuareg rebels in the country's north. Tuareg rebels capitalized on the trouble in Bamako in the south and took over chunks of territory in the north. Islamists now control two-thirds of the country, and many fear they will benefit further from delays in transitioning back to civilian rule. Protesters said Traore, a former parliamentary speaker, was part of a self-serving political elite that has misruled the country for years. ""People have no faith in the politicians to organize elections and resolve the situation in the north,"" said Youssouf Kone, the leader of several groups demanding the president's resignation. ""That's why they want Sanogo to return to power in the role of president,"" Kone said. John Campbell, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the perceived elite includes French speakers, ""movers and shakers"" and those with access to government contracts and the economy. ""Those elites and the institutions through which they work is not seen as very relevant by the mass of people in Bamako,"" Campbell said. ""You are talking about poor, marginalized people as seeing the military as grounds for hope."" The African policy expert said the United States will continue to support pressure by ECOWAS on the military junta. That could come in the form of financial sanctions, as was the case in 2011 against former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo. Mali, which does not have a robust economy or array of natural resources, could especially feel the pinch. ""It's intrinsically one of the poorest countries in the world,"" said Campbell. ""The country is going into a major food security issue because of the ongoing drought."" In the north, Islamist rebels destroyed a monument to those who died in the struggle against dictator Moussa Traore in 1991. ""This is very serious,"" said Ousmane Halle, mayor of the fabled city of Timbuktu, now under the control of Ansar Dine, a militant group that seeks to impose strict Sharia, or Islamic law. Witness Sankoum Sissoko said the rebels attacked the monument Tuesday evening, shouting: ""Shame on all those who don't believe in Allah."" Earlier this month, Islamists burned a tomb listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. A vast country of few inhabitants (15 million) and searing desert, Mali lies at an awkward intersection in Africa. To the north is a 1,200 kilometer border with Algeria, to the east Niger with its own restive Tuareg minority, to the west Mauritania. Derek Henry Flood, a geopolitical analyst based in New York, said the Tuareg rebellion is a direct result of the Libyan war. Well-armed Tuareg separatists who sought refuge in Libya and fought for Moammar Gadhafi's regime returned to Mali after he was overthrown and killed. ""His legacy is alive and well in the secession and Sharia (law) movement in Mali,"" said Flood. The analyst said Sanogo's objectives are not clear: ""Is he trying to buy time for himself to stay in power for some time?"" Like Campbell, Flood questioned how a group of protesters were able to invade the palace and severely beat Traore. ""Was that allowed to happen?"" Flood asked. ""Was the presidential security that weak?"" Problems in the capital appear to be having little impact on three northern regions under rebel control, said Campbell. An area the size of Texas is now beyond the government's control. ""While all of this chaos is going on in Bamako, nothing is being done to send troops back to retake the north,"" said Flood. Leaders of Ansar Dine and the secular National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, or MNLA, even with their divergent agendas, may be coming to an accord on ruling the north, according to Flood, adding Ansar Dine may be connected to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The nightmare scenario for Western governments is that without the rapid re-establishment of civilian rule, parts of northern Mali, southern Algeria and Mauritania could become a safe haven for al Qaeda in the same way the group has exploited power vacuums in Yemen and Somalia. Mali, with all of its competing interests, is not seeing a power vacuum, Flood said. ""I would call it a power jumble."" Katarina Höije reported from Bamako, Mali. CNN's Phil Gast reported from Atlanta. CNN's Tim Lister contributed to this report.","NEW: Experts detail complexity of political, military situation .

"(CNN) -- A recent cell phone video of two Philadelphia police officers during a stop-and-frisk has caught the attention of online viewers and the American Civil Liberties Union -- and the police department itself, which says it its investigating. The over-16-minute long YouTube video dated September 27 depicts two male Philadelphia police officers confronting two unidentified pedestrians, one of whom recorded the incident on his cell phone. It is unclear who posted the video online, but police have not challenged its authenticity. Despite the lengthy and often caustic questioning of the men, they are allowed to walk away by the officers. The video begins with a police vehicle slowing down as one officer is heard saying, ""Yo, my man,"" before the vehicle comes to a complete stop. ""How you doing sir?"" one of the pedestrians replies, as the officer in the passenger seat of the vehicle opens his car door and steps out on to the street. After inquiring whether the pedestrians have identification or live in the area, the second officer exits the vehicle and joins them on the sidewalk. One pedestrian asks, ""What seems to be the problem?"" as the other says he is on his way to work. The officers then begin questioning why the pedestrians said ""hi"" to a third, unseen individual on the street before the video begins. ""You don't say 'hi' to strangers,"" one officer remarks. After one pedestrian disagrees with this, both officers immediately restrain his arms and push him up against the police vehicle. The pedestrian recording the confrontation on his cell phone attempts to walk away from the scene but is stopped by an officer who tells him to put his phone away because he is ""under investigation."" The phone is placed down on the ground facing the sky and continues to record audio. ""Investigation of what? I was walking,"" the pedestrian argues, prompting the officer to reply, ""That's not what I saw,"" later threatening, ""If you keep running your mouth I'll split your wig open."" After examining the pedestrian's ID, the officer interrogates him on his legal past. The pedestrian admits to being arrested once for fighting. ""That's it?"" the officer responds sounding surprised. The officer begins asking questions about the pedestrian's cell phone and whether or not he is being recorded, taking the phone and turning it around to face the ground, the audio continues to record but the image is constricted. ""Are you accusing me of robbing somebody?"" the pedestrian asks. ""I didn't accuse you of anything can you hear?,"" the officer shouts, ""We could've got a call, that somebody wearing the clothes that you're wearing just robbed somebody, that's why we stopped you. Is that wrong of us?"" The officer then yells to the other pedestrian who was last seen being pushed up against the police car a few feet away, ""Why don't you shut up?"" ""Everybody thinks they're a (expletive) lawyer and they don't know jack (expletive),"" the officer continues to yell. After next accusing the two pedestrians of jaywalking, the officers can be heard returning the pedestrians' belongings and allowing them to leave. The video ends after this. The video is titled ""Police unlawful harassment and racial profiling,"" but the race of the men who were stopped was not specified in the video. According to Mary Catherine Roper, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU in Pennsylvania, there is no investigative purpose for humiliation and verbal abuse in such a situation, even if this particular stop was for an adequate reason. ""You do not call people trash, you do not call them a burden on society, you don't threaten to split their wig. It went way beyond what a stop is supposed to be,"" Roper said, making references to remarks by the officers during the stop. Philadelphia Police Department's Internal Affairs is conducting an investigation into the officers' actions as seen in the video, according to public affairs spokesman Lt. John Stanford. ""The Department takes this very serious and we don't tolerate unprofessional or distasteful behavior by any member of this department,"" Stanford said in a statement this week. Police will not release the two men's identities or the names of the two male officers who stopped them, according to public affairs spokesperson Officer Jillian Russell. While it's unclear whether the pedestrian who recorded the video is also the person posting it online, that's not significant to the investigation, Russell said. This is not the first time Philadelphia police practices have been under scrutiny. In 2010, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the Philadelphia Police Department for stopping pedestrians without reasonable suspicion. Rather than litigating, the city chose to negotiate and in June 2011 it consented to a ""mirror monitoring program,"" in which prosecutors reviews police-stop material from a random, selection of records collected quarterly, Roper said. Since reviewing the stop material, Roper found that 45% of pedestrian stops do not have a legally adequate reason. Roper said examples of an inadequate reason are ""loitering"" or ""acting suspiciously."" ""My favorite one was a man who was carrying a chair,"" she said. ""(The police) assumed he had stolen it."" While Roper has seen a decrease in the number of stops since she started reviewing the city's police stop material, that doesn't indicate whether the stops are being conducted lawfully, she said. In fact, it might mean for the department to retrain officers on not just when it's appropriate to stop pedestrians but also how to appropriately conduct a stop, which the ACLU may decide to request, she said. Roper said she strongly believes police officers want to do the right job when the department's expectations are made clear to them, but an ""ingrained police practice"" will not be a quick fix. ""An attitude is far more difficult to change,"" she said.","Two Philadelphia police officers stop two men on a city street .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Singer Bobby Brown is headed to jail next month to serve a 55-day sentence imposed for his second drunken driving conviction in a year. The jail time is stiffer because his driver's license was suspended after he pleaded no contest last summer to another charge of driving under the influence, the Los Angeles city attorney's spokesman said. Brown, 44, spent time in a ""confidential rehabilitation center"" last August as part of his plea deal for the April 2012 arrest. The judge ordered Brown to attend at least three Alcoholics Anonymous sessions each week until he reports to the Los Angeles County jail on March 20, according to the city attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan. Brown was not in court Tuesday when his lawyer entered his guilty plea on charges of driving under the influence, driving on a suspended license and violating his probation for the earlier conviction. A lawyer for the singer said he has accepted responsibility, and is committed to his sobriety. ""Brown is pleased that the matter has been resolved,"" attorney Christopher Brown said in a statement. The judge imposed 10 days in jail for the drunken driving offense, 10 days for the suspended license conviction and 35 days for the probation violation, according to Mateljan. His probation was extended to four years, Mateljan said. A Los Angeles police officer smelled ""a strong scent of alcohol"" when he approached Brown during the Ventura Boulevard traffic stop last October, a police spokesman said. He was arrested after a field sobriety test, the spokesman said. Brown was previously married to Whitney Houston, whom he divorced in 2007. He has one daughter, Bobbi Kristina, from his relationship with Houston, as well as three other children. Houston died a little more than a year ago. Brown, who has been touring with his R&B group, New Edition, released ""Masterpiece,"" his first solo album in 14 years, last June.

"(CNN) -- Being coach of a nation's football team brings enormous responsibility. The stakes are high, and the weight of expectation is even greater. Some say, for instance, that the England manager's job is second only in importance to the British Prime Minister's role -- and Roy Hodgson has already been subject to intense scrutiny before his first match in charge against Norway in this weekend's Euro 2012 warmup match. But though undeniably demanding, Hodgson's job is arguably a walk in the park compared to the task facing Kevin McGreskin. On another island group, half a world away -- and light years in terms of sporting and economic development -- the Scottish coach is getting to grips with turning a tiny nation's team into one recognized by football's governing body FIFA. Hodgson may have the splendor of Wembley Stadium for home games, but Kiribati's main pitch has more sand than grass. Part of the Commonwealth, Kiribati is made up of 33 coral islands about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii, with a population of just over 100,000. It is one of the world's poorest countries and the World Bank ranks it as having a gross domestic product only greater than that of Tuvalu. Who are European football's ""Most Valuable Players?"" McGreskin, recently appointed as the Kiribati Football Association's technical director and head coach, has worked closely with a number of professional clubs in the UK as well as helping deliver coaching courses for European football's governing body UEFA. He must also be the only coach who holds the prestigious UEFA ""A"" License qualification through three different national associations -- England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland -- after deciding to research different approaches to the courses. He is likely to need that raft of qualifications given that Kiribati suffered two 17-1 defeats at the 2011 Pacific Games. ""One of my aims now is to make us more competitive at international level within the Pacific region,"" McGreskin told CNN, laughing at the suggestion he has taken on the toughest coaching job in the world. ""While achieving this will improve the status of the national team I also think this will be a very important for the development of game in the country as a whole, as it will offer the young players something positive to aspire to."" While Hodgson's time will be taken up by analyzing the teams England will face at Euro 2012, handling the egos of millionaire players and enduring the barbed comments of a critical media, McGreskin's job description extends to helping the Kiribati Football Association find a sponsor and a kit supplier. Oh, and given that it is a low-lying Pacific island, global warming could possibly be a concern down the line. ""Generating this funding will determine how we can implement a range of programs at various levels to really move the game forward in the country,"" said McGreskin. His plan to rejuvenate Kiribati will evolve literally one game at a time. ""This year we plan to participate in an international fixture against Fiji, one of our 'local' neighbors, in July and this will require us to raise considerable sponsorship to achieve this,"" said McGreskin. Big-spending Man City top EPL value table . There is also the small matter for McGreskin of helping the Kiribati FA win FIFA recognition, which would allow the islanders to play in international competitions and be eligible to receive funding from football's global governing body. ""Our recent application was unsuccessful but this will be an ongoing process for us,"" said McGreskin. ""However, while delivering this disappointing news FIFA also promised some assistance in our efforts to develop the game. ""This will be a great help to us and we will continue working towards meeting the membership criteria. It is the country's ultimate ambition to compete in the World Cup qualifiers."" Of Kiribati's 33 islands, 21 are inhabited -- though most of its population is based in the Gilbert Islands. Thirty-two are atolls (ring-shaped islands with a central lagoon) while Banaba is a raised coral island. Player selection is also a challenge, with just 2,351 registered male players over the age of 18 in Kiribati and only 468 women players. The islands extend 2,400 miles from east to west, so McGreskin also faces a travel headache as he scouts for talent. ""The land mass of the country may be small but it is spread out over a huge area, so it offers a fairly unique logistical problem -- particularly if you need to implement a regular league season,"" he said. ""There is a huge passion for the game in the country and although there isn't much room for football pitches, there is still at least one on each of the islands. ""This means that the pitches that are available are played on almost all of the time, which means the surfaces aren't the best."" Surrounded by palm trees, Kiribati's Bairiki National Stadium looks about as idyllic a location as you could want from a football ground, but with one small hitch -- it does not have much grass. Indeed it has so little, the pitch could double up as a beach. ""The installation of a 3G all-weather pitch would be of huge benefit to us on the main island as it would be used regularly and mean less wear on our stadium pitch, which would give us the chance to maintain it to international standard, and help us achieve our ambition of hosting a home international match,"" added McGreskin. ""Maybe this is one of the projects FIFA can help us with."" McGreskin might not be a household name but he is quietly establishing a reputation as one of Britain's more innovative coaches. He believes that for too long England has been coaching players in ""pretty much the same way, but expecting the end product to be different and thinking somehow talent will magically appear."" An advocate of overload training -- a method which encourages players to concentrate on doing several things at once -- he has devised one exercise in which players have to throw a tennis ball and call out colors while they are passing a football in sequence. ""We are not providing players with the challenges that they need to meet the demands of the modern game,"" said McGreskin, who has been working with Scottish professional team Partick Thistle this season. ""Overload exercises help the player speed up the feet and the thought process."" McGreskin believes players' decision-making is often not quick enough, a weakness that is caused by their inability to scan the pitch when they are without the ball. ""Don't forget almost 98% of the game is played off the ball. Even in a basic passing drill I force the players to work on perception, scanning skills, technique, adjustability, concentration, attention focus and attention bandwidth. It's quite amazing the effect it can have on players."" So does McGreskin have any advice for Hodgson ahead of Euro 2012? ""In one word: win,"" he said bluntly. "" I think that has become almost only thing that matters for a coach at that level of the game. ""England don't just want to be in a position to participate in the Euros and World Cups, they want to be competing and seriously challenging for the trophy. ""However, I also think people like to see a steady stream of young talent coming through that also offers hope for the future. So, while the England manager's focus is on the full team, I think he should be actively interested in the development squads at both international and club level.""","Roy Hodgson takes charge of England team for first time against Norway on Saturday .

"(Mental Floss) -- Earlier this summer, New York City's Metropolitan Transit Authority announced that it would be rearranging some of its subway signs because they resembled a slightly naughty bit of internet slang. The signage for the F, M, and L lines read ""FML,"" which savvy web users know as self-deprecating shorthand for ""F -- My Life."" The double meaning of its signs caught the transit authority off guard, but they've worked quickly to switch around the letters. New York's subways are hardly the first victims of acronym problems, though. Let's take a look at ten other organizations, places, and businesses that have realized a bit too late that their initials meant a little more than they had intended. Mental Floss: 11 regional soft drinks . 1. WTF . In 2009, the Wisconsin Tourism Federation's biggest problem wasn't finding a way to attract more people to the metropolitan Kenosha area; it was the realization that its initials mirrored the slang abbreviation for ""What the F--?"" The WTF from America's Dairyland has been around since 1979, so it likely predates the vulgar WTF. In the end, though, you can't fight an internet meme. The organization changed its name to the Tourism Federation of Wisconsin. The WTF's only consolation must be that it's not alone. In 2008, the North Carolina DMV allowed drivers whose license plates contained ""WTF"" to swap out their tags free of charge. The DMV also had to change its website; the sample plate pictured on the site was ""WTF-5505."" Mental Floss: Why soap operas look so different? 2. DOA . In a move that must have been unsettling for thousands of Iowa's seniors, the state changed the name of its Department of Elder Affairs to the Department on Aging, or DOA, in 2009. Something's telling us that the change hasn't helped Iowa's elderly sleep any easier. The organization now goes by IDA, for Iowa Department on Aging. Mental Floss: People who switched careers after 50 . 3. AIDS . When Joan Woehrmann started her ambulance company in Whittier, California, in 1955, she hit on a pretty brilliant acronym: AIDS. The letters stood for ""attitude, integrity, dependability, and service,"" which are all great qualities for an ambulance line. The name was also easy to remember in times of crisis. She didn't foresee the name eventually signifying one of the greatest medical catastrophes of the century, though. By 1985, the LA Times reported that Woehrmann's drivers were being taunted and that the public mistakenly started to think that the line only transported AIDS patients. Finally, she had enough and changed the line's name to ""AME,"" even giving up the ambulances' customized line of ""AIDS 1"" and ""AIDS 2"" license plates. 4. SUX . While FAA identifiers for airports aren't technically acronyms, the three-letter codes can give rise to their own headaches. Just ask the Sioux City Gateway Airport, which the FAA saddled with the unfortunate designator ""SUX."" Airport authorities petitioned for a new code, and the FAA -- and this is not a joke -- offered them ""GAY"" as a nod to the ""Gateway"" part of the airport's name. Sioux City decided that switching to GAY probably wouldn't save them much sophomoric taunting, so officials decided to make the best of the SUX situation. Now the airport markets playful T-shirts emblazoned with slogans like ""Fly SUX."" SUX might not even be the worst airport code. According to a 2008 Los Angeles Times story, Fresno's is FAT, and Perm, Russia's is PEE. The big winner has to be Fukuoka, Japan, though. We'll let you guess how that one gets abbreviated. 5. SLUT . In 2007, Seattle opened a new streetcar line connecting the South Lake Union neighborhood to the city's downtown. While the project was officially called the South Lake Union Streetcar, local residents began ribbing it as the South Lake Union Trolley, or SLUT. Although the city and the line's developers did what they could to dispel the notion that the line had a bawdy name, residents still refer to it as the SLUT; in 2007 the Seattle Post-Intelligencer even reported that a coffeehouse was selling T-shirts that read, ""Ride the SLUT."" 6. CCRAP . In 2000, delegates of Canada's United Alternative convention needed a name for their newly formed political party. They came up with Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance Party, which in addition to taking roughly six minutes to pronounce was abbreviated CCRAP. Organizers quickly realized the blunder and changed the party's name to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance. Mental Floss: 50 amazing facts for our 50th issue . 7. WPPSS . In 1998, the Washington Public Power Supply System chose to change its name to Energy Northwest to discourage people from pronouncing its unfortunate acronym as ""Whoops!"" The old name left the utility open to quite a bit of taunting in 1983, when the WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion worth of bonds. Whoops indeed. 8. POOF . In 1990, the Philharmonic Orchestra of Florida decided it had heard just about enough kidding about its acronym, POOF, which resembled an old offensive term for a homosexual man. The musicians changed their name to the Florida Philharmonic Orchestra. 9. The C-word . In 2002, Microsoft had to do a little rearranging on the fly. It quickly and quietly changed its ribald ""Critical Update Notification Tool"" to the more family friendly ""Critical Updated Notification Utility."" Mental Floss: Company Initials Explained . 10. NIC . What's wrong with NIC? In English, nothing. In Arabic, a whole heck of a lot. When the Coalition Provisional Authority began planning new Iraqi armed forces in 2003, they originally called them the New Iraqi Corps. They hit a big snag, though. As ABC News reported, in Arabic ""nic"" is ""a colorful synonym for fornication."" The coalition quickly changed the name to the New Iraqi Army.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The case of South African athlete Caster Semenya has sparked worldwide interest following reports that she will be tested by sporting officials to determine whether she is male or female. Semenya celebrates her gold, which came just hours after the IAAF called for a gender test on the athlete. The 18-year-old won gold in the 800 meters race Wednesday but she may be forced to return the medal if she fails a gender-verification test imposed by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). According to media reports, the IAAF are testing to see whether Semenya has a rare genetic disorder that means she has female genitalia but male chromosomes. This condition, known as intersex, is commonly referred to as hermaphroditism. (Some support groups say that the term ""hermaphroditism"" can be inaccurate and offensive, as it implies that someone is both fully male and fully female, which is a physiologic impossibility.) According to the Intersex Society of North America, (ISNA)  intersex is a ""general term used for a variety of conditions in which a person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't seem to fit the typical definitions of female or male."" ""For example, a person might be born appearing to be female on the outside, but having mostly male-typical anatomy on the inside,"" a statement on the society's Web site says. There are around 20 to 30 types of biological ""intersex"" conditions, each of them affecting the body in different ways. Some people are born with both male and female reproductive organs, while others like intersex activist Hida Viloria are born biologically female yet possess masculine-looking genitalia. Others have a form known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) where the person is totally insensitive to any male hormones known as androgens. Dr. Peter Bowen-Simpkins of the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists told CNN: ""Intersexuality is incredibly rare, the one I've seen most commonly and one which affects 1 in 13,000 people worldwide is AIS."" ""In a woman your androgen receptors leads you to grow pubic hair, for instance,"" he explained.  ""If you are insensitive to androgens, you will grow up looking like a girl because the default of all human beings is female. ""However if the body, when it's developing, is not guided into turning into a male, then it will always be female,"" he told CNN. He added: ""This South African athlete couldn't have AIS because her problem is that it is suggested that she looks rather male, she's got a big jaw and has very little breast development, but so many athletes are like that, "" he added. ""But if she had AIS she would be all female and wouldn't have the advantage of the testosterone androgen, which make men's bones grow and makes them faster than a woman."" To test Semenya's gender, Dr. Bowen-Simpkins said the IAAF test would  involve her being examined by a gynecologist to see what her genitals look like. Semenya would also have an ultrasound to see if she has all the normal female reproductive organs. Doctors would also need an hormonal test to see if she had an excess of testosterone and they would also test her chromosomes. People who are intersex could also have the condition and not be aware of it, as was the case of Indian athlete Santhi Soundarajan, who failed a gender test at the 2006 Asian games and was stripped of her medal. She later attempted suicide, survived and recently announced she was becoming a coach. Intersex conditions occur in one out of every 2,000 births in the United States, according to the Rohnert Park, California-based Intersex Society of North America. For more than half a century it was common for doctors to carry out reversal operations, either through castration or constructing a new vagina, on babies whose genitals were seen as either too big or too small. Many of these people later spoke out and said that these surgeries caused them trauma and confusion in adult life. Most groups campaigning for intersex people now advocate that doctors should not perform medically unnecessary genital surgeries on intersex babies to make them male or female. CNN's George Webster contributed to this report .","South African athlete Caster Semenya will be gender tested after her gold medal win .

"(CNN) -- A former Mexican president who once led a military crackdown on drug cartels now has a new pitch: creating a legal system to produce, distribute and tax marijuana. Vicente Fox is joining a group of entrepreneurs in Seattle this week to discuss that possibility, six months after voters in Washington state approved a ballot measure allowing recreational marijuana use. As president, Fox launched Operation Safe Mexico, which sent soldiers and federal police to eight cities across the country in 2005 as drug cartels expanded their reach. But since leaving office in 2006, he's taken a significantly softer stance. For years, he's pushed for drug legalization. Using military force to fight cartels doesn't work, he argues, but legalization would. ""With this we will avoid the violence,"" Fox told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday. ""We will control the criminals and reduce their income, and at the same time it would become a transparent, accountable business in the hands of businessmen."" Speaking to reporters earlier Thursday, Fox praised Washington state's efforts to legalize marijuana and ""change the paradigm."" ""In Mexico we welcome this initiative,"" he said, ""because the cost of the war in the case of Mexico is becoming unbearable, too high for Mexico, Latin America and the rest of the world."" Legalization measures, he argued, ultimately topple the foundations of organized crime. ""We must get out of this trap, and here is the opportunity,' Fox said. ""Now this group here is moving accordingly from words into plans, and from plans into action, and from action into the arena. To play the real game this group must understand the need to make good, safe, and legal use of these new laws, for the benefit of the people and the common good."" As Fox spoke, Jamen Shively nodded in agreement. The former Microsoft executive is heading up a new business venture that aims to create the first national brand of retail cannabis in the United States. Fox told CNN he was not involved in Shively's venture, but sat beside him because he supports the push to move to put the drug trade in the hands of businessmen, not criminals. ""By making cannabis illegal, we have instead turned it into a tool for violence, exploited by criminals and organized crime, spanning many countries,"" Shively said. ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a unique moment in history. The Berlin Wall of the prohibition of cannabis is weak, and it is crumbling as we speak. And just as happened in Berlin in 1989, the old guards who used to protect the wall of cannabis prohibition are laying down their weapons and walking away."" Opponents criticize legalization . But drug legalization still has fierce critics. Obama administration officials have repeatedly stressed their opposition to such proposals when they've been floated in other countries. Last year, John Walters, who directed the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy from 2001 to 2009, told CNN that decriminalization is ""utterly self-defeating"" and would cause more crime. Mexico's current president, Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, has also expressed his doubts about large-scale legalization measures. In Mexico, marijuana use is not crime, but production and distribution of the drug are. PeÃ±a Nieto told CNN last year that despite his reservations, the way the war on drugs is waged may have to change in light of changing U.S. policies such as the recent referendums in Colorado and Washington. ""Personally, I am not in favor of legalization of drugs ... because it's not just about marijuana. It seems to me that is a gateway through which people will start taking much more harmful drugs,"" PeÃ±a Nieto said. ""But it's clear that this thing that has happened in two states in the near future could bring us to rethinking the strategy."" Complicated political landscape . In November, voters in both Colorado and Washington state approved ballot measures allowing for the personal, recreational use of marijuana. Nearly 20 other states permit the use of marijuana for medical reasons. The new laws put Colorado and Washington at odds with the federal government, which classifies marijuana as an illegal substance. Since pot is still listed in the nation's Controlled Substances Act, federal raids of pot businesses continue at feverish pace. In 2012 alone, federal agencies seized more than 2,500 indoor grow operations, killing close to 300,000 plants. The situation makes the so-called legal marijuana industry a risky one. A dispensary could be in full compliance with state laws, but the feds could still raid them. And the financial picture is complicated, too. Figuring out how to tax cash marijuana sales is a challenge both Colorado and Washington are facing. On Thursday, Shively said he's up to the challenge. ""We have waited long enough for some sort of a green light from Washington, D.C. In fact, the silence from our nation's capital has been deafening,"" he said. ""We are moving forward with our plans to build a national and eventually international network of cannabis businesses."" Follow Catherine Shoichet on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- For the first time, researchers have succeeded in creating human embryonic stem cells by injecting DNA from a skin cell into an unfertilized egg, according to a study published Wednesday. To achieve what is being called an ""important step"" in stem cell research, scientists in New York used a cloning technique similar to the one used to clone Dolly the sheep. ""This work now demonstrates for the first time that the human egg has the ability to turn a specialized cell into a stem cell,"" said Dieter Egli, who along with fellow study author Scott Noggle led the research team at the New York Stem Cell Foundation. ""The goal of this research was to create patient-specific embryonic stem cells with the patients' DNA for the eventual use in cell replacement therapy,"" Egli told CNN. He said the motivation for the research was to eventually cure diseases such as Parkinson's, diabetes and many other illnesses. In 2005, researchers in South Korea claimed to have created the first human embryonic stem cells by cloning an embryo. A year later, it was revealed that the data had been faked. This new study, published in the journal Nature, shows researchers have finally succeeded in creating human embryonic stem cells. They weren't perfect though because they have too many chromosomes -- 69 instead of the usual 46 -- making the cells suitable for research purposes only, not actual treatments. In the past, efforts to create human stem cells using cloning meant taking an unfertilized egg, removing egg's nucleus with its 23 chromosomes and replacing it with the nucleus of a skin cell (which has 46 chromosomes) and placing the egg in a chemical bath to make it divide as if it had been fertilized by sperm. Researchers started out with 270 donated oocytes or unfertilized eggs, provided by sixteen egg donors, Noggle said. Egli said through a process of elimination, he and his colleagues determined that it was the removal of the egg's genome, not the introduction of new DNA or chemically initiating cell division, which was preventing the egg to develop far enough along so stem cells can be extracted. Noggle says 63 eggs were needed to develop two cell lines, of which one was viable. ""It's the machinery within the egg that allows the egg to progress normally in development,"" said Ted Golos, who is a professor of Comparative Biosciences at the school of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Golos, who is not involved in this new research, says this new study isn't a giant leap forward but it's an interesting one. Now the challenge is to figure out how to remove the egg's chromosomes, without removing the machinery or spindle, which helps the egg divide. Egli said he and his colleagues are working on just that. Researchers have been using adult stem cells like bone marrow for treatments for decades. But adult stem cells have been programmed for one part of the body and are not easily converted to correcting problems in other parts of the body. Then the first major advance in human embryonic stem cell research came In 1998, when Jamie Thomson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, extracted the first stem cells from an existing human embryo. In 2007, researchers in Japan and California reported the creation of stem cells by bypassing eggs altogether and reprogramming skin cells directly into dividing like fertilized eggs with the addition of four viruses. These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells. Since then, researchers have found these cells have some limitations as well. While some opponents of embryonic research believe advances in the ""less controversial"" adult stem cell and iPS cells eliminate the need for embryonic stem cell research, most experts in the field believe all three research paths need to be explored to eventually find the right treatment for the right disease. Dr. Alan Trounson, who heads the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, which funds embryonic and adult stem cell research, says if researchers are able to take the next step and figure out how to make embryonic stem cells without the excess chromosomes, then they can begin to compare them to iPS cells and determine how different or similar they really are. Egli agrees. ""We need to better understand the biology of the human egg for reprogramming without the egg genome,"" he said.","The achievement is an ""important step"" in stem cell research, scientists say .

"(CNN) -- In death, as in life, the two brothers were inseparable. Connor Barthe, 6, the loud protective big brother with a wicked smile and deep dimples. Noah, the little albeit quieter one, who wanted to play basketball when he grew up. Their Canadian community of Campbellton, New Brunswick, eulogized the boys Saturday, days after they were strangled to death by an African rock python. The 100-pound snake came crashing through the ceiling of a family friend's apartment, where they were having a sleepover Monday. ""How can we prepare for such a service? There's not really any way to prepare,"" Father Maurice Frenette, the interim pastor at St. Thomas Aquinas Church, told CBC News. At the altar, the brothers smiled broadly in a picture, leaning against each other. Family members described them as sharing a close bond. They were best friends and shared everything, including their love of video games. Police: Boys killed by snake died from asphyxiation . ""Boys, oh boys, we loved those boys,"" family friend Melissa Ellis said, according to CBC News. The two were visiting the home of Jean-Claude Savoie, who owns a pet store, when the tragic incident happened. The python was kept in a glass enclosure similar to an aquarium, but slithered into the ventilation system. It was above the living room, where the boys were sleeping, when the ceiling caved in. Savoie's son was asleep in another room, but was not harmed, CBC News reported. The city's deputy mayor expressed his condolences and asked the community not to rush to judgment. African rock pythons are not allowed in the province , the Department of Natural Resources told CBC News . ""Mr. Savoie, he is a human being and you know, he is suffering, he is grieving, so everyone is grieving as well for Mr. Savoie,"" Ian Comeau said. As questions surround the incident, the family says the are forever changed. ""Were they taken from us too soon? Absolutely. But how much time would have been enough?"" said Nadine Poirier, who delivered the eulogy. The funeral service concluded with a somber rendition of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" as the procession walked out. And as a symbol of their brotherly bond, they were laid to rest in a single, pale blue casket.","Noah and Connor Barthe, ages 4 and 6, had been at a sleepover at a family friend's home .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers pulled 130 people from the waters between Australia and Indonesia on Wednesday after a ship capsized, the Australian authorities said. Merchant and naval vessels, as well as a patrol aircraft, carried out the rescue effort about 107 nautical miles north of Australia's Christmas Island, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. By Wednesday night, 130 people had been rescued from about 134 believed to have been on board the ship when it turned over, the authority said in a statement. One body has been recovered, and three people are thought to have gone down with the ship, the statement said. The rescue effort has now been called off as no more survivors or deceased people have been spotted, the maritime authority said. The Australian authorities had initially estimated that about 150 people were on board the vessel. Ship capsizes off Australia . Jo Meehan, a spokeswoman for the maritime authority, declined to comment on the nationality of the people on board the ship and the purpose of their voyage. ""We don't have details on origin or intended destination of the vessel,"" she said. The ship is the second to capsize in the area in the past week. A vessel carrying an estimated 200 people seeking asylum in Australia turned over last week 110 nautical miles northwest of Christmas Island. Rescuers recovered 110 survivors and six dead bodies from that accident, according to the Australian authority. An accurate number of exactly how many people died ""may never be known,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- Who shot J.R.? Why is zombie Bobby taking a shower? And can Texans really pull off a cowboy hat with a suit? A new incarnation of the groundbreaking television saga that raised these questions will return to TNT June 13. The new series isn't just a remake; it's a continuation of the original, which means that television's most notorious family is back in the Big D. But the city has changed a lot since we last checked in with J.R. and company. For instance, it lost a lot of oil derricks and gained a few modern marvels, including a signature bridge and a stadium that rivals the construction of the Death Star. Women's hairstyles aren't as high and neither are the peaks of 10-gallon Stetsons. The Dallas Cowboys are now a source of great embarrassment and the Texas Rangers are the pride of the metroplex. But that's not to say there isn't still plenty of the unapologetic glam and high-society Western culture celebrated in the show's original 14 seasons. The Ewing clan would feel just as at home in today's Dallas as they did during the series' heyday. Here are a few spots where you just might run into them. 'Dallas' vs. Dallas: Where TV stops and reality begins . Five Sixty by Wolfgang Puck at Reunion Tower . Built in 1978, the same year ""Dallas"" premiered on CBS, Reunion Tower served as Dallas' most iconic building for three decades before the ""Big Ball"" underwent a much-needed makeover. Now Reunion Tower boasts one of the finest dining experiences in Dallas, with a 560-foot-high revolving restaurant and an Asian fusion menu crafted by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Summer Travel: World's best affordable beach resorts . Adair's Saloon . J.R. wouldn't be caught dead in this dive bar that's covered floor to ceiling in graffiti, photos, stickers, neon lights and mounted horns. But a younger Ewing would feel right at home at Adair's, where you're likely to see just as many businessmen as you do cowboys. The 49-year-old honky tonk features some of the best burgers in Dallas and live music almost every night (usually of the country and western persuasion), and you're more than welcome to join the trove of two-steppers, whether you're wearing designer or dungarees. Highland Park Village . Bang & Olufsen, Harry Winston, Diane von Furstenberg, Hermes, Stella McCartney, Chanel, and Christian Louboutin are just a few of the high-end shopping options available at this 20,000-square-foot outdoor mall. You might find one of the Ewing boys shopping for a $130,000 rifle at the Beretta Gallery, or a soon-to-be Mrs. Ewing picking out an Oscar de la Renta wedding dress at Warren BarrÃ³n Bridal. Summer Travel: Secret hotels of Florida's Gulf Coast . Southfork Ranch . Of course, the Ewings would be nothing without the world-renowned Southfork Ranch. The home base of Dallas' most famous TV dynasty actually sits just outside the city, in Parker, Texas. The Ranch is still alive and well, and has served as a tourist destination and an event and conference center since the '80s. Many of Dallas' most elite soirees are held on the property, including the Cattle Baron's Ball, which draws in thousands of guests donning their finest Western attire. South Side on Lamar . This time around the Ewings are spending about as much time around Dallas' South Side as they are around Southfork. Members of the cast and crew stayed in the South Side on Lamar, a loft apartment building that lures creative spirits and young professionals, and provides the city's best views of the Dallas skyline. Many of the scenes were also filmed in South Side, which originally served as the home of the historic Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s Catalog Merchandise Center. Margot and Bill Winspear Opera House . Dallas' new stunning, state-of-the-art opera house is the most prestigious venue in the world that warmly welcomes cowboy boots. Eager to promote culture in North Texas, Margot and Bill Winspear donated $42 million with a vision of promoting great opera to help Dallas become a top international city. Located in the AT&T Performing Arts Center, the opera house has certainly upped the city's cultural cred. In 2010, the Winspear hosted Dallas' first opera premiere, with Jake Heggie's ""Moby-Dick,"" and with each new show, the venue has continued to help fulfill the Winspears' dream. Saint Ann Restaurant & Bar . ""Dallas"" veteran Linda Gray (Sue Ellen Ewing) and newcomer Jordana Brewster (Elena Ramos) were spotted filming at this minimalist Uptown restaurant set in an old Catholic school house, the first in the city to teach Hispanic children. With a chalkboard wall, notebook-paper menus and original beams sitting below glass flooring, you won't soon forget the trendy restaurant's past life. But history isn't all Saint Ann has to offer -- the eatery also features the city's largest patio garden and one of the longest pre-seat waiting periods. So be sure to make a reservation. Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek . For starters, it's so elegant it's known simply as The Mansion. It's also the most historic and elite hotel in Dallas, and the bar and restaurant are no exception. The Mansion Bar's recent renovation enhanced the den's club ambiance, with cognac-colored leather walls covered in fine art and shelves filled with leather-bound books. You half-expect to see J.R. sitting out on the terrace overlooking Turtle Creek, sipping on his signature Bourbon and Branch cocktail. Summer Travel: Getting away, celebrity style . (Like CNN, TNT is a division of Turner Broadcasting.) Have you been to Dallas? Where do you hang out? Share your tips for visitors below.","New incarnation of 'Dallas' debuts June 13 .
The city has changed a lot since the original show premiered in 1978 .

"(CNN) -- Activists in Saudi Arabia utilizing new media tools to call for change ""face a repressive and intolerant government,"" and risk harassment as well as imprisonment, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). A report by the rights group, ""Challenging the Red Lines: Stories of Rights Activists in Saudi Arabia,"" released Wednesday, accuses Saudi authorities of ""arresting, prosecuting, and attempting to silence rights defenders and to quash their calls for change."" ""Independent activists in Saudi Arabia have little to protect them from the repressive practices of their government,"" said Adam Coogle, Saudi researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""It's time for other countries to break their silence and tell Saudi Arabia to allow independent activism,"" Coogle told CNN. Activists in Saudi Arabia -- an absolute monarchy where dissent is little tolerated -- have increasingly turned to social media sites to express growing frustration with the government. Online participation by Saudis has increased so much that the country now has one of the highest usage rates of Twitter in the world. As the government will not allow for the formation and licensing of independent human rights bodies inside the country, many internet-based nongovernmental rights organizations have been established, and frequently report on human rights abuses within the ultraconservative kingdom. According to HRW, ""despite the authorities' efforts to block online content, Saudis -- at least 49% of whom have Internet access -- use Internet forums to bypass heavily censored state media."" The report also highlights the stories of 11 prominent Saudi political and civil activists and ""their struggles to resist government efforts to suppress them,"" according to HRW. One of those activists, Waleed Abulkhair, was recently sentenced to three months in jail by a court in Jeddah for signing a petition critical of Saudi authorities two years ago. ""Human rights activists are having a very bad time right now in Saudi Arabia,"" Abulkhair told CNN. ""Authorities don't want anyone to speak out loudly and when we do, the government feels they lose control."" Abulkhair, a prominent human rights lawyer, said he is appealing his sentence, but that he's now also being tried by the Specialized Criminal Court (which prosecutes terrorists) in the country's capital city, Riyadh. According to Abulkhair, he's been charged with ""setting up an unlicensed organization"" and ""breaking allegiance with the Saudi King,"" among other things. Abulkhair believes he is being prosecuted solely for his activism and holds out little hope he'll remain free much longer. ""I'm sure that I will be convicted,"" he told CNN. Another Saudi activist highlighted in the report is Abulkhair's brother-in-law and client, Raif Badawi. Badawi was recently sentenced by a Jeddah Criminal Court to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for violating the nation's anti-cybercrime law. In jail since June 2012, Badawi was found guilty of insulting Islam through his website and in television comments. Badawi's legal troubles started shortly after he started the Free Saudi Liberals website in 2008, as a way to encourage discussion about religion; it didn't take long for some clerics to brand him an unbeliever and apostate. Badawi's sentence is being appealed. The case of Adel Ali al-Labbad is also included in the report. It calls him ""a political activist and poet from the Eastern Province city of Awammiyah."" HRW says Saudi security forces have arrested al-Labbad, a Shiite, four times over the past ten years and tortured him. ""Saudi Arabia's conviction of eight prominent activists in 2013 alone for their peaceful activities has been largely met with silence by Saudi Arabia's friends in the US and Europe,"" said HRW's Coogle. ""It's time for other countries speak up and tell Saudi Arabia to end its repression campaign."" Despite repeated attempts, CNN was unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry or Justice Ministry for comment. Rights groups have frequently accused Saudi authorities of targeting activists through the courts and travel bans. Many were outraged in March this year, when two of the country's most prominent reform advocates, Mohammed Al-Qahtani and Abdullah Al-Hamid were sentenced to 10 and 11 years in prison respectively. At the time, Amnesty International called their trial ""just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom's human-rights activists."" Asked in January about accusations that Saudi Arabia is cracking down on dissent, Major General Mansour Al-Turki, spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, told CNN, ""At the Interior Ministry, our area of responsibility is security."" He added, ""My understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now. Nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts."" According to HRW, ""Saudi Arabia does not have a written penal code, leaving judges free to issue sentences based on their own interpretations of the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, the two agreed-upon sources of Islamic Sharia law."" ""Defendants accused of political offenses -- including human rights activists -- are often sentenced by the Specialized Criminal Court, set up to try terrorism-related cases. This court sometimes denies defendants the most basic fair trial guarantees, including the right to a lawyer, and passes sentences in closed proceedings."" Despite repeated criticism of Saudi Arabia's human rights record by numerous rights groups, in November the kingdom was elected to a three year term on the United Nations' Human Rights Council.","Activists in Saudi Arabia have turned to social media to speak out against the government .

"London (CNN) -- After centuries buried beneath the Vatican, and decades hidden away inside the Holy See, the bones of a man long believed to be St. Peter, one of the founding fathers of the Christian church, are on display for the first time. The controversial remains were revealed to the public on Sunday at a mass in St Peter's Square marking the conclusion of the Catholic church's ""Year of Faith."" Writing in L'Osservatore Romano, the semi-official Vatican newspaper, Archbishop Rino Fisichella said the ""relics which tradition recognizes as those of the apostle who gave his life for the Lord"" would be exhibited as part of the service. L'Osservatore Romano reports that 8.5 million pilgrims have venerated the relics over the course of the year. But whether the bones, normally kept in an urn housed in the private chapel of the Pope's own Vatican apartments, really are those of St. Peter, the fisherman-turned-disciple who became the first pope, is open to question. Tradition has it that St. Peter was martyred -- by being crucified, upside down -- in Rome in A.D. 64. before being buried in the city. In his book ""The Vatican Diaries,"" John Thavis wrote that ""St. Peter's tomb in the cemetery on the Vatican Hill became... a popular pilgrimage site,"" prompting the emperor Constantine to build a basilica in his honor in the 4th century. The remains which will be revealed on Sunday were among those discovered during an archaeological dig begun on the site in 1939; in 1968 the then pope, Paul VI, declared that they had been identified ""in a manner which we believe convincing."" But with no DNA evidence to conclusively prove their identity, whether they belong to St. Peter is likely to remain an enduring mystery. CNN's Vatican analyst John Allen says that like so much concerning religion, the belief that the bones are those of the disciple comes down to faith. ""Like other famous relics, such as the Shroud of Turin or the Belt of Mary, they evoke awe and devotion regardless of their actual provenance,"" Allen writes in an Op-Ed for CNN.

"(CNN) -- Some major websites went dark briefly Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET as part of a national moment of silence for the victims of last week's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Dozens of sites participated, including Aol, The Huffington Post and Digg, and more than 100,000 people and sites have pledged to participate on the Causes.com page for the Web Goes Silent campaign. People and companies are also spreading the word by tweeting their intention to go quiet with the hashtag #momentforSandyHook. High-profile Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ron Conway promoted the online moment of silence, which is part of a larger campaign for federal gun control legislation. Conway is leading the Causes.com campaign along with other big names including Ryan Seacrest, Jack Dorsey, Britney Spears, MC Hammer, Suze Orman and Tyler Florence. Causes.com is a startup that uses social media to raise awareness and funds for charities and causes. Conway is also an investor in the for-profit company. Sites that participated in Friday's moment of silence were invited to do so on their own, or it can embed an official badge with a green ribbon on their sites. Sites using the code appeared grayed out in the background with a white box in the foreground that reads ""We are observing a National Moment of Silence for the victims of the Sandy Hook tragedy.""

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Serena Williams breezed past Germany's Angelique Kerber in her opening match at the WTA Championships in Istanbul's Sinan Erdem Dome on Tuesday. The world No.1 needed just 65 minutes to overpower the World No.9 winning 6-3, 6-1 as she looks to seal a fourth WTA Championships crown and an incredible 11th title this season. ""I feel really good -- I think I served very well -- and she's beaten me before so I was just a little nervous and so focused going into this match. I felt like I was going to have to play well to win,"" Williams said. ""I'm actually happy about my match and I never say that! I'm really excited about that. I've been working really hard since the Open and hopefully I can continue with that here."" Earlier, World No.2 Victoria Azarenka was made to work a little harder against Sara Errani. The Belarusian eventually came thorough 7-6, 6-2 but only after her Italian opponent sustained a calf injury at the start of the second set. Errani battled bravely but couldn't stop Azarenka bringing an end to a three-match losing streak which began at the U.S. Open final where she lost to Williams. That defeat was followed by consecutive first round exits at events in Tokyo, where she lost to sister Venus before she was dumped out in the first round of the China Open in Beijing by Germany's Andrea Petkovic. ""I was missing a little bit too much at the beginning but I turned it around,"" Azarenka said after beating Errani. ""It was a little bit difficult to focus in the second set because I didn't know what was going on (with Errani's injury). Even after the time-out, she was returning unbelievably and fought until the last point."" Sixth seed Petra Kvitova had a good head-to-head record going into her match against Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska and once again came out on top. The Czech triumphed in straight sets 6-4, 6-4 to improve her match record against the World No.4 to 5-1 and secure her 50th win in a WTA match this year. The season finale features the top eight singles players and the top four doubles pairings who are competing for a $6 million prize pot. Wawrinka crashes out in Basel . Two ATP Tour 500 events are taking place this week as the top men look to secure their place at the season-ending World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in London which start on November 4. Home favorite Stanislas Wawrinka crashed out in the first round of the World Tour 500 event in Basel, Switzerland going down in straight sets 6-4, 6-3 to Edouard Roger-Vasselin of France. The Swiss No.2 is currently eighth in the rankings, but seventh in the Race to London given that Andy Murray has withdrawn from the event.

"(CNN) -- The deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi underscores the gaping power vacuum across Libya since the toppling of Moammar Gadhafi's regime last year. Fighting groups that battled Gadhafi have stepped in to maintain law and order after the fall of the regime, an expert on post-Gadhafi Libya told CNN. Most of the groups are simply neighborhood watch entities. But some include hard-line Muslim Salafis and have ""a very Islamist orientation,"" said Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The group accused of being behind the consulate assault, the Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades, is said to be pro-al Qaeda. Ex-SEALs, online gaming maven among Benghazi dead . ""The problem is that the Libyan army and the Libya police forces effectively disintegrated,"" Wehrey said. ""These groups are basically running the show"" throughout much of Libya. Another analyst, Andrew Lebovich, a Washington-based researcher focused on security issues in North Africa and the Sahel, said the militias, criminal groups, and hard-line Islamist groups in Libya make up a ""somewhat diffuse"" environment. ""Some groups, such as the Ansar al-Sharia Brigades in Benghazi and Derna and the Imprisoned Omar Abdel Rahman Brigades have been involved in increasing shows of force and outright attacks against Western and other targets in Libya in recent months,"" he said. Wehrey, in speaking to CNN, cited two of his recent essays about security in Libya. One was in Foreign Affairs in July and the other appeared Wednesday on the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace website. He said the fledgling government is in a bind. Officials are trying to demobilize and reintegrate the militias and bring these groups into the government security forces, he said. But the militia members across Libya remain loyal to their groups and distrust the new government's authority, in part because of the ""taint"" of a link to the Gadhafi regime, Wehrey said. The government has used militia commanders to quell tribal fighting, subcontracted border control and defense of oil installations to small brigades, and used armed groups to provide security during elections. In Benghazi, he said, ballots for an election were stored and counted at the headquarters of the city's strongest militia. Six things to know about the attack . ""The strategy of trying to dismantle the regional militias while simultaneously making use of them as hired guns might be sowing the seeds for the country's descent into warlordism,"" he warned. ""It has also given local brigades and their political patrons leverage over the central government. Emboldened by the writ of state authority, brigade commanders have been free to carry out vendettas against rival towns and tribes, particularly those favored by ... Gadhafi,"" Wehrey said. Violence between warring militias and attacks against Western and moderate Sufi Muslim targets erupted in recent months, Wehrey said. In Benghazi, there was a ""rapid deterioration"" of security before the U.S. Consulate attack. Pro-al Qaeda group seen behind deadly Benghazi attack . A strike on a British consulate vehicle in Benghazi in June wounded a diplomat. The International Committee of the Red Cross said its workers endured attacks at least five times in less than three month in Benghazi and Misrata. The group announced the suspension of its activities in August. The Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades, in fact, first surfaced in May when it claimed responsibility for an attack on the ICRC office in Benghazi. The next month it claimed responsibility for detonating a blast outside the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. It also released a video of the attack. Sufi mosques and tombs were among the sites targeted. Sufism is considered a more moderate form of Islam. Libyan Interior Minister Fawzi Abdel A'al was quoted by Human Rights Watch as calling the attackers ""groups that have a strict Islamic ideology where they believe that graves and shrines must be desecrated."" That comment, Human Rights Watch said, refers to Salafists, the name for those Muslims who want a ""return to Islam as they believe it was practiced in the days of the Prophet Mohammed."" Salafists have increasingly asserted themselves in eastern Libya. In June, hundreds of fighters wielding AK-47s and black Islamist banners converged on Benghazi to call for the imposition of sharia law. This spring, an associate of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri addressed a large gathering in the town square of Derna, in eastern Libya. An online video of his address has been seen by CNN. ""Salafi militias have reportedly carried out assassinations of Gadhafi-era officials, taken over radio stations and shut down beauty parlors,"" Wehrey said. Derna has for years been a recruiting ground for al Qaeda. A 2008 diplomatic cable from Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya who was slain in the consulate attack, described the area as ""a wellspring of Libyan foreign fighters"" for al Qaeda in Iraq. In some cases, Wehrey said, the revolutionary brigades have become ""very sophisticated."" They have checkpoints, security headquarters, ID cards, and their own payroll. Some militia coalitions have made handshake deals to police areas. Yemen police, demonstrators hurt in U.S. Embassy . ""These are militias that operate openly,"" and operate blogs and Facebook pages. With that Salafi foothold in eastern Libya, Wehrey said, it wouldn't be hard for armed militia members to ""converge on a target"" in Benghazi with an hour's notice. Was al Qaeda involved? Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the al Qaeda branch that operates in Africa, would have connections in the country's far south, if it indeed has any network in Libya, Wehrey said. And Lebovich said he's seen no evidence of ""overt"" al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb involvement in Libyan violence, despite reports of arrests, smuggling and weapons purchases linked to the group. As for other militia groups, he said, ""There is little public evidence linking their actions to al Qaeda, even if some of these groups' leaders have extensive militant pasts and ties with the group."" ""However,"" he added, ""we know very little about the exact compositions of Libya's hard-line militias beyond the top public leadership, making it impossible to say definitively whether or not links or relationships with other jihadist organizations like al Qaeda, or members of these organizations, are playing a role in militia-led violence in Libya."" Regarding the consulate attack, Wehrey said he thinks the strike ""was a much more local affair"" than one that involved al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. He called it ""the latest in a series of attacks by the country's increasingly active Salafis."" ""Libyans' public reaction to such strong-arm tactics has been vociferous and damning,"" Wehrey said. ""Tribes, women's groups, and civil society -- as well as the country's increasingly active social media community -- have all mobilized to condemn the recent attacks on Sufis, while mounting demonstrations of their own against the Salafis' shows of force."" Wehrey said that ""much of the violence suggests a movement in search of a cause."" Salafis ""are now grasping at foreign causes they believe will excite Libyans' emotions,"" such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Syria, and anti-Americanism, he said. Meanwhile, the country's provisional government has had to deputize revolutionary brigades for security work. ""Invariably, these poorly trained bodies contain a number of Salafi militias who have used their warrant from the government to enforce draconian social mores, conduct vendettas against Gadhafi-era intelligence officers, and attack Sufis,"" Wehrey said. Citizens have voiced outrage over Salafi shows of force and have mobilized against their ""strong-arm tactics against, for example, the Sufis."" ""For the citizens of Tripoli, Benghazi and other cities, all this is a stark and tragic reminder of the perennial problems of poor governance and the security vacuum,"" Wehrey said.

"(CNN) -- He is still a long-shot to win -- but centrist candidate Hassan Rouhani has suddenly injected fresh intrigue in Iran's upcoming presidential elections. Early on, critics of the Islamic Republic had described the race as a sure-fire victory for one of the ruling establishment's loyalists. Ultra-conservatives have dominated the field of eight candidates, which is missing leading reformist candidates like former president Hashemi Rafsanjani. Read more: Who is running in Iran's presidential election? He was disqualified without explanation during the vetting process carried out by the Guardian Council, a panel of clerics and lawyers. But there are strong signs that Rouhani is trying to revive Iran's dormant reform movement -- and some observers say that could give the 65-year-old cleric a fighting chance. Iranians head to the polling booths on Friday June 14. ""He appears to be gaining ground daily,"" explains Tehran-based political analyst Sadegh Zibakalam. ""The more I hear about Rouhani, the more I'm encouraged that he might be able to be a spoiler in this election,"" adds Nader Hashemi, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver. Has Iranian regime learned nothing from 2009 election fiasco? Rouhani's campaign gathered steam last month soon after his first live interview on state television. During his exchange with the show host, Rouhani did what few Iranian politicians dare do -- accuse Iran's state-run media of censorship and lies. Several video clips of the interview racked up thousands of views on YouTube. ""He turned the host into a cutlet,"" a viewer wrote in the comment section. Days later, Rouhani held a televised rally and whipped his supporters into a frenzy when he criticized the government's tight grip on security. ""Why does there have to be a securitized atmosphere everywhere?"" Rouhani asked the fired-up crowd. ""We must crush the securitized atmosphere."" Hashemi says that Rouhani is ""politically savvy and realizes there's a lot of political discontent in society. He's trying to play to that discontent as a way of rallying support to his candidacy."" Hooshang Amirahmadi: Setting the record straight . Rouhani's defiant tone seems to be winning over remnants of the Green Movement, the opposition force that exploded onto the scene during the 2009 elections, only to be later crushed by the regime's security apparatus. Today the two main leaders of the Green Movement -- Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karoubi -- are under house arrest and Iran's security officials have warned the public against anti-government street protests. Amanpour explains: Iran's presidential election . But Rouhani is prodding the movement's supporters. Some of his statements echo those of the Green Movement. Last month he told students at Tehran University that the movement's initial street protests were not a foreign plot as some regime leaders had claimed in 2009. ""These were protests that were natural and popular,"" Rouhani said. ""They should have been addressed."" Rouhani's Twitter page suggests a progressive ideology. It features two women holding up his campaign poster: one of the women is holding a green Tupperware lid. It's not clear if the picture is a veiled invite to the Green Movement, but many are starting to follow his lead. At a rally this month supporters chanted Rouhani and Mousavi's names together, shouting: ""Greetings to Rouhani! Salutes to Mousavi!"" But Iran's notorious security forces are paying attention too. Shortly after the rally, police arrested several members of Rouhani's campaign, state media reported. ""I think he has the potential,"" says Hashemi. ""It depends on how much he really wants to tap into the public discontent. But of course doing so is very difficult because then he draws the attention and the ire of the regime who want to block a massive public rallying around a Rouhani candidacy."" Despite his growing popularity among opposition circles, Rouhani has long been a part of Iran's ruling establishment. He's the only cleric among the eight candidates, has close ties to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and served in Iran's parliament for two decades. He was also Iran's lead nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 and currently holds seats on several powerful decision-making bodies. But to be Iran's next president he'll have to beat several heavyweights among the ultra-conservative candidates, including top contenders like Iran's current nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, Tehran's mayor Mohammad Qalibaf and Ali Akbar Velayati, A senior adviser to the Supreme Leader. Rouhani may be the dark horse but the presidential campaign is no longer as dull as some anticipated. ""More and more people are saying let's go and vote for Rouhani,"" says Zibakalam. ""I won't be surprised if he manages to win the vote.""","The 'dark horse' of Iran's election, centrist candidate Hassan Rouhani, is gaining points .

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- Seven teachers abducted last week for supporting a polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's tribal Khyber Agency have been released by militants, their school principal said Tuesday. ""All the teachers have been released after they were questioned over their activities by militant group Lashkar-e-Islam,"" Hira Public School Principal Qasim Khan told CNN. The principal would not say what information the militant group wanted from the teachers, who were abducted Thursday. The militant group, which has connections to the Pakistan Taliban, opposes polio vaccinations, accusing polio workers of pursuing a political agenda. Anti-polio campaigns have been targeted by militants in Pakistan since U.S. intelligence officials used a fake vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011. Under cover of the program, the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad. Since July 2012, at least 22 polio workers have been killed. The polio campaign has a history of controversy in Pakistan. Some mullahs have preached against it, claiming falsely that the oral vaccine leaves Pakistani children sterile. Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continued its campaign of drone strikes. At least 16 cases of polio have been reported this year in Khyber Agency. Law and order problems in Bara have left it particularly vulnerable to the disease, which has been declared eradicated from adjacent India. Polio, which can cause permanent paralysis in hours, remains endemic only in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After its case count spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 198 in 2011 to 58 in 2012, but that progress has stopped: Pakistan is the only one of the three countries where polio is endemic to see its numbers go up this year, according to Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for polio, emergencies and country collaboration. As of November 19, it has seen 63 cases this year versus 54 cases as of that date last year, he said last week in a telephone interview. A second concern is spread of the infectious viral disease from Pakistan to other parts of the world -- cases diagnosed this year in Afghanistan have been linked directly to virus from Pakistan, he said. Vaccination campaign against polio, other diseases begins in Mideast . Journalist Zahir Shah Sherazi reported from Peshawar, CNN's Shaista Aziz and Saima Mohsin wrote from Islamabad, and CNN's Tom Watkins contributed from Atlanta .","The teachers had supported a polio vaccination campaign at their school .

"(CNN) -- It was a strange sight indeed -- one large aircraft carrying another large aircraft strapped on top. But that's exactly what skyward-looking folks in Washington saw Tuesday as Space Shuttle Discovery, atop a Boeing 747, made an inspiring pass over the capital in its final flight. It makes you wonder: How can the 747 transport something that big and heavy? Well, the shuttle-airliner combo is not as heavy as you might first think. In fact, it's a relatively easy load to hoist. When the shuttle missions started in the 1980s, NASA designated several places as landing strips for the orbiter, including Edwards AFB in California. Discovery taken its final destination, a Smithsonian museum . But all the launches were from Florida, so NASA needed a way to transport to Kennedy Space Center from Edwards. A shuttle can't fly itself after it leaves orbit, as it is basically a big glider. So NASA created the designed the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, which is a Boeing 747 designed to fly with a shuttle on top. All that's well-known, at least to space buffs. But what may surprise many people is that a Boeing 747 with a space shuttle strapped on its roof weighs less -- that's right, less -- than a 747 airliner full of passengers. At first that might seem counterintuitive, but Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for NASA, says the 747 they use is stripped clean of anything in the main cabin. There's a cockpit and a big empty shell. But the 747s used by airlines have hundreds of seats, galleys, lavatories -- even a bar in some cases. Add 300-plus passengers, their luggage, food, water and assorted other cargo, and the weight adds up. Capturing Discovery's final flight . The 747 that carried Discovery weighed about 488,000 pounds. Jim Proulx, a spokesman for Boeing, says a commercial 747 airliner can weigh more than 800,000 when carrying passengers. There will be another chance to see the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft in action later this week. That's when it will carry Space Shuttle Enterprise, which was used for tests but never flew in space, will be flown from Dulles International Airport in Virginia to its new home on board the USS Intrepid, a retired aircraft carrier turned floating museum in New York City.","Shuttle Discovery hitches ride atop a Boeing 747 to Washington .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The venerable CBS soap opera ""Guiding Light"" will go dark in September after 72 years and 16,000 episodes, the network announced Wednesday. Gina Tognoni is one of many performers who have appeared on ""Guiding Light"" over the years. The daytime drama's declining viewership led to the decision, according to a CBS spokeswoman. The show, which the Guinness Book of World Records lists as the longest-running television drama, first aired on NBC radio in 1937 as a 15-minute serial, the spokeswoman said. It moved to television on the CBS network in 1952 as 15-minute drama. It later went to 30 minutes, and on November 7, 1977, it expanded to one hour and introduced the wealthy Spaulding family as foils to the show's middle-class Bauers, who were a mainstay of the show for much of its run. In 1979, the show did a groundbreaking storyline when the character of Roger Thorpe (played by the late Michael Zaslow) raped his wife, Holly (Maureen Garrett). The marital-rape story line reflected a significant real-life case in 1978 -- the state of Oregon v. John J. Rideout. It was the first time in modern U.S. history that a man was charged with raping his wife and then put on trial. It prompted national debate about whether a man had absolute sexual rights with his spouse. Rideout was acquitted. Among the actors who went on to greater fame after roles on the show: Kevin Bacon, James Earl Jones and Taye Diggs. The last episode is set to air on September 18, the spokeswoman said.

"(CNN) -- Liberals and conservatives don't agree on much these days, but many agree on this: The Department of Health and Human Services' HealthCare.gov rollout has been a debacle. That's reason enough for President Obama to replace agency Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and he should go with an unconventional choice: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In leading the department as it prepared to launch the national insurance exchange platform, Sebelius has presided over less a rollout and more a rolling calamity. The ongoing fiasco has not only dealt a body blow to the Affordable Care Act, it has set back the entire progressive project of good, smart government by failing so ridiculously on one of its most visible public initiatives. On the left, the two most prominent reasons given for not firing Sebelius have little to do with just deserts. Many argue that it would be nearly impossible to get a suitable replacement confirmed by the Senate. Others contend that the situation is so critical that a leadership change would be a detrimental distraction: Why burn precious time tying a nominee up in Senate hearings when the clock is ticking fast on a much-needed fix? The ""keep Sebelius"" crowd isn't being irrational, but they are being uncreative. Yes, it would be complicated to bring in a new Health and Human Services secretary at a precarious time for the rollout -- but presidents change generals in the middle of wars, and we change presidents every four or eight years, no matter what kind of craziness is going on (fall 2008, as everyone remembers, was not a calm time in American life). And yes, the obvious roster of Obama allies would face trouble in the Senate, where the Democrats' lack of a filibuster-proof majority will sorely tempt Republicans, as Ron Brownstein put it last week, ""to use this as kind of a way to leverage more concessions from the administration."" (Indeed, much of the coverage across the media has focused on how safe Sebelius' job is.) But what if Obama made Republicans an offer they didn't see coming -- and couldn't refuse? Enter Bloomberg, who is not a health care guru per se but certainly has some experience in overseeing New York's $6.3 billion health care system (not to mention his strong feelings against large, sugary sodas). Moreover, what he lacks in specific health care expertise, he more than makes up for in managerial prowess and technological acumen, as well as -- relevant to the confirmation fight question -- political independence. Bloomberg didn't, after all, inherit his billions; he founded Bloomberg LP in 1981, and it's now a company with $8 billion in revenue (he's still the majority shareholder). Most of that revenue comes from selling Bloomberg terminals, which are sophisticated computer platforms that integrate data from a dizzying array of sources. That wouldn't be such a bad skill set to have at Health and Human Services right now. Just as important, Bloomberg is still at the top of his game, and he's going to need a job in two months. When asked by a New Yorker reporter late this summer what he'd do after his final term expires, he proposed two weeks of skiing and golf. ""After that, I'd go ballistic."" So he'll be looking for a new place to hang his hat come January 15. Although there aren't a lot of positions that compare to being America's Mayor, Cabinet secretary just might. Though he's a Republican-turned-independent, Bloomberg is much more liberal than today's Republican Party, and it's inconceivable he'd be popular with conservatives on the Hill (libertarian Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has called him ""Nanny Bloomberg""). That said, Democrats wouldn't need that many votes to break a GOP filibuster: An independent fiscal conservative like Bloomberg would have a strong shot at peeling off bipartisanship-tolerant senators like Maine's Susan Collins, Illinois' Mark Kirk, Arizona's John McCain, Ohio's Rob Portman, New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte and Tennessee's Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker. Add five of those folks to the 55 votes in the Democratic caucus, and Bloomberg is confirmable. Even if the president decides to keep Sebelius in place, he should still call on Bloomberg's managerial and IT prowess and enlist him as the new ""Obamacare czar."" Jeff Zients, former acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, is currently filling this role, but he lacks Bloomberg's unique stature and experience -- and is slated to join the White House staff as director of the National Economic Council on January 1 (the same day New York will welcome its new mayor). ""Obamacare czar"" would lack the prestige of a Cabinet appointment, but it's still about the kind of thorny public problem that the newly unemployed mayor might be willing to tackle. Not all Democrats will love the Bloomberg option -- Bill de Blasio's huge momentum in New York is in part a liberal referendum on the current mayor's three terms -- but the man has more to recommend him than lovability: He's a credible, creative and confirmable nominee who would offer the president (whose approval ratings have just dipped to 39% in the latest Gallup tracking poll) one of the few chances he'll get to turn the page on the current HealthCare.gov mess. That would do a lot to safeguard health reform for the long haul -- and begin to restore some much-needed faith in good government.

"(CNN) -- An advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday voted 19-10 to recommend placing tighter restrictions on hydrocodone, an ingredient found in popular prescription drugs including Vicodin, Norco and Lortab. If the panel's advice is adopted by FDA, it would put hydrocodone on par with prescription painkillers like oxycodone, morphine, and methadone -- drugs with high abuse potential that can lead to severe physical dependence. With its vote, the advisory panel is suggesting that hydrocodone be moved from its current classification as a Schedule III drug -- a drug with moderate abuse potential -- to a more restrictive Schedule II classification. Among a wide field of potent prescription painkillers -- which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says are fueling an epidemic of abuse in the United States -- hydrocodone may have been flying under the radar among doctors. ""Most doctors are under the impression that Vicodin (whose main ingredient is hydrocodone) is less addictive than other prescription painkillers,"" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing. ""When you wonder why your dentist gives you 40 hydrocodone for a toothache, or your knee doctor prescribes far more than he should, that's because they're under the impression that it's not addictive as Percocet. That's completely false."" Concerns about generic painkillers increase . The panel's advice, if adopted by the FDA, would limit how much hydrocodone a patient could get between doctor visits. It would also limit refills -- Schedule III drugs can be refilled up to five times, while Schedule II drugs are not eligible for refills, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. But pain patient advocacy groups and pharmaceutical companies, among others, fear that reclassification will make it harder for patients to get medications they need. ""The FDA advisory committee is considering a proposal that could make it harder for patients with legitimate health needs to obtain essential medications,"" according to a statement by the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents pharmacy owners and employees. Hydrocodone is the most prescribed painkiller in the U.S.: 131 million prescriptions for hydrocodone were written in 2010, according to IMS Health, a health care information company. That number far outpaces the medical need for the drug, said Kolodny. ""We've had a medical community that has been massively overprescribing the drug,"" said Kolodny. ""There is very little difference between a hydrocodone molecule and a heroin molecule. We need doctors to prescribe much more cautiously."" But it is up for question whether rescheduling hydrocodone will deter doctors from prescribing, or make it very difficult for patients to obtain it, said Dr. Stephen Anderson, an emergency-room physician in Auburn, Washington. ""You'd like for providers who write prescriptions for it to think twice, you'd like people who use it to think twice,"" said Anderson, also a past president of the Washington chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians. ""Unfortunately I think way too many providers don't draw that distinction very often."" Prescription drug deaths: Two stories . And while Anderson does not wholly agree that reclassifying hydrocodone will necessarily change habits, he says that the move does underline a dire need to change the overall perception of painkillers. ""Society's starting to open their eyes that there is a problem associated (with prescription painkillers),"" said Anderson. ""If you make a move like this...it's out there in the conversation about this epidemic, and that's a good thing."" An FDA spokeswoman could not confirm when the FDA would act on the panel's recommendation. The DEA will make the ultimate decision on whether to reschedule the drug.","An advisory panel recommends that hydrocodone be more restricted .

"(CNN) -- No one knows for the time being as to what exactly Bernard Arnault, France's richest man, intends to do in order to escape the punitively high 75% tax rate being proposed by President Francois Hollande. But it should come as no surprise that he and scores of other wealthy French citizens are looking to organize their financial affairs differently so as to reduce their exposure to what amounts to little more than a smash-and-grab raid on the country's most successful businessmen that will in all likelihood prove counter-productive. After all, we live in a world where different countries operate with different tax regimes, competing (I would hope) to attract businesses -- and therefore jobs -- to their shores. So if one country creates an environment where those who have done well for themselves are suddenly stung with a massive hike in the money the state wants to confiscate from them, they cannot be blamed for wanting to rearrange their finances, their domicile or even their nationality. And, lest we forget, those with the greatest financial resources are those who will find it easiest to relocate in that way. Hence, in the past, we have spoken of a ""brain drain"" when tax in a particular jurisdiction has become excessively high. And when those individuals relocate, not only will the country's treasury miss the additional tax that they would have paid, but it most likely loses all the revenue that they were paying beforehand. That is one of the ways in which increasing a tax rate can reduce the total tax yield, thereby defeating the whole supposed object of the tax-raising exercise. But don't just take my word for that. In the final report of the UK's 2020 Tax Commission, published earlier this year by the TaxPayers' Alliance and Institute of Directors, we reviewed literature by academics the world over and looked at tax changes introduced in a number of different countries to demonstrate the folly of punitively high tax rates. Most students of economics are familiar with the Laffer curve, named by Dr. Art Laffer, which demonstrates how higher taxes do not necessarily mean a higher tax yield, with there being a point (the peak of his curve) after which total revenue falls when the tax rate increases. That lower tax rates increase the tax take has been demonstrated time and again in the real world: remember how JFK said in 1962 that ""the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long term is to cut the rates now""? And then of course we saw that principle again put into practice by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher on their respective sides of the Atlantic in the 1980s. In the 2020 Tax Commission report, we also cite the work of Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva, who have looked at the effects of tax changes specifically on the richest one per cent, amongst whose number Mr. Arnault features in France: . ""The incomes of the top one per cent respond to taxes in three ways: (1) the standard supply-side channel through reduced economic activity, (2) the tax avoidance channel, (3) the compensation bargaining channel through efforts in influencing own pay setting. In other words, high earners will either respond to lower taxes by doing more productive work, by putting less effort into avoiding taxes or by putting more effort into negotiating for higher pay, as the post-tax rewards for all three are now higher."" Conversely, the opposite is clearly true, with higher taxes making them less productive, more likely to find ways of avoiding taxes and so on. Tax evasion is illegal and cannot be condoned, but tax avoidance is when people devise mechanisms which contravene an interpretation of the spirit of the law but are nonetheless perfectly legal and intended wholly or primarily to reduce their liabilities. The onus should be on governments to change tax systems and close the loopholes that they allow to exist rather than to suggest that those using such schemes are to be condemned. Lower tax rates will reduce people's incentive to avoid tax and a simplified tax code should also provide fewer opportunities for avoidance in the first place. So if things get to the point where people are seriously considering changing nationality to reduce their tax bill, then that is a symptom of a tax system that has become seriously dysfunctional and in urgent need of reform. As we can see, President Hollande is doing the French and their government's coffers a disservice with the introduction of his new top rate of tax -- and that ought to be a salutary lesson for anyone seeking to emulate it elsewhere.

"(CNN) -- The question is not just whether Jim Thorpe, in death, will ever be allowed to rest in peace. The question is whether he ever managed to find true peace while he was alive. Thorpe, the Native American from rural Oklahoma who in the early years of the 20th century became the greatest athlete in the world, died in 1953. He is back in the news because one of his sons, Jack Thorpe, 73, is waging a legal battle to have his body removed from where it is buried in Pennsylvania and sent back to Oklahoma. ""I want to see him put away properly,"" the son recently told reporter John Branch of The New York Times. ""I want him put where he wanted to be."" Jim Thorpe is buried in the town of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, and the way that happened is a story in itself. Thorpe, the son of a Sac and Fox Indian blacksmith in Oklahoma, grew up with athletic ability so incandescent that the scope of his accomplishments mesmerized the world. He won two gold medals in the 1912 Olympic Games, for the decathlon and the pentathlon. He was a professional football star and is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He played baseball in the major leagues for six seasons. His heart was broken after newspapers reported that, before going to the Olympics, he had received small amounts of money for playing semi-pro baseball. Today, of course, the idea of professional athletes competing in the Olympics doesn't even warrant a public yawn; think of all the NBA players on the United States Olympic basketball team, or all the NHL players on various Olympic hockey teams. But back then there was an assumed purity to the idea of amateurism, and Thorpe was shamed by having his Olympic medals taken from him and his achievements nullified. (The medals were reinstated in 1983, 30 years too late for him to know about it.) His post-sports life was rugged. Beset by alcoholism, he died in a California trailer home at age 64 in 1953. Various communities around the country offered to provide burial and a monument, in the hopes of attracting tourists. The Pennsylvania towns of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk made the most attractive offer to Thorpe's third wife, Patricia: If they could have the body of the world's greatest athlete, they would rename their towns. So it is that Thorpe, for more than half a century, has been buried in Jim Thorpe. He had eight children; I got to know one of them, his daughter Grace, when she was 70. She has since died, but some of the things she told me about her late dad have stayed with me, because they show a decent man who seemed lost in a lifetime blizzard of great fame and utter confusion. ""When Dad was too old to play sports anymore, he had to make a living,"" she said. ""He had no money. There were no pension benefits or anything. He didn't know quite what to do. When he was in his 40s, he took a job out in California digging ditches. He didn't say much about that to me. He dug ditches because he had to make a buck."" Once hailed by kings and presidents for his athletic skills, Thorpe's life, she said, became an almost constant struggle. She sensed his quiet sorrow about his medals being taken from him: ""I think he was bitter, but I don't really know, because he didn't talk much about himself, good or bad."" His losing battle with alcohol haunted her. ""He was always so graceful,"" she said. ""When I was very young I didn't understand what a great athlete he was, but I knew what a graceful person he was. He taught me how to ballroom dance. He took me in his arms and taught me how to dance."" Later in his life, she said, ""Sometimes he would come home after he had been drinking, and he wouldn't be physically graceful. He would slur his words and he would walk unsteadily, and it was a sad thing for me to see."" Whether Thorpe's body will be taken out of its Pennsylvania resting place and shipped to Oklahoma is something the courts will decide. It is one more melancholy act in a once-glorious life that was blindsided by the fates. Grace Thorpe told me about a fleeting moment on one of the last days she ever spent with her dad. She was living in the small town of Pearl River, New York, near the New Jersey line, and in 1951 he came to visit her. ""Dad stayed with me, and he had to go to New York City for something, and I drove him to the bus stop,"" she said. ""In Pearl River, the bus stop was right underneath the marquee of the movie theater. ""Years before, when he needed money, Dad had sold the rights to make a movie of his life to Warner Brothers. He had only been paid $1,500 for it. In 1951 Dad was 63 years old, and the movie had finally been made and had just come out. It starred Burt Lancaster, playing my dad. And it was showing at the Pearl River Theater that day. ""So Dad was standing underneath the marquee, and the marquee had the title on it: 'Jim Thorpe, All-American.' I dropped him at the bus stop, and I looked back, and there he was. Dad was wearing his old suede jacket and a broad-brimmed hat, and he was carrying the same old suitcase he always carried. He was standing there kind of quiet, just waiting for the bus.""

"New York (CNN) -- New York police have arrested one of their own on riot and criminal mischief charges in connection with the September 29 attack on an SUV driver in New York City, a law enforcement official said Tuesday. Wojciech Braszczok, a 32-year-old detective in the New York Police Department who was off duty at the time, is allegedly shown on a video smashing the rear window of the Range Rover as it drove amid a sea of motorcyclists on the city's West Side Highway, according to the official. That video is now in investigators' hands. It is not clear if the detective participated in the subsequent beating of the vehicle's driver, Alexian Lien. Both charges Braszczok faces are felonies, according to the law enforcement official. Braszczok was one of at least two off-duty undercover officers who were riding with fellow bikers that day, a law enforcement official told CNN. The other officer, who is under investigation, has been talking with authorities about the incident, a law enforcement source said. Braszczok was riding with his motorcycle club when the incident occurred and saw much of the confrontation, a law enforcement source told CNN last week. The undercover officer allegedly didn't inform supervisors about the incident until three days later, telling internal affairs investigators that he waited because he reportedly was afraid his cover would be blown. The second off-duty officer now being questioned also waited a few days to report the incident, the law enforcement source said. Off-duty police officer among bikers who saw SUV driver beaten . Braszczok is expected to be arraigned Wednesday. Once the prosecutor formally brings charges against him, six people in total -- all of them motorcyclists -- will have been charged in the case. ""In the last few days, serious charges have been brought against several defendants in last Sunday's attack,"" Erin Duggan, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, said Wednesday. ""As we said from the beginning of the investigation, the NYPD and the District Attorney's Office are methodically scrutinizing the evidence to build the strongest possible cases in our continuing effort to hold accountable those responsible."" The five other motorcyclists are: . • Clint Caldwell, a 32-year-old biker from Brooklyn, faces charges of gang assault, assault and criminal mischief. Police have video allegedly showing him at the scene of the attack, according to New York police Lt. John Grimpel. He too will be arraigned Wednesday. • Craig Wright, 29, was arraigned Tuesday on gang assault and other charges and then ordered held on $150,000 bond. Wright is accused of stomping Lien at least twice after police say he and other motorcyclists forced the man's Range Rover to a stop, used their helmets to break out the window and dragged him out of the car, in which his wife and 2-year-old daughter were passengers. A witness who tried to help the driver told CNN on Tuesday that bikers also tried to drag Lien's wife from the vehicle. According to court documents, police say Wright, 29, identified himself in a picture showing him standing near the stopped SUV. Another photograph shows him stomping Lien as the man lies on the ground, according to the documents. Wright is charged with first-degree gang assault, first-degree assault and first-degree unlawful imprisonment. He was arrested at his home in Brooklyn. In addition to the bond, New York Trial Court Judge Tamiko Amaker set Wright's next court date for Friday. In March, Wright pleaded guilty to driving with a suspended license, a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office said. It is unclear whether he was driving with a suspended license at the time of the SUV incident. He was also convicted in Virginia in 2005 for reckless driving. Motorcyclist charged in beating of SUV driver . • Reginald Chance, 37, who was captured on video smashing his helmet into the SUV's window, has been charged with first-degree assault and gang assault. He was ordered held on $75,000 bond Sunday. Assistant District Attorney Samantha Turino said Chance's license had been suspended and he should not have been driving. She said his arrest record includes a marijuana charge in 2013 and attempted criminal possession of a weapon in 2006. ""The law does permit someone who is a victim of an accident to at least attempt to get the identification of the motorist,"" said Chance's attorney, Gregory Watts. ""My client obviously overreacted in that manner, but he is not this thug assaulting someone who's harmless, contrary to the public opinion that's being put out there."" He said Chance was knocked off his motorcycle by Lien's SUV after bikers had surrounded the vehicle earlier. • Christopher Cruz, 28, who police say is the biker who slowed in front of Lien, was charged with reckless driving and other misdemeanors. He was released on bond. His lawyer, H. Benjamin Perez, said, ""He never tried to assault him in any way. And he does not know any of the other motorcyclists who were involved in this beating."" • Robert Sims, 35, is accused of stomping on Lien. He surrendered Friday on charges of attempted assault and gang assault. New York police: Bikers stomped on SUV driver . The case became national news after video of the incident surfaced. The video was captured, attorney Andrew Vecere said, when his client, motorcyclist Kevin Bresloff, turned on his helmet camera after he saw a water bottle thrown from the SUV's sunroof toward the bikers. It shows dozens of bikers swarming on Manhattan's West Side Highway. One motorcycle quickly slowed down in front of Lien, who bumped its rear tire, slightly injuring Cruz. Lien pulled to a stop, and angry bikers surrounded his vehicle, hitting it and spiking its tires, police said. Lien's vehicle plowed into three more bikers, including Edwin Mieses, whose wife says he is paralyzed. Edwin Mieses is still in great pain, Dayana Mieses said Tuesday, but he's out of the intensive care unit. A doctor told them ""there's a 99% chance my husband will never walk again,"" she said. The video shows the Range Rover stopping again -- long enough for a biker to open the door -- and Lien then driving away until traffic forced him to the final stop. Opinion: In attack, can bikers get a fair shake? Police say the subsequent beating included kicks to Lien's head and body as he lay on the highway. Lien suffered two black eyes and cuts on his face and side, requiring stitches, a police detective's criminal complaint said. His wife and daughter were unharmed. Defenders of the bikers, including relatives of Mieses, the critically injured biker, have criticized Lien for driving through the crowd of motorcycles. Vecere, Bresloff's attorney, says his client hasn't been charged with a crime, and he doesn't expect him to be. He said police issued a warrant for the video, but Bresloff was going to turn it over anyway. He's cooperating with police, Vecere said. ""He was shocked"" by what happened, the attorney said, adding that the case is ""not black and white.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The controversial auction of Michael Jackson's property from his Neverland ranch has been canceled, and all of the items will be returned to Jackson, the auction organizer said. The property will return to Michael Jackson's control, the owner of an auction company says. The singer sued the auction company last month, claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from Neverland after he sold the ranch. ""We resolved everything with Michael Jackson,"" Julien's Auctions owner Darren Julien said. ""We came to a resolution that both sides are very happy with."" Details of the settlement are confidential, Julien said. The public can still ""get a glimpse at Neverland and the life and career of Michael Jackson"" because the items will remain on exhibit in Beverly Hills, California, until April 25, Julien said. The exhibition was a prelude to the planned auction. After April 25, the items will go back to Jackson's control, Julien said. The items, including the iconic Neverland gates, the singer's famed white-jeweled glove and a stretch Rolls Royce, were removed by the auction house last year at Jackson's request, the auctioneer told CNN. Jackson's lawyer did not immediately respond to calls for comment. Jackson sold Neverland ranch, his former home, last year. Since his 2005 acquittal in the United States on child molestation charges Jackson has spent much of his time living in Bahrain. Jackson is set to perform 50 ""final curtain call"" concerts in London, England, starting in July. The shows sold out in four hours last month, the events' organizers said.

"(CNN) -- Latvia's president has described the deadly collapse of a supermarket roof in Riga as ""basically mass murder"" of defenseless citizens, local media reports. At least 53 people died in Thursday's collapse at the Maxima supermarket, in the west of Latvia's capital, national news agency LETA said Saturday. It said rescue workers are continuing their hunt for survivors and still have about 150 squre meters to search. President Andris Berzins had told Latvian television that ""nature could not be blamed"" for the collapse and that those involved needed to think about what they had done, so that action could be taken. ""This incident is basically the mass murder of a large number of defenseless civilians. We must act accordingly,'' Berzins said. Berzins urged for a team of independent experts from abroad to be assembled to investigate the collapse. Latvia has declared three days mourning -- Saturday to Monday -- for victims of the collapse. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that two Russian citizens -- a man and a woman -- were among those killed. It said a second collapse had occurred after rescue workers arrived and a third took place Saturday, but that no rescuers were injured in the latest collapse. LETA earlier quoted a State Fire and Rescue Service spokesman as saying rescuers had begun searching the ""least stable"" area of the site Saturday. ""The area is very dangerous and unstable, and the decision has been made to search the area with less men, so to prevent anymore collapses,"" the news agency said. Three firefighters are among the dead. Latvia's Interior Ministry said their families would receive 50,000 LVL ($95,600) in compensation. Treatment for rescue workers injured in the operation would also be paid for, it said. In an interview with CNN Friday, Rescue Service spokeswoman Viktorija Sembele declined to speculate on the cause of the collapse. ""There are a lot of versions, a lot of stories. The real cause of this tragic accident will be investigated by state police and other authorities once the rescue is finished,"" she said. However, Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs earlier told CNN that authorities think building materials stored on the roof caused it to collapse. The supermarket collapse is the Baltic state's deadliest accident since it won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, LETA said. Latvia's previous most deadly accident was a nursing home fire that killed 26 people in 2007.

"(CNN) -- Actress Kate Winslet appears on the cover of the November issue of Vogue, now on newsstands. She is radiant; glowing and fairly ageless in that way that, one has come to suspect, only professional photo editing can achieve, although Winslet has objected to digital manipulation of her image in the past. Still, much ado has been made of the fact that Winslet is pregnant with her third child during the shoot -- but it's impossible to tell. On the cover, only her face is visible; inside, her body is shrouded in layers of thick fabrics. She looks gorgeous. But pregnant? Aside from the maternal wrapping of her hands around her nonexistent belly, not particularly. The publishing industry has a history of putting pregnant celebrities on magazine covers and featuring them in fashion shoots. Naturally, these women are made to look flawlessly chic and as comfortable as ever in their skin, two characteristics not typically associated with the very physical nine months of carrying a child. Demi Moore photographed by Annie Leibovitz was, of course, the pioneer of this particular genre of cover modeling when she posed naked -- aside from some giant jewels and an aloof expression -- for the cover of Vanity Fair back in 1991. It's an image that's inspired countless others, with magazines recreating the look since then with celebrities such as Cindy Crawford, Jessica Simpson and Claudia Schiffer. And the bodies keep getting better: At least Leibovitz, or Vanity Fair, let Moore retain a bit of realistic cellulite. But by the time we got to supermodel Miranda Kerr, naked and pregnant in W in 2010, it was official: Pregnancy is just regular life, albeit with a slightly rounded tummy. And so it goes this month, both with Winslet and with Ivanka Trump, who is seen posing for the cover of FitPregnancy magazine in a dress with a hip-high slit looking both very pregnant and very trim. The cover elicited such raves as ""Ivanka Trump is flawless!"" And indeed she is, enviably, almost impossibly, so. Putting aside the now-standard practice of electronically ""perfecting"" already gorgeous women for the purpose of selling magazines, there is something particularly dangerous about depicting pregnant women in such a way. One might argue that these magazines are celebrating a woman's natural shape during a beautiful time in her life. But is it a celebration? Or an exploitation? The fact is that it's the rare instance in which a female celebrity larger than a size 4 is put on the cover of a magazine, especially a fashion magazine. When she is, it's often because the magazine is running a ""special issue"" -- or because she's expecting. Or both. In 2003, for example, Vogue put a pregnant Brooke Shields on the cover for its Shape issue. But pregnancy isn't a shape; not exactly. It is, however, to hear these magazines tell it -- or, rather, to see them depict it -- pretty damn glamorous. The message: Big is OK when you're expecting and Photoshopped to glowing perfection: After all, it's only temporary. Otherwise, forget about it. Consider Elle's current issue, which features six different cover celebrities as part of its annual ""Women in Hollywood"" theme. One is actress Melissa McCarthy, who looks gorgeous in an enormous Marina Rinaldi coat, as the other cover actresses are shown in form-fitting dresses or various states of undress. How come we don't get to see McCarthy's bumps the way we do Trump's? Of course, women respond differently to pregnancy. Perhaps these female celebrities, who are indisputably genetically blessed, look no different posing pregnant than they do when they're not expecting. Perhaps, but not likely. What's likely, though, is the message society is getting: that ease and beauty in pregnancy are the norm. By unequivocally depicting expectant women as beautiful and glowing and ready for a night out in a tight dress, these magazines set up unrealistic expectations for both pregnancy and motherhood, neither of which is easy, beautiful, or picture-perfect, at least not all the time. Proof of shifting expectations has already emerged, and society has indeed come to expect a certain level of beauty from its pregnant stars. Though Kim Kardashian is generally admired for having a body that does not succumb to the Hollywood ideal, she received constant negative press throughout her pregnancy for her weight gain; for not being, at all times, ""cover-worthy."" People, with the help of the media, seem to forget that pregnant women change shape, and that's a wonderful, natural thing that needn't be covered up or defended or cloaked in haute couture. It needn't always look perfect, because when is it, really? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Kate Winslet on Vogue is pregnant but it's impossible to tell .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Recent photos of Lindsay Lohan's teenage sister sparked online speculation over the past week that the 17-year-old Ali Lohan changed her face, which her publicist denied Monday. ""Aliana has never had any type of plastic surgery in her life, nor has she ever considered it,"" said her publicist, Steve Honig. Buzz about apparent changes in Lohan's face started on websites including Hollywoodlife.com, which said, ""We love Lindsay's little sister, but these shocking photos make it look like her beauty is not all-natural!"" Honig, in a written statement to CNN, said Lohan, who recently signed a modeling contract, has no reason to have plastic surgery. ""Her success as a model lies with her natural looks and she has no interest in changing that,"" he said. Honig, however, did not dispute that Ali Lohan's face today is different from when she was younger. ""During the past two years, she has gone through a normal teenage growth spurt that has made her taller and slimmer,"" he said. ""It has also slightly changed the composure of her face, all of which is typical of what happens to kids in their mid to late teens. It's what most people refer to as the awkward stage. Ali is growing up; that's all."" The director Next Model Management, the agency who signed Lohan, told CNN Monday she could ""confirm that Aliana Lohan has not had any surgery."" ""As a young girl who is growing up, it's natural for her facial features to change slightly, and we see this with many of the younger models we represent,"" Alexis Borges said.

"(CNN) -- It's supposed to be known as the ""Beautiful Game"" but the ugly face of racism returned to haunt European football once again Wednesday. Manchester City's Yaya Toure, the Ivory Coast midfielder, was subjected to ""monkey chants"" during his side's 2-1 Champions League win against CSKA Moscow in Russia. City is expected to make a formal complaint to UEFA, the game's European governing body, with Toure urging for action to be taken following his side's victory courtesy of two goals from Sergio Aguero. ""A couple of months ago, a friend was playing at Milan and he had the same problem, and today with me again, it's always the same,"" he told the club's official website. ""I hope they will change it, I hope they will get big sanctions. They have to ban them at some stage, they have to ban a club for a couple of years. ""They don't know. They have to do something about it or they will always continue with it. I don't know why we just have this in football -- in volleyball or rugby, we don't have it. ""A few times when I went to the goal and tried to score, I missed it, some of the fans reacted badly. It's always the same - what they say about racism, but they have to stop it now. We have to act, I hope that UEFA will take action. I want it to stop. ""If UEFA don't take action about that, it will continue. We always have some guy saying 'we will have it, blah blah blah'."" Toure went on Twitter to thanks fans for their support following the incident with thousands retweeting his sentiments. He tweeted: ""Thank you for your support! Hate or racism cannot affect me when so many people are showing me love and support on a daily basis! ""I believe in football institutions, I know decision makers will take their responsibilities and show a red card to racism."" City captain Vincent Kompany, who is of Congolese descent, took to Twitter to hit out at the abuse and sent a message to UEFA and the Russian government. ""Racist chants again in Moscow today.. We've all said enough. @UEFAcom, @GovernmentRF, CSKA, all eyes are on you now.."" UEFA has vowed to crack down harder on fans which continue to partake in racial abuse. In May, the body's executive committee ratified a 10-match minimum ban for racial abuse by players or officials. At the time, UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino stated that the organization's 53 members should adopt the same measures. According to the new regulations, the first sanction for a club whose fans are found guilty of racist abuse will be a partial stadium closure. If the abuse persists, then there will be a full stadium closure and a $65,000 fine handed out. ""An association should adopt the same or similar measures,"" Infantino said in May. ""UEFA has always acted in a way to try to convince people rather than impose. I don't think you measure the way of fighting against racism in one simple measure and sanction."" In August, Polish club Legia Warsaw was fined $41,000 and ordered to close the north stand of its stadium following racist behavior by supporters during a Champions League second qualifying round tie. UEFA has been heavily criticized in the past for the way it has punished those found guilty of racial abuse compared with other offenses. During Euro 2012, Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner was handed a $125,800 fine for revealing a betting company's logo on his underwear after lifting his shirt while celebrating a goal. UEFA also handed out a larger fine to Chelsea following its semifinal defeat by Barcelona in 2009 after Didier Drogba confronted referee Tom Ovrebo after his failure to award the London club several penalties. When it comes to punishment for racism, UEFA has imposed relatively small fines, which has left the governing body open to extreme criticism. Back in 2002, the Slovakian Football Association was hit with a $29,000 fine after fans abused England duo Ashley Cole and Emile Heskey. A year later, Cole, Heskey and Sol Campbell were abused while on England duty in Macedonia with the host FA being forced to pay a fine of $27,000. In June 2007, the Football Association of Serbia was punished with a $27,000 fine after its fans racially abused England players during the Under-21 Championship Finals in Holland. The Croatian FA was made to pay just $16,000 after its fans were found guilty of ""displaying a racist banner and showing racist conduct"" during the Euro 2008 quarterfinal tie with Turkey. In 2011, Bulgaria's FA was hit with a $54,000 fine after England's Ashley Young, Ashley Cole and Theo Walcott were racially abused during a Euro 2012 qualifier in Sofia. Porto was fined $27,000 after its fans racially abused Manchester City's Mario Balotelli during a Europa League game last April. That decision came a full six weeks after the incident and was then frowned upon further, after UEFA fined City $40,000 for coming out late ahead of the second-half of their last-16 Europa League game at Sporting Lisbon. Both Russia ($39,000) and Spain ($26,000) were fined at Euro 2012 following problems of racism, but neither country was hit as hard in the pocket as Denmark striker Bendtner.","Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure urges UEFA to take action on racism .

"(CNN) -- It's a beautiful day to be on the water a few kilometers off the southern coast of Sri Lanka. Within view of shore the spinner dolphins twist and turn energetically, flying fish launch out of the water and cruise for what seems like ages, and a manta ray gracefully glides under my boat. In the safety of my 20-foot research boat. I am the biggest thing on the water. Suddenly, a blue whale emerges close by, and as it breaks the surface, it exhales. This creature is so immense that the vertical tower of mist that escapes from its blowholes is taller than my boat is long. As it calmly swims, it teases me by revealing just parts of its huge self. It is hard to fathom just how large this creature truly is. I am mesmerized by the scene, impressed at how the buoyancy of the ocean has aided this giant to achieve near maximum size. My moment is disrupted when I become aware of the fleet of container ships close by. Each carries thousands of containers, which are on average twice the length of my boat. Welcome to one of the busiest shipping highways in the world. What I see is no different from what I hear when I drop my hydrophone (underwater microphone) in the water. The cacophony of the ships' propellers drowns out all other sounds in the ocean before, during and often even after we have lost view of them in the distance. These ocean-going monsters are at the beck and call of human needs and their increasing numbers are a reflection of the escalating wants of an ever-growing global population. This morning's lesson has been about perspective but I soon realize there are many more lessons to be learned. Moments like these concretize my desire to scientifically understand these whales in order to protect them. Moments like these drive me to work harder. Over the years, my research has shown that these whales are different, unorthodox even. Science has often described baleen whales (the group that blue whales belong to) as creatures of habit. They travel to the poles to feed and then migrate to the lower latitudes to mate and calve. But we find that quite incredibly, those within the Northern Indian Ocean choose to remain in tropical waters year-round. These blue whales grow up to 24 meters (78.7 feet) and have incredible energetic requirements so it makes sense for them to exploit the most productive areas of the ocean to ensure their survival. But these waters are often considered less productive than their temperate or polar counterparts, and this anomalous behavior leads me to question why? How? The Northern Indian Ocean clearly holds many secrets that we have yet to unravel. What excites me most is that the waters around Sri Lanka, slap-bang in the heart of the Indian Ocean, are home to a resident group of Northern Indian Ocean blues. My research is just beginning to shed light on what sustains this group of the largest animals to ever roam the oceans throughout the year. But besides fulfilling their nutritional needs, Sri Lankan waters provide a safe haven for mothers and calves and have given me the opportunity to observe mesmerizing portrayals of the persistence of males and the pickiness of females engaged in courtship rituals. The Northern Indian Ocean is as unorthodox as the blue whales that live within it. It is the only ocean that is not connected from the North Pole right through to the South Pole. The effects of this geographic isolation are profound, and the differences these blue whales display may be driven in part by this. Unfortunately, this isolation and their dependence on a restricted area for their most fundamental needs -- feeding, breeding and calving makes these blue whales increasingly vulnerable to threats. Very little is known about the causes of natural mortality for blue whales. They are after all, very large. However, human-induced threats abound. Not least, off the south coast of Sri Lanka. Sadly, the overlap between prime blue whale habitat and extremely busy shipping lanes increases the risk of mortality by ship strike. Blue whales do not belong wrapped on the bow of a container ship. They belong swimming freely in the ocean. Available data tells us that commercial shipping densities off the southern coast of Sri Lanka are double those in California's Santa Barbara Channel where measures are already being taken to mitigate the risk of collisions with blue whales. My mission is to decrease whale mortality by ship strike in the waters off Sri Lanka with the support of a strong network of scientists from around the world. But to achieve this mission, I realize I have to be an unorthodox scientist. I have to ensure that people, not just scientists know of the problems faced by this population. I believe that the more we know, the more we care and the more we feel responsible and subsequently, the greater our chance of success. My dream is to work to protect these whales as best I can to ensure that the immense blue whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling of the Colombo National Museum since 1894 is not the only option for seeing blue whales in the future. ---- .

"(CNN) -- Facing mounting criticism over the alleged behavior of one of his players, Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin says the buck stops with him. ""I am in charge of the workplace atmosphere,"" he said at a news conference. Philbin said he was unaware of alleged misconduct by Richie Incognito against fellow offensive lineman Jonathan Martin until Martin's representatives informed the team Sunday evening. ""We immediately took those concerns very, very seriously,"" and informed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to request a review, Philbin said. ESPN also reported that Martin never brought his concerns to Philbin. But many who know the ins and outs of pro football say Philbin should have known what was going on in his ranks and taken action much sooner. ""The recent developments in the Jonathan Martin-Richie Incognito situation (have)shown us one thing: Joe Philbin is to blame for the turmoil in the Miami Dolphins' locker room,"" writes Gil Alcaraz of rantsports.com. ""First and foremost, an NFL head coach needs to know what's going on within his own locker room. If there's a player bullying another player, sending him threatening voice mails and text messages while making him feel uncomfortable on a daily basis, the head coach has to be aware of it."" The central allegation against Incognito involves messages to Martin, including a voice mail in which Incognito allegedly used racial slurs, threatened physical violence, and used the words, ""I'll kill you."" Martin's representatives have turned materials over to the NFL for an investigation. Incognito allegedly also got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Las Vegas by a group of Dolphins even though Martin preferred not to travel with them. Martin gave Incognito the money, fearing the consequences if he did not, ESPN reported. Incognito, on Twitter, accused a news organization of ""attaching my name to false speculation,"" but that tweet and others were later deleted, according to bleacherreport.com. Incognito has been suspended; Martin left the team. It's unclear what lies in store for either of them. Incognito said Tuesday he is ""weathering the storm right now."" Richie Incognito, Jonathan Martin, and the NFL's future . Philbin ""is ultimately to blame here,"" Dan Shanoff writes at USAToday. ""... Philbin either actively neglected his team culture (his claim) or he knew and did nothing (which would be worse). Let's give him the benefit of the doubt -- at best, he is an appallingly ineffective leader."" The Sun Sentinel reports that Dolphins coaches had asked Incognito to toughen up Martin -- orders he may have taken too far. The report does not say whether Philbin himself made the request. Philbin did tell players each year to ""cut out"" rookie hazing, the paper reports. But how much are NFL coaches really expected to police their teams? By and large, they ""let their players, and especially their seasoned veterans, maintain harmony in the locker room,"" Ken Belson writes in the New York Times. ""In the crudest sense, they are hired to build a winning team, and as long as players do their jobs well, what happens elsewhere is largely immaterial."" ""To some extent, the inmates run the asylum,"" Trevor Pryce, a defensive end who spent 14 years in the NFL, told the Times. ""The coaches have a lot of other things to deal with."" No organization speaks for all NFL coaches. The NFL Coaches Association ""represents the interests of nearly 500 assistant coaches,"" according to the website of its executive director, David Cornwell. He was not immediately available Wednesday to discuss this issue. Ricky Williams, who played with Incognito in Miami, said he believes a coach should only step in if behind-the-scenes behavior affects play on the field. ""The locker room, we keep coaches out for a reason. It's our space,"" Williams told KGMZ-FM in San Francisco, according to NFL.com. There is ""a lack of leadership in that locker room,"" he said of the Dolphins. Some coaches have been credited with taking disturbing behavior seriously. ""Hall of Famer Bill Walsh's coaching tree never tolerated any form of hazing or harassing. Pete Carroll doesn't allow it in Seattle. Jimmy Johnson and Mike Shanahan have said they've never witnessed bullying to the extent that is alleged in this circumstance,"" NFL.com reports. As the conflict between Incognito and Martin spirals into a time of reckoning for the entire NFL, league officials face the task of laying out in clear terms just what coaches are responsible for -- and how to punish coaches when their players cross the line. Philbin has compared running a team to running a school. When his two children go to school each day, ""I have certain expectations that the administration, the teachers and the staff are going to create a safe atmosphere where my children can learn and develop as people,"" he said at his news conference Monday. ""This is no different,"" he added. ""I take this responsibility very seriously."" But even if Philbin shoulders blame for what allegedly transpired in his team, he's not alone, says columnist Jen Floyd Engel of foxsports.com. She points to others in the team's leadership and the players themselves. ""(I)t is every person who saw what was happening to Martin and did nothing who deserve our condemnation.""","Allegations surrounding NFL star Richie Incognito are raising questions about coaches .

"London (CNN) -- A violin played by the Titanic's bandleader as the ship sank sold at auction Saturday for more than $1.7 million, a UK-based auction house said. The price -- 1.1 million British pounds, when adding the buyer's premium and tax -- is by far the highest ever fetched for memorabilia tied to the sunken passenger ship, according to veteran collector Craig Sopin. ""This figure is going to be hard to beat,"" said Sopin, who helped authenticate the fact the violin came from the Titanic. ""I can't think of anything else that is more iconic to come off that ship."" According to survivors, Wallace Hartley's band played to calm passengers even as the ship sank beneath them. The scene was depicted in James Cameron's blockbuster movie ""Titanic,"" which depicted Hartley and his band playing ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" as the ship took on water. Hartley's body was reportedly pulled from the water days after the April 1912 sinking with his violin case still strapped to his back. In 2006, the damaged violin was found in the attic of a home in Britain. It was authenticated through testing of salt water deposits, according to a statement released by Henry Aldridge and Son, which hosted the auction in Wiltshire, England. The violin was adorned with an engraved silver plate that connected it to Hartley. Aussie tycoon insists Titanic II good idea . The names of the seller and the buyer have not been released. The famous wreckage was first discovered in 1985 off the coast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Since then there have been a number of research and recovery expeditions, during which time the artifacts included in the sale were found. Interest in the shipwreck peaked again after the release of the movie ""Titanic"" in 1997. The film grossed $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the second highest grossing film in history, according to Box Office Mojo, a site that tracks ticket sales. Over the years, exhibitions of Titanic artifacts have made millions, and auctions have drawn high-priced sales. End of an era for tourist trips to ghostly wreck of Titanic . In 2004, Guernsey's auctioned off memorabilia from the Titanic and a few artifacts that had been passed down through the families of survivors. An original menu sold for about $100,000, the president of the auction house said at the time. Sopin, a Philadelphia lawyer who has between 300 or 400 Titanic artifacts, said the ocean liner's sinking is ""in a class all its own"" when it comes to disasters, due to its unique mix of historical, cultural and cinematic elements. ""The ship is a microcosm of society,"" he said, noting the different classes of people aboard the ship that fateful night. And it had both villains and heroes -- Hartley and his fellow band members, none of whom survived, chief among the latter group. ""What they were doing was actually causing a sense of calm on that ship,"" Sopin said. ""You could only wonder the mass pandemonium that would have occurred otherwise. It helped save a lot of lives."" What happens to goods lost at sea? CNN's Per Nyberg reported from London; Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Five young children were pulled from a car Thursday after it plunged into an icy pond in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. The children -- ages 1 through 7 -- suffered serious injuries, according to the Minnesota State Patrol, which received a report of the car in a retention pond early in the morning. The 1998 Pontiac Grand Am had run off the road into the water, which was about 9 feet deep where the vehicle sank. Its driver, 23-year-old Marion Guerrido, got out of the car on her own, and suffered no apparent injuries. Onlookers and medical personnel attempted to reach the vehicle. But because of the cold water, and how far the car sank, they were unable to get to the children immediately, according to Lt. Eric Roeske with the Minnesota State Police. The first child was removed some 20 minutes after the incident began; the last child was in the water for roughly 40 minutes, he said. Authorities do not believe weather, drugs or alcohol played a role in the crash, which is under investigation. Three of the five victims are children of the driver, CNN affiliate KARE reported. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","A 1998 Pontiac Grand Am ran off the road .

"(CNN) -- Even as America reels from the horrific massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, the clock continues to count down toward the so-called ""fiscal cliff."" In the face of a legitimate crisis, it is harder to stomach manufactured ones. And that's exactly what the so-called fiscal cliff is. In fact, every time I hear the term, I want to slam my head on the table. Luckily, I'm not alone. Today, December 19, a collection of artists are coming together to expose the ""fiscal cliff"" as a ""fiscal bluff,"" and remind progressives of the power of culture in helping to win the long-term war of ideas. My organization, Rebuild the Dream, is joining artist groups CultureStrike and 5D Stories on a special project: ""ARTSTRIKE: America's Not Broke, America is Being Robbed."" On Wednesday, with the help of Rebuild the Dream's members and partners, millions of people will see works of art that convey what is at stake in the big budget fight. Some of the artwork takes the form of arresting and powerful visuals with a fierce message. Other works explain what is happening in Washington, or graphically depict the choice our nation faces. There are songs and videos touching on issues from student debt to long-ignored poverty. Not every piece frames the debate exactly as I would, and I may not share every artist's exact view. But that's not the point of a project like this. I believe this project conveys a message that policymakers need to hear. And it couldn't come at a more urgent moment than now, as reports indicate President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner could be nearing a deal that slashes Social Security, cuts benefits for veterans and raises taxes on the poor and middle class to pay for the Bush wars, tax cuts and bailouts. Our country is in the midst of a massive jobs crisis, the next generation is saddled in debt, the climate crisis is rapidly approaching a point of no return and now unspeakable gun violence shatters the heart of our nation. Instead of tackling these problems, some of our nation's leaders are apparently contemplating putting Social Security, and maybe Medicare, on the chopping block in a panic move -- all to avoid an artificially contrived deadline. We can make a huge dent in the rest of the deficit just by returning to the higher taxes and lower defense spending of the Clinton boom years, asking those who do well in America to do well by America. Washington should also deal with spending by cutting wasteful subsidies to oil companies, defense contractors and agribusinesses that do little but line CEOs' pockets with our tax dollars. The main part of the cliff that worries me is taxes going up on poor and middle-class Americans. The House of Representatives could fix that with one vote to extend the current low rates. We need to spread the word, and I am glad that artists are leading the way. Artists have been at the forefront of all great modern social movements. They inspire people to dream bigger, force us to imagine a different world and confront people with new ideas. We must embrace the power of art to better protect the American Dream for generations to come. We should never allow Washington politicians to stampede the American people into supporting cuts they otherwise would never accept. They're bluffing -- and hoping we fold. It's not a fiscal cliff, it's a fiscal bluff. And as our nation struggles to deal with real emergencies, I am glad that America's artists are calling them on it. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: After Newtown, it is hard to stomach an artificial crisis like the fiscal cliff .

"(CNN) -- Three coalition service members died after a suicide attack Friday in the Afghan capital of Kabul, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. The NAT0-led force said the suicide strike was carried out with a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device. The nationalities of the service members were not immediately available. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The attack comes two days after two rounds of ""indirect fire"" struck the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, the embassy said. No one was injured in the Wednesday incident. A claim of responsibility was posted on the Taliban's official website. The violence is occurring during an important juncture in U.S.-Afghan relations. The two countries are working on an important security pact.

"(Wired) -- It's mind-boggling to look at paintings from the 14th and 15th centuries and think that artists like Leonardo da Vinci created such vibrant portraits using nothing more than a free hand and the naked eye -- when just 100 years before, two-point perspective was unknown. If you're David Hockney, who's been a seminal figure in modern painting since the 1960s, you literally can't believe it. Hockney holds nothing against his predecessors, but he does have a theory that some used early optical devices to improve and expand their skills. The idea first occurred to him nearly 14 years ago and became the subject of his book Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the lost techniques of the Old Masters. Hockney's latest show, A Bigger Exhibition, hosted by San Francisco's de Young Museum, looks back on the period since his revelation, highlighting how he's embraced technology ranging from video cameras to iPads, and integrated them into his art. (The exhibition's title is a play on Hockney's best-known painting, A Big Splash.) In 1999, a long-standing and well known fascination with new media led Hockney to his controversial suspicions. Visiting the retrospective of a 19th century French artist, he noticed uncanny technical similarities to drawings that Andy Warhol had traced from slide-projected photographs. Knowing that the tools Warhol had used clearly weren't available in the 1800's, Hockney began researching. It wasn't long before he came across camera lucida, a small prism mounted at the end of a metal arm that enables an artist to refract an image onto their paper. The device received a patent in 1807. Bingo. The discovery was enough to prompt Hockney to expand his investigation, which quickly grew in scope and size. By the end of his study he'd created The Great Wall, a staggering arrangement of pictures organized chronologically from left to right, and geographically from top to bottom, charting of the evolution of western art across time and space. He used the Wall to trace this history of optical aids, identifying 1420 as the trend's likely genesis. Shown publicly for the first time at the de Young, the 8-by-72-foot behemoth is the ultimate testament to Hockney's obsession with technology's influence on fine art. It's obvious that tools like camera lucida made creating realistic artwork easier. But Hockney's broader concern, which he's explored extensively throughout his career, is how technology has allowed artists to experiment with new perspectives, and thus create new ways of considering the world around them. Where Jan van Eyck might have used convex mirrors to create a larger field of view on his canvas, Hockney turns to a modern equivalent: video cameras. Tucked among the rows of hanging paintings and sketches, four large sets of nine LED screens roll footage of the same country road, each in one of the four seasons. To make the piece, titled Woldgate Woods, Hockney mounted nine cameras on an SUV and while a studio assistant drove, he directed another who controlled each shot individually. The result is a video collage that's synchronized in timing, but visually unaligned -- a choice he hoped would challenge the viewer's understanding of perspective, encouraging them to explore each screen and become an active participant in the work. Unsurprisingly, you can find more evidence of technological inspiration all over A Bigger Exhibition. Walking through the seemingly endless space devoted to the exhibit -- the largest in the museum's history -- it's seemingly in more places than not. From towering 12-foot-tall prints of iPad drawings to rolling flat screens depicting each of his digital brushstrokes, Hockney's eye has remained steady while his tools have changed -- making you wonder what will be next in his arsenal.

"(CNN) -- The United States and Israel are on the same side when it comes to Iran, but you might not know it watching the bitter public disagreement that has broken out between the two allies over negotiations with the Islamic Republic. Is this a way for friends to handle their differences? The talks with Iran present enormous challenges for Washington. One of those challenges is to move through the process without damaging existing alliances or weakening America's already diminished standing in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that he thinks the U.S. is falling into an Iranian trap. The White House says it is moving cautiously in the interest of peace and security. The disagreement is tearing at the alliance. Both Israel and the U.S. should find a different way to make their cases. They have moved perilously close to impugning each other's character instead of debating the merits of their positions. Netanyahu strongly objects to the proposal that would ease sanctions in exchange for a slowdown of Iran's nuclear program during negotiations for a permanent agreement. He is used to wielding sharp words. His tone has suggested U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are being played for fools. When talks broke off a few weeks ago, Netanyahu sarcastically called the agreement that was almost reached between Iran and the so-called P5+1, the U.N. Security Council permanent members plus Germany, ""the deal of the century"" -- for Iran. France, too, another U.S. ally, called the proposal ""a sucker's deal."" But it's not just critics of the Obama administration position who have come perilously close to insulting those with whom they disagree. White House spokesman Jay Carney responded to criticism and to calls for new sanctions by saying ""the American people do not want a march to war,"" as if those who don't like this agreement actually want a war. The notion that Netanyahu, that Israelis, want war with Iran is patently absurd. Some may think a war is unavoidable, but everyone in Israeli knows war with Iran would bring unspeakable suffering. In Israel, the issue is personal for every family that lives within rocket range of Iran -- every family. Many Israelis dislike Netanyahu's style, but they share his concern. Today, only 31% of Israelis think Israel can rely on the U.S. on talks with Iran. What Israel wants is a strong deal, one that truly prevents Iran from having the ability to quickly build a nuclear weapon when it chooses. That, incidentally, is what America's Arab friends also want, creating an unlikely alignment of interests between Israelis and Arabs. Instead of ""dissing"" each other and engaging in acrimonious debate that brings satisfaction to their enemies, Israel and the U.S. should concentrate on the substance of their disagreement. Both Israel and the U.S. -- not to mention France, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and others -- want to bring an end to what they believe is Iran's nuclear weapons program. Iran says it only wants nuclear power, but even U.N. weapons inspectors say there are indications of a military aspect to Iran's nuclear program. Israel and the U.S., of course, have different perspectives. They differ on tactics, strategy, and to some degree on goals. The U.S. is physically distant from Iran and it has a stronger military. Israel wants Iran to end all nuclear enrichment. The U.S. is apparently willing to allow some enrichment and stockpiles. America sees Iran and its nuclear program as a challenge to global stability, to the regional balance of power, to nuclear nonproliferation. Israelis believe Iran aims to destroy their country. On Wednesday, as talks restarted in Geneva, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gave a televised speech in which he called Israel the ""rabid dog"" of the Middle East and declared that Israel ""is doomed to failure and annihilation."" That kind of language, and a nuclear program, a wave of terrorist attacks, and the funding of anti-Israel militias, such as Hezbollah, add up to a pretty good case for Israelis to worry. Their concerns are echoed by many members of Congress, who also question the strength of the current negotiating approach. All want to see a deal, but only a good deal. All of them, lest we forget, are on the same side. Israel, along with France and many members of Congress, believes relief from sanctions should come only if Iran completely stops getting closer to a nuclear weapon. They worry that once world powers start rolling back sanctions, even slightly, the entire system will start unraveling. The Obama administration says the interim deal would ""put time on the clock."" But Obama too said he wants to make ""absolutely certain"" the Iranians are not ""busy advancing their program"" during talks. On the surface, Obama and Netanyahu are saying much the same thing. It's no simple task, but if a deal can be made that convinces everyone Iran is not within reach of a bomb, that would satisfy America, Israel, America's Arab friends and -- if Tehran is telling the truth -- it should meet Iran's goals. We don't know the exact terms under discussion in Geneva, Switzerland, but some reports give reasons for concern. One element under discussion, for example, would reportedly allow continuing construction of the Arak plutonium facility, with a promise from Iran to delay operating it for six months; far from ideal. It is also unclear what would happen with the Parchin site, where U.N. inspectors suspect Iran is working on ways to develop military components to weaponize its nuclear materials. Instead of disparaging the administration's negotiating skills, Netanyahu, as a friend of the U.S., should raise questions about these issues. And instead of disparaging the motives of Netanyahu and other critics, the Obama administration should respond to the specific claims. Ironically, Israel's strong objections strengthen the West's negotiating position. It is Iran that should explain why it will not allow inspectors into Parchin and why it needs to build a plutonium reactor. Countries make alliances because they are stronger together. Israel and the U.S. need to defend their alliance as they work together to stop Iran's nuclear program. Anything else will only strengthen their enemies.

"Nogales, Mexico (CNN) -- An American woman who was released from a Mexican jail cried out for joy when she crossed the border into Arizona. ""I'm home! Finally!"" Yanira Maldonado exclaimed. Mexican authorities detained her last week and put her behind bars over allegations she tried to smuggle 12 pounds of marijuana under a bus seat. She and her husband, Gary, were traveling from Mexico back to the United States when their bus was stopped and searched. Yanira Maldonado allegedly was sitting above the illegal stash. Maldonado's case sparked widespread media coverage and attention from U.S. lawmakers as family members pushed for her freedom. At a press conference early Friday in Nogales, Arizona, she thanked journalists, crediting them for her expedited release. The quality of her conditions in jail also improved as the media coverage increased, she told CNN affiliate KPNX-TV in Phoenix. A court official delivered the good news to her in jail Thursday. ""I screamed,"" Maldonado said. The Arizonan and mother of seven had consistently denied the charges against her, and the court determined that the prosecutors did not provide evidence. Her husband, Gary, tearfully embraced his wife after her release. Though the court released her back to the United States, legal proceedings are not completely over, Gary Maldonado said. But his wife's attorney in Mexico will take care of them in her absence. Opinion: Shakedown 'justice' in Mexico . Security footage revealed . Security camera footage revealed in court Thursday shows Maldonado and her husband boarding a bus in Mexico last week. They are carrying a purse, two blankets and two bottles of water. It's an everyday scene that plays out at bus stations around the world. But in this case, defense attorney Francisco Benitez argued that the images were a crucial piece of evidence. Why? Because nothing they're carrying, he said, could hold the amount of marijuana that Maldonado was accused of smuggling. Video footage suggests that someone else brought the marijuana aboard the bus, the lawyer said. Packages of the illegal substance allegedly recovered from under Maldonado's seat would not have fit in her purse, Benitez said. Big relief . Her attorneys also presented documents that show that she and her husband have no criminal records in the United States, Benitez said. Word that the surveillance video had been shown in court was a big relief, her husband said. ""That was the key that would help us prove her innocence,"" he said. ""It showed right on the film clear as day there's no way you could carry 12 pounds or 5.7 kilos with one arm,"" he said. The Mexican military officials who arrested Maldonado didn't make their case in court. The soldiers were scheduled to appear Wednesday but didn't show. Opinion: Americans still captive in global power games . Official: She was framed . Mexican authorities arrested Maldonado, a U.S. citizen, on May 22 as she and her husband were on their way back to Arizona. Gary Maldonado said he believes Mexican soldiers at the checkpoint wanted a bribe. A Mexican state official also told CNN it appears that Maldonado was framed. Yanira Maldonado does not necessarily think she was directly targeted. ""Someone smuggled those in there, and I probably sat in the wrong seat,"" she said. Nonetheless, she called on those who arrested her to ""repent,"" find ""respectable work"" and stop making people suffer. A regional office of Mexico's defense ministry said troops conducting a routine investigation stopped the bus Maldonado was riding in and found 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) of a substance that appeared to be marijuana under her seat. Troops turned the case over to the Mexican attorney general's office, the defense ministry said. Maldonado was held in a women's prison in Nogales, Mexico. Tearful pleas . In an interview Wednesday with CNN, Maldonado, a Mormon, said she turned to Scripture to survive the ordeal. ""Reading the Scriptures, reading the Book of Mormon, praying, fasting,"" Maldonado said. ""And all the support that I've been getting from my family, my husband, my children and everybody out there reaching out to help."" Family members' tearful pleas for her release drew widespread media attention and caught the attention of U.S. officials. U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Arizona, said he had spoken about the case with the U.S. ambassador to Mexico and Mexico's ambassador in Washington. State Department officials said consular officials met with Maldonado on Wednesday and May 24. U.S. diplomats did the same things they would when a U.S. citizen is arrested in a foreign country, but maybe to a higher degree because of the high-profile nature of the case, a senior administration official said.

"(CNN) -- Crews in North Dakota were testing the air Tuesday morning for any dangerous fumes a day after two trains wrecked, sparking a large fire. The results of the tests will help determine when it is safe for residents to resume their routine activities. One of the trains was carrying crude oil, which sent dangerous smoke into the air, officials said. The incident occurred one mile west of Casselton, a town of 2,300 residents about 25 miles west of Fargo. Authorities issued an evacuation order, which was not mandatory, but ""strongly, strongly recommended,"" Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney told CNN. He estimated that 65% of area residents heeded the call to leave their homes. There were no injuries in the wreck, and everyone is accounted for, Laney said. ""When you see the fireball and you see the damage and the aftermath, that's amazing that nobody was hurt,"" he said. ""There were people inside their homes that could feel the heat from the explosion in their homes."" Firefighters were forced to let the fire burn out. The extreme heat made it impossible for them to get close enough to the flames to battle the blaze.

"(CNN) -- Five men in El Salvador, including a police officer, were arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing last week of French filmmaker and photographer Christian Poveda, the country's attorney general's office said. Two of five men arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing of French filmmaker Christian Poveda. A sixth man who allegedly ordered the murder was already in prison, according to a statement from the agency. Poveda -- who recently finished a documentary about a violent street gang, part of the Mara 18 gang in El Salvador -- was found shot dead in the town of Tonacatepeque, about 10 miles northeast of the capital, San Salvador, on September 2, authorities said. Four of those arrested were members of the same Mara 18 gang that was the subject of Poveda's film, the attorney general's office said. National Civil Police Officer Juan Napoleon Espinoza also was arrested, it said. Poveda's documentary, ""La Vida Loca,"" which follows the lives of members of the Mara 18 gang, had been screened at a handful of film festivals and is slated for wider release later this month. His body was found in an area controlled by that same gang, local reports said.","5 men in El Salvador arrested in killing of French filmmaker Christian Poveda .

"(CNN) -- An alleged would-be smuggler was caught at a Thailand airport with dozens of rare wildlife -- including snakes, squirrels and tortoises -- stuffed into three suitcases, a wildlife monitoring organization says. The Indonesian man, whose name was not released, was stopped at Suvarnabhumi International Airport on Wednesday, according to a news release from Traffic, an organization that fights wildlife trafficking. The man had purchased the wildlife at Bangkok's Chatuchak Market and was attempting to smuggle them out of the country, the organization said. He was stopped after a regular luggage scan revealed the animals. According to the organization, the man carried 88 Indian star tortoises, 33 elongated tortoises, seven radiated tortoises, six mata mata turtles and four Southeast Asian narrow-headed softshell turtles. He also had three Aldabra tortoises, one pig-nosed turtle, and one ploughshare tortoise, which Traffic described as the world's rarest tortoise. But that wasn't all that the man stuffed into his luggage. Authorities also found 34 ball pythons, two boa constrictors, several milk snakes, corn snakes and king snakes and one hog-nosed snake, Traffic says. According to the organization, there also were 19 bearded dragon lizards, four spiny-tailed lizards, two Sudan plated lizards and six Argentine horned frogs. And, to top it off, there were 18 baboon spiders, 22 common squirrels and one African grey parrot inside the suitcases, Traffic says. ""It speaks well of a few alert enforcement authorities when such seizures happen, said the organization's regional director, William Schaedla. ""The airport authority is to be commended. However, one really has to question how Chatuchak Market, which is located just down the street from both wildlife protection and nature crime police offices, can continue these illegal mass sales."" Chatuchak Market is known for being a hub for the illegal trade of rare species, Traffic contends. ""Frankly, the situation is totally unacceptable in a country that claims to be effectively addressing illegal wildlife trade,"" Schaedla said. The man, who was taken into custody, faces wildlife smuggling charges, the organization said.","An Indonesian man is arrested at an airport in Thailand, a wildlife monitoring group says .

"(Mental Floss) -- Just hearing the word ""champagne"" conjures up images of sparkling wine, popping corks, and wild celebrations. But mentioning that other Champagne -- as in the northeastern region of France -- evokes a much more complex bouquet. Filled with wars, political clashes, and controversy, the bubbly region and its eponymous drink have produced a rich history worth toasting to. Divine Origins . Today, the region synonymous with sparkling wine is crowded with vineyards -- but that wasn't always the case. In fact, during the 17th century, France's Champagne district was known primarily for its high-quality wool. Then a Benedictine monk named Dom Perignon came along and changed everything. At the age of 29, Perignon was appointed business manager of Champagne's Abbey at Hautvillers. Realizing that the financial health and reputation of the monastery was tied to its vineyards, the Dom set to work resurrecting the beaten-down vines and reconstructing the cellar. In almost no time, the Hautvillers vineyard was up and running. Nowadays, many people credit Dom Perignon with inventing champagne by forcing bubbles into sweet wine. That's a myth, though. In Dom Perignon's day, bubbles were considered a serious wine flaw, and the good monk actually went to considerable lengths to eliminate them during his 47 years as cellar-master. And while he never succeeded on that front, he did succeed in making bubbly wine a whole lot better. For starters, he was the first winemaker in Champagne to use corks, which kept the carbon dioxide from escaping, thus creating the bubbles. He also used a process of gently pressing his grapes, so that it eliminated the dark color that came from the skins -- producing a clearer, less murky wine. He even blended his grapes to make a light white wine, which suited the effervescence far better than the heavy red. Legend has it that upon first tasting his vastly improved beverage, the Dom exclaimed, ""Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!"" Loyal Royals . Dom Perignon brought such nobility and renown to Champagne's sparkling wines that they soon became the preferred libation of royalty -- namely, France's Sun King, Louis XIV. For much of his life, Louis XIV drank champagne almost exclusively -- a habit that made one province very wealthy and another very jealous. Burgundy, to the south, felt the Sun King was giving their fine red wines the shaft. They soon engaged Champagne in a war of words carried out via inflammatory pamphlets and public seminars deriding their wine. The feud was no small affair. In fact, it lasted for more than 130 years, and many times, the two regions seemed to teeter on the brink of a civil war. Of course, the Champenois learned to embrace the long-detested bubbles along the way, and it didn't hurt that doctors began claiming the bubbles cured malaria (a proclamation that caught the attention of everyone with a moat). Louis the Great was hardly the last emperor to take a liking to the region, however. At age 9, Napoleon Bonaparte was sent to study at the Brienne military academy in Champagne, where he developed an early interest in the local brew. In fact, before each of his military campaigns, the self-appointed emperor made a point of passing through Champagne to obtain a supply of bubbly from his good friend Jean-Rémy Moët. After all, Napoleon once claimed of champagne, ""In victory you deserve it, in defeat you need it."" One can only assume that post-Waterloo was a time of need. Sadly, in the ensuing years, Champagne's ties to royalty did more harm than good. In 1870, Bonaparte's nephew, Napoleon III, declared war on Prussia, and by the time Prussian troops overran Alsace and Lorraine, the only thing standing between them and Paris was a patch of land called Champagne. The Franco-Prussian War was one of the bloodiest of the 19th century, and many of the deaths, according to one observer, occurred in fields ""strewn with fragments of glass from champagne bottles."" Within a short time, Prussia had won the war, and France was left nearly bankrupt. It was about that time that Louise Pommery decided to introduce a radical new idea to the world: dry champagne. Brut, as it became known, was more expensive and more difficult to make because it required more fully ripened grapes. But the extra effort paid dividends. The world loved brut, and within three years, France's economy was back on track. Along with the cabaret, the cinema, and the cancan, champagne played a large role in the Belle Époque -- the nation's greatest era of peace and prosperity. It's no wonder, then, that the sparkling beverage quickly became a fixed part of France's national character. Trick or Treaty? In order to cement the Champenois' hard-earned contributions to world culture, France forced some specific language into the 1891 Treaty of Madrid. It stated that sparkling wine could only be named champagne if it was produced in Champagne and made with grapes originating there. As happy as this made the Champenois, it also created a confusing problem. Champagne itself didn't have defined borders; thus, when the French government formally declared in 1908 that only those vineyards in the Marne and Aisne districts had the right to call themselves ""Champagne,"" well, it caused quite a ruckus in the neighboring Aube region. (This would be roughly the same thing as Major League Baseball suddenly declaring the Toronto Blue Jays a minor league franchise because it isn't really located in the United States even though they've won the World Series.) What happened next was predictable: protests, riots and 6 million bottles of good champagne destroyed. Of course, the incident was nothing compared to the devastation, confusion, and sheer terror Champagne experienced during World War I. The German toll on the area was horrific. In fact, the destruction of buildings like the Rheims Cathedral (a building that had seen the coronation of many a French monarch, celebrated with many bottles of  -- what else? -- champagne) was so dramatic that among the many stipulations of the post-war Treaty of Versailles was a further, more forceful clarification of the 1891 proclamation that only the Champenois could legally produce a sparkling wine called champagne. That seemingly minor concession in the Treaty of Versailles has become the linchpin of the business in France. The fact that no other nation (nor any other region of France, for that matter) can legally produce champagne gives long-established houses like Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Taittinger, and Krug a huge advantage when it comes to sales. Sure, other places produce sparkling wine, but in Italy it's called spumante, in Spain it's called cava, and in Alsace, crémant. Interestingly, American sparkling wine producers have been able to get away with printing the word ""champagne"" on their labels, but only because they've sneakily skirted the system. Even though President Woodrow Wilson signed the Treaty of Versailles, the U.S. Senate never ratified it; therefore, American winemakers are technically not subject to the strict standards of the treaty. (Which is why Korbel sells a bottle of ""California Champagne"" for less than $15.) Champenois of the World . Today, the champagne business in Champagne is as strong as ever. In fact, things are going so well that some insiders worry that the only place for the region's industry to go is down. They warn that small producers are introducing new brands too quickly, and that they might be at risk of overcrowding the market. Of course, the biggest problem seems to be growth. Because Champagne has a finite geographical size, it can only hold so many vineyards, and right now, the region is at its capacity. Not to worry. Even though the Champenois make a wine for the best of times, they've had more than their share of the worst of times. And somehow, that special homemade bubbly always seems to carry them through.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan militias surrendered their Tripoli bases to the military on Thursday, nearly a week after growing public anger over the presence of armed groups in the capital sparked deadly clashes. In a series of ceremonies across the coastal city, militias from Tripoli as well as smaller towns such as Zintan handed over their bases to the authorities, including the Ministry of Defence and Libyan air force. These included the Mitiga airbase, as well as the Islamic Call Center. Public anger has been growing over the armed groups' refusal to disarm in the two years since they toppled the North African country's longtime leader, Moammar Gadhafi. Last Friday, Tripoli residents marched on the headquarters of militias from the city of Misrata. The militia opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, unleashing heavy clashes that left 47 people dead and more than 500 injured in the worst violence in the city in two years. Misrata militias withdrew from Tripoli earlier this week, but it was not immediately clear where the militias that handed over their bases on Thursday would go. They include a number of powerful and heavily armed groups. Other groups remain in Tripoli. Government officials attending the ceremonies nonetheless praised the handover as a major step toward building the Libyan state and its security forces. During a press conference at one of the ceremonies, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan lashed out at a reporter who asked whether the government had guarantees the handovers were real, and not ceremonial. ""We are not joking here, we are not in a theater to be acting"" Zeidan said. ""We are serious about this. ... We have a duty to fulfill and we will fulfill it God willing. The weapons that were in the hands of these groups was the security threat and now this threat has disappeared"". While many Libyans welcomed the move toward disarming militias, the real impact on the ground has yet to be seen. In a country still awash with weapons, Libya's fledgling state security forces remain outgunned by former rebel fighters. Zeidan's government is struggling to assert its authority. Zeidan was himself briefly abducted by militiamen last month.","Last week, the worst violence in the capital in two years left 47 dead .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Friends and family of actress Brittany Murphy held a private funeral Thursday for the 32-year-old who died unexpectedly of what authorities said were natural causes. The service at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn Cemetery featured Christian and Jewish clergy. It included the hymn ""Amazing Grace"" and a reading from ""The Little Prince,"" one of her favorite books. ""Today a wife, a daughter, a niece, a cousin, a family member and dear friend to thousands was laid to rest,"" the family said in a statement. ""Brittany was an incredibly loving and passionate person ... there are no words that can truly express the devastation felt by Brittany's husband, mother, and everyone who attended the intimate service."" Murphy was pronounced dead Sunday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Authorities have said she appeared to have died of natural causes. No sign of foul play or trauma was found. The often bubbly, free-spirited actress appeared in films such as ""Clueless,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""Don't Say a Word"" and ""Girl, Interrupted."" She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie ""Happy Feet"" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular voice role on the animated TV series ""King of the Hill."" Murphy was best-known for her work in a string of comedies earlier this decade, including playing lead roles in ""Uptown Girls"" alongside fellow Georgia native Dakota Fanning, and ""Little Black Book"" with Holly Hunter and Kathy Bates. She is survived by her husband, British screenwriter Simon Monjack, who also spoke at the service. The family may have a larger public memorial early next year, but nothing is confirmed yet, spokesman Alex Ben Block said.","Friends, family of actress Brittany Murphy hold a private service on Christmas Eve .

"(CNN) -- There was a time when the Republican Party was strictly for White Anglo Saxon Protestants. It was an alliance between Country Club Episcopalians and twice born followers of the Old Time Gospel, all firmly opposed to mass Catholic immigration from Europe. The nativism of the GOP drove Catholics into the welcoming arms of Al Smith, Jack Kennedy, Tip O'Neill and the Democratic Party. But this year's GOP front-runners are a Mormon and two Catholics -- Rick Santorum (a cradle of Italian descent) and Newt Gingrich (a convert). Roughly one-quarter of Republican primary voters are Catholic.  Notable Catholic GOP leaders include John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Christine O'Donnell, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush. Six out of nine justices of the Supreme Court are Catholics, and five of them are Republicans. The GOP is undergoing a quiet process of Catholicization. It's one of the reasons why this year's race has focused so much on social issues -- and sex. Republican outreach to Catholics began in the early 1970s, when Richard Nixon tried to entice blue-collar ""white ethnics"" to the GOP by taking a tough stand on abortion. Nixon told members of his staff he was tempted to convert to Catholicism himself, but was worried it would be seen as cheap politics: ""They would say there goes Tricky Dick Nixon trying to win the Catholic vote. ..."" Nixon genuinely admired the Catholic intellectual tradition and its ability to provide reasonable arguments to defend conservative values at a time when they were undergoing widespread reappraisal. That certainly made the Church an invaluable partner during the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s. When the Moral Majority was established in 1979 to oppose things like abortion and homosexual rights, its evangelical founders did their best to include Catholics. Despite the organization's reputation for being the political voice box of televangelists and peddlers of the apocalypse, by the mid '80s it drew a third of its funding from Catholic donors. Leaders like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson consciously used the Moral Majority (and, later, the Christian Coalition) as an exercise in ecumenical coalition building. Falwell and Robertson were fans of Pope John Paul II and his resilient anti-communism. But they also recognized, like Nixon, that the Catholic Church had a vast intellectual heritage that could be drawn upon when fighting the liberals. For example, when debating abortion, evangelicals had hitherto tended to rely on Scripture to make their case. Catholics, on the other hand, had been integrating the concept of ""human rights"" into their theology since the 1890s. Under Catholic influence, the pro-life movement evolved from a zealous, theology-heavy rationale to one more couched in the language of human dignity and personhood. By 2000, Catholic social teaching was a core component of the Republican Party's ""compassionate conservatism"" agenda. Karl Rove targeted religious Catholics on behalf of George W. Bush, while the president made a big play of his social traditionalism. In the 2004 election, Bush beat John Kerry among Catholics, despite the fact that Kerry described himself as a faithful Catholic who never went anywhere without his rosary beads. Crucially, Bush's victory among Catholics was made possible by his margin of support among those who attend Mass regularly. Catholics who said they rarely went to church plumped for Kerry. The election heralded a new split within the politics of the communion, between religious and ethnic Catholics. Indeed, it could be argued that just as Republican Protestants have become a little more Catholic in their outlook, so conservative Catholics have become a little more Protestant in theirs. Take Rick Santorum. Santorum is part of the John Paul II generation of Catholics who reject most of the liberalism that swept the church in the 1960s. He is a member of a suburban church in Great Falls, Virginia, that (unusually, nowadays) offers a Latin Mass each Sunday with a Georgian chant sung by a professional choir. The church has a ""garden for the unborn"" and has boasted as worshipers the director of the FBI, the head of the National Rifle Association and Justice Antonin Scalia. Santorum is also an outspoken admirer of Saint Josemaria Escriva, the founder of the conservative lay organization Opus Dei. Opus Dei encourages among its members a work ethic and an effort to ""live like a saint"" that is strikingly similar to the values and mores of New England's Puritan settlers. Santorum's political theology has thus moved him so sharply to the right that it's sometimes difficult to culturally identify him as a Catholic. In a March 18 survey, less than half of GOP Catholics actually knew the candidate was himself a Catholic. That might be one of the reasons why Santorum consistently loses to Romney among Catholics in primaries, even during his landmark victories in the Deep South. In contrast, he does very well among evangelicals. We might speculate that what is emerging is an alliance between ultra-conservative Catholics and tea party evangelicals. Its politics might be antediluvian, but it's an ecumenical breakthrough and a cultural revolution at the grass-roots level. The coalition's mix of Catholic moral teaching and evangelical fervor has oriented the 2012 GOP race toward fierce social conservatism. During the debate over Obama's contraception mandate, it was the Catholic conservative leadership who provided the moral objection, but the evangelicals who produced most of the popular opposition to it. And it is evangelical support that has elevated Santorum to his current status in the race. With its ability to shift the agenda and win primaries, the emerging Catholic/evangelical political theology is the most striking conservative innovation of this turbulent campaign season. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley: The Republican party was once dominated by Protestants .
He says Catholics and Catholic theology now play a key role in the GOP .

"(EW.com) -- Spiraling into oblivion really helps you see things from a different perspective. At Sunday night's premiere of ""Gravity,"" Sandra Bullock said she felt she didn't deserve the Oscar when she won it for ""The Blind Side"" three years ago — and now her performance as an astronaut stranded in orbit when space debris demolishes her shuttle could win her another one. The survival drama, out Oct. 4, got an intense reaction as the Toronto International Film Festival's opening weekend drew to a close, with many marveling at both the technical and emotional achievements of director Alfonso Cuarón (""Children of Men,"" ""Harry Potter"" and the ""Prisoner of Azkaban."") Expect ""Gravity"" to be a major player at the Academy Awards this year in all the top categories. It should easily win in the visual effects category, and will be a heavy-duty competitor in the others. Bullock is also a near certain Best Actress nominee, although she said her 2010 win still hasn't sunk in. ""I think most people have that out-of-body experience when they win the Oscar. I had a little newborn at home, so my body was already out of itself,"" Bullock said in response to a question about awards season during the post-screening Q&A with festival-goers. ""I still haven't gotten around to having my moment with it yet. Maybe one day it will come."" She'll face formidable opponents in the race. Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine, Kate Winslet in ""Labor Day,"" and Emma Thompson from ""Saving Mr. Banks"" are among the potential nominees generating voter buzz. Bullock said awards talk is just part of the fun of festivals, and tried to put the coveted prize in a more grounded context. ""What it does do is make you realize how hard you have to work to earn it,"" she said. ""I didn't feel worthy of it when I got it. So I thought, okay, I'm going to spend the rest of my life hopefully earning it --- but having a really good time in the process, as well."" Except the making ""Gravity"" was ... anything but fun. Since the film is set in orbit, she was often strung up on wires, or locked in a device that spun her wildly in different directions while multiple cameras shot close ups of her face. That footage was later woven into photo-real animation of her and George Clooney in jeopardy, floating far above the Earth. ""It was painful, I remember. Not for me -- but for you,"" Cuarón said. Bullock didn't hesitate to agree. ""Jess,"" she said, imitating his accent as she explained to the crowd: ""That's 'yes.'"" Whenever she got frustrated, she would mock his Spanish accent, Cuarón said. ""It was frustrating, it was painful, and it was isolating. But how lucky am I that I got to have all those frustrations, you know, built in?"" Bullock told the crowd. ""That's something people who are in the position these characters are in [would be] experiencing a thousand-fold."" That didn't mean she let Cuarón or David Heyman (producer of the ""Harry Potter"" films) escape a little of the agony. ""After a while you just used it. And you wanted to kill David and Alfonso regularly, and I used that as well,"" she joked. ""Just all your hate, and anger, and rage -- you just give forth in your work, and hope it translates on the screen."" Clooney didn't attend the screening (he's on the other side of Canada shooting director Brad Bird's ""Tomorrowland"" in Vancouver.) But most of the movie is focused on Bullock's character anyway, with Clooney in a supporting turn as the captain of the space shuttle. Turning serious, Bullock said there was one part of the role that was particularly special to her. ""It was an amazing experience to do as an actor, but I think more importantly as a woman,"" she said, thanking Cuaron, who wrote the script with his son, Jonás .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy tried to get permission to board a North Korean merchant vessel that it suspected was carrying illicit weapon technology in the South China Sea, the Pentagon confirmed Monday. It was denied permission, but the United States kept an eye on the vessel, which later turned around and returned to North Korea, the Pentagon said. The incident occurred late last month, it said. The MV Light is registered and flagged in Belize but was believed to be manned by a North Korean crew, according to Col. David Lapan, a Pentagon spokesman. According to Lapan, on May 26, the merchant vessel was hailed by the USS McCampbell, which requested permission to board the ship and inspect its cargo. The ship's master denied the request, telling the Navy ship that it was a North Korean ship, according to the Pentagon. Lapan said the vessel was in violation of international law in refusing the boarding. It was believed the ship might have been heading to Myanmar, he said. Several U.N. resolutions permit the boarding of ships suspected of carrying banned weapons cargo such as ballistic missile parts or technology. The McCampbell maintained surveillance of the vessel for several days. On May 29 the vessel turned around and headed back to a North Korean port, with the United States maintaining surveillance all the way, Lapan said. He would not specify how that surveillance was maintained, but the Navy is known to use surveillance aircraft at sea, and U.S. intelligence satellites regularly monitor North Korean ports.","Permission to board the ship was denied, the Pentagon says .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to plastic pollution, our society has asked everyone -- scientists, environmentalists, and the government -- to clean up the mess we've made.   Through recycling initiatives, plastic-bag bans and fees, and alternatives to plastics altogether, we still haven't come close to solving the problem ... perhaps until now. The solution might have been discovered with a fungus in a laboratory Petri dish. Pria Anand was a student in Yale University's class of 2010 whose passion for the environment made her want to make a difference.  Anand wanted to find out if there was something in nature that could decompose plastic.  She began experimenting with dozens of species of fungi from the Amazon, but she graduated before she could finish her work. Jonathan Russell took over for Anand but soon he was beginning to think maybe it just wasn't possible.  One day, as he casually walked into the lab he says his eyes locked on the Petri dish containing his experiment:  the plastic was gone.  He'd found what they'd been looking for. The Yale students had discovered that Pestalotiopsis microspora fungus can break down plastic.  It's a species of fungi that can be found in many regions of the world and can decompose polyurethane, a common plastic that is used to make things like insulation, synthetic fibers, plastic for electronics and sealants. The fungus was 10 days old when the experiment started and in only a matter of days, he says, it had significantly decomposed about a quart size amount of the plastic. The study found that several species of fungi were able to at least partially decompose polyurethane, but this type was the only fungus able to do it in water without oxygen, one of the most challenging environmental conditions. Scott Strobel, the Yale biochemistry professor who instructed Anand and Russell during these experiments, says because of this discovery, the future looks promising for all types of plastic pollution.  He says fungi's potential to break down man-made materials could be endless, along with its possibilities in medicine and other fields of science. However, Russell warns that this is not the ultimate solution to solving plastic pollution.   ""I don't want it to be broadcast as the cure-all to pollution, but it's a modest step towards a very important goal,"" he says. The full study will be published in the journal of Applied and Environmental Microbiology's September issue. Dr. Ming Tien, a biochemist at Penn State University, says he experimented in the past with using fungi for decomposition.   He points out ""the question of whether these microbes can be used in the future is an engineering challenge.  It's a big leap to go from the test tube to the field."" Back in Strobel's classroom, one of his students is working to find an organism that biodegrades styrofoam. Strobel says the current crop of students is interested in seeking out more solutions like these and that they'll continue to make discoveries like Russell. Today, Russell is working on his Ph.D. in molecular biology at Harvard.  He's encouraged that other students are taking an interest in environmental solutions. ""Growing up in a world where pollution is going to be a big issue in the future, coming up with creative ways to tackle it, gets me excited,"" Russell says. ""I only hope that more people will take this on and get interested in it in the future.""","Two Yale students find that a species of fungi can decompose polyurethane .

"(CNN) -- Revenge proved sweet for Roger Federer and now he has World No.2 Novak Djokovic in his sights at the Paris Masters. Federer lost in Sunday's final of his hometown tournament in Basel to Juan Martin Del Potro but fast forward five days and the Swiss maestro turned the tables in another tight three set encounter in the French capital. The 6-3 4-6 6-3 victory earned him a semifinal clash with Djokovic, who earlier dispatched Federer's compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka in straight sets. ""That's definitely good for my confidence, because those are the kind of wins I need right now,"" Federer told the ATP Tour website. ""It was clearly a huge victory, giving myself a chance to be in the semis here, and playing Novak is clearly very exciting, . ""I think I did well today to start stronger this time around in the third set. It was something I couldn't quite do in Basel,"" added the 32-year-old. Federer, whose form has fallen away during the latter part of 2013, has renewed confidence after booking his passage to next week's ATP Tour Finals in London for a 12th straight time. ""I prefer playing him now than four months ago. I'm more confident now and I believe again in my chances. But if I had played a few weeks ago or a few months ago, I might have thought that I was not sure,"" he revealed. Djokovic, in fine form on the indoor circuit, is fully aware of the danger that Federer still poses. ""Roger is probably experiencing the worst season that he had in last 10 years, but he's still a player to beat in every tournament, because he's Roger Federer, because he has won 17 Grand Slams, and we all know how successful a career he has,"" he said after his easy win over Wawrinka. The pair have not faced each other since Djokovic beat Federer in the title match of last year's ATP World Tour Finals in London. World No.1 Rafael Nadal joined his arch rivals in the last four with victory in the first match of the evening session Friday against home favorite Richard Gasquet. Nadal won 6-4 6-1 with a dominant display and will face Spanish compatrot David Ferrer. He is chasing a record sixth Masters title in one season.

"(CNN) -- Progress against global diseases is typically slow, incremental and hard-won. But there are moments -- such as Wednesday's release of the World Health Organization's World Malaria Report -- when the cumulative effort of dozens of nations, millions of people and billions of dollars adds up to a true breakthrough. With the new report, we have turned a corner in the malaria fight. We have reduced the rate of deaths from malaria among children under 5 by 51% from 2000 to 2012 -- halfway to our goal of ending death by mosquito bite. For the first time, the number of children dying from this preventable and treatable disease fell below half a million. Progress against malaria is responsible for fully 20% of the reduction in child mortality since 2000. Malaria control has saved 3.3 million lives since 2000 -- 3 million of them children under 5. This progress stands out as one of the great success stories in global health, even in human history. It's especially impressive when you consider that malaria has been with us since the dawn of man and, by some accounts, has killed more people than any other cause in human history: more than war, famine or any other disease. Despite today's progress, malaria remains one of the biggest impediments to saving lives, improving health and unlocking human potential in much of the developing world. It threatens 3.4 billion people -- roughly half the globe -- and is a leading cause of school and work absenteeism in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria literally sucks the lifeblood (energy, livelihood and productivity) from the African continent. I often compare the malaria fight to the moonshot. Both are human milestones, measures of our progress as a species and a society. And both were made possible by U.S. vision and leadership. The seeds of today's progress were sown under President George W. Bush with the launch of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2002 and the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative in 2005. These efforts have accelerated under President Barack Obama, who has expanded the initiative and recently committed to provide $1 to the Global Fund for every $2 contributed by the rest of the world, up to $5 billion by 2016. These investments are paying off, not only in children's lives saved but also in promoting stable, productive nations by keeping children in school, workers at their jobs and families financially secure. As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently said, ""fighting malaria is not only the right thing to do, it's also the smart thing."" Much of the progress to date comes from expanded access to simple tools such as insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and we must maintain high levels of coverage. But how do we end the other 50% of child deaths? How do we ensure that no child dies from a mosquito bite and that we ultimately eradicate this disease from the planet? The answer comes down to three cheap, revolutionary tools. The first is a rapid diagnostic test, or RDT. Until a few years ago, there was no practical way to get a timely, accurate diagnosis for malaria. If someone thought they might have malaria, they had to travel to a distant clinic that had an expensive microscope -- and a trained lab technician who would examine a drop of blood under a microscope -- and hope the doctor read it right. Enter the RDT. This simple, 50-cent device tells you in a matter of minutes with 99% accuracy if you have the malaria parasite in your body. There are now 200 million of these tests deployed in Africa each year, and they're transforming the fight against malaria -- driving timely treatment and ensuring people who have other illnesses -- such as pneumonia or respiratory infection -- get the lifesaving care they need. The second tool is malaria treatment: artemisinin-based combination therapies, or ACTs. It costs less than $1 to deliver a full course of lifesaving treatment to a child in Africa. And the simple fact is: If a child with malaria gets this $1 worth of medicine in time, he or she will not die. At Malaria No More, we're helping to close the testing and treatment gaps in Africa through our new Power of One campaign, where every dollar provides a lifesaving test and treatment. The third tool may surprise you: a mobile phone. There's a mobile revolution under way in Africa. By 2015, there'll be more than 1 billion mobile phones on the continent. They're not only transforming communication and commerce but also how we fight communicable disease. Mobile is helping us solve a whole slew of problems in the malaria fight: address health facilities that have a shortage of lifesaving treatments by providing timely updates on stock levels, fight counterfeit drugs by enabling consumers to text a code to confirm a malaria treatment is authentic, expand the reach of health education to ensure people sleep under their mosquito nets and provide the real-time data on malaria cases that is the prerequisite for strategies to eliminate the disease. These tools are helping us work faster, smarter and more cost effectively. With their help -- and continued investment -- we can write malaria into the history books. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Martin Edlund.","Martin Edlund: New report finds impressive progress against malaria .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich arrived at a Colorado federal prison Thursday to begin serving a 14-year sentence on a corruption conviction, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons said. ""This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do,"" he told a crowd of sign-wielding supporters outside his Chicago home Wednesday before reporting to prison. ""But this is the law and we follow the law."" He was convicted of corruption in June 2011 after a jury returned 17 guilty verdicts against him. Among other allegations, he was accused of trying to profit as he considered whom to appoint to take Barack Obama's open Senate seat. Blagojevich called his impending prison stint a ""dark and hard journey,"" and said he should have been more humble. ""We are so grateful and will never ever forget your kindness to us,"" he told the crowd, which occasionally chanted slogans such as ""Free our governor."" His wife, Patti, remained cinched under his arm, squeezing back tears as the former governor spoke. ""This, as bad as it is, is part of a long and hard journey that will only get worse before it gets better,"" Blagojevich said, telling his wife that he loved her. He'll serve his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution Englewood, southwest of Denver. ""Governor Blagojevich has always stood up and stood tall. He hasn't hid. And he has truly enjoyed being out in public. He never considered 'sneaking' out of Chicago and miss an opportunity to say goodbye,"" his spokesman Glenn Selig said earlier. ""It's difficult to put into words the challenges he and his family now face. But he draws strength from the incredible support he continues to receive from the people of Illinois and beyond."" Blagojevich's past statements have been noteworthy for their bluster. In a defiant news conference in April 2010, he called his accusers ""liars"" and ""cowards,"" and directly challenged a prosecutor. Blagojevich also accused U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald of hiding taped evidence that would prove his innocence during that news conference. ""I challenge Mr. Fitzgerald ... Why don't you show up in court tomorrow and explain to everybody, explain to the whole world why you don't want the tapes that you made played in court?"" Blagojevich said to reporters at the time. ""I'll be in court tomorrow. I hope you're man enough to show up,"" he added, referring to Fitzgerald. Prosecutors said court-authorized wiretaps caught Blagojevich offering Obama's Senate seat in exchange for personal gain, including a job with a nonprofit or union organization, corporate board posts for his wife, campaign contributions or a post in Obama's administration. He expressed frustration, according to prosecutors, that Obama transition officials were ""not willing to give me anything except appreciation."" ""I've got this thing and it's (expletive) golden, and, uh, uh, I'm just not giving it up for (expletive) nothing. I'm not gonna do it,"" prosecutors quoted Blagojevich as saying. Blagojevich also considered appointing himself to the post, mulling whether he might be better off being indicted as a senator rather than governor, and saying contacts he would make in the federal job would benefit him later, according to prosecutors. Aside from the charges of trying to sell the Senate seat, prosecutors also accused Blagojevich of using his position to obtain financial benefits for himself, his family and his campaign in exchange for jobs, contracts and appointments to state boards to supporters. They accused Blagojevich of accelerating the scheme in 2008 to accumulate funds before a new state ethics law would have limited his ability to raise money from people and companies that were doing business with the state. Despite months of professing his innocence in impromptu news conferences, on Twitter and even on Donald Trump's show ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" the ousted Illinois governor did not take the stand in his own defense during his trial.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy has had a 2013 to forget but chose a lucrative exhibition match with World No.1 Tiger Woods in China to give promise of a return to his stellar best at season's end. The pair fought it out Monday in the ""Match at Mission Hills"" on Hainan Island and it was Northern Ireland's McIlroy who edged it by one shot after 18 holes. The 24-year-old carded a six-under 67 against 68 for Woods - repeating his win of 2012 in the corresponding event. ""I would like to play all my tournaments in China where I can beat Tiger,"" McIlroy joked after his narrow win. ""It's been great to come back to this wonderful golf course where I still have such great memories from playing here two years ago in the World Cup,"" he told AFP. McIllroy won the World Cup in 2011 with Graeme McDowell at the same venue and will be hoping his improved form can be carried over to next week's WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai. He needs a solid finish to get into the top 60 and qualify for the European Tour's Race to Dubai, an event McIlroy won last year to round off a superlative season. He is currently languishing in 62nd place in the rankings, a far cry from his triumphs of 2012 as he rose to No.1. ""I still have four tournaments left to the end of the season and still would love to finish 2013 strongly and get some momentum into next season,"" he said. ""I'm hitting the ball well and from tee-to-green the game is very solid and if I can get the putter working, I maybe can contend and get a win or two."" By contrast, Woods has won five PGA Tour events this year, but has missed out on adding to his major tally of 14. He battled a virus and a long trip from the United States to push Mcllroy close, the issue decided when he bogeyed the 17th to fall a shot behind. Both men birdied the last, but it was McIlroy who took the honors, building on his strong second place finish in the Korea Open eight days ago. Organizers have not revealed the fees both men received, but reports said they had shared $3 million to play in the exhibition. Woods is skipping the HSBC-Champions to play in a tournament in Turkey. In other golf action Monday, Ryan Moore beat Gary Woodland in a playoff to win the CIMB Classic in Malaysia, an event sanctioned by the PGA Tour. The American pair were tied on 14-under par after four rounds at the Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club, but had to come back the next day after the light ran out. Moore birdied the first extra hole to claim the $1.26 million top prize and a two-year PGA Tour exemption. The tournament, which was blighted by storms and rain delays, attracted a strong field, which included major winners Phil Mickelson, Keegan Bradley and Ernie Els as the star attractions, but they did not feature in the battle for the top prize.","Rory McIlroy beats Tiger Woods in exhibition at Mission Hills .

"(CNN) -- Democrats have struck back at Republican senators' filibusters of President Barack Obama's three current nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit. The struggle signals an escalation of the confirmation battles in which the courts and litigants are largely innocent victims. Congress has authorized a set number of judgeships for each of the 13 courts of appeals, including 11 for the D.C. Circuit. Filling vacancies in those judgeships has become more contentious over the last 20 years. The Senate approved 88% of President Ronald Reagan's nominees, but that figure has been in the low 70s since the Clinton administration. And it takes longer. Reagan's appellate judges got confirmed on average in 60 days. For President Bill Clinton, the average was 238 days, a number that shot up to 355 for President George W. Bush and is currently 257 for Obama's appointees. Eight of the 11 judgeships on the D.C. circuit are filled. Four of the eight were appointed by Republican presidents, four by Democratic presidents, including one by Obama (confirmed by a lopsided 97-0). In addition, six judges now in a form of semiretirement hear some cases. Of the six, five were appointed by Republican presidents. Those facts are important not because judges always decide cases the way their appointing president's party might prefer. They don't; most cases in the courts of appeals don't present issues with much of a policy implication at all. But numerous empirical studies of judges' decisions in large numbers of cases with policy implications have demonstrated that, on some issues more than others, the party of the appointing president is an indicator, albeit a weak one, of how judges will decide cases -- for or against environmental claims, for example, or labor union claims -- especially in cases in which existing law is unclear. The D.C. Circuit gets a high proportion of cases with policy implications because it receives a comparatively high number of cases involving decisions made by administrative agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Labor Relations Board. That fact is basic to the battle over Obama's nominees, although it's hard to tell from the back and forth. Republicans say there is no need to fill the vacancies because the D.C. Circuit has a lower caseload than the other appellate courts. The leader of the resistance, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, told a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing that the country needs ""smart ways to reallocate our judicial resources"" -- and he's right on that point, given that Congress has created no new appellate judgeships for 23 years and seems in no mood to start doing so. So Grassley has introduced legislation to transfer two of the vacant judgeships to other courts of appeals, and abolish the third in order to save money. Democrats have said that Obama is duty-bound to nominate judges for the vacancies because the Constitution says ""he shall nominate ... Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States"" (which includes lower court judges). But if a court clearly does not need all its vacancies filled, few would fault a president for not submitting nominations. That the D.C. Circuit does not need more judges, though, is hardly clear. Both sides sling around cherry-picked statistics, with Republicans emphasizing raw case numbers and Democrats stressing the court's comparatively large number of complex agency cases. As explained, though, by a representative of the federal court's governing body, there is currently no reliable statistical method to compare the workloads of the courts of appeals. Republicans have also said that the current four-four balance of Republican and Democratic appointees on the court shouldn't be upset. In fact, readjusting the party-of-appointing president balance has been a goal of Democratic and Republican presidents. That helps explain why the Senate refused to confirm two of Clinton's five nominees to the D.C. Circuit and two of Bush's six nominees. It's hard to say how this battle will end. The obvious solution is to confirm the three nominees and then urge the judiciary itself to come up with a reliable way to compare the workload of the courts of appeals, as it has for district courts. If it shows that the D.C. Circuit can do its work with eight judgeships, Congress can shift the next three vacancies as they occur (three of the active judges are eligible to retire and either have reached 70 years of age or soon will). Obvious, though, doesn't mean likely. Instead, Democrats moved Thursday to take away the Republicans' ability to use filibusters to block lower court nominations. The D.C. three will probably get confirmed -- but at a cost. Some, even while acknowledging filibuster abuse by both sides, think abolishing filibusters will harm the Senate in the long run, to say nothing of the strain it will put on already frayed relations. The elimination of the filibuster impedes the ability of Senate Republicans to block more Obama appellate nominees. The balance among active judges on those courts when Obama took office was 60-40 Republican-to-Democratic appointees. It's now at 50-50, and Republicans were likely trying to keep it there. One unlikely result from this battle is any expansion of Grassley's efforts to ""reallocate"" appellate judgeships. Only one appellate court has lost a judgeship to another circuit -- the 2007 transfer of a D.C. Circuit vacancy to the Ninth Circuit, effective January 20, 2009. The D.C. Circuit would lose more under his bill, and it's no coincidence that it's the only court without a (patronage-protecting) Senate delegation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Russell Wheeler.","Senate Dems use ""nuclear option"" to strip GOP of ability to filibuster court nominations .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British TV channel was scheduled to air a controversial documentary Wednesday night showing a terminally ill man committing assisted suicide. Craig Ewert dictates a letter to his children before leaving for his assisted suicide in Switzerland. The film follows retired university professor Craig Ewert during the last four days of his life in 2006, when he visited a Swiss clinic with his wife, Mary, in order to die. The 59-year-old suffered from motor neurone disease (MND), which deprived him of the use of his arms and legs and caused him to be on a ventilator, Mary Ewert told The Independent. MND destroys the body's motor nerves, eventually resulting in paralysis. Most sufferers die within five years of diagnosis although scientist Stephen Hawking has survived with the disease for more than 40 years. ""Right to Die: The Suicide Tourist"" shows Ewert lying in a rented Zurich apartment, where an employee of the clinic prepares a lethal dose of drugs for Ewert to drink. As the camera rolls, and with his wife by his side, Craig Ewert then closes his eyes and dies. Mary Ewert said her husband wanted his death to be filmed in order to show that a terminal illness does not have to result in a painful death. ""For Craig, my husband, allowing the cameras to film his last moments in Zurich was about facing the end of life honestly,"" she told The Independent.  Watch more about the case » . ""He was keen to have it shown because when death is hidden and private, people don't face their fears about it. They don't acknowledge that it is going to happen, they don't reflect on it, they don't want to face it. That's the taboo."" What's your view? Click here to comment . Ewert was an American who lived in North Yorkshire, England with his wife. In a clip on the Web site of British satellite channel Sky Real Lives, which planned to air the documentary, he dictates an e-mail to his son and daughter in America. ""I truly expect that death is the end, that there is no everlasting soul, no afterlife,"" Ewert says. ""This is a journey that we all must make at some time. I would hope that this is not a cause of major distress to those who love me and I expect that my dear sweet wife will have the greatest loss, as we have been together for 37 years in the deepest intimacy."" Read explainer about assisted suicide . The scheduled airing of the documentary provoked controversy in Britain. It was featured on the front pages of several newspapers, with the Daily Mirror asking in bold letters, ""Is this an insight into the issue of euthanasia or just a cynical attempt to boost ratings?"" The production company behind the film says it explores the difficult choices made by patients and families of those who commit assisted suicide. ""'The Suicide Tourist will take the audience on a journey they could only have imagined, and will not forget,"" Point Grey Pictures says on its Web site. Oscar-winning Canadian filmmaker John Zaritsky made the documentary with the family's permission and gained rare access to the Dignitas clinic in Zurich, where Ewert died. Mary Ewert told The Independent that she was ""very happy"" with how the film turned out. Opponents of assisted suicide said, however, the film was cheap voyeurism. ""I think it's reducing somebody's death to a kind of reality show, a peep show. I think it's very cheap,"" said Phyllis Bowman, executive director of Right to Life. Bowman said she feared the film would encourage the idea of assisted suicide. That was echoed by Care Not Killing, an alliance of human rights, disability rights, and health care groups. ""The disproportionate media coverage given to a very small handful of persistent people, desperate to end their lives, creates the false impression that there is a growing demand for assisted dying,"" Care Not Killing said in a statement on its Web site. The group said more attention should be paid to palliative care for dying people, rather than assisted dying. It is against the law in the United Kingdom to help someone commit suicide, and it can bring a prison sentence of as long as 14 years. Recent court cases have sought clarity on the law, however, saying it does not specify at what point assistance begins. Swiss law says only that helping someone commit suicide must not be for personal gain.","Assisted suicide of 59-year-old Briton Craig Ewert sceduled to be shown on TV .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Nine Lebanese nationals abducted 17 months ago in Syria returned home Saturday after a multinational deal to secure their release, officials said. They arrived at Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport on a flight from Turkey, where they were sent after being freed Friday, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency. Lebanese Foreign Affairs Minister Adnan Mansour and Interior Minister Marwan Charbel, together with relatives of the freed hostages, were at the airport to welcome them, the news agency reported. Their return follows the release of two Turkish Airlines pilots who were abducted in Beirut two months ago, the agency said. The pilots arrived Saturday in Istanbul, where Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan greeted them, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. Turkish President Abdullah Gul spoke to the pilots by phone, Anadolu said. One of the pilots, Murat Akpinar, said he understood why there was no military raid to rescue them since that could have led to hundreds of deaths, Anadolu said. Still, he said he never lost faith. ""We knew that our government was behind us, and they would not leave us there,"" Akpinar said, according to Anadolu. The nine Lebanese were kidnapped in May 2012 in Aleppo, Syria, as they were returning from a religious pilgrimage to Iran, their relatives said. Some in Syria accused them of being members of Hezbollah, a Shiite militant group. The pilots were going from the Beirut airport to a hotel when their bus was ambushed August 9. They may have been targeted in retaliation for the Lebanese abductions because many Lebanese Shiites oppose the Turkish government's support for rebels in Syria. Palestinian officials as well as the governments of Qatar and Turkey played a role in securing the swap, Lebanese officials said. Free passage for many inside Syria remains out of reach. On Saturday, the U.N. humanitarian chief called for a cease-fire in Moadamiyeh so that aid workers could evacuate thousands of civilians trapped in the conflict, which reportedly has killed more than 100,000 people since it began in March 2011. ""The humanitarian community has stressed time and time again that people must not be denied lifesaving help and that the fighting has to stop,"" Valerie Amos, under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said in statement. Aid groups have been barred from Moadamiyeh for months, she said. ""I call on all parties to agree (to) an immediate pause in hostilities in Moadamiyeh to allow humanitarian agencies unhindered access to evacuate the remaining civilians and deliver lifesaving treatment and supplies in areas where fighting and shelling is ongoing,"" said Amos, who is also the U.N. emergency relief coordinator. Thousands of families also are trapped elsewhere in Syria, including in Nubil, Zahra, old Aleppo town, old Homs town and Hassakeh, she said. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Beirut, and Tom Watkins wrote in Atlanta.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British television audiences will be shown an assisted suicide for the first time Wednesday, when a documentary is aired about a man taking his own life at a Swiss clinic. Craig Ewert, along with his wife Mary, hears final instructions from Dignitas escort Arthur Bernhard before taking a fatal dose of barbiturates. The documentary for broadcaster Sky will show the final moments in the life of 59-year-old Briton Craig Ewert, a retired university professor, as he takes a lethal dose of sedatives under medical supervision. The father-of-two had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease -- a rare condition caused by the breakdown of nerve cells in the brain that control the muscles -- five months before his death at Swiss euthanasia clinic, Dignitas. He decided that he didn't want to continue suffering as a prisoner in his own body.

It differs slightly from euthanasia, which involves the deliberate killing of a person for the benefit of that person. What are the laws on assisted suicide in the UK? Assisted suicide is currently illegal in the UK, with the 1961 Suicide Act making it an offence to ""aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another."" Helping somebody to die carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years. Have people been prosecuted here for assisting suicide? No. A decision by Britain's Crown Prosecution Service on December 10 effectively ruled out the prosecution of families who assist in such ""mercy killings,"" when it decided no charges would be brought against the parents of a paralyzed rugby player. Daniel James, 23, died with the aid of his parents in a Dignitas assisted suicide clinic last year after deciding he was no longer able to live with the injuries he sustained playing rugby at university.  Watch more about the case » . In a landmark decision, Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to prosecute the couple, but that it would not be in the public's interest to do so. In a statement he pointed to the fact that Daniel, ""as a fiercely independent young man, was not influenced by his parents to take his own life and the evidence indicates he did so despite their imploring him not to."" Has there been a push to change the law in the UK? The issue was brought to widespread attention in 2002 when Diane Purdy, a terminally ill woman, failed in a legal bid for her husband to be allowed to help her take her life without fear of prosecution. Her lawyers had argued that under the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to respect for private life and bans inhuman and degrading treatment, she should be allowed to die with dignity, rather than face the distressing final stages of her disease. She eventually died in a hospice in Luton, England. Since then several attempts to legalize assisted suicide in the UK have been rejected. The most recent, in 2006, was defeated in the House of Lords -- the country's upper house in parliament -- by 148 votes to 100. In Scotland, which has its own legal system, veteran MP Margo MacDonald has launched a campaign to legalize the practice. MacDonald, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, said people should have the right to choose the time and place of their death. She hopes to bring legislation before Scotland's parliament next year. Why can it be done in Switzerland? Who does it? Swiss charity Dignitas was founded in 1998 and has helped hundreds of people across Europe to commit suicide. Dignitas takes advantage of Switzerland's liberal laws on assisted suicide which suggest that a person can be prosecuted only if they are acting out of self interest. Campaigners see the absence of a complete ban on assisted suicides as tacit permission to proceed - although their stance has never been tested in the Swiss courts. The charity is run by lawyer Ludwig Minelli, who believes that he is helping people ""die with dignity.""","Final moments in the life of 59-year-old Briton Craig Ewert shown on TV .

"New York (CNN) -- Get too far out of line aboard an international flight and you could be restrained in your seat with zip ties and duct tape. That appears to be what happened to a disruptive male passenger aboard a flight from Iceland to New York on Thursday after a photo surfaced on social media showing a man bound to his seat. Iceland Air said it could not confirm the validity of the photo, but said there was ""an incident with a passenger on the flight from Reykjavik to New York"" in which the passenger was restrained. The man was ""hitting, screaming and spitting at other passengers, while yelling profanities,"" according to airline spokesman Michael Raucheisen, who said the passenger's ""behavior was considered to be unruly and threatening."" ""To ensure the safety of those on board, he was restrained by passengers and crew and was monitored for his own safety for the duration of the flight,"" he added. The man was arrested after the flight arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York, the airline said. The Port Authority said the man was not charged and was taken to a local hospital. Raucheisen said duct tape and plastic zip ties are considered standard protocol when restraining a passenger. ""This equipment is on board all our flights in case an incident like this arises,"" he said. A photo posted on Facebook by a fellow passenger showed a man tied to the back of his seat with his legs tied together, and tape on his ankles and over his mouth.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Hurricane Ike made landfall on the north coast of eastern Cuba Sunday as a Category 3 storm that weather experts were calling a ""major hurricane."" The eye of the hurricane made landfall in the province of Holguin near Punto de Sama, with maximum winds near 125 mph. Earlier Sunday, Ike hit Turks and Caicos Islands, leaving a trail of devastation. Rains and flooding from Ike also killed at least 73 people in Haiti. ""It pretty much looks like an episode of 'The Twilight Zone,' "" said Audley Aftwood, a reporter for a radio station on Grand Turk Island. ""It's like the end of the world."" Aftwood estimated at least 90 percent of homes he saw on the island were missing roofs and hundreds, if not thousands, of people had been made homeless. ""This is definitely similar to Katrina in New Orleans or worse,"" Aftwood said. ""It's going to take years to bring this island back to the way it was.""  Watch Aftwood describe the damage » . The possibility of similar devastation prompted state and local officials in Florida and Louisiana to prepare for what may be the third major storm to affect the Gulf Coast in less than a month. ""Let's hope it's all a false alarm,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Sunday as he preemptively issued a state of emergency. His state is still recovering from Hurricane Gustav; more than 370,000 people there are still without power, nearly a week after Gustav made landfall, he said. ""There continues to be much uncertainty about the predicted track,"" he said of Ike. On Sunday, President Bush declared a state of emergency in Florida.

It's just too close to say, 'Bunker down and we'll be OK.' "" At 11 p.m. ET, Ike had sustained winds near 120 mph (195 kph), with higher gusts. It was located about 135 miles (100 km) west of Cabo Lucrecia, Cuba. The storm was moving westward at about 13 mph (20 kph), and forecasters expect it continue on that track and turn west-northwest Monday. Ike has raised fears about flooding, as rain from Tropical Storm Hanna saturated the ground when it struck last week, he said. The hurricane's eye never touched Haiti. But the storm system did bring heavy rains and winds. Jean Pierre Guiteau, executive director for the Red Cross in Haiti, said 52 people were killed when a river burst its banks in the mountain town of Cabaret --not far from the capital Port Au Prince.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- A 69-year-old who was previously convicted of torching a palace has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed Namdaemun, South Korea's oldest wooden structure and a national treasure, authorities said on Tuesday. People on Monday look at the debris of the Namdaemun gate in central Seoul after the fire. Similarities between the Sunday night fire and the 2006 blaze led to the investigation of a man identified only as Mr. Chae, said Kim Young-Su, chief of police of the Namdaemun police station. Chae had served time in prison for the palace fire. Police searched the home of Chae's ex-wife and found a can of paint thinner and a pair of leather gloves they believe were used in the fire, Kim said. Chae confessed to starting the fire, saying he was upset by a land grievance that led him to start the 2006 fire and by the sentence he was handed in that case, Kim said. Chae was free on a suspended sentence, Kim added. Chae said he chose Namdaemun because it was easily accessible by public transportation and yet situated in a lightly populated area where the fire was unlikely to hurt people, according to police. The fire burned for hours, and more than a hundred firefighters tried to save it.  Watch the reaction to the Namdaemun's destruction » .

A storm hovers over Highway 34, 12 miles east of Grand Island, Nebraska, on Wednesday night. Tornadoes struck parts of Minnesota and Nebraska on Wednesday, uprooting trees, downing power lines and knocking out cell phone service, emergency officials said. A tornado touched down near the city of Aurora in southeast Nebraska on Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service said. Aurora Mayor Marlin Seeman said the twister severely damaged a rural county five miles west of his town.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie gave an exclusive interview with CNN's Arwa Damon while visiting Iraq to draw attention to the refugee crisis in the wartorn country. Here is a full transcript of the interview: . ""Displacement can lead to ... instability and aggression,"" Jolie, right, tells CNN's Arwan Damon. Damon: First of all thank you obviously for your time. What is your main aim in this visit -- what are you trying to acomplish while you are out here? Jolie: Well I came to the region about 6 months ago, I first went to Syria because I work with U.N.H.C.R. and there are 1.5 million refugees in Syria alone from Iraq and while I was there, I went inside and met with some internally displaced people.  And this trip is to get a better picture of the internally displaced people and to discuss with the local government, with our government, with the NGOs and with local people, the situation and try to understand what is happening, because there are over 2 million internally displaced people and there doesn't seem to be a real coherent plan to help them and there's lots of good will and lot's of discussion --but there seem to be a lot of uh -- just a lot of talk at the moment and a lot of pieces need to be put together. So, trying to figure out what they are. Damon: What kind of a sense have you been able to get so far in terms of how severe the crisis is and what actually needs to be done to help out?  Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Angelina Jolie » . Jolie: Well, I in my research before I came here, I looked at the numbers and there are over 4 million people displaced and of the 2 million internally displaced it's estimated that 58 percent are under 12 years old. So it's a very high number of people in a very, very vulnerable situation and a lot of young kids. So far the different U.S. officials I've met with and different local people I've met with all have shared concerns and very, very strongly you know they have spoken out about the humanitarian crisis but um, but there seems to be a block in. I'm not good at policy and fixing all this and saying what's wrong but I do know that for example U.N.H.C.R. needs to be more active inside Iraq. In order for that to happen, they need they feel strongly about having some better protection ... better security in talking with the U.S. officials, they're willing to give that security to the extent that they can give it. And so you know I don't have the answers but I know that this is one thing that needs to be addressed and solved because there does need to be a real presence here to help count the people and register the people. Also even just the government here needs to empower the prime minister ... here needs to empower the government that deals with migration and displacement to be able to address the concerns for these people and that hasn't happened in a significant way yet. Damon: Do you think that the global community has a responsibility to address that? Jolie: Well I think the global community always has a ... has a responsibility to any humanitarian crisis. And I think it's in our best interest to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale because displacement can can lead to a lot of instability and aggression and you know pop. We don't ... we certainly we just don't want that we have.. A lot of people feel it's a little calmer now ... this is the time to really discuss and and try to get these communities back together. But if these communities don't start coming back together properly, if we don't start really counting the people ... understanding where they are ... what they need ... making sure the schools are being built ... making sure the electricity the water and all these needs are being met and also understanding that a lot of the people that will return are going to come back to houses that are occupied or destroyed and bombed out and we have to we have to have... It's going to be a big operation to understand the needs ... to address it to help people put the pieces of their life back together and return to their communities. So it's really just putting kind of ... getting the plan together ... getting the group together and everybody actively focused on helping the IDPS and the refugees. Damon: What would the message that you would want to carry out of here back to the States or even the message that you would want to get out internationally in terms of what's happening here ... the refugee crisis ... how serious it is and the consequences that could happen in the future if it's not properly addressed? Jolie: I always hate speculation on the news, so I don't want to be somebody who speculates. Um but I think it's clear, I think, I think you know a displaced unstable population is you know is a very what happens in Iraq, and how Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East. And a big part of what is going to affect how it settles is how these people are returned and settled into their homes into their community and brought back together and whether they can live together and what their communities look like, so it does have broad implications. Damon: On a personal level why is this so important to you ... you willing to come here and risk your life? Jolie: Uh, what about you (laughs) why are you here? (laughs) It was an easy choice to make. I've uh, I felt I had to come here because it is very difficult to get answers about especially the internally displaced people. It's as I said even U.N.H.C.R. who I traditionally work with -- they are not able to be inside at the moment and so I was very frustrated and just getting a bunch of ideas and papers but not knowing what's really going on, so so today I'm able to talk to all different people from our government and their government and really get some answers as to what is holding up the processes to really really assist these people properly. Damon: Do you think that you in your position can try to push this process forward put ... pressure perhaps on the U.S. government to let more refugees into the U.S. to address the situation within Iraq and of course address the situations in Syria and Jordan? Jolie: To put pressure on the U.S.? Damon: On the U.S. or to try to just put pressure in general create awareness? Jolie: (interrupting) I think certainly creating awareness. And I think you know what I found is there is... I spoke to the State Department today about meeting our goal, you know the U.S.'s goal of 12,000 people and they still intend to reach that goal and they have and you know there are many different people who can be cynical or say well how are they going to do it, and I will ask them how are you going to do it and is there some way we can help to ... you know ... is there some thing we all need to understand more is there ways we can help to process different people in different countries better is there  because uh because we do need to get those people and we do need to in eight months get as close to 12,000 people as possible we should and I have to believe that there are people working towards that goal so.. So at least that and um, what was your other question? Damon: Why is it so important? What do you think needs to be (interrupted) Why is Iraq important? Jolie: Well as I said, if it is not stable it can affect the entire Middle East and that will effect our entire world. If you don't simply want to look at it as of course it's important because there are human beings living here .. I don't see borders and I see lives and I see children and this is you know an environment where there is a war but there is a humanitarian crisis. And they have to be addressed simultaneously. We can't wait for one to end to then finally take the time to address the other, it has to start right now. Damon: There are reports out of Hollywood that... (laughs) Jolie: Oh don't. Stop it. (interupts I had to ask) Stay true to your tradition. You're CNN. Don't do it! Damon: I know that's why I have to...  (Laughs) Jolie: But I don't have to answer. OK? Damon: No you don't. I completely and totally ... you're right and will not press the matter. Jolie: Thank you. E-mail to a friend .","Angelina Jolie visits Iraq to boost efforts to help internally displaced refugees .

"(CNN) -- New details emerged Monday about a former American soldier that Colombian rebels have said they are holding hostage and plan to release. Kevin Scott Sutay served in the U.S. Army from November 2009 to March 2013 and deployed to Afghanistan from November 2010 to November 2011, according to the U.S. Defense Department. He is from Willow Spring, North Carolina, and won a number of awards, including an Army Commendation Medal and a National Defense Service Medal. The Pentagon lists his rank as private. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia said in a statement on Friday that it had been holding Sutay for about a month and would free him as a gesture of good will. The rebels described him as an American soldier, saying they would release him as a ""gesture"" to advance peace talks. They pointed to his capture to back up accusations that the U.S. military is operating in their country. A State Department official said over the weekend the United States was aware of reports that an American citizen had been kidnapped and was working with Colombian authorities to get more information. Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon criticized the apparent kidnapping and called for his immediate release. But he also noted that the American had been warned to be cautious and avoid certain areas. ""The information that we have collected indicates that this American citizen came to this area of the country and even at the time the police warned him not to enter certain areas,"" Pinzon said. The rebels, who have been at war with the Colombian government for decades, said they captured Sutay on June 20 after he entered Colombia after going through Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. They did not provide specifics on the circumstances of his capture. FARC said it hopes his release will boost peace talks between the government and rebels, and is asking for Colombian and Red Cross delegates to pick him up. The government initiated preliminary peace talks last year. Pinzon said the apparent kidnapping showed the rebel group's promises have been disingenuous in the past. ""This organization had promised not to kidnap and they kidnapped an ordinary citizen,"" he said. ""It is absurd that they continue abusing with promises that, it seems, continue to be false.""

"(CNN) -- Guatemala's government has declared a state of siege and sent hundreds of troops to a northern province where officials say a Mexican drug gang is overtaking towns and threatening residents. President Alvaro Colom announced the 30-day emergency rule in Alta Verapaz on Sunday. The rule allows the military to order anyone suspected of conspiring against the government to be arrested and imprisoned without a warrant, the state-run AGN news agency said. ""Starting today, combined forces will retake the streets of Alta Verapaz,"" a government statement released Sunday morning said. Government data shows cells of the drug gang known as Los Zetas are in the area to protect drug trafficking paths between Honduras and Mexico, ""intimidating the population with their heavy weapons and threatening farmers to give up their land for criminal activities,"" AGN reported. The state of siege also allows the government to place greater restrictions on public gatherings, travel visas and gun licenses, among other things, according to AGN. ""The population should be calm. What we are doing is not intended to persecute honest, working people,"" Interior Minister Carlos Menocal told reporters. Menocal said operations in the coming days would aim to boost regional security, regain control of territory, identify criminal gangs and capture their members. In an interview with CNN en Espanol last month, Menocal said his country needed more help from the United States to combat cartels, which were increasingly carving out new drug transport paths. ""In the end, the large majority of drugs travel through Central America, and the assignment of resources or the financial support of the United States government is not the same as Colombia and Mexico receive,"" he said. Menocal said clashes between authorities and Los Zetas had notably increased. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration describes Los Zetas as ""a group of Mexican military deserters...who have kidnapped, tortured, and murdered -- including beheadings -- of law enforcement officials, innocent citizens, informants, and rival drug gangs."" A report released by the Stratfor global intelligence company last week said Los Zetas have also ""long been active in human smuggling, oil theft, extortion and contract enforcement."" Corruption and violence are high in Guatemala, according to the United Nations, which created a committee in 2006 to investigate those issues there. Carlos Castresana, the former head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, announced his resignation earlier this year because he felt the country had not made enough reforms to its justice system. More than 200,000 people have been killed in the nation since 1970, mostly as a result of organized crime, drug-trade violence and a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996. CNN's Miguel Escalona contributed to this report.","30-day state of siege allows the military to arrest suspects without a warrant .

"(CNN) -- The death of a beloved sister is at the heart of best-selling author and screenwriter Delia Ephron's new book, ""Sister Mother Husband Dog (etc.)."" Her sister, famed writer and director Nora Ephron, with whom she worked on projects like the film ""You've Got Mail,"" passed away last year. CNN's Jack Gray asked Delia Ephron about writing through her grief, sibling rivalry, and working with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. An edited transcript of the conversation is below. CNN: Congratulations, it's a wonderful book. Understandably, the passing of your sister and occasional collaborator, Nora Ephron, has a place of honor: You begin with an essay about her death. I recall hearing her mentioning in interviews that your mother, also a writer, liked to say ""everything is copy,"" meaning everything is material for writing. Even though Nora didn't publicize her illness, do you think she'd be on some level pleased with you writing about it? Perhaps she'd be disappointed if you hadn't? Delia Ephron: Thank you. My mother didn't say everything is copy, although for writers everything is copy. She said ""take notes,"" when she was in the hospital and she was dying. But she didn't say it to me. She said it to Nora. To me she said, ""I hope you never tell anyone what happens here."" So, mixed messages. I write about that. Nora always said we shared half a brain, and we loved one another's work. I know she would appreciate this book. But she also said to me, about herself, ""What is there left to say? I've said everything."" Nora was rarely wrong, but she was wrong about that. It was a joy to write about her and it helped me a lot to do it. CNN:  You make the point in your book that there's no right way or wrong way to deal with terminal illness, even if you're a celebrity. Nora chose to keep her diagnosis private, while writer Christopher Hitchens went public with his. Why do you think it's difficult for some to accept that different people have different ways of approaching the end of their lives? Ephron: Death is scary. It makes people frightened, upset, angry, and sad. How could it not? In Nora's case, I understood ... if you don't tell a friend that you are seriously ill, how shocking and upsetting that discovery must be. (Friends might ask themselves), ""How close were we, should I have noticed?"" (There is) a sense of betrayal and a desire to have been of help. And when people read you and love you through your work as they did with Nora, in their hearts they have a relationship. Or maybe some people are just judgmental. I have noticed that people are a tad judgmental, myself included. CNN: It's a very poignant and emotional book in places, yet there is also plenty of humor and fun nostalgia. You and Nora wrote the film ""You've Got Mail."" Who would you rather be stuck in an elevator with, Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan? Ephron: Meg, because she's more likely to be carrying a bottle of water and we might get dehydrated. CNN: I'm a huge Diane Keaton fan and I got kind of nervous while reading the essay in which you describe a film adaptation of one of your novels, ""Hanging Up,"" that she directed. Was that a bad experience? Please don't ruin Diane Keaton for me. Ephron: I am so sorry that I made you nervous. In my book I am writing about the complicated nature of collaboration, and about how movies belong to directors, not to screenwriters. ""Hanging Up"" the movie belongs to Diane Keaton. ""Hanging Up"" the novel belongs to me. CNN: You write lovingly about your dog, Honey. Is she really on a kangaroo diet? What does that entail? Because it sounds kind of sketchy. Ephron: Sketchy? I buy dog food made of kangaroo and feed it to her. Honey loves it. Do you mean, how could kangaroo food cure her tendency to chew her paw? Well the truth is, it did for several months but then, just recently, she started chewing her paw again, just in time for publication. Maybe she's having anxiety about being written about. She's a very private dog. CNN: Obviously, ""Sister Mother Husband Dog (etc.)"" is a book that's very much about family. In addition to you and Nora, your sisters Amy and Hallie are also writers. Was there/is there much competition? And how tired are you of people asking you what it's like being from a family of celebrated writers? Ephron: Since much of ""Sister Mother Husband Dog"" is about what it's like to come from my family, I can't really get upset if someone asks me about my family. In fact I'm thrilled. As for competition, siblings are basically uncivilized. My first memory of Nora was of her biting into a tomato in such a perfect way as to squirt juice in my eye. But, coming from a family of writers, we all take pains to respect one another's work and feel that we all have a right to write what we want. That's what we strive for. And mostly we succeed.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis announced on Monday that Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II will become saints on April 27, 2014. This is the first time that two popes will be canonized at the same time. While John Paul II is considered conservative and John XXIII progressive, each extended his hands to the global community. By canonizing two internationally respected religious icons who were quite different from each other, Pope Francis is once again showing the path toward tolerance and civility that is the basis of our collective humanity. The first Jesuit to ascend to the papacy, Pope Francis recently told La CiviltÃ  Cattolica, the Italian Jesuit journal, that too many people have become obsessed with gays, abortion and contraception. His vision of a more inclusive faith that does not discriminate against anyone is a conviction in which I believe the vast majority of Rhode Islanders and Americans share. Pope Francis, by his actions and words, demonstrates that he is determined to eliminate the scourge of prejudice in our society and to renew our civic purpose as a people. For too long, religious extremism has prevailed at the expense of our common human ties. In certain circles in America and countries around the world, there are those people who try to demean others as lesser based on their social standing, skin color or the person they love. This pope can help transcend the culture wars of the past. While I have forcefully maintained the separation of our public and private lives over the course of my career in politics, Pope Francis' papacy offers an unprecedented opportunity for a partnership that wipes out poverty and fulfills a wealth of public policy goals. Since taking the helm of the Vatican, Pope Francis has rededicated the pontificate to the causes of economic justice, equality and peace. In visits to poverty-stricken communities, he has praised the courage of the poor, urging society to receive them with love and understanding. During a trip to the recession-ravaged capital of Sardinia, where he wore a helmet alongside coal miners, Pope Francis criticized the ""idolatry of money,"" a corporate economy that has erased jobs and increased the gap between the wealthy and the poor. ""Where there is no work, there is no dignity,"" he said. In addition to being perhaps the most populist pope in our history, this pope is free of dogma against minorities, thus, providing a platform for all working families. On the international stage, Pope Francis has advocated for diplomacy amid the recent tensions in the Middle East. As the humanitarian crisis in Syria escalated and an ominous conflict loomed, he passionately preached a course of peace. The Pope has encouraged our youth -- the next generation -- to empower themselves with compassion and hope instead of clinging to a vicious cycle of animosity and violence. Rather than narrowly tailoring his message along anti-minority lines, Pope Francis' spiritual doctrine seems to be informed by a commitment to embrace all of humanity. As governor of a state that is home to many Catholics as well as a diverse group of believers and nonbelievers, these are the values shared in many corners of Rhode Island, where we recently celebrated the 350th anniversary of our founding charter -- the first among the American colonies to protect religious liberty. Mapping a modern papacy for the Millennial age, Pope Francis has charted a bold new direction for the future of religion. With an enormous heart and acute intellect, he is poised to be a trailblazing leader who reaches far beyond any one individual religious community. Already, Pope Francis is a shining example of the civil society that we aspire to be in Rhode Island and across our country. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lincoln D. Chafee.","Pope Francis announced that two former popes will be canonized in April 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Alvin Lee, the speed-fingered British guitarist who lit up Woodstock with a monumental 11-minute version of his song ""I'm Going Home,"" has died, according to his website. He was 68. ""With great sadness, we have to announce that Alvin unexpectedly passed away early this morning after unforeseen complications following a routine surgical procedure,"" read the message on alvinlee.com. ""We have lost a wonderful, much loved father and companion. The world has lost a great and truly gifted musician."" The note was signed by Lee's daughter, Jasmin, wife, Evi, and former companion Suzanne. Lee died Wednesday. Born in Nottingham, England, in 1944, Lee was the leader of the band Ten Years After. His performance at Woodstock in 1969 catapulted him into the front ranks of the period's British guitar heroes, which included Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Pete Townshend. In an image from the 1973 book ""Rock Dreams,"" he and those four others are pictured in tuxedos carrying guitar cases into a building. ""Groups would play for an hour without pausing, not to be mobbed or screamed at but in hopes of an ovation,"" critic Nik Cohn wrote about musicians in the caption. Despite his status as a musician, Lee never reached the critical or popular heights of his countrymen. Ten Years After never had a Top 10 album in America, though 1971's ""A Space in Time"" went platinum thanks to the group's only Top 40 hit, ""I'd Love to Change the World.""

"(CNN) -- Facebook's Ticker, the fast-scrolling tote board of pretty much everything your friends are doing, is ready to start selling you stuff. ""Sponsored stories"" -- in other words, posts that someone paid for -- reportedly will begin appearing in the feed in the top right corner of home pages. A Facebook spokesman confirmed that changes are on the way. ""We recently made some changes to Facebook that help surface more engaging content, whether paid or organic, to people using Facebook,"" spokesman Andrew Noyes said in an e-mail. ""With these changes, people may see a varying number of ads or Sponsored Stories alongside organic content. In testing, we've found this leads to more engagement with for both paid and organic content."" A marketing news website -- ClickZ -- reported this weekend that a Facebook spokeswoman said ads would begin appearing in the Ticker for some users Monday. ""Sponsored stories"" have appeared on Facebook for some time, targeted to individual users based on their activities on the site. In some instances, they can be triggered by friends' activities -- say, if they ""like"" a particular brand's page. Currently, they appear in the Ticker on the ""canvas pages"" of apps. Those are the pages you're on when you're playing a game or using some other app that needs its own page to run. Weaving sponsored content into organically appearing posts is a trend that's been growing as sites look to cash in on their popularity. Story-sharing sites StumbleUpon and Digg already sprinkle sponsored ads among the stories they recommend to users. Twitter offers ""sponsored tweets"" and ""promoted"" trending topics -- a status that usually has to be earned by popularity alone. The Ticker was one of the most discussed new wrinkles when a host of Facebook changes were rolled out in September. Critics called it distracting -- a constantly buzzing home for oversharing of the highest order. (The comparisons to Twitter's fast-moving updates, for better or for worse, are hard to ignore.) But as with many Facebook changes, complaints died down in the weeks that followed as users either got used to the feature or entered a realm of quiet acceptance.","Facebook is adding ads to its fast-moving Ticker .

"(CNN) -- A state medical examiner will try to determine the cause of death of two University of Florida students who died over the weekend while exploring a cave in northwest Georgia. Michael Pirie, 18, and Grant Lockenbach, 20, both died Saturday of what appears to be hypothermia, David Ashburn, director of Walker County emergency services, said late Sunday. Autopsies will be conducted, he said. ""Both passed away in Ellison's Cave in Walker County and their bodies are at the state medical examiner's office now,"" Ashburn said. ""We think Grant went down first and Michael went down to help him."" Their bodies were removed from the cave late Saturday, he said. They were part of a group of five guys and five girls who were exploring the Crockford-Pigeon Mountain Wildlife Management Area in LaFayette, Ashburn said. Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson said affiliate WTVC that Pirie and Lockenbach broke away from the group and decided to explore by themselves. ""They were only dressed in T-shirts and jogging shorts and certainly were not dressed appropriately for going in a cave,"" Wilson said. Other members of the group were able to communicate with the men for up to 45 minutes, but their voices eventually grew faint and disappeared. Lockenbach was president of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which held a prayer service for the two students Sunday night, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Pirie was also a member of FCA and played in the University of Florida Drumline.","The bodies of the students are recovered over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- The FBI announced Thursday its agents are looking for a letter, this one directed to the Central Intelligence Agency, that it believes was similar to at least three other letters that contained ricin. Letters were sent to a federal judge, a Spokane post office, President Barack Obama and Fairchild Air Force Base, the FBI said. Tests are being conducted on the letter sent to Fairchild Air Force Base to determine whether it -- like those other three letters -- contained ricin. The letter sent to the CIA was ""addressed in a manner consistent with the first four envelopes"" and went to ""a location that does not receive mail deliveries."" As of Thursday evening, authorities have not been able to locate this letter. It was not immediately clear how they knew about its existence. Eight days ago, 37-year-old Matthew Ryan Buquet was arrested as part of the investigation into the aforementioned letter sent to U.S. District Court Judge Fred Van Sickle. That letter contained a message threatening to kill and injure the judge. Both that letter and one sent to a Spokane post office were intercepted on May 14, while the letters to Obama and Fairchild Air Force Base were tracked down on May 22. The four envelopes that authorities have in their possession were all postmarked out of Spokane on May 13, the FBI said. Each one of them had addresses handwritten in red ink. The bureau said it believes the fifth letter -- written to the Central Intelligence Agency at its headquarters in McLean, Virginia -- was likely postmarked the same day and also had red ink on its envelope. The FBI's announcement Thursday out of Washington state came the same day officials intercepted a letter addressed to Obama. The off-site facility that screens mail addressed to the White House turned the letter over to the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force for testing and investigation, U.S. Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said. This letter was similar to threatening letters sent to New York Mayor Bloomberg and the gun-control group he founded. Preliminary tests indicate ricin was in those latter letters, New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said Wednesday. If inhaled, injected or ingested, less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours because of the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems. There is no known antidote for the toxin, which is derived from castor beans.","The FBI says four similar letters were postmarked the same day, with similar ink .

"(CNN) -- Three people died Tuesday when a sweeping dust storm impaired visibility on a major interstate in Arizona and caused a chain-reaction of car accidents, according to the state's Department of Public Safety. Between 30 and 40 vehicles were involved in the Interstate 10 accidents, which also seriously injured five people, Officer Robert Bailey told CNN's sister network HLN. A total of 14 people were hurt, DPS spokesman Harold Sanders told CNN. The collisions started fires, and many of the injured suffered burns, Bailey said. Officials were asking motorists to avoid the affected stretch of I-10, near Casa Grande, Arizona, and south of Phoenix. The scene was a horrific sight even after fires were extinguished, Bailey said. Tow trucks were on the way to clear the road late Tuesday morning. ""There's still a lot of carnage and mess out here,"" Bailey said. iReport: Photos illustrate crash site carnage . Officers in patrol cars are managing rolling traffic breaks to slow traffic, Sanders said. Motorists shouldn't drive faster than 30 mph in the area or in the vicinity of any dust storm, he said. If a driver sees a dust storm ahead, the first step should be to get off the road, he said. I-10 from Phoenix to Tucson gets hit by 10 to 20 dust storms per year, mostly during the summer monsoon season, said Ken Waters, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix. But he wouldn't describe the Tuesday event as a storm, rather ""a case of very localized dust being picked up and thrown across the highway."" Nearby farming could have contributed to Tuesday's conditions, Bailey said. ""What we see here is some farmland here that is very dry and was recently cultivated, and that may have contributed to this,"" he said. Waters gave credence to that theory, saying that winds were clocked at 15 to 20 mph, not as strong as in typical dust storms, in which winds reach 30 to 40 mph. But the area also had seen little rain in the past few weeks, he said, exacerbating the dust problem. CNN's Khadijah Rentas and Sara Pratley contributed to this report.","Many of the injured suffered burns in fires caused by collisions, officer says .

"(CNN) -- The Carolina Panthers selected Auburn University quarterback Cam Newton as the first pick of the 2011 NFL draft on Thursday. The Panthers were given first pick as a result of being the worst-performing franchise last season and had been widely tipped to opt for the 21-year-old. Denver Broncos were allotted second choice in the draft, and the two-time Super Bowl winners chose Texas A&M linebacker Von Miller. The draft took place amid a dispute between NFL teams and players over pay rates. NFL owners appeal ruling, allow some operations . Talks between the players and the teams over contracts broke down last month, resulting in the players union disbanding. The dispute has brought the start of the NFL season, set to get under way on September 8, into jeopardy. Newton helped Auburn to their first undefeated season last year and their first National Championship in 53 years. The Georgia native also won the Heisman Trophy, an award given to the best player in collegiate football. ""It was like a shock went through my body,"" Newton said on the official NFL web site. ""I'm just blessed. ... I can't wait to get to my new hometown of Charlotte."" ""He has special qualities,"" Panthers general manager Marty Hurney said. ""We've had a strong feeling for some time that he was the person who we felt could come in and have the most impact on our football team.""

"(CNN) -- New York eighth-grader Arvind Mahankali is the fiercest speller around. No word can foil him, as he proved Thursday when he beat out other Scripps National Spelling Bee contestants by spelling ""knaidel"" correctly. ""I know this. I got this,"" he told CNN's ""Early Start"" on Friday morning, recalling how he confidently steadied himself before enunciating every letter in the Yiddish word of German origin meaning dumpling. When he uttered the final letter, the audience erupted in wild applause. The 13-year-old is feeling good even though he knows he won't be able to compete again since there's a limit on contestants beyond the eighth-grade. Mahankali isn't the type of kid who stops at spelling domination. ""Next year I'll try to go somewhere in the Math Olympiad and the Physics Olympiad,"" he said. The Bayside Hills, New York, teen, who wants to become a physicist, finished third in two previous national bees. He was eliminated after misspelling words with German roots. ""I thought that the German curse had turned into a German blessing,"" he said. It didn't hurt that he studied constantly, telling CNN that he browsed through the dictionary and let his mother quiz him. ""My dad collects words. I look up those words and get familiarity with those words."" Ending his Scripps career with a victory means he's ""retiring on a good note,"" he said. ""I shall spend the summer,"" he said, ""maybe (an) entire day, studying physics."" Pranav Sivakumar, a 13-year-old from Tower Lakes, Illinois, finished second. He missed on ""cyanophycean."" Then Mahankali nailed ""tokonoma"" and ""knaidel,"" and the rest is history. The annual contest offers the winner a healthy dose of classroom cred, $32,500 in cash and savings bonds, a trophy and a library of reference materials. Contest isn't bee-all and end-all . Eleven million schoolchildren participated in preliminaries leading up to the national contest this week. Of those, 281 children made the trip to Oxon Hill, Maryland, outside Washington, for the national bee. Eleven spellers made it through to the finals. Among them were 63 children who had been to at least one national bee before, and had to prepare for some changes in the rules for this year's events. For the first time, participants had to demonstrate proficiency in vocabulary in addition to spelling. Organizers also added an additional computer test for the semifinals, imposed time limits on computer-based spelling and vocabulary tests, and added a rule that resulted in automatic elimination for any participant who misspelled a word on stage in the second or third rounds. CNN's Athena Jones and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Arvind Mahankali correctly spells ""tokonoma,"" then ""knaidel"" in Scripps National Spelling Bee .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man was arrested after police say he poured acid on his daughter, burning her skin and sending her to the hospital in critical condition. As one of the primary caretakers of Jerome Lynch, 69, Darlene Lynch, 49, was checking on her father in his Brooklyn apartment early Saturday afternoon, when seemingly out of nowhere, the elder Lynch came up behind her and poured acid on her face and down her body, according to Dominique Goodwin, the man's niece. ""Our family just doesn't understand,"" Goodwin said. ""He's not incompetent. He's totally aware of what he did. We just don't know why."" Goodwin said Jerome Lynch had suffered a stroke several years ago, leading to a slur in his speech and a need for a cane or walker to get around. Goodwin added that her family has no idea where he got the acid. Police believe the corrosive substance was actually a cleaning solution that contained 98% sulfuric acid. According to Goodwin, Darlene Lynch suffered burns over 50% of her body -- on her face and over her left side. At one point, it was feared she might lose her left eye, but Goodwin says her cousin is now able to see out of it. An emergency medical team took the daughter to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in critical condition after the attack. NYPD spokesman Sgt. John Buthorn said Sunday that Jerome Lynch had been arrested and charged with felony assault. Information about his arraignment and legal representation were not immediately available.

"(CNN) -- In the span of a few days, more than 51,000 people have thrown their support behind a Massachusetts State Police trooper who was temporarily suspended for giving Boston magazine photos of the hunt and capture of one of the Boston bombing suspects. Sgt. Sean Murphy, who was suspended for a day last week for releasing the photos without authorization, will face a closed hearing Tuesday to determine his professional future with the agency, said state police spokesman David Procopio. Boston magazine published what it said were Murphy's images in a story last week. The piece quoted Murphy as saying that he felt the Rolling Stone cover image -- showing a doe-eyed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev with tousled hair -- was an insult to the victims of the April bombings. What do you think of the Rolling Stone cover? Boston magazine said it received images that Murphy, a tactical photographer, took of the hunt and capture of the alleged Boston bomber. ""I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets,"" Boston magazine quotes Murphy as saying alongside numerous images, including one of the suspect appearing bloody, looking down, his shirt raised and what looks like a red dot laser trained on his forehead. ""This guy is evil,"" Murphy told Boston magazine. ""This is the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine."" A day before three commissioned officers will decide if the sergeant will remain on full or restricted duty pending an investigation or suspended with or without pay during a probe, there was very little hair-splitting on ""Save Sgt. Murphy"" about how people feel. ""If the powers that be do the right thing, they'll give Sgt. Murphy a medal, a long weekend off with pay, a new camera, and an apology,"" Richard C. Martin posted on the Facebook page. His comment alone garnered 160 likes. ""I support Sgt Murphy for standing up for the victims,"" posted John W. Patterson, ""he's a true hero for doing what he thinks is right."" But there were a few people who understood why the trooper was in trouble. Darin Vance, a 16-year-old from West Virginia posted, ""I hate to see him lose his job, but what he did really was illegal; those pictures were not his, since he took them for his employer. Therefore, legally speaking, he stole the picture, and published it. I guess it depends how his contract was set up, but I think all copyrights would have been given over to the state..."" Vance reiterated his support for the trooper to CNN Monday and said that he worried that the Rolling Stone cover might inspire someone to commit an act of terror hoping to land on the cover of a legendary magazine. On Monday CNN reached a woman who said she was the organizer of the page but would only give a first name -- Lisa. She said that she felt compelled to create the page because her own father was a Massachusetts State Police trooper. ""I thought this page would only be popular among my friends, but I'm getting private messages from people across the country, in Germany and in England, all over, who believe this trooper did the right thing,"" she said. ""I was so angry when I heard that Sgt. Murphy was going to suffer for trying to stand up for victims."" Fast Facts: Boston Terror Attack . Before quoting Murphy in several long passages, Boston magazine wrote: ""Here, in his own words, Murphy shares his thoughts on the Rolling Stone cover. He stresses that he is speaking strictly for himself and not as a representative of the Massachusetts State Police."" John Wolfson, Boston magazine's editor in chief, said the magazine has hundreds of photos similar to the ones Murphy provided and will publish more in its September issue. He said Murphy was ""conflicted on some level"" about releasing the photos, but ""genuinely worried"" about how the Rolling Stone cover will affect the victims' families. The Rolling Stone cover unleashed a wave of intense reaction on social media, which played out in brick-and-mortar stores. Three prominent New England-based businesses -- CVS pharmacies, Stop & Stop, and Tedeschi Food Shops -- heard the public outcry and announced they would not sell the print edition of the magazine. The 7-Eleven corporation said Thursday its nearly 1,700 company stores across the country won't sell the issue. Read more: Rolling Stone cover called a 'slap' to Boston . Some have defended the cover, arguing that it draws much needed attention to a young man who seemed an unlikely terrorist and makes us all reconsider our ideas of what a terrorist would look like. Rolling Stone issued a statement saying that the story ""falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage..."" ""The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in the same age group as many of our readers,"" the statement read, ""makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens."" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges in connection with bombings and is awaiting trial.

"(CNN) -- Football's managerial merry-go-round swung into action Tuesday as both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain ended months of speculation by appointing new coaches. Carlo Ancelotti has left PSG to take over at Real, while former French national team coach Laurent Blanc has replaced the Italian in Paris. Nine-time European champion Real has been searching for a new coach since Jose Mourinho moved to Ancelotti's former club Chelsea earlier this month. Ancelotti has signed a three-year contract at the Bernabeu and will be presented to the media on Wednesday. Former France captain Blanc's arrival at PSG was announced at almost exactly the same time as Ancelotti's appointment. ""Paris Saint-Germain is delighted to announce the appointment of Laurent Blanc as coach for the next two years,"" read a PSG statement. ""The board of Paris Saint-Germain has given Laurent Blanc the mission to build on last season and to continue the club's ascendency towards the summits of the European game."" Both Ancelotti and Blanc will be tasked with improving their respective club's performance in the European Champions League. Ancelotti will look to deliver an historic 10th triumph in Europe's premier club competition for Real, having won the competition twice as coach of AC Milan. The 54-year-old also won the European Cup twice with Milan as a player. Qatar-owned PSG will expect Blanc to mould an expensively-assembled squad into a major European force. Blanc will have players such as Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Brazil captain Thiago Silva at his disposal at the Parc des Princes. As a player, Blanc led the France team during the greatest period in its history. He captained the team to victory on home soil at the 1998 World Cup, when France beat Brazil 3-0 in the final, before playing a central role in Les Bleus' win over Italy in the final of Euro 2000.

"(CNN) -- A fired United Airlines flight attendant plans to admit in court that he made eight bomb threats against his former airline. Patrick Cau, 40, a German citizen living in Los Angeles, was arrested in January while training for a flight attendant job at another airline -- American. Although the threats received widespread attention at the time, news of his arrest and the charges are just coming to light now. In a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Cau admitted to making eight bomb threats between Oct. 4, 2012, and January 2, 2013, from pay phones in Los Angeles, New York City, Las Vegas and Seattle. In each case, the caller claimed explosives had been placed on United flights. The threats disrupted law enforcement and inconvenienced passengers, according to the court filing. Each time, officials evacuated planes, re-screened passengers and searched bags and cargo, but did not find explosives. Cau's attorneys, John Duran and Craig Charles, said he worked at United for 15 years as a purser, or flight attendant supervisor. Cau filed a sexual harassment complaint against a male supervisor and was dissatisfied with how the carrier handled it, Duran said. After lodging the complaint, the airline fired Cau for an incident involving a passenger, Duran said. But Cau believed the firing was retaliation for his complaint. Duran and Charles declined to say how authorities came to believe Cau was responsible for the bomb threats or when the investigation began, but said authorities have a circumstantial case. They confirmed that many of the threats involved Cau's old London to Los Angeles route. He has agreed to plead guilty to one count relating to false information and hoaxes next Monday, according to the agreement filed in Los Angeles. The charge carries up to five years in jail. Duran said Cau had no previous criminal record, so American would have had no reason not to hire him when he applied for a flight attendant job. But when American conducted a records check before a training flight, it discovered Cau was on a no-fly list, Charles said. The FBI arrested him at an American training center. Both airlines confirmed they once employed Cau but declined further comment. Charles described Cau's legal situation as ""delicate,"" acknowledging that he had signed a plea agreement, but saying ""as of today (he had) not officially admitted in open court to any of the allegations.""","Man allegedly called in eight threats to flights by former employer United Airlines, court document says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors began deliberations Thursday in the Michael Jackson wrongful-death trial, potentially bringing the contentious case to a close after five months of testimony and three days of closing arguments. The 12 jurors spent two hours in the jury room Thursday afternoon before ending their day; they will return Friday morning for more deliberations. Katherine Jackson's lawyer delivered his final arguments in the AEG Live trial Thursday morning, delivering his rebuttal to defense closing arguments. AEG Live's Marvin Putnam had asked jurors to find Michael Jackson responsible for his death, not the company that promoted and produced his comeback concerts in 2009. Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending the company was liable in the pop icon's drug overdose death because its executives negligently hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray. ""Plaintiffs want you to hold a concert promoter liable for Michael Jackson's overdose in his bedroom at night, behind locked doors on June 25, 2009,"" Putnam told jurors. ""An overdose of the drug administered to Mr. Jackson by his longtime doctor -- Dr. Murray -- who he'd been seeing for years, a doctor he brought to Los Angeles from Las Vegas."" ""How dare they come up here and accept no responsibility and blame it all on Michael,"" Jackson lawyer Brian Panish said in his rebuttal. Panish suggested that Jackson's share of blame was 20%, ""but the rest goes on AEG."" When the trial began five months ago, Putnam warned he would show ""ugly stuff"" and reveal Jackson's ""deepest, darkest secret."" The revelations that jurors heard from 58 witnesses over 83 days of testimony spanning 21 weeks included details of Jackson's drug use and his shopping for a doctor to give him the surgical anesthetic propofol that he thought would give him sleep. ""He was nearly half a billion dollars in debt,"" Putnam argued Wednesday. ""His mother's house was near foreclosure, we didn't know that then. What else do we know now? That Mr. Jackson spent decades shopping for doctors to give him the painkillers he wanted. Mr. Jackson made sure we didn't know that."" Panish, the lead Jackson lawyer, conceded in his closing Tuesday that the singer may have some fault for his own death, but said ""it's about shared responsibility."" Jackson did use prescription painkillers and was warned that using propofol at home to sleep was risky, ""but he never had a problem until Dr. Conrad Murray was working and until Conrad Murray negotiated with AEG Live,"" Panish argued. Who's to blame for Michael Jackson's death? The AEG Live lawyer argued Wednesday that Jackson should take the full blame. ""The sad truth is Mr. Jackson's death was caused by his choices and it would have happened no matter what -- with or without AEG Live."" The Jackson lawyer urged jurors to award the family between $1 billion and $2 billion in damages for what he called AEG Live's share of liability in Jackson's death -- to replace what Jackson would have earned touring, had he lived, and for the personal suffering from the loss of a son and father. Putnam told jurors Wednesday that was ""an absurd number."" Katherine Jackson testified that she filed the wrongful death lawsuit three years ago against AEG Live ""because I want to know what really happened to my son."" Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's propofol overdose death. The judge is allowing a television camera in court for the closing arguments and verdict. Lawyer: Blame Jackson for his death, not AEG Live . Burden of ""Poof"" Panish -- a former college football player who has a reputation for winning large damage awards -- appeared more aggressive in his rebuttal than in his initial closing arguments delivered Tuesday. In what may become a much-repeated video highlight, Panish joked about how his AEG LIve counterpart had accused him of making up the estimate of $59 million that MIchael Jackson could have been expected to have given his mother and children in support had he lived. ""Poof! Poof! I just made it up!"" Panish said dramatically as he pointed to Putnam, sitting at the AEG Live defense table. The line and gesture drew a laugh from some jurors. Panish showed jurors that the figure was actually from a opinion provided by a financial expert that AEG Live hired to analyze the issue. Putnam, in his closing Wednesday, referenced the expert's lower-end estimate of $21 million. The numbers could be important in guiding the jury if it decides to award damages to the Jacksons. AEG Live's defense . Murray treated Michael Jackson and his children for minor illnesses while they lived in Las Vegas for three years, before the singer returned to Los Angeles to prepare for his ""This Is It"" comeback tour. It was Jackson -- not AEG Live executives -- who chose Murray to be his full-time doctor for his tour, the company's lawyers contend. AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware negotiated to pay Murray $150,000 a month only because of Jackson's request to have his doctor with him as he performed 50 shows at London's O2 Arena, they argue. ""He told them 'We're bringing this doctor,' "" Putnam said. ""This was a choice Mr. Jackson made. He was a grown man."" AEG Live executives tried to talk Jackson out of taking an American doctor with him on tour, suggesting he could save money by using a physician in London, Putnam said. ""But Mr. Jackson was undeterred,"" he said. ""Ultimately, it was his money, his doctor, his choice. He certainly wasn't going to take 'no' for an answer."" There was no need to check Murray's background because he was a licensed, successful doctor who was known to Jackson, Putnam said. ""All AEG Live knew was Dr. Murray was Mr. Jackson's longtime doctor."" A key argument in the Jackson case is that AEG Live was negligent by not ordering a financial background check of Murray, which would have revealed he was in a dire financial situation and not successful. His desperation to keep his lucrative job led Murray to violate his Hippocratic Oath to do no harm by using the dangerous propofol infusions to put Jackson to sleep each night for two months, Jackson lawyers argue. AEG Live executives had no way of knowing Murray was treating Jackson's insomnia with propofol in the privacy of his bedroom, their lawyers contend. Jackson was a secretive addict, adept at keeping family, friends and other doctors in the dark about his medical treatments, they argue. But two doctors testified that they told Gongaware about Jackson's abuse of painkillers and his insomnia during tours in the 1990s, when the AEG Live executive served as tour manager. Jackson lawyers argue Gongaware, who was the top producer on the new tour, should have known that Jackson could suffer the same problems in 2009. The deterioration of Jackson's health over the two months he was being treated by Murray was a red flag that there was a problem, but AEG Live executives negligently ignored the warning, Jackson lawyers argue. By June 19, he was frail, suffering chills, unable to do his trademark dances and paranoid, according to testimony. ""Everyone believed at the time that a 50-year-old man, who hadn't performed in a decade was tired, out of shape and very nervous,"" Putnam argued Wednesday. ""That's what they believed at the time and it makes sense."" AEG Live would avoid a negative verdict if it is able to convince at least four of the 12 jurors that it did not hire Murray. It is the first of 16 questions on the jury verdict form. If jurors answer it with a ""no"" -- that AEG Live did not hire the doctor -- they would end their deliberations and the trial. An AEG Live lawyer e-mailed an employment contract to Murray on the morning of June 24, 2009. Murray signed it and faxed it back to the company that day. But the signature lines for AEG Live's CEO and for Michael Jackson were never signed since Jackson died the next day. But Panish, the lead Jackson lawyer, told jurors Tuesday that all the elements of an oral contract -- ""just as valid as a written contract"" -- were in place when Jackson died. Murray had been treating Jackson for two months and the written contract stated that his start day was May 1, 2009. A series of e-mail exchanges involving Murray and AEG Live executives and lawyers support this argument, Panish said. A look at the life of Michael Jackson . Blame and damages . If the jury concludes AEG Live has liability, it would have to decide how much the company should pay in economic and personal damages to Jackson's mother and children. They can use estimates of Jackson's ""lost earnings capacity"" -- the amount of money he could reasonably be expected to have earned if he had lived -- to guide them. AEG Live expert Eric Briggs testified it was ""speculative"" that Jackson would have even completed another tour because of his drug use, damaged reputation and history of failed projects. He suggested the star may never have earned another dime. Putnam's closing argument about damages must overcome the impression left on jurors Tuesday, when Panish played a video montage of Jackson performances. ""That is, I think, the best evidence of if Michael Jackson could have sold tickets -- not what Mr. Briggs would tell you,"" Panish told jurors. Panish suggested jurors pick a number between $900 million and $1.6 billion for economic damages. They should add on another $290 million for non-economic damages -- or personal damages, he said. Putnam argued that the number, if the jury finds AEG Live liable, should be closer to $21 million, the amount of money AEG Live's expert calculated Jackson would have given his mother and three children over the next 16 years. He couldn't have given them more because he had a $400 million debt that was getting deeper, he said. ""If Mr. Jackson had lived, it's hard to see how he would ever have dug himself out of that whole,"" Putnam said. The last question on the verdict form asks jurors to assign a percentage that they believe represents Michael Jackson's share of blame in his death. The total damages owed by AEG Live would be reduced by that percentage. While AEG Live lawyers did not suggest a percentage, Panish suggested jurors reduce the damage award by 20% to reflect Jackson's share of blame.

"Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- The startling discovery that three women had been held captive for a decade inside a Cleveland home has answered key questions from their families and raised a slew of others. Here are some of the most pressing: . What was life like for the victims? Ropes and chains taken as evidence from the modest, two-story home on Seymour Avenue where the women were held were used to restrain the women, Police Chief Michael McGrath told NBC's ""Today."" ""We have confirmation that they were bound,"" he said. But Public Safety Director Martin Flask said it was not clear what they were used for. Victor Perez, chief assistant prosecutor for Cleveland, announced Wednesday that charges against Ariel Castro include four counts of kidnapping -- one each for Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and a 6-year-old girl who was born to Berry in captivity. Those charges also address the question of whether the women were sexually abused. Castro, 52, faces three counts of rape, Perez said, adding that a grand jury could later indict him on additional charges. Two of Castro's brothers who also were arrested after the women's escape Monday evening will not be charged, according to the prosecutor. Perez said ""there is no evidence these two individuals had any involvement."" As to the victims, two of them returned home Wednesday. But they have not made public statements as they seek to be reacquainted with family and friends. The interior of their prison was unremarkable, according to Tito DeJesus. The sometime bandmate of the homeowner, suspect Ariel Castro, said he entered the house about two years ago to to help deliver a washer and dryer and saw ""a normal environment."" ""It didn't seem to be a place where women were being held against their will,"" he said. ""Of course, mind you, I didn't go throughout the entire house. I was just at the beginning of the house, in the living room, but it seemed normal."" The one-bathroom house has a living area of 1,436 square feet, with a living room inside the front door, a dining room and a kitchen on the ground floor, according to Cuyahoga County records. The four bedrooms are all on the second floor. Because the ground is sandy and loose in the area, basements in the area tend to be smaller than the footprints of the houses above, which are usually damp and cold in the winter. The basement of the house, which was built in 1890 and renovated in 1956, is not finished. Timeline: From missing to liberated . How did their years of captivity go unnoticed? Looking back on it, would police or neighbors done anything differently to increase the chances of discovering the imprisoned women? And was Monday's escape by Berry the first time in a decade that any of the women had been able to signal anyone in the neighborhood about their plight? Some neighbors of Ariel Castro have second-guessed themselves, asking if they could have prevented the horrors had they noticed details that now seem out of place. For example, neighbor Daniel Marti -- who has described Castro as an ""outgoing person, very nice guy"" -- asked why he didn't question why the single man frequently carried bags full of McDonald's food into the house where he appeared to live alone, or why he frequently steered conversation away from it. ""Now that I think of it, he didn't want nobody back there,"" said Marti, who said he has known Ariel Castro since junior high school and lived near him for some 22 years. Neighbors Israel Lugo and Nina Samoylicz told CNN that they had called police in recent years to report separate incidents at the home. Samoylicz said she and others saw a naked woman in the home and called police. Faliceonna Lopez, Samoylicz's sister, told a different version Tuesday night on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" She said after seeing the woman, they told their mother, not police. The mother, Annita Lugo, told Morgan that she didn't call police, either. Another neighbor, Israel Lugo -- Annita Lugo's brother -- says he called police in 2011 when he heard yelling in the Castro home. Officers left when no one answered the door, Lugo says. If neighbors' accounts were true and the police really heard screaming and simply knocked on the door and left when no one answered, then ""law enforcement clearly dropped the ball,"" attorney Lisa Bloom told CNN. ""It was almost like a Keystone Cops situation,"" prominent attorney Mark Geragos added. ""There's got to be much more to this story."" Cleveland officials denied claims that they had called police to report suspicious activity at the home. ""Media reports of multiple calls to the Cleveland Police reporting suspicious activity and the mistreatment of women at 2207 Seymour are false,"" spokeswoman Maureen Harper said in an e-mailed statement. Other officials said call records contained no evidence that neighbors had called police to report unusual activity at the home. Police say they went to the address once in 2000, before the abductions, when Castro reported a fight outside his home, and in 2004, after two of the three women had disappeared. The latter visit was to investigate a complaint that Castro had left a child alone on the bus he was to have been driving. No one answered the door at the home, and investigators later interviewed him elsewhere, police say. Are there more victims? Police have used at least one cadaver dog to search for human remains; they said they have so far found none. They also have said they want to know whether there could be any additional victims in the case. Investigators had speculated that the disappearances of Berry, DeJesus and another girl, Ashley Summers, may have been connected. Summers' family last saw her in July 2007, when she was 14. Now the Summers family is hoping that the Cleveland investigation will yield information about Ashley, her aunt, Debra Summers, said. ""We're hoping for a miracle,"" she said. An FBI spokeswoman said investigators will question the women found Monday in hopes of learning something about Summers' disappearance. Tonia Adkins said she was hoping that her sister Christina was among the women who were freed Monday. Then 18 and five months pregnant, Christina Adkins disappeared in 1995 while walking toward her boyfriend's house on the same block where one of the Castro brothers lived and a few streets away from where the other women were last seen, she said. ""She was going home for the night and she disappeared,"" she said. ""We just really want to find out where she is and is she OK."" Most missing person cases of such duration end badly, according to authorities. According to court documents, Ariel Castro's former wife accused him of repeatedly abusing her, including breaking her nose twice, breaking two ribs, dislocating her shoulder twice and knocking out a tooth. Grimilda Figueroa also accused Castro of causing a blood clot on her brain, according to the 2005 documents. A judge granted a protection order but lifted it three months later after court delays and hearings Castro did not attend, according to the documents. Ishmael Figueroa, Grimilda's father, told CNN that when Ariel Castro and his daughter moved into the house on Seymour Avenue, Ariel Castro would not let let any other family members enter the home. After the couple broke up, his daughter moved back with her parents and said she never wanted to talk about Castro, Figueroa said. She died last year at age 48, according to Social Security records. Ariel Castro's uncle Julio also recalled his nephew's messy breakup. Castro seemed to live alone after that, except for occasional visits by, among others, his two brothers. He also had grandchildren -- at least five, he'd recently noted on Facebook. Some news outlets have reported that at least one of the three women gave birth more than once during their years in captivity. Those news outlets cited unnamed sources. Investigators have not publicly confirmed or denied those assertions, saying it will take time to piece together a complete picture of what happened inside the house.","NEW: Ariel Castro is charged with kidnapping, rape; his brothers are not .

"(CNN) -- The words ""kindergarten graduation"" usually evoke images of tearful parents taking pictures of cute kids in pint-sized graduation caps and gowns. But for students and parents at Michael R. White Elementary School in Cleveland, ""kindergarten graduation"" might now conjure images of ""aggravated rioting."" This, after eight individuals were arrested Friday morning after a fight near the end of the school's graduation ceremony. Officers were dispatched after receiving reports of gunfire, according to a statement from the Cleveland Police Department. As it turned out, there was no gunfire or guns confiscated. But people were going at it after an altercation between two teen girls apparently broke out, Detective Jennifer Ciaccia said. ""We assume they were there for the graduation ceremony,"" she said. ""Several adults then got involved."" Cleveland Police Commander Wayne Drummond was one of the first responding officers to the scene. He told CNN affiliate WEWS that the initial feud prompted family members on both sides to get involved. ""It's an absolute shame,"" said Drummond. ""That something as good as a graduation ceremony, a promotion ceremony, is marred by the actions of a few."" Drummond said the school was put on lockdown to ""make sure the kids were OK."" Roseann Canfora, spokeswoman for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, said no students at Michael R. White Elementary were involved in the fight. A hammer and a stick were taken as evidence, although neither was believed to be used in the fight. Eight people were arrested on suspicion of aggravated rioting, police said. Police say the incident will be further investigated.","Fight breaks out at Cleveland kindergarten graduation .

"(CNN) -- ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" This is the first line of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Apparently, this now only applies to the certain instances for which President Barack Obama sees fit. In recent months, a far-reaching regulation emanating from ""Obamacare"" and imposed by the Department of Health and Human Services requires church-affiliated hospitals, agencies and universities to pay for services that violate their faith (such as contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs) in the health insurance they provide employees. For the first time in our nation's history, the government has launched a full-fledged assault on our religious institutions to force them to pay for services that go against their religious convictions. The compromise offered by the administration allowing religious institutions a year to transition to the new system is no compromise. They are still forced to pay for services in direct conflict with their faith or incur severe penalties that could effectively drive them out of business. This is the most despicable violation of religious liberty that this nation has ever seen. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, archbishop of New York and president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, outlined it best when he said, ""In effect, the president is saying we have a year to figure out how to violate our consciences."" A year is a pitiful concession to make when they are essentially telling people that if they do not violate their conscience, the government will put them out of business. Catholic institutions, however, are not taking this assault lying down. This week, 43 of them have filed lawsuits across the nation challenging the mandate's intrusion on religious liberty. This sentiment is felt not only among Catholics but also among Jewish, Protestant and other religious groups. Though these groups do not necessarily have a uniform religious teaching against some of the mandate's provisions, they do have a uniform agreement that a coercive government does not have the right to say that these religious institutions must violate their consciences. These religious leaders realize that if government can impose these mandates against conscience rights on Catholics, what other mandates will they impose them on next? The Obama administration and some of its allies in the press have attempted to make this a debate over contraception and tried to position opponents of the mandate as waging ""war on women."" Nothing could be further from the truth. There is no effort to limit access to contraceptives. Contraceptives are widely available to women -- and men. For $9 a month, birth control pills can be purchased at major national retail chains. This is all typical Washington-speak to create a rhetorical diversion from the real issue at stake. This debate is about whether the full force of government can be used to force religious institutions to violate their own faith and pay for services and products that violate the tenets of their teaching. It is also a debate over how government defines a religious institution. Until this mandate, the government recognized, through tax law and other means, faith-based schools, hospitals, orphanages, soup kitchens and hospice services as religious institutions. They kept a wall of separation between these institutions and the federal government. Now, under this mandate, unless a Catholic hospital only employs Catholic staff or cares for only sick Catholics it will no longer be regarded as a religious institution and will be forced to fund products and services contrary to the institution's religious and moral beliefs. This is an unprecedented hit on the First Amendment and our nation's long-standing practice of religious liberty. Religious leaders and people of faith from across the spectrum are speaking out to let the administration and Congress know that we cannot let this assault on religious liberty stand and that we will not allow our religious institutions to be bullied into violating their own faith or be forced to limit their good work or worse yet, be forced to shut down these services that help so many people and promote the common good. This mandate presents a challenge to the American people. Our nation has had a long-held tradition backed by legal foundations and precedents that religious groups are allowed ""the free exercise"" of their beliefs. Will we allow our religious freedom to be jeopardized? Will we open the door to other freedoms being regulated, or worse, taken away entirely by the government? The answer to our president should be simple. We cannot -- and will not -- allow this to stand. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Matalin.","Mary Matalin: Obama administration rule infringes on rights of religious organizations .

"(CNN) -- A California man was on probation when he was arrested then released for public intoxication, hours after which he allegedly killed a Roman Catholic priest in a church rectory. The terms of slaying suspect Gary Lee Bullock's probation -- which were for three years tied to a November 2012 arrest for cocaine possession -- did not mandate that he should have remained behind bars after his arrest in southern Humboldt County, California, on New Year's Eve. But had he stayed in custody, or if Eureka police officers detained him again after being tipped off about a suspicious man shortly after his release at the coastal city's St. Bernard Church, the gruesome story may have turned out differently. Instead, around 9 a.m. on Wednesday, New Year's Day, church staff alerted police after finding the Rev. Eric Freed's body. Eureka Police Chief Andy Mills said later that officers and a doctor, who also was a parishioner, soon determined that Freed was dead, having suffered ""blunt force trauma"" in what he described as a ""violent struggle."" Court and other records obtained Friday by CNN did not hint at any violent crimes in Bullock's history. But they do shed light on some of his life, including speeding tickets, the fact he has at least three daughters, bankruptcy filings and the aforementioned cocaine arrest. He pleaded guilty to a controlled substance charge on the latter matter, leading to the probation. CNN's efforts on Friday to reach the lawyer who represented Bullock in this case were unsuccessful. Bullock's was a relatively low-level probation: It did not mean he should remain detained were he ever arrested on any charge, Lt. Steve Knight of the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office said. Humboldt County's chief probation officer, William Damiano, said Bullock's case never fell under his department, and as such Bullock didn't have to do things like check in regularly with a probation officer. The California Superior Court document outlining Bullock's probation specifies that he would be in violation if he was found to have ""any nonprescribed controlled substance."" But the guidelines specifically do not include things like prohibiting the violation of any ""criminal statutes;"" possession, custody or control of any alcohol; or ""aggressive or assaultive behavior toward any person."" These facts are relevant, given Bullock's interaction with authorities in the hours before Freed's death. According to Eureka police, the 43-year-old was ""acting strangely"" when he was picked up by county sheriff's deputies in Garberville. They took him to a jail where ""he was rejected due to his erratic behavior,"" then moved him to a nearby hospital ""where he became more agitated and had to be physically restrained by deputies,"" police added. Knight, from the sheriff's office, said Bullock was sent to a hospital because of a high heart rate. He was eventually booked into a jail shortly after 4:30 p.m. that day, staying there for more than eight hours before his release at 12:43 a.m. on January 1. Less than two hours later, police got a call about a suspicious person at St. Bernard Church. Officers found Bullock, but because he wasn't ""intoxicated and did not qualify for an emergency psychological hold,"" they didn't detain him. Instead, they referred him to a shelter, Mills said. Chief: Police want to know why slaying happened . At some point later, a guard at St. Bernard found a person matching Bullock's description on the premises and told him to leave, police said. Then came the devastating discovery of Freed's body. The slain priest's 2010 Nissan hybrid was gone. Bullock apparently drove 45 minutes from the parish to a family member's house in that car, police said. One of Bullock's relatives eventually tipped off police to his whereabouts, leading to his arrest midday Thursday, according to the Eureka police chief. ""There's no question in our mind he's responsible for this heinous act,"" Mills said, citing evidence recovered at the crime scene and interviews with witnesses that allegedly link Bullock to the priest's death. The chief added: ""To me, 'why' is the biggest thing that we would like to establish -- to bring a sense of ease and comfort to the community,"" Mills said. That community -- including members of St. Bernard Parish, students and staff at Humboldt State University where Freed taught, and residents throughout greater Eureka -- was still hurting Friday, as it tried to make sense of the violent death of the popular priest. ""Eric knew as well as anybody just how senseless violence could be,"" said William Herbrechtsmeier, a professor at Humboldt State. ""When a fine person like him is brought down -- that's just tragic."" Since 2007, Freed had taught about the New Testament at that public university, where he also had a leadership role in the Newman Center for Catholic students. He developed a reputation there for his warmth as much as his scholarly expertise, which made him popular on campus. ""Kind is the word that comes to mind, sensitive."" said professor Stephen Cunha, the chairman of Humboldt State University's religious studies department. ""... He was very much someone that you could sit down and speak with. ... He connected with everybody."" But his primary calling was as a priest. Freed had been part of California's Santa Rosa diocese since 1999, establishing himself as a ""great preacher"" and an engaging teacher from his work in Catholic schools, said Monsignor Daniel Whelton. John Chiv said he and other St. Bernard parishioners are shocked and angered by Freed's death, especially given how it happened. ""It's hard to feel Christian because ... it was brutal,"" Chiv said, adding that Freed was ""very jovial ... very accessible (and) very loving."" ""We lost a pastor, we lost a friend and, for many of us, he was like a father figure."" CNN's Dan Simon, Augie Martin, Ashley Fantz and Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","Murder suspect Bullock was on probation when he was arrested for public intoxication .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of people were being evacuated from their homes in Missouri after a levee was breached Monday night. Officials in St. Charles County near St. Louis activated warning sirens after the levee broke, a statement from the county said. Earlier Monday, a bridge connecting West Alton, Missouri, and Alton, Illinois, was shutdown after a temporary flood barricade gave way. Forecasters say there could be major flooding Tuesday. The Mississippi River at St. Louis was 10.1 feet above flood stage Monday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey website. Flood warnings and advisories were in effect from counties in northern Illinois down to Louisiana. As authorities dealt with rising water in Missouri and Illinois, officials in Oklahoma wrapped up another day of looking for people who remained missing after last week's tornadoes and heavy rain. The fate of the five missing people remains uncertain, officials said. Searchers found the body of an 8-year-old girl Monday afternoon, Oklahoma City Deputy Fire Chief Marc Woodard said. She drowned in the Deep Fork River. At least 18 people died in the storm, authorities said Monday. Among them were four people who died Saturday in separate drowning incidents, according to officials. Also killed were seven members of an extended family from Guatemala -- including four children -- who died when they were swept away by rains after hiding from the approaching weather in a storm drain. One woman remains missing. The flash flooding swept some bodies up to 5 miles downstream, Woodard said. The family grew panicked when they saw reports of tornadoes and sought shelter in the storm drain, a 7-foot drop from their property, which, in the end, was not hit by high winds. But suddenly the water in the drain rose quickly. The high, powerful water hurled them through the dark concrete tunnel. The brother of one of the women who died said, ""I have an emptiness in my heart because I've lost my sister."" Family and friends searched a muddy creek Monday looking for an eighth body. Other deaths came in wake of storm . In eastern Oklahoma County, a 65-year-old man on his way to work was killed early Saturday when he drove off a washed out bridge and drowned in a creek. Three others who died were storm chasers: Timothy Samaras, his son Paul and Carl Young. The damage wasn't confined to Oklahoma. In Missouri, a twister left more than 10 miles of significant damage ""that caused dozens and dozens of houses to be literally blown up,"" Gov. Jay Nixon told CNN affiliate KSDK. No one was killed in that tornado, but three people drowned in Missouri, Nixon said. And in Arkansas, flooding killed at least four people: a sheriff's deputy, a wildlife officer and two women they were trying to save from a deluged home. 'Memories just tossed about' But it was Oklahoma City and its surrounding areas that sustained most of the damage. The storm system mowed down power lines and uprooted trees, flipped big rigs on their sides and ripped off part of the terminal roof at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport, where some 1,500 area residents had taken shelter in a tunnel. The twisters tore open brick houses like cartons, sucking out their contents and tossing them out onto lawns. ""It's a sombering thing to think about life and to see all your memories just tossed about,"" Kris Merritt said as he surveyed the damage at his parents' house. ""Everything from your childhood on up."" Though Friday's tornadoes were not as strong as the EF-5 twister that killed 24 people on May 20, fear drove some people to flee in cars, ignoring warnings not to drive. Some drove on the wrong side of the highway. Interstates turned into parking lots. 'We were overwhelmed' Once the tornadoes passed, Oklahomans faced a new threat: floods. Eight to 11 inches of rain hosed Oklahoma City, stranding motorists and hitting apartments in low-lying areas of town hard. ""We saw flooding in areas that we don't see flooding,"" said police Lt. Jay Barnett. ""We were overwhelmed."" The National Weather Service said there was a possibility of severe storms in central Oklahoma on Tuesday night that could bring large hail, damaging wind and localized flooding.

"(CNN) -- A wave of deadly bombings struck Baghdad on Thursday in an already remarkably lethal week in Iraq, prompting a U.N. official to warn the mayhem is ""ready to explode"" into a wider conflict. And violence wasn't limited to Iraq's capital -- Anbar province's governor escaped the latest apparent attempt to assassinate him when bombs exploded Thursday near his convoy in Ramadi and injured four of his bodyguards, police said. In Baghdad, a car bomb exploded Thursday afternoon outside a university, and three car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded Thursday morning in four neighborhoods, killing at least 10 people and wounding 41 others, police said. The deaths come as political and sectarian violence rises across Iraq, much of it stemming from discord between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. Nearly 400 people have been killed in acts of violence in May, according to a CNN tally. And since Monday alone, at least 120 people have been killed. Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative to Iraq, expressed dismay at the recent violence and condemned the attack against the Anbar governor. He also warned the situation could worsen if leaders don't take action. ""Systemic violence is ready to explode at any moment if all Iraqi leaders do not engage immediately to pull the country out of this mayhem,"" Kobler said in Baghdad. Thursday's violence included the afternoon car bombing outside a university in southeastern Baghdad. At least two people were killed and eight others wounded in that blast, city police officials told CNN. No other details were immediately available. Iraqi security forces are on high alert and have established more checkpoints in and around the capital, causing massive traffic jams during rush hour. In central Ramadi, more than 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of Baghdad, Anbar Gov. Qassim Mohammed Abid was unharmed when car and roadside bombs exploded Thursday morning near his convoy, Ramadi police officials said. Abid has survived several assassination attempts over the years. He lost his left hand in a suicide attack in the predominantly Sunni province in 2009. Recent violence in Iraq comes amid rising Sunni-Shiite tensions. Since December, tens of thousands of Sunni demonstrators have taken to the streets across the country, protesting against the Shiite-led government. Sunni Arabs had more political clout in Iraq under Saddam Hussein until his ouster in 2003 after a U.S.-led invasion. Under the Shiite-led government in the post-Saddam era, Sunnis have felt marginalized.

"(CNN) -- Outrage over the possibility that a Van Gogh, Bruegel, or any other treasure at the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) could be sold to pay down the city's debts prompted a Michigan state senator to propose legislation to protect the masterpieces. Under the bill presented Wednesday by Sen. Randy Richardville, any art museum in the state must adhere to a code of ethics set forth by the American Alliance of Museums, which prohibits the sale of pieces unless the money is directed to improving the museum's collection. The DIA has a similar policy with the city, but the government's emergency manager has the power to cancel or modify it. The bill came about after Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr asked the DIA for an inventory list so that its 60,000 pieces could be appraised. The move sparked alarm among residents and museum administrators that the DIA's collection would be sold to settle the city's massive $15.8 billion debt. ""They basically let us know that the collection was not off the table,"" said museum director Graham Beal. Gov. Rick Snyder in March declared a financial emergency exists in Detroit and announced the appointment of Orr to get the city back on solid footing. Although Detroit owns the art displayed in the DIA, Richardville's bill would provide an extra layer of protection, so that if the city were to file for bankruptcy, none of its art could be sold to satisfy creditors. ""We're talking about cultural influence for the city of Detroit. It's a part of the community and part of what makes Detroit, Detroit,"" said Richardville. ""It shouldn't be sold for monetary use."" Bill Nowling, a spokesman for Orr, told CNN that any concern for the art being sold is premature and that the request for an inventory list is simply a precaution. ""There is no plan on the table to sell any asset of the city. The emergency manager continues to look at all options that will help solve the financial crisis the city faces,"" Nowling wrote in an e-mail. Nowling conceded that while the city has not made any plans to sell assets, ""it is possible that the city's creditors could demand the city use its assets to settle its debts."" Beal maintains that DIA's collection is among the top six in the Western Hemisphere. While he could not specify a value, Beal said it would likely be in the billions of dollars. To sell off its pieces would mean dismantling a collection that has set precedents in the United States, he contends. ""It would be a tragic irony -- the first U.S. museum to acquire a Van Gogh in 1922 and then 90 years later, we sell it? It's terrible."" The news that the DIA's collection may face dismantling prompted response from other museum directors across the country, including Thomas Campbell, director and CEO of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Even in the darkest days of New York City's economic woes, the ""cultural treasures closely identified with [New York] ... were never considered an asset that might be cashed in during a crunch,"" Campbell said in a statement. ""I am sure that many museum directors around the country would join me in condemning the Detroit emergency manager's consideration. Art for the public is not interim, fungible, or liquid,"" Campbell said. Detroit City Council President Charles Pugh is flatly against any such move, arguing that selling a masterpiece to pay bills does not address the city's long-term needs. ""If we sell art, it's a one-time fix. We sell that Van Gogh for $30 million, it's a one-time fix. We didn't fix the structural problem,"" said Pugh. Laura Bartell, a bankruptcy law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said she believes Orr is just doing his job and that it would be irresponsible for him not to consider what assets Detroit has and what they are worth. ""I don't think anyone argues that Detroit does not have the legal authority to sell something that Detroit owns. It's a question of whether Detroit will -- and if Detroit should,"" said Bartell. Gov. Snyder has been working with Orr to try to ward off the city's bankruptcy and the sale of the DIA's art. However, Snyder admitted that he is not legally empowered to declare the collection hands-off. Beal said he will do anything in his power to protect the art from any kind of depletion. ""We will defend. We will do everything we can to defend the integrity of this collection,"" he said. The DIA was founded in 1885 and houses more than 100 galleries, a lecture and recital hall, an art reference library, and a state-of-the-art conservation laboratory, according to the museum's website.

"(CNN) -- Throngs of revelers gathered around Times Square in New York City early Sunday to ring in the New Year amid cheers, glittering confetti and fireworks in one of many festivities worldwide. Crowds erupted in cheers, kissed and hugged as the giant ball dropped at midnight to mark the start of 2012. ""This is crazy, it's doggone warm,"" said Gary Grieco of College Point New York, who attended the unusually warm festivities this year. Grieco said he hopes this year is better than the last and outlined his resolutions for the New Year. ""Quit smoking, that's my promise ... today is the day,"" he said. iReport: NEW YEAR'S OPEN STORY . From London to Samoa, the world ushered in 2012 and said goodbye to a year marked by natural disasters, economic turmoil and other highlights such as the end of the Iraq war. ""Natural disasters were pretty brutal and the end of the Iraq war was long overdue,"" Grieco said. Fireworks lit up the sky over London's River Thames as the clock struck midnight -- one of many festivities worldwide. As Big Ben chimed on midnight, the sky exploded with pyrotechnics to mark the start of what Mayor Boris Johnson promised to be ""the most extraordinary and exciting year we are likely to see in our lifetime in this city."" In 2012, London will host the Summer Olympics and pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth's diamond jubilee marking her 60 years on the throne. England was relatively late to the party, which began 14 hours earlier (at 5 a.m. ET) in Samoa, Tokelau and the Christmas Islands in the western Pacific. Samoa and Tokelau -- historically the last to celebrate the new year -- reveled in being the first to party this time round, after skipping west across the international dateline, missing out on December 30 entirely in the process, in a move intended to boost trade. From there, the midnight revelry worked its way west. The final ones set to ring in the new year will also be in the Pacific, specifically on the U.S. Midway Islands and American Samoa. New Zealand bid farewell to a year that brought more than its share of natural disasters, with fireworks bursting through a blanket of fog to light up Auckland's Sky Tower. Dazzling pyrotechnics above Sydney Harbour got 2012 off to a spectacular start in Australia, with huge crowds gathered to watch. In South Korea, the Boshingak bell in downtown Seoul chimed 33 times to celebrate the occasion, while in Japan, many families ate a bowl of long noodles together to symbolize the bridge from one year to the next. Crowds of onlookers cheered as fireworks and bright lights flashed over Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour and boats filled with revelers drifted below. In Laos and Cambodia, Buddhist temples struck their gongs 108 times to cast out 108 types of human weakness. The atmosphere was far more subdued in Vatican, where the pope presided over a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. The celebrations then moved across Europe. Russia started by kicking off its new year in a grand way with fireworks over the Kremlin. Three hours later, much of the continent -- including Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Germany -- were officially in 2012, before England and Ireland finally joined in the next hour. Never known to shy away from a party, Brazilians in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and beyond celebrated the new year with characteristic flair and explosive pyrotechnics. They were followed one hour later by another large swath of South America that included Argentina, Paraguay and Chile.

"(CNN) -- A New York woman faces charges for faking cancer to solicit money from unsuspecting donors and a relative. For more than a year, 21-year-old Brittany Ozarowski falsely claimed she had cancer, defrauding donors of thousands of dollars to collect money for her drug habit, the Suffolk County District Attorney's office said. Ozarowski was arrested April 1 in front of a supermarket while soliciting shoppers for cash, holding a donation jar. She was arraigned in court Thursday on 24 counts of fraud and forgery. She pleaded not guilty. ""This is an emotionally disturbing case, but her crimes were non-violent ones. This should be taken into account when evaluating her case as a whole,"" Ozarowski's attorney, George H. Duncan, told CNN. According to authorities, Ozarowski falsely claimed that she had bone and brain cancer, stomach cancer, thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer. She claimed her daily medical expenses were $33,000, explaining to prospective donors that radiation treatments cost $1,000 per session at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Commack. ""This was a despicable scam,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said. ""There was no cancer, no chemotherapy, no radiation, and no medical bills. There was just heroin."" Ozarowski convinced many store owners in Nassau and Suffolk counties to allow her to place donor jars in their businesses, Spota said, and even created a PayPal account and a website with the banner, ""Brittany Ozarowski-Help Save My Life."" ""The truth is, she is a 21-year-old drug addict with four open narcotics cases, and we have strong evidence she forged doctors' notes to avoid court appearances,"" Spota said. Those cases include charges of possession of heroin and Oxycodone. A spokesperson for the District Attorney's office also said detectives discovered that Ozarowski's grandmother, Rosemarie Ozarowski, gave Brittany approximately $100,000 after selling her home to move to Florida. Authorities said Brittany Ozarowski defrauded many sympathetic online donors and store owners out of thousands of dollars. One donor told CNN that she grew suspicious of Ozarowski's claims and contacted authorities. ""I asked her, 'Why didn't you lose your hair?' "" Elizabeth Patricola, 52, owner of Paws N Claws, told CNN on Thursday. "" 'Brittany replied because they give her special vitamins.' My stomach dropped. I didn't feel right about any of those answers."" Paws N Claws was one of many businesses on Long Island that helped organize fundraisers for Ozarowski. Last September, the Paws N Claws fundraiser raised $3,000. Patricola donated another $1,000. ""I let my heart rule me. And she was extremely convincing and believable,"" Patricola said. Ozarowski is currently being held in the Suffolk County jail, with her bond set at $75,000 cash or $150,000 bond.","Brittany Ozarowski falsely claimed to have multiple cancers, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Elmore Leonard is something of a living legend among lovers of crime fiction. A favorite of millions of readers, a hero to scores of writers, he's been called ""America's greatest crime writer."" The 86-year old author has been writing bestselling books for sixty years, mostly Westerns and crime novels. Many of them have been turned into hit movies, including ""3:10 to Yuma,"" ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight."" Now, Leonard returns to one of his favorite characters in his newest book, his 45th novel to be exact, titled simply, ""Raylan."" That would be U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens. The laid back, Stetson-wearing lawman first appeared in Leonard's novels, ""Pronto"" and ""Riding the Rap"" and again in the 2001 short story, ""Fire in the Hole"" which became the basis for the hit TV show, ""Justified,"" starring Timothy Olyphant as the title character. The actor and the show are winning over fans, critics and Leonard himself. So much so that Leonard has returned to writing about ""Raylan."" The book just hit store shelves the same week the show had its third season premiere. Leonard, gracious and unassuming, shows no signs of slowing down at this point in his career. The author spoke to CNN from his home in Michigan. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What brought you back to Raylan? Leonard: I've always liked him. He's just one of my favorites. Now when I see him on the screen I can't believe it. He acts exactly the way I write him. He's so laid back and he always has the best line in the scene. He's perfect, boy. The way he talks I hear him just the way I heard him when I'm writing it. He's kind of laid back but if you call him on anything, he says, ""if I have to pull my gun I will shoot to kill,"" and he's serious about that but he doesn't have to sound that serious, he just states it. CNN: Raylan feels like a character from one of your Westerns transplanted into one of your crime novels. Leonard: He could have been and maybe that's where I got him. The critics see him as a western character because of his hat but his hat wasn't my idea, that was his (Olyphant's) idea. I pictured a businessman's Stetson, a much smaller cowboy hat if you will but one that's kind of worn out and shaped exactly the way he likes it. I think the hat works. I didn't care for it at first but after a couple of episodes I liked the hat. CNN: The writers on ""Justified"" all wear wristbands with the initials WWED stamped on them for ""What Would Elmore Do?"" What do you think about that? Leonard: Well, I'm flattered. I met all the writers and every one of them had the little plastic bracelet on. I have a picture of all them and they're at their desk and they all have a different book of mine and each one is reading to get my sound. That's very flattering, I'll tell you. CNN: Do you have an active role with the TV show beyond your inspiration? Leonard: No and I don't want to know what they're doing because I don't want to interfere with them. While I was writing ""Raylan"" I would send them pages and I said use what you want, if you don't use any of it OK but if it fits use it. They found some places to use some scenes where they're taking body parts from victims and selling them. They're going to do it one of the episodes this year so that's very gratifying. I like the way they write, boy. Sometimes I think the show is better than my writing. CNN: Millions love to read your books but who are you a fan of and what do you like to read? Leonard: One of my favorites is George V. Higgins who wrote, ""The Friends of Eddie Coyle."" Today I like reading Pete Dexter, Cormac McCarthy, Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Ron Hansen and Richard Bissell. He only wrote three or four books but he was a pilot on the Mississippi, piloting a string of barges up and down the river. The way he described his characters and the way they talked, I just loved him and he was funny. That's what I missed in Hemingway because he never showed any sense of humor. I don't know why he was so serious. I still read Hemingway. I still read his short stories because they're so good. He doesn't waste any words. CNN: You've been writing professionally for sixty years, where do you find your inspiration? Leonard: It's what I do. If I just sit here what am I going to do? I don't have a trade. I don't teach or anything. I just love to make up characters and gradually build a story around them. There was a photograph in the newspaper of two marshals in front of a courthouse in Miami where some drug dealers were being tried and the woman marshal had a shotgun on her hip, the stock against her hip and the rest of it angled up away from her and she was really good looking. I thought she's a book, she's going to be in my next book and she was. That was Karen Sisco, ""Out of Sight."" CNN: Sounds like you still have lot of enthusiasm for your work? Leonard: Absolutely, that's it. To me writing is the most fun. It's not always fun but finally when you make it come out the way you want it then you can say its fun, boy. Even writing a scene I'll enjoy a particular scene and then several years later I'll happen to read that scene again, not looking for it, I'll just happen to open an older book and read and think oh my god and start laughing. I didn't laugh when I wrote it maybe I smiled, I don't know. I was startled by the scene; I thought why'd I think of that? Why did I put that in there but it seemed to work. CNN: Your stories read so easily, how did you develop your style? Leonard: It's got to be re-writing. It takes me at least three handwritten pages to get one clean, typed page with every word in place. The next morning I'll read these pages again and I'll start to make little changes, not much usually I'll just add things. The first time I write it's more spare then when I finally get into it, just add a word maybe add a cigarette or a drink or something like that. I don't want it to sound like writing. I say leave out the parts people tend to skip. Just don't overwrite. CNN: What's next for you? Leonard: I'm writing a book right now but I'm only a chapter into it. I'm still thinking of names. For a couple of months I've been thinking of the bad guy's name. I don't know why I can't get it but I will. I do this a lot with names. I'll start with a name and then for some reason he won't talk much or he's older than I pictured him just because of a name I give him. So then I finally get the right name and I can't shut the guy up. This always happens. There's always a character who gives me trouble that way.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Militants blew up a major oil pipeline in Yemen on Saturday, three senior government officials said. The attack halted oil production, and crews worked to fix the line, which links the Masila oilfield to port the port town of Shihr. The militants planted explosive devices under the pipe in the Urf Valley of the southern Hadramout province. Yemen crude oil exports are the mainstay of the impoverished country's economy, and halts in production pose a serious threat to stability. The vandalized pipeline transports more than 100,000 barrels per day. Yemen oil infrastructures have increasingly been the targets of attacks over the last year. ""Lost oil production due to pipeline attacks cost the government more than $1 billion in 2012, and cost the government even more in 2013,"" an Oil Ministry official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. The Yemeni Prime Minister's office said that the government has for months carefully guarded its pipelines, fearing that terror or tribal groups could attempt to damage country's economy by vandalizing them. Security experts have warned that the government's inability to preserve state infrastructures may lead to a vote of no confidence and potentially to political instability. ""The more attacks on oil pipelines, the less of a chance Yemen has to recover from its economic woes,"" said AbdulSalam Mohammed, President of the Sanaa based Abaad Research Center. ""This is something Yemen cannot possibly afford given the size of its state deficit.""","The pipeline attack halted oil production, and crews worked to fix it .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG LIve's lawyer asked a jury to find Michael Jackson responsible for his death, not the concert promoter. Attorney Marvin Putnam spent four hours Wednesday deliver his closing arguments in the trial of the wrongful death lawsuit brought by Jackson's mother and three children. ""Plaintiffs want you to hold a concert promoter liable for Michael Jackson's overdose in his bedroom at night, behind locked doors on June 25, 2009,"" Putnam told jurors. ""An overdose of the drug administered to Mr. Jackson by his longtime doctor -- Dr. Murray -- who he'd been seeing for years, a doctor he brought to Los Angeles from Las Vegas."" When the trial began five months ago, Putnam warned he would show ""ugly stuff"" and reveal Jackson's ""deepest, darkest secret."" The revelations that jurors heard from 58 witnesses over 83 days of testimony spanning 21 weeks included details of Jackson's drug use and his shopping for a doctor to give him the surgical anesthetic propofol that he thought would give him sleep. ""He was nearly half a billion dollars in debt,"" Putnam argued Wednesday. ""His mother's house was near foreclosure, we didn't know that then. What else do we know now? That Mr. Jackson spent decades shopping for doctors to give him the painkillers he wanted. Mr. Jackson made sure we didn't know that."" Brian Panish, the lead lawyer for Jackson's mother and three children, conceded in his closing Tuesday that the singer may have some fault for his own death, but said ""it's about shared responsibility."" Jackson did use prescription painkillers and was warned that using propofol at home to sleep was risky, ""but he never had a problem until Dr. Conrad Murray was working and until Conrad Murray negotiated with AEG Live,"" Panish argued. The AEG Live lawyer, Putnam, argued Wednesday that Jackson should take the full blame. ""The sad truth is Mr. Jackson's death was caused by his choices and it would have happened no matter what -- with or without AEG Live."" The Jackson family lawyer urged jurors to award the family between $1 billion and $2 billion in damages for its share of liability in Jackson's death -- to replace what he would have earned touring, had he lived, and for the personal suffering from the loss of a son and father. Putnam told jurors Wednesday that was ""an absurd number."" Katherine Jackson testified that she filed the wrongful death lawsuit three years ago against AEG Live ""because I want to know what really happened to my son."" Her lawyers argue that the company is liable in the death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's propofol overdose death. Jackson's lawyer will have another two hours Thursday morning to sum up his arguments in rebuttal. Twelve jurors, who have sat and listened in a Los Angeles courtroom for 21 weeks, will then begin deliberations. The judge is allowing a television camera in court for the closing arguments and verdict. Who's to blame for Michael Jackson's death? AEG Live's defense . Murray treated Michael Jackson and his children for minor illnesses while they lived in Las Vegas for three years, before the singer returned to Los Angeles to prepare for his ""This Is It"" comeback tour. It was Jackson -- not AEG Live executives -- who chose Murray to be his full-time doctor for his tour, the company's lawyers contend. AEG Live Co-CEO Paul Gongaware negotiated to pay Murray $150,000 a month only because of Jackson's request to have his doctor with him as he performed 50 shows at London's O2 Arena, they argue. ""He told them 'We're bringing this doctor,' "" Putnam said. ""This was a choice Mr. Jackson made, he was a grown man."" AEG Live executives tried to talk Jackson out of taking an American doctor with him on tour, suggesting he could save money by using a physician in London, Putnam said. ""But Mr. Jackson was undeterred,"" he said. ""Ultimately, it was his money, his doctor, his choice. He certainly wasn't going to take 'no' for an answer."" There was no need to check Murray's background because he was a licensed, successful doctor who was known to Jackson, Putnam said. ""All AEG Live knew was Dr. Murray was Mr. Jackson's longtime doctor."" A key argument in the Jackson case is that AEG Live was negligent by not ordering a financial background check of Murray, which would have revealed he was in a dire financial situation and not successful. His desperation to keep his lucrative job led Murray to violate his Hippocratic Oath to do no harm by using the dangerous propofol infusions to put Jackson to sleep each night for two months, Jackson lawyers argue. AEG Live executives had no way of knowing Murray was treating Jackson's insomnia with propofol in the privacy of his bedroom, their lawyers contend. Jackson was a secretive addict, adept at keeping family, friends and other doctors in the dark about his medical treatments, they argue. But two doctors testified that they told Gongaware about Jackson's abuse of painkillers and his insomnia during tours in the 1990s, when the AEG Live executive served as tour manager. Jackson lawyers argue Gongaware, who was the top producer on the new tour, should have known that Jackson could suffer the same problems in 2009. The deterioration of Jackson's health over the two months he was being treated by Murray was a red flag that there was a problem, but AEG Live executives negligently ignored the warning, Jackson lawyers argue. By June 19, he was frail, suffering chills, unable to do his trademark dances and paranoid, according to testimony. ""Everyone believed at the time that a 50-year-old man, who hadn't performed in a decade was tired, out of shape and very nervous,"" Putnam argued Wednesday. ""That's what they believed at the time and it makes sense."" AEG Live can avoid a negative verdict if is able able to convince at least 4 of 12 jurors that it did not hire Murray. It is the first of 16 questions on the jury verdict form. If jurors answer it with a ""no"" -- that AEG Live did not hire the doctor -- they would end their deliberations and the trial. An AEG Live lawyer e-mailed an employment contract to Murray on the morning of June 24, 2009. Murray signed it and faxed it back to the company that day. But the signature line for AEG Live's CEO and Michael Jackson were never signed since Jackson died the next day. Putnam will point to those blank signature lines as evidence that Murray was never hired by his client. There were negotiations with Murray, but he was never paid, the AEG Live lawyer argues. Panish, the lead Jackson lawyer, told jurors Tuesday that all the elements of an oral contract -- ""just as valid as a written contract"" -- were in place when Jackson died. Murray had been treating Jackson for two months and the written contract stated that his start day was May 1, 2009. A series of e-mail exchanges involving Murray and AEG Live executives and lawyers supported his argument, Panish said. A look at the life of Michael Jackson . Blame and damages . If the jury concludes AEG Live has liability, it would have to decide how much the company should pay in economic and personal damages to Jackson's mother and children. They can use estimates of Jackson's ""lost earnings capacity"" -- the amount of money he could reasonably be expected to have earned if he had lived -- to guide them. AEG Live expert Eric Briggs testified it was ""speculative"" that Jackson would have even completed another tour because of his drug use, damaged reputation and history of failed projects. He suggested the star may never have earned another dime. Putnam's closing argument about damages must overcome the impression left on jurors Tuesday when Panish played a video montage of Jackson performances. ""That is, I think, the best evidence of if Michael Jackson could have sold tickets -- not what Mr. Briggs would tell you,"" Panish told jurors. Panish suggested jurors pick a number between $900 million and $1.6 billion for economic damages. They should add on another $290 million for non-economic damages -- or personal damages, he said. Putnam argued that the number, if the jury finds AEG Live liable, should be closer to $21 million, the amount of money AEG Live's expert calculated Jackson would have given his mother and three children over the next 16 years. He couldn't have given them more because he was had a $400 million debt that ws getting deeper, he said. ""If Mr. Jackson had lived, it's hard to see how he would ever have dug himself out of that whole,"" Putnam said. The last question on the verdict form asks jurors to assign a percentage that they believe represents Michael Jackson's share of blame in his death. The total damages owed by AEG Live would be reduced by that percentage. Panish will have two hours to rebut Putnam's arguments before jury deliberations begin later Thursday.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A prison riot Wednesday in the troubled Mexican border town of Juarez left 20 dead and 15 wounded, an official said. Mexican federal police patrol Monday on the streets of Ciudad Juarez, a major battleground for drug cartels. None of the dead were police or military officials, said Enrique Torres, a spokesman for the joint operation at the Cereso Estatal de Ciudad Juarez prison. Authorities called in 200 federal police agents and 50 army soldiers to help put down the riot; two helicopters and an airplane also were employed, he said. Victor Valencia de los Santos, spokesman for the state government of Chihuahua, told El Universal newspaper the fighting began when rival gangs clashed at the end of conjugal visits. El Universal identified the gangs as ""Los Artistas Asesinos,"" or the Assassin Artists, and the Aztecas drug gang. Police official Carlos Gonzalez told El Universal the fight was over control within the prison. The high-security prison houses many of the nation's most dangerous drug traffickers. The uprising started at 7 a.m. local time and was quelled two hours later, El Universal said. The prison is located in a semi-desert area 17 miles (28 kilometers) south of Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas. Juarez is one of the major battlegrounds as drug cartels fight each other and Mexican authorities. ""The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern,"" the U.S. State Department said in a travel warning issued February 20. ""Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city since January 2008.

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN)  -- Francois Ponchaud was a newly ordained Catholic priest when he arrived in Cambodia in 1965 from a small village in France. Francois Ponchaud said refugees' accounts of the genocide ""went beyond my wildest imagination."" He was sent to do missionary work. But within a decade he would become a crusader against the worst genocide since the Holocaust. ""I was staying by the Cambodian people's side,"" Ponchaud said, ""through the good and the sadness and the suffering."" When he arrived at age 26, Cambodia was a peaceful place: a bucolic land of villages, peasants, rice paddies and Buddhist monks. Ponchaud studied Cambodian history and Buddhism, became fluent in Khmer, made friends and immersed himself in the culture -- falling in love with the country and its people. But the peacefulness was short-lived. By 1970, Cambodia was descending into chaos as the Vietnam War spilled across its borders. In the countryside, the Americans were carpet-bombing Vietcong outposts. In the capital, Phnom Penh, Washington was propping up a corrupt government. From the jungles, a sinister and brutal communist rebel group called the Khmer Rouge was fighting to overthrow Cambodia's U.S.-backed regime. On April 17, 1975, Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. They began to reinvent Cambodia according to an insane blueprint. They emptied the cities, including some 3 million in the capital, forcing all the residents into the countryside -- and toward a dark future. ""As of noon, all the people started leaving,"" Ponchaud said. ""Then I saw all my friends who were leaving. ... There were hundreds of thousands of people who were trudging along a few kilometers an hour. It was truly a staggering sight. Incredible.""  Watch Ponchaud describe the exodus from Phnom Penh » . Ponchaud was told to stay at the French Embassy, where thousands fleeing Phnom Penh desperately sought asylum. One of the few foreigners able to communicate with the Khmer Rouge, he spent days at the embassy gate, trying to negotiate.  Watch Ponchaud discuss the significance of the embassy gate » . In the weeks that followed, the Khmer Rouge let him leave the embassy twice. Both times he searched for clues about what was happening in the country. But Phnom Penh was empty.  Read a reporter's notebook of his journey through Cambodia's killing fields » . Ponchaud was expelled from the city in the last evacuating convoy, as the Khmer Rouge forced all foreigners onto trucks and out of the country. At the border, Ponchaud broke down, weeping. ""It was as though we had gone mad,"" he said. ""We were getting out of a country of the living dead."" With the country sealed, the Khmer Rouge went about creating their new Cambodia -- and the killing began in earnest. The Khmer Rouge envisioned a return to Cambodia's medieval greatness -- a ""pure"" nation full of noble peasant farmers. For that, though, they had to purge everyone else: the rich, the religious, the educated, anyone from a different ethnic group. ""All those who were opposed to the government were killed,"" Ponchaud said. ""And all those who didn't work quite hard enough were killed."" Hundreds of thousands were worked -- or starved -- to death. ""Perhaps a good chunk -- a solid half -- died from sickness and lack of health care,"" he said. By September 1975, Ponchaud was back in France and ready to resume his work. His missionary society in Paris asked him to keep track of events in Cambodia. He quickly became the ""go-to"" person for Cambodian refugees arriving from Thailand, and he began documenting their stories. At first, Ponchaud had a hard time believing the accounts of execution, torture, deportation, forced labor and starvation. Read how a Khmer Rouge survivor is documenting the genocide . ""They were burning villages ... sending people into the forest without giving them anything to eat,"" Ponchaud said. ""It went beyond my wildest imagination."" Horrified, Ponchaud devised a plan to gather more information: A friend living on the Cambodian border would record and send him broadcasts from Radio Phnom Penh -- the official voice of the Khmer Rouge -- in which the government described its transformation of the country. Read a former Khmer Rouge member's account of the killings . Ponchaud found that the broadcasts substantiated the refugees' claims. As unbelievable as those claims were, the broadcasts told of the same policies. What the refugees were saying was true. ""I decoded the radio -- the official declarations. And then the refugees would give me the 'experienced' side. It matched up,"" he said. ""On one hand, the ideology, and on the other, the lived experience.""   Watch Ponchaud describe how he was able to decode the Khmer Rouge ideology » . For months, Ponchaud gathered and documented information, repeatedly denouncing the Khmer Rouge. His testimonials appeared in the French press as early as October 1975. He also wrote to the president of France and Amnesty International, and appeared before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.  Watch Ponchaud discuss his efforts to alert people to the genocide » . In 1976, angered by inaccuracies in Le Monde's reporting on the Khmer Rouge, Ponchaud fired off a letter to the newspaper's editor -- along with a dossier of refugee accounts and radio transmissions. He was contacted immediately and asked to write for the newspaper. His articles were published in February 1976.  Watch Ponchaud tell the Le Monde story » . Though few accounts of Cambodia's nightmare were appearing in the press, the U.S. government was receiving frequent briefings about what was happening there. In a meeting in November 1975, then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger acknowledged the brutality of the Khmer Rouge. But he also knew that they shared an enemy with the U.S. -- Vietnam. ""Tell the Cambodians that we will be friends with them,"" Kissinger told an official in the region, according to a declassified State Department account. The Khmer Rouge ""are murderous thugs,"" he said, ""but we won't let that stand in our way."" Read Kissinger's words in the declassified State Department document (pdf) By 1977, the Khmer Rouge had been in power for two years, and much of the world remained unaware or uninterested. Many who did hear accounts of Khmer Rouge brutality found them hard to believe. Even prominent liberals and intellectuals doubted that a supposedly egalitarian peasant movement would perpetrate such horrors on their own people. Ponchaud then published a startling book called ""Year Zero."" It was one of the first to expose the brutal totalitarian regime of the Khmer Rouge to the world. Still, no help came for Cambodia. ""I was pretty frustrated,"" he said. ""The governments did not react. You know, countries don't defend human rights. They are always subservient to politics."" In January 1977, the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter promised a change. Carter vowed to put human rights at the center of U.S. foreign policy. But it would take 15 months for him to publicly condemn the Khmer Rouge as the world's ""worst violator of human rights."" Even then he took no action to stop the slaughter. Invasion, he said, was not an option for a country still recovering from the Vietnam War. Instead, in December 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia after years of cross-border skirmishes. The Vietnamese quickly overthrew the Khmer Rouge, who fled back into the jungle. The world would finally start to see that all Ponchaud had said was true. More than 2 million Cambodians were dead. The scope of the catastrophe quickly became clear. In the fall of 1979, Carter responded, raising $32 million to help the refugees. Today, Ponchaud is back in Cambodia, continuing his efforts for the Cambodian people, building schools, holding Mass and working on local projects. Often referred to as ""the friend of the Cambodians,"" he is considered an expert on the country. But this time he has no illusions. ""No one defends human rights,"" he said. ""Governments are cold beasts looking out for their own interests.""","Francois Ponchaud was sent to do missionary work in Cambodia in 1965 .

"(CNN) -- Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, better known as Lady Gaga, remembers when she was bullied in high school. She returned from gym class and discovered profanity scrawled across her locker. ""It sticks with you and it hurts. And I went home and cried. I didn't want to go to school,"" she said. Her story isn't unique. On any given day, 160,000 students opt to stay home because they are afraid of being bullied. Today, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Lady Gaga is officially launching her Born This Way Foundation, which will inspire bravery and kindness in young people. As one of the best-selling recording artists of all time, Lady Gaga has repeatedly encouraged her fans to ""be someone that nurtures."" With her new foundation, she is poised to do much more. Bullying is pervasive in and out of school. Each year, 20% of high school students report being bullied -- physically, emotionally, or socially. The results can be tragic, as the recent suicides of Phoebe Prince, Jamey Rodemeyer and Carl Joseph Walker-Hoover have taught us. Victims seldom report bullying incidents to their parents or their teachers because they are embarrassed, fear retaliation, worry that adults will make things worse, or resigned to the belief that nothing can be done. The humiliation of being bullied can haunt people their entire lives. As Secretary of Education Arne Duncan put it, ""Bullying is insidious, it tends to get enveloped in a code of silence and shame."" Contrary to conventional views, bullying is not simply a result of troubled kids or peer pressure. The stark reality is that bullying has deep roots in adult behaviors and attitudes. What would you do if you witnessed three high school students berating another student for being smart, gay, learning disabled, quiet or just different? Research has demonstrated that most of us would do nothing. We tend to be bystanders because we believe bullying is just kids being kids or we may not know how to intervene effectively. Our failure to act has large costs to our communities. When adults are bystanders, they inadvertently reinforce the bad behaviors of bullies and the passivity of students. However, bullying goes down when students stand up for victims. Bullying is not a rite of passage -- it is a human rights issue. Fortunately for kids everywhere, bullying is not an intractable problem. There are a number of ways to combat bullying. We can start by giving educators important tools. Teacher education programs typically do not include techniques on how to create a caring and safe environment in the classroom or strategies on how to handle peer conflicts. These programs often fail to provide basic knowledge of child development in the curriculum. This has to change. At the same time, educators can utilize proven anti-bullying programs. For example, the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program has resulted in a 50% decrease in bullying behavior in Norway. In addition, educators can play their part by breaking down the high wall that often separates the cultures of adults and students. When adults are able to gain the trust and respect of the students, they have more credibility in resolving conflicts. Strong teacher-student relationships have numerous academic, emotional, social and moral benefits for students. Students should be enlisted in prevention efforts. They tend to be a lot smarter about their social environment than adults, and they are far more likely to adhere to community standards if they are involved in creating and monitoring those standards. Finally, it is up to the adults in all communities to step up. Nothing short of a full-blown media campaign is required to change people's attitudes and behaviors. This kind of social movement is not without precedence. The best example is the designated driver campaign, which saved at least 50,000 lives in the United States alone. Imagine a world in which adults and children view bullying to be just as stupid and dangerous as drunk driving, and know how to stop it in its tracks. People will need guidelines on how to confront bullies, when to ask a target if he or she is OK, how to enlist the help of others, and when to call 911. We can provide adults and children with the skills and confidence to act when they encounter bullying at bus stops, on playgrounds or online. We are at a moment of great opportunity. In 2010, the Department of Education hosted the first summit on bullying prevention, and 48 states have now enacted anti-bullying legislation. Many schools and districts are working to create more caring communities. And Lady Gaga is speaking loud and clear at Harvard. Let's not let this moment pass. Let's translate this energy into concrete actions that will not only prevent bullying, but also help adults raise children who care about a more just and kind world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen McCartney and Richard Weissbourd.","Lady Gaga is officially launching a foundation to inspire kids to be kind and brave .

"CHOEUNG EK, Cambodia (CNN) -- More than 30 years after the genocide, the killing fields still cover Cambodia. Him Huy: ""As soon as I got there, I felt that something was wrong."" Across the country, 20,000 mass graves stand as silent witnesses to the horrors that took the lives of more than 2 million Cambodians. During the rule of the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia's lush countryside was transformed by slave labor, starvation, fear and execution. Him Huy saw it all firsthand -- as a member of the Khmer Rouge. In 1976, he was part of a military group, he said, and was ultimately assigned to work at the notorious prison at Tuol Sleng. ""As soon as I got there, I felt that something was wrong,"" he said. ""This place kills generations. We all had a sense of what was going on. I knew this place would be full of death."" Once a high school in the middle of Cambodia's bustling capital city, Tuol Sleng was transformed by the Khmer Rouge into a prison and torture center. In the hallways and classrooms, claustrophobic, rough-hewn cells and interrogation rooms were built to keep prisoners. Other prisoners were held for days and weeks at a time, packed in larger rooms and forced to lay motionless on the floor side by side. At Tuol Sleng, so-called ""political prisoners"" were interrogated, beaten, tortured and forced to confess. The barbaric rules for prisoners were posted on the wall, and instructed them, among other things, that ""while getting lashes or electrification, you must not cry at all.""  Watch the rules for prisoners at Tuol Sleng » . During the reign of the Khmer Rouge, almost 15,000 men, women and children were brought to Tuol Sleng. Only seven survived. The rest were executed and buried at the killing fields at Choeung Ek. Him Huy says he was in charge of receiving prisoners, both at Tuol Sleng and when they arrived at Choeung Ek. Some workers transported prisoners to the killing fields. Then, Huy says, they ""opened the car door and gathered some cloth to tie the prisoners. Then they were led one by one into [a] house. After all the prisoners were led in, a group of us helped to guard and lead the prisoners to the ditches, where another group were waiting to kill the prisoners."" Him Huy says he was occasionally forced to hit prisoners at the graveside before others came to slit their throats and finish the job.  Watch Him Huy demonstrate what he did at Choeung Ek » . Some witnesses accuse Him Huy of taking an active role in the horrors at Tuol Sleng, including executing prisoners and separating infants and children from their mothers and sending them to slaughter. Him Huy said he was only doing what he was forced to do. ""We did not do this on our own. The Khmer Rouge brought us here, and we knew nothing. And once you got here you cannot leave. The tasks were assigned and told and done. So if someone was assigned to spy, they spied; if they were assigned to guard, they guarded."" Him Huy said no one dared resist. ""During that time, you do what you can to survive. If you don't do what they say, you die.""","Him Huy was a member of the Khmer Rouge, assigned to work at Tuol Sleng .

"(CNN) -- Turkey and Japan have agreed to a $22 billion deal to build a nuclear power plant in Turkey, the semi-official Turkish news agency Anadolu reported. The deal, signed Friday, represents a step toward recovery for Japan's nuclear industry, left reeling by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that triggered a disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking at a joint news conference, said the deal would place relations between the two nations on a different level. Japanese and French companies lead the consortium which will deliver the contract signed by the two governments. The third-generation ATMEA1 reactor will be built in Turkey's northern Sinop province, which borders the Black Sea, said GDF SUEZ, part of the consortium. Erdogan said lessons had been learned from the Fukushima disaster, the worst nuclear accident in a generation. ""After the Fukushima incident, people said negative things about Japanese technology,"" Erdogan said, quoted by Anadolu. But, he said, in response to that criticism he drew a parallel with what happens after an air crash. ""We should consider there is a risk of accident, but we need that technology. With an advanced technology we will take better steps."" Turkey, like Japan, is in an active earthquake zone. The two prime ministers said they hoped it would take less than a decade to complete the project. The two countries have also agreed to found a Turkish-Japanese Technical University in Turkey, Anadolu reported, with plans to follow up with a Japan-based counterpart in the future. ""A step like this between Turkey and Japan is really important,"" said Erdogan. The tsunami that hit Fukushima Daiichi after Japan's historic earthquake knocked out power and coolant systems at the plant, resulting in meltdowns in three reactors. The result was the most serious nuclear accident since Chernobyl, as the crippled reactors spewed enormous amounts of radioactive particles into the environment. CNN's Bharati Naik and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Japan and Turkey agree a $22 billion contract for a nuclear reactor .

"(CNN) -- Hugo Chavez was known to break out into song during his long-winding speeches, and fittingly, traditional Venezuelan llanera music filled the space where his funeral was held. Chavez, who died Tuesday at age 58, was a polarizing figure in his country. But his followers revered him, and his funeral Friday in Caracas reflected that status. There were 32 heads of state in attendance, and all of them were called, in groups of eight, to flank the Venezuelan president's casket and observe a moment of silence as honor guards. Venezuelan standouts in the arts and sports likewise surrounded the deceased leader. Chavez left behind a mixed legacy: He is credited with putting the nation's poor at the center of his policies, but also had an authoritarian streak that garnered criticism from defenders of human rights and press freedom. The turnout of foreign leaders and thousands of mourners who waited hours for a chance to view Chavez is a testament to the role he played in the country, the Rev. Mario Moronta said. Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who will be sworn in as interim president later Friday, laid a replica of the sword that South American hero Simon Bolivar used on top of Chavez's flag-draped casket. Tributes to Chavez were also paid in Cuba, where the military made a 21-gun salute from the La Cabana Fortress overlooking Havana. Military officers placed roses in front of a picture of Chavez. Venezuela and Cuba maintain close military ties, and Cuba sent hundreds of military and intelligence advisers to aid Chavez while he was president. Chavez was known for his anti-American rhetoric and allied himself with others at odds with the United States. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended and kissed Chavez's casket. ""He was a dear friend of all nations worldwide,"" Ahmadinejad had said upon his arrival in Venezuela. ""He was the emotional pillar for all the revolutionary and freedom-seeking people of the region and the world."" The United States, which doesn't have an ambassador in Venezuela, was represented at the funeral by the charge d'affaires at its embassy in Caracas, James Derham. U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-New York, and former lawmaker William Delahunt of Massachusetts made up the rest of the U.S. delegation. Hollywood actor and Chavez friend Sean Penn was at the funeral, as was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who offered a prayer. ""Hugo fed the hungry. He lifted the poor. He raised their hopes. He helped them realize their dreams,"" Jackson said. Hero or villain? The many ways to see Chavez . Maduro, who Chavez had named as his preferred successor before his death, gave a lengthy, impassioned speech that made him emotional at times. He addressed the view of Chavez as an autocrat and inept leader who left Venezuela worse off than when he assumed power. ""Never has a man, here or anywhere, been lied about so much,"" he said. Chavez was a ""true son of Christ"" who taught the country love and forgiveness, Maduro said. ""That's why today we say from our hearts, we forgive those who have defamed you."" Chavez had asked Maduro and other top leaders what they would do when he died, the vice president said. ""He arranged it all for us, and now it is up to us whether we will carry it out or not,"" he said. There was no burial after the funeral, because of an unexpected twist that Maduro announced Thursday. Chavez will be embalmed ""just like Lenin (and) Mao Zedong"" and laid to rest at a military museum where generations of Venezuelans can visit. It is a reminder that Chavez's image will not soon fade. ""The body of our leader will be embalmed, and it will ... be surrounded by crystal glass forever, present forever, and always with his people,"" he said on state-run TV. Opinion: Chavez was a maker of dreams . Chavez died after a long battle with cancer. Thousands of his supporters lined the streets Wednesday in a procession from the military hospital where he died to a military academy where Venezuelans could view him. As president, Chavez cultivated an image as a protector of the country's marginalized, and his followers worshiped him with fervor. The turnout at the military academy to view Chavez was so great that the viewing was extended for another seven days. Opinion: Chavez used force of personality to win votes . Chavez first announced his cancer diagnosis in June 2011, but the government never revealed details about his prognosis or specified what kind of cancer he had. CNN's Patrick Oppmann, Karen Smith and Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","NEW: Funeral includes traditional music, honor guards .

"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN)  -- Youk Chhang knows the truth about the Cambodian genocide perhaps better than anyone in the world. Youk Chhang runs the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has documented 20,000 mass graves. He was 13 when the Khmer Rouge came to power. Separated from his family, forced into slave labor, beaten nearly to death for stealing rice for his pregnant sister, he saw the horrors firsthand. His mother lost a daughter and four siblings; 30 years later she still searches for them, hoping they survived. Chhang survived by eating whatever he could find. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, it took him months to walk home to his family. Eventually, he fled to safety in the United States. ""Food was ... more important than God,"" Chhang said. ""I always wish to have a bowl of rice. And one good night's sleep. That's all I wanted. I would do anything for it.""  Watch Youk Chhang talk about what he ate, how he survived » . But the ghosts of the genocide brought Chhang back to Cambodia. And for more than a decade, he has run the Documentation Center of Cambodia. ""DC-Cam,"" as it is known, is the world's largest repository of information about the Cambodian genocide. It holds hundreds of thousands of documents, photos and films as well as interviews with both survivors and former Khmer Rouge members. Chhang said he believes the Khmer Rouge kept such careful records as a measure of their success -- a trophy of sorts. ""At each time when they kill a person, they document it so that they can measure their success one step forward,"" Chhang said. ""If they kill two, then two step forward. If they kill five, then five step forward. So to them, it's a golden file. But I mean, to us it's crime against humanity."" DC-Cam has located and mapped nearly 200 prisons and 20,000 mass graves across the country. For Chhang and DC-Cam, the work is critical to preserving memory and promoting justice.  Watch as Chhang takes CNN's Christiane Amanpour into DC-Cam's secured vault » . Today in Cambodia, a tribunal is under way to try five of the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge -- 30 years after their alleged crimes. DC-Cam is providing much of the evidence for use in the trial, evidence that makes plain the facts of the genocide, the scope of the losses and the personal and national grief. Chhang said he hopes the tribunal will help Cambodians move forward -- and help heal the nation he loves. But even now, the way forward is difficult. Chhang has dedicated a lifetime of work, research, preservation and advocacy to his mother, whose bravery and sacrifice inspired him. Even though his mother survived and they shared much of the same pain and many of the same losses, the two do not talk about what happened. Some in Cambodia are anxious to forget and forgive. Others are angry and searching for justice. Many, like Chhang, said that only by knowing, exploring and exposing the truth will Cambodia be able to rectify its past -- and secure a healthy future.","Youk Chhang was 13 when the Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia .

"(CNN) -- There are seemingly millions of smartphone apps out there designed to make traveling easier, but not all of them are very good. Every company seems to think that it needs an app to be cool, but not every app is worth the effort. Here are some of the apps that I find to be most helpful while on the road: . FlightAware . I'm one of those guys who always thinks that more information is better, and that's why I like FlightAware. You can see exactly where your flight (or any other flight) is at the moment. I've used the FlightAware website for years to see near real-time flight tracking, and now there's an app as well. Were you told your airplane is coming from Wichita, but it's still not there and you should be boarding? Go to FlightAware to see where the airplane is right now. FlightAware is hardly the only one in this space. Other frequent fliers swear by FlightTrack Pro, for example. GateGuru . When I was in Atlanta recently, my wife was looking for something before our next flight. Trying to find the right store in an airport the size of Hartsfield-Jackson is a mind-numbing experience. GateGuru, however, gives the rundown on which stores and restaurants are in each terminal and it pulls in reviews as well. If you're in an airport looking for a particular product or service, this will make your task much easier. Hotel Tonight . Have you ever been somewhere and realized you needed a room for the night? Maybe your flight was canceled or perhaps your meetings ran long. This company negotiates deals with hotels for last-minute rooms in many big cities. Within seconds, you can have the room reserved for a low rate. Taxi Magic . If you don't know a city well, the taxi scene can be confusing. Where is the best place to hail a cab? How much should you pay? Taxi Magic makes it a lot easier. If there's a participating cab company in your city, Taxi Magic will have a cab sent right to you. You can pay directly through the app so you don't have to worry about whether credit is accepted or not. The app and booking services are free, and there's a $1.50 documentation fee for using a credit card through the app. If there isn't a participating cab company in the area, Taxi Magic will give you phone numbers for local companies so you can call and arrange for a cab yourself. TripIt . If you've ever used TripIt online to manage your travel, you know it's a great tool for keeping all your travel plans in one place. Of course, there's also an app for that. See and manage all your travel plans in the TripIt app so you never lose your details. Beyond the basics of flights, hotels and cars, you can also put in things like appointments and meals. Your airline app . This isn't one app; it's dependent upon which airline you fly. If you fly a different airline every time, then it's probably not worth downloading every single airline app. But if you're a loyalist, you should absolutely have it. There are some excellent apps out there that allow you to check flight status, see the standby list, book flights and even check in. Apps will store a mobile boarding pass so you can just flash your phone to get on the airplane (not in all airports, but it's getting there). Some airlines have better apps than others. I've heard rave reviews about the new United Airlines app, but get the apps for the airlines you fly frequently. What would you add to the list?","Hotel Tonight connects travelers with last-minute rooms at discounted rates .

"London (CNN) -- As a nation prepared for next week's funeral of Margaret Thatcher, hundreds of demonstrators took to Trafalgar Square on Saturday condemning the political legacy of Britain's ""Iron Lady."" Meanwhile, as authorities planned a public funeral with full military honors, her daughter talked of her heartbreak and grief over the loss of her mother, the first woman to have become the country's prime minister. ""This is going to be a difficult and and tearful week, even for the daughter of the 'Iron Lady,'"" Carol Thatcher told reporters outside her mother's central London home. With high-profile guests, the funeral on Wednesday will rival those given to Princess Diana of Wales and the Queen Mother. Meanwhile, protesters staged anti-Thatcher gatherings in central London and elsewhere despite earlier heavy rains. At Trafalgar Sqaure in central London, activists and former miners rallied around an effigy of Thatcher, whose orange hair was made out of plastic bags. The effigy was paraded around the square, which in 1990 was the scene of rioting against a hugely unpopular poll tax introduced by Thatcher. Protesters chanted ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, dead, dead, dead."" Opposition groups called their event a ""party"" Saturday to celebrate the death of the conservative leader. The T-shirt on the back of one man said: ""We're having a party, Thatcher is dead."" Participants carried a makeshift coffin labeled ""Society."" That was a reference to Thatcher's controversial remark in 1987 that ""there is no such thing as society."" Workers unfurled a ""National Union of Mineworkers"" banner, evoking memories of the yearlong coal miners' strike during the Thatcher years. One person held a placard stating in part: ""War-Monger Destroyer of British Industry. Architect of Casino-Capitalism."" Others popped champagne. London's Metropolitan Police said its officers will be monitoring the event but that officers would not get involved as long as it remained peaceful. One minor scuffle occurred when police removed equipment from the square. The guerrilla theater Saturday served as a reminder that Thatcher's political legacy remains highly divisive, partly because many blame her for creating staggering unemployment as she battled unions and reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to businesses. Tight security for funeral . More information emerged Saturday about Thatcher's involvement in planning her own funeral. Her spokeswoman, Gillian Penrose, said she asked for whoever was prime minister at the time of her death to give a reading. Thatcher also specified that she wanted the hymn ""I Vow To Thee, My Country"" to be sung, Penrose said. Police plan to intensify security Wednesday. More than 2,000 guests have been invited, including UK and foreign dignitaries, British military veterans and prominent artists, journalists and business people. The threat of demonstrations by anarchists or anti-Thatcher activists, on top of fears that dissident Irish Republicans may try to act, have heightened security concerns. Thatcher was the target of a hotel bombing in Brighton by the Irish Republican Army in 1984, and two of her close colleagues were killed in IRA attacks. Police were called Monday in London's Brixton neighborhood,as well as in Bristol and Glasgow after people gathered to ""celebrate"" the news of her death. Politicians have condemned such behavior, saying it shows a lack of respect to her grieving family and friends. ""I feel like anyone else who has just lost a second parent. It's a deeply sad and rather thought-provoking landmark in life,"" Carol Thatcher said. She thanked people for their messages of sympathy and support, as well as the appreciation given for her mother's achievements. ""My mother once said to me, 'Carol, I think my place in history is assured.' The magnificent tributes this week, (from) the wonderful words by President Obama to others from colleagues who once worked alongside her have proved that,"" she said. Carol's twin brother, Mark, appeared briefly beside her for photographers. Margaret Thatcher was leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990, and served as prime minister for 11 of those years. CNN's Fred Pleigten and Laura Smith-Spark contributed from London.

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Republicans portray themselves as the party of family values. Yet, in Wyoming, one prominent group of right wing kinfolk will spend the holidays embroiled in a family feud. You don't get to choose your family. Still, family members might choose a destructive lifestyle that puts them at odds with loved ones. They make others uncomfortable, and hurt those who love them. These people are often thinking only of themselves, and they haven't considered the consequences of their behavior. Liz Cheney is one of these people. And the destructive lifestyle she has chosen is that of a politician. The Republican Senate candidate from Wyoming is running to the right of Republican incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi. And because that might not be so easy to do, whenever the challenger offers an opinion on a topic, it's difficult to know if she's speaking from the heart -- or pandering to the lowest common denominator. An independent political group calling itself the American Principles Fund, which is defending Enzi, recently launched an ad attacking Cheney for opposing a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage and supporting the decision of the State Department to give benefits to same-sex partners of employees. Cheney sisters spar over same-sex marriage, parents weigh in . This week, while calling on Enzi to denounce the ad and labeling it ""gutter politics,"" Cheney stood by those earlier positions. During an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" she said: . ""I don't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary on their life insurance, there's no reason we shouldn't do that."" Nonetheless, that ad puts Cheney in a tight spot, and given that Wyoming is a very conservative state and given that she's trying to position herself on the far right of the spectrum, she can't be seen as soft on same-sex marriage. Thus, in the same interview, she made clear that she doesn't favor allowing same-sex couples to wed and that she supports ""the traditional definition of marriage."" It's a position that Cheney has long held. That is part of the problem. In a country where, as public opinion polls make clear, the opinion of so many Americans on same-sex marriage is rapidly evolving due in large part to the fact that young Americans consider this a nonissue, it would have been good to see some personal growth from Cheney. Besides, she should tread lightly on this subject. Why? Because blood is thicker than votes. And because Michael Corleone was right, and -- even in the rough and tumble of politics -- you ""don't ever take sides with anyone against the family."" And, for the Cheney family, this issue is personal. Liz's sister, Mary, is in a same-sex marriage and has two children with her wife and longtime companion, Heather Poe. ""I love Mary very much. I love her family very much. This is just an issue in which we disagree,"" Cheney said on ""Fox News Sunday."" Mary Cheney wasn't having any of it. Not long after the interview, she posted this rebuttal on Facebook: . ""Liz -- this isn't just an issue on which we disagree -- you're just wrong -- and on the wrong side of history."" Mary also shared a post by Poe, who was likewise bothered by Liz's comments. It read: . ""I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday (yes Liz, in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law) and was very disappointed to hear her say 'I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage.... ""Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 -- she didn't hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us. ""To have her now say she doesn't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least."" Here is what Liz Cheney missed: To many proponents of marriage equality, the very idea of ""traditional marriage"" is offensive. You see, tradition is the antithesis of progress. It was once tradition that women didn't have the right to vote, and African-Americans used separate restrooms, and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were swept up in immigration sweeps. Those things had to change, and they did. In those instances, Americans decided that tradition should take a back seat to things like fairness, justice and equality. This year, Christmas dinner at the Cheney house is bound to be awkward. The kids are fighting, and that sort of thing always hurts the parents most of all. ""This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public,"" Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife, Lynne, said Monday in a statement. They insisted that Liz Cheney has ""always treated her sister and her sister's family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done."" And, they said, ""Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter."" The Cheneys know something about compassion. Over the years, they have been remarkably graceful and supportive toward Mary Cheney and her family. Dick Cheney has challenged conservatives in his own party by saying that gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry and that -- despite calls for a federal ban on same-sex marriage -- the issue should be handled at the state level. I know something about what Liz Cheney is going through. As recently as 14 years ago, I was opposed to same-sex marriage and supported the watered-down alternative: civil unions. I thought this was a battle that wasn't worth fighting and that gay activists should focus their attention elsewhere. However, my younger brother, who is gay, wouldn't let me get away with it. He challenged me. He told me I was wrong. He forced me to be a better person. I changed my view, and came to understand that Americans can't have a two-tiered system, where some of us enjoy the right to marry the people we love while our brothers and sisters and cousins are denied that right, based on nothing more than sexual orientation. It's discrimination with all its ugliness. In the end, this is where we should arrive. Not just because you love your brother, or your sister, but because, just as importantly, you love your country. And you understand what America stands for above all else: freedom. For all of us. Or none of us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Liz Cheney, running for U.S. Senate, declared opposition to same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- A California judge ruled Thursday that a boy who murdered his father, a neo-Nazi leader, will serve his sentence in a yet-to-be-named juvenile detention facility. The boy was 10 when he killed his father, Jeffrey Hall. He is now 13 and could remain at the facility until he is 23. Hall was asleep on a couch in his family's Riverside home when his son killed him on May 1, 2011, according to authorities. CNN is not naming the boy because he is a juvenile. Hall had been the Southwestern states regional director for the National Socialist Movement, according to an online tribute to him from the group's leader, Jeff Schoep. One of the nation's biggest, most well-known neo-Nazi organizations, the National Socialist Movement idolizes Adolf Hitler and touts virulent rhetoric against those who are Jewish, immigrants and not ""pure-blood whites,"" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center civil rights group. Prosecutors contend the victim's neo-Nazi background is not linked to his death, saying the young killer's concerns about abuse and his family being split up were more significant factors. ""It was our belief that this would have happened even if (Hall) was not part of the National Socialist Movement,"" said John Hall, a spokesman for the Riverside County district attorney's office. ""This was done more on a domestic level."" The boy was detained in juvenile halls in Riverside County after the shooting. His lawyers initially sought an insanity defense but later dropped that approach and argued their client didn't fully grasp the ramifications of what he did, the spokesman said. The murder trial before county Judge Jean Leonard -- and not a jury -- got underway October 30, 2012, continuing off-and-on for about 10 days over four months, ending January. As there are no ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" verdicts in her California juvenile court, Leonard instead found it ""true"" that the boy had committed second-degree murder and understood his actions were wrong. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","A boy, then 10, fatally shot his father in 2011 as he was sleeping on a couch .

"(CNN) -- A surveillance video captures the moment when a store clerk in Florida survived a bullet, thanks to his cell phone. It shows a robber pointing his gun at the clerk as he walks away from the counter. The clerk doubles over after the bullet strikes. But the clerk survived the shooting without serious injury because the bullet hit the cell phone he had in his front pocket. In the surveillance video, aired by CNN affiliate WESH, the clerk can be seen lifting his shirt to check for wounds. His co-worker, meanwhile, describes the close shave in a 911 call. ""My partner was, he was hit, I think it hit his phone,"" she says in a recording of the call released by police and aired by WESH. ""But he was hit, he was injured."" The dispatcher asks her where the victim is now. ""He's standing up,"" the worried co-worker replies. ""The bullet didn't go through, but it hit him."" The clerk's lucky escape happened Monday at the store of a Hess gas station in Winter Garden, Florida. The robber had pulled out a revolver and demanded that the store clerks open the safe. When they were unable to do so, he left, firing one shot at the male clerk. The clerk experienced chest pains from the impact, but he was quickly released from a hospital after being checked for injuries, authorities said. His HTC smartphone came off worse. A photo showed its screen shattered around a hole where the bullet had lodged. Police have said he was very lucky to have escaped almost unharmed from the shooting. No arrests had been made in the case as of Wednesday evening, according to WESH.","The store clerk doubles over after the bullet hits him, a surveillance video shows .

"(CNN) -- The highest court in Massachusetts Tuesday struck down down life sentences without parole for juveniles as unconstitutional, ruling that applying such sentences against minors was ""strikingly similar, in many respects, to the death penalty."" The decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court comes one year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that two men convicted of killings committed when they were 14 could not be sentenced to life in prison without parole. The nation's highest court said the sentences violated the ""principle of proportionality, and so violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment."" In Massachusetts, the court ruled that ""the imposition of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the commission of murder in the first degree by a juvenile under the age of eighteen is disproportionate not with respect to the offense itself, but with regard to the particular offender."" Since the brain of a juvenile is not fully formed, a judge could not make an accurate determination on whether the minor is ""irretrievably depraved."" ""Simply put, because the brain of a juvenile is not fully developed, either structurally or functionally, by the age of eighteen, a judge cannot find with confidence that a particular offender, at that point in time, is irretrievably depraved, the court said. The decision stems from the case of Gregory Diatchenko, who was 17 when he stabbed Thomas Wharf nine times near Kenmore Square in Boston in 1981. Diatchenko was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The court ruled Diatchenko, who has served 31 years in prison, was eligible to be considered for parole. The court also ruled in the separate case of Marquise Brown, who was tried and convicted last year of first-degree murder in the killing of Tyriffe Lewis. The slaying happened in 2009, when Brown was 17. Brown was awaiting trial when the U.S. Supreme Court made its 2012 ruling in Miller v. Alabama, which affirmed recent high court rulings against harsh criminal sentences. ""When considered in the context of the offender's age and the wholesale forfeiture of all liberties, the imposition of a sentence of life without parole on a juvenile homicide offender is strikingly similar, in many respects, to the death penalty, which this court has determined is unconstitutional,"" the Massachusetts court wrote . Citing ""current scientific evidence,"" the judge wrote that the ""discretionary imposition of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole on juveniles ... under the age of eighteen when they commit murder in the first degree violates the prohibition against 'cruel or unusual punishment.'"" The U.S. Supreme Court in 2005 banned the death penalty for those under 18 who commit aggravated murder. Then, five years later, the justices said juveniles found guilty of non-homicides could not receive life without parole. The rulings put the spotlight on the youngest of killers and the question of whether a national consensus has developed to treat them differently regarding a lifetime of incarceration. At the time of high court ruling, about 2,500 prisoners were serving life sentences without parole for crimes committed as juveniles. At least 79 of those were 14 years or younger at the time, according to the Equal Justice Initiative.","Massachusetts court equates life terms for minors, ""in many respects,"" to the death penalty .

"(CNN) -- Former first lady Barbara Bush underwent heart surgery Wednesday at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN. Former first lady Barbara Bush had heart surgery Wednesday in Houston, Texas. Jean Becker, chief of staff for former President George H.W. Bush, said that Barbara Bush, 83, was ""fine"" following the surgery. ""In fact, she is awake,"" Becker said. ""We, of course, naively wanted to keep it quiet -- Mrs. Bush did,"" Becker said Wednesday night. ""She thought there was too much fuss the last time."" Wednesday's surgery was not related to surgery she had in November for a perforated ulcer. Her husband is with her in the hospital, where she is expected to remain for seven to 10 days. ""I am very impressed with and grateful to the wonderful team of doctors and nurses at The Methodist Hospital who have helped Barbara,"" the former president said. ""We have every confidence she is in the best hands."" The open-heart surgery was taken as a precautionary step after she experienced shortness of breath last week and doctors found hardening on one part of her aorta, according to a statement released by the hospital. Dr. Gerald Lawrie performed the 2 1/2 hour surgery, replacing her aortic valve with a biologic valve, the hospital said. ""This is a very common aging change,"" Lawrie told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""It's estimated as many as 10 percent of people over 70 need this type of surgery. It's basically a wear-and-tear that leads to calcium deposits."" Lawrie said the former first lady ""really should"" recovery quickly with the new aortic valve taken from a pig. ""That's what we use most commonly,"" he said, adding that Bush ""woke up from the surgery joking.""","Barbara Bush undergoes heart surgery in Houston, Texas, hospital .

All of them had minor injuries, Burbank police Sgt. Jerry Misquez said. The center is ""centrally located within Griffith Park"" and has access to more than 50 miles of horse trails in the park, its website says. Patrons can rent horses, board their horses or watch equestrian events, according to the center. The equestrian center is hosting the 25th annual Equestfest on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- On April 15, the Boston Red Sox won an early-season game at Fenway Park in dramatic, walk-off fashion in the bottom of the ninth inning. About 30 minutes later, that win -- and baseball in general -- ceased to matter; the Boston Marathon -- a sports-crazed city's most exalted annual sporting event -- had just been bombed by terrorists. Nearly six months to the day later, the Red Sox needed some Game 2 inspiration after an uninspired performance against the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the American League Championship Series. They only needed to look to the pre-game ceremonies Sunday night, when 7-year-old Jane Richard stood on her new prosthetic leg before a sellout crowd and poignantly sang the National Anthem. Singing in front of nearly 40,000 people made her strong, but the circumstances that brought her there made her Boston Strong. Jane, who lives in the city's Dorchester neighborhood, didn't just lose her leg in the Boston Marathon terror attacks. She lost her big brother, 8-year-old Martin, as well. She underwent 12 surgeries and spent months recovering in Boston hospitals. When she was finally discharged, the Richard family issued an update that coincided with the bombing's four-month mark. ""Jane continues to be an incredible source of inspiration -- and exhaustion,"" the August 15 statement read. ""The loss of her leg has not slowed her one bit, or deterred her in any way."" Fenway Park is barely a David Ortiz home run away from the marathon's finish line in Copley Square where the bombs went off and changed the city forever. On Sunday night in Fenway Park, Ortiz hit a late-inning home run to tie a game that the Red Sox would later win in dramatic, walk-off fashion in the bottom of the ninth inning. On Sunday night in Fenway Park, that win mattered. On Sunday night in Fenway Park, baseball mattered again.","Jane Richard lost her leg in the Boston Marathon bombings .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has been clubbed into the long grass by EA Sports after the games manufacturer ended its association with the world's most famous golfer. Woods, 37, won the last of his 14 major titles back in 2008, but this year returned to world No.1 after replacing Rory McIlroy at the top of the rankings. There were 14 editions of the video game bearing his name, which was played by millions of golf fans across the world. Writing on EA's official website, the company's vice-president and general manager Daryl Holt commented: ""EA Sports and Tiger Woods have made a mutual decision to end our partnership, which includes Tiger's named PGA Tour golf game. We've always been big fans of Tiger and we wish him continued success in all his future endeavors. ""EA Sports golf fans have always loved authentic courses and players, but they've also asked for more choice and customization in how and where they play."" EA had previously stuck with Woods through his acrimonious divorce in August 2010 at a time where several other sponsors severed ties with the American. Gatorade, AT&T and Accenture and Tag Heuer all withdrew sponsorship or did not renew their deals following the revelations of Woods' infidelity and subsequent divorce from Elin Nordegren -- costing him $20 million in earnings. From the endorsements he held in 2009, just two remain: Nike, which teamed up with Woods when he turned professional in 1996; and NetJets, a plane ownership-sharing company. ""For most mortal sportsmen, losing the EA deal would constitute a real body blow. At an estimated $6.2 million a year, it's a very significant chunk of change,"" Sami McCabe, CEO of Clarity PR, told CNN. ""However, Tiger Woods is in a unique category in terms of earning potential from sponsorship deals -- particularly from his sportswear sponsor Nike, which ensures he dwarfs the majority of his peers -- in any sport. ""So I don't see this news being a source of sleepless nights from a financial perspective. However, it might be the cause of concern for the longevity and sustainability of 'Brand Tiger.' "" According to market tracking company NPD Group, EA sold $771 million worth of games boasting the Tiger Woods name. DFC Intelligence, a consulting firm which deals with the gaming market, states that EA made $3.79 billion last year -- with its Battlefield and Madden NFL games the top sellers. But while the loss of the EA partnership should not cause major damage to the Woods brand, McCabe does believe the move remains significant. ""Losing a marquee sponsorship deal says two things: first, he's no longer the force he once was on the golf course; and secondly, EA will no doubt be replacing him with someone else,"" he said. ""Rory McIlroy would seem the most obvious choice -- assuming his form picks up. So this might be perceived as the first major step in a changing of the guard. ""Losing EA Games won't make much of a dent on Tiger's bank balance, but it does make a dent on his ubiquity. ""And that ubiquity is the single biggest reason why he's able to command such astronomical sponsorship deals. ""That said, a couple of major wins would surely turn the tide back in his favor."" EA started making golf simulation games back in 1990, with PGA Tour golf coming out on PC, Amiga and the Sega Megadrive. In 1998 it produced the ""Tiger Woods PGA Tour 99"" which became a huge hit on Playstation and blazed the trail for further success. But in recent years EA has begun to take a step back, with the 2010 cover of the game the first to feature another golfer alongside Woods -- Northern Ireland's rising star McIlroy. A few months later on a newer version it simply showed Augusta, home of the Masters, with no trace of Woods on the cover. Rickie Fowler joined Woods on the front of ""Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13"" in the U.S., while Arnold Palmer was used in the latest version.","EA Sports will drop the Tiger Woods name from its next-gen golf games .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles International Airport completed the reopening of all its terminals early Saturday afternoon, when business finally resumed at the terminal where a TSA officer was fatally shot a day earlier. ""Terminal 3 is now fully reopened and operational,"" Gina Marie Lindsey, head of Los Angeles World Airports, said around 1:10 p.m. (4:10 p.m. ET) Saturday. That's the terminal where a gunman shot three TSA officers Friday morning, killing one of them, before being shot himself and taken into custody. Throughout Saturday morning, LAX struggled with flight delays, but authorities were able to allow passengers to retrieve their possessions that had been abandoned during Friday's emergency evacuation. Uniformed and undercover police will continue a high security posture ""for the foreseeable future,"" said Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon. The FBI was still working the shooting scene Saturday inside Terminal 3, and its flights had been assigned to other terminals during the morning, airport officials said. Meanwhile, the airport entrance's 100-foot pylons ""will light the night blue through Sunday in honor of fallen TSA Officer (Gerardo) Hernandez,"" airport officials said on its Twitter account. By late Saturday morning, all of LAX's roadways were open. In all, the violence affected an estimated 1,550 scheduled flights with about 167,050 passengers from the start of the incident around 9:30 a.m. Friday through midnight, airport officials said. Those totals consist of 826 scheduled departure flights with an estimated 99,200 passengers and 724 arrival flights with 67,850 passengers. ""Please contact ur airline for flight status before coming to LAX,"" the airport said on Twitter. ""Thank you to law enforcement, airlines, agencies & traveling public for your teamwork & patience as we return your LAX to normal operations."" The Federal Aviation Administration announced it ordered a ground stop that ended at 3 p.m. PT (6 p.m. ET). It applied to LAX-bound flights that were departing from airports in the western United States; those aircraft were held at their departure airports, the FAA said in a statement. On Friday morning, about 9:20 a.m. PT (12:20 p.m. ET), a gunman opened fire at a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint. One TSA officer was killed and two others were injured. By Friday afternoon, the airport was letting employees back into Terminals 1 and 2, said Lindsey, the airport's executive director. There was ""no time frame"" of when the FBI will complete its investigation in Terminal 3, the airport said. Passengers expecting to fly out of Terminal 3 should contact their airlines for more information, Lindsey said. Many travelers took the delays in stride. Some stuck in airplanes at LAX took to Twitter to document their delays, but the tone was largely respectful.

"(CNN) -- It's not easy taking over from one of the greatest managers in football history, but David Moyes has been assured that one trophy in his debut season at Manchester United will be considered a success. So says his predecessor Alex Ferguson, a man who waited more than three years for his first silverware at Old Trafford before rewriting the record books. United's hopes of a 21st English title seem faint after Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Southampton, a result which left Moyes' men eight points behind leader Arsenal after only eight matches. However, Ferguson -- whose reign ended with a 13th Premier League crown last season -- urged fans to be patient after a difficult start to this campaign. ""For David, winning a trophy would be a fantastic achievement,"" the 71-year-old told the club's MUTV channel in an interview aired Saturday. ""No matter what it is -- the League Cup, FA Cup, European Cup or Premier League. We've always had priorities obviously, and David is aware of that, but I hope he achieves it. ""He has great support at the club. The most important person in the club is the manager and that must always be sacrosanct. In fairness, the club have always stuck by that rigid belief."" Moyes, who did win the pre-season Community Shield match, was boosted ahead of the Southampton match when teen sensation Adnan Januzaj signed a new five-year contract. The 18-year-old, who underlined his status before the international break as one of the game's hottest young prospects with two goals in his first EPL start, was again to the fore as United dominated the first half. Januzaj sent Wayne Rooney clear on goal and, although the England striker's shot was saved by Artur Boruc, Robin van Persie fired home from the rebound. Januzaj was also denied by Boruc, and another well-timed pass found Danny Welbeck -- but the forward could not set up Rooney for the second. ""We have been trying to get him signed for quite a few months, not just in my time,"" Moyes said of the Brussels-born winger. ""He's an exceptionally talented player. He has not looked out of place in the team. He has created goals and been part of some of our best passing movements."" However, United's defensive frailties were once again exposed as Adam Lallana diverted in a scrambled shot from Dejan Lovren in the 89th minute to deny Moyes successive wins for the first time since joining from Everton. ""We should probably have put the game to bed earlier,"" Moyes said. ""We hit the bar and had a couple of other opportunities. ""It was a mixed game at times, but we still had those chances that I was hoping we would finish off."" By contrast, Arsenal romped to a comprehensive 4-1 win at home to Norwich that put Arsene Wenger's team two points clear of Chelsea and Liverpool. Record signing Mesut Ozil scored twice after Jack Wilshere's opener, and fellow midfielder Aaron Ramsey added his ninth goal in all competitions this season. Chelsea came from behind to beat promoted Cardiff 4-1, as former African player of the year Samuel Eto'o scored his first goal for the London side since joining from Russia's Anzhi Makhachkala in August. However, the Cameroon striker's cheeky dispossession of David Marshall when the visiting keeper bounced the ball -- which allowed Eden Hazard to equalize with the first of his two goals -- left Cardiff boss Malky Mackay fuming. ""I did go in to ask for clarification of the ruling and what the referee and linesman saw,"" he said. ""The explanation leaves me really disappointed -- they felt the goalkeeper dropped the ball. My goalkeeper bounced the ball. He saw Samuel Eto'o standing next to him and he bounced the ball."" Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to attend his press conference after being sent to the stands in the second half after protesting about Cardiff's alleged time-wasting. Eto'o had put Chelsea ahead by that stage, while Oscar and Hazard wrapped it up after Mourinho's dugout exit. Liverpool briefly went top after being held 2-2 by 10-man Newcastle in Saturday's early match, with striker Daniel Sturridge heading a 72nd-minute equalizer. The home side twice led, through Yohan Cabaye and Paul Dummett, despite having Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa sent off for a foul on Luis Suarez -- from which Steven Gerrard netted a penalty for Liverpool's first leveler. In the late match, Manchester City won away for the first time this season, beating West Ham 3-1 thanks to a double from Sergio Aguero to move above Southampton into fourth place. Sixth-placed Everton joined Saints on 15 points with a 2-1 win at home to promoted Hull, while Swansea crushed Sunderland 4-0 to give new manager Gus Poyet a losing start to his tenure at the EPL's bottom club, and there was a 0-0 stalemate between Stoke and West Brom.","Manchester United eight points off EPL pace after drawing 1-1 at home to Southampton .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities announced Friday they have opened an investigation into how a mammoth cargo plane landed Wednesday at the wrong airport in Wichita, Kansas. The National Transportation Safety Board's probe is in addition to a probe announced Thursday by Atlas Air, operator of the Boeing-owned jet. It left New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport bound for McConnell Air Force Base, but landed instead on the other side of town at Colonel James Jabara Airport. The latter airport does not typically accommodate such beasts. The Atlas Air 747 Dreamlifter is a modified 747-400 passenger airplane that can haul more cargo by volume than any airplane in the world. When fully loaded, the Dreamlifter needs a runway 9,199 feet long to take off, reports affiliate KWCH. The Jabara runway is 6,101 feet. But, after spending Wednesday night performing calculations that factored in the lighter weight from the fuel burned during the flight from JFK and the favorable weather, engineers approved its attempt to take off from Jabara's abbreviated runway. On Thursday afternoon, after police cleared nearby roads -- just in case -- the plane took off without incident from Jabara. A few minutes later, it landed without incident at its original planned destination -- McConnell Air Force Base. Photos: Boeing through the ages .

"(CNN) -- Ever imagined flying an airplane with your eyes closed? Or driving at nearly 200 miles an hour with a blindfold? How about racing a speedboat in complete darkness? Sounds crazy? Well take off those blinkers and meet Mike Newman -- the world's fastest blind daredevil. On Friday, Newman will attempt to break the blind water speed record in a powerboat just off the English coast and secure his place in history. Being unable to see has proved no barrier to the 52-year-old who is aiming to become the first man to hold the blind speed records for land, sea and air in the same year. Having already succeeded on four wheels and in the cockpit of an airplane, it is just the sea which stands between him and sporting immortality. ""To hold all the records would be amazing,"" Newman told CNN, who is hoping to reach speeds of 95 miles an hour in a top of the range powerboat. ""I first started riding motorcycles 12 years ago when I was pushing 40 and I just went from there. ""I moved on to cars after that and I've loved it. People love all types of different sports but for me it was always motorsport. ""I love the engines, the smells, the noises which come with it. I love all the elements and just because I can't see, it doesn't detract from the experience."" Newman's story is as rapid as it is remarkable. Diagnosed with glaucoma as a child, Newman lost his sight at the age of eight. But it was not until some years later that he began his love affair with speed -- breaking blind land records on land and in the air. It was 12 years ago that he first attempted to break a record -- riding a motorcycle at 89 mph after just three days practice. He twice broke blind land speed records in 2003 and 2005, improving from 144mph to 175mph in the space of two years. In October 2011 he achieved the world blind aerial aerobatic record; flying the most consecutive loops in formation. A five times Guinness World record holder, there isn't much Newman can't do. His charity is now helping others to overcome their difficulties through racing with his team having recently designed and built ten specially adapted track cars boasting dual controls, twin steering wheels. ""The main point of all of this is to make sure that people who aren't able to have these opportunities get that chance,"" added Newman. ""The charity is doing a great job and although we're only quite young we've made great progress. ""I can't believe the amount of attention we've had. Hopefully it will continue for a while yet."" There will be hundreds of people present for Newman's latest record attempt with television cameras, journalists and photographers all ready to capture the moment. His exploits have made him into something of a celebrity -- a tag of which he's not too keen on. That he is blind is not an issue to him -- what everyone else thinks is up to them. ""Whatever I attempt, I do it in my own environment,"" Newman told CNN. ""If I get on the bus, go to the post office or the supermarket, I'm doing it in my own environment and it's normal for me. ""Being blind doesn't stop me doing things. I don't really think about being a role model or if I've broken down barriers. I'm just doing this to help other people in life."" John Galloway, the team principal, has worked with Newman for over a decade and has watched his friend and colleague meet each challenge head on without showing an ounce of fear. ""I have known Mike for over 11 years now and never met someone with such self belief,"" Galloway told CNN. ""He has a driving ambition to chase his dreams and able to catch them. He is a great example to all of us."" Newman will now turn his attention to breaking the blind water speed record and become the first man to hold all three records at the same time. Former soldier Mark Treadgold currently holds the record of 91mph but Newman is confident he can surpass that achievement when he hits the water at Torque Harbor, Devon, on England's south west coast. Newman will be assisted by Andrew Langdon, who owns the race boat Silverline and will offer navigational assistance through helmet to helmet radio communication. The team believes he can reach 95mph if conditions allow -- a result which would see him become the first man to hold the land, air and sea record in the same year. ""It would be amazing if we could do it,"" added Newman. ""It's really exciting and I cannot wait for it to happen.""","Mike Newman is hoping to break the blind water speed record on November 1 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Embattled U.S. Rep. David Wu will resign from the House of Representatives after being accused of making unwanted sexual advances toward a fundraiser's daughter, he announced Tuesday. In a statement issued by his office, the seven-term Oregon Democrat said he would step down once the current standoff between Congress and the White House over raising the U.S. debt ceiling is resolved. ""I cannot care for my family the way I wish while serving in Congress and fighting these very serious allegations,"" Wu said. ""The well-being of my children must come before anything else."" Gov. John Kitzhaber said he will call for a special election once he has Wu's official resignation. On Friday, Portland newspaper The Oregonian reported that the daughter of one of Wu's fundraisers accused him of unwanted sexual advances in May. Citing anonymous sources from inside the congressman's office, The Oregonian said the woman, whom it declined to name, left a voice-mail message at Wu's Portland office alleging aggressive advances. According to the newspaper, the woman was 18 when the alleged incident took place in November and it was never reported to police. With House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi seeking an ethics investigation after Friday's news and calls for his resignation mounting back home, the congressman's spokesman said Monday that he would not seek re-election and was ""considering all options"" regarding the rest of his term. The 56-year-old congressman, who separated from his wife in 2009, disclosed in February that he had sought ""professional medical care"" after dealing with campaign stress, his responsibilities as a single father and his father's death. The Oregonian reported that campaign aides had confronted him about his erratic behavior and use of medication during his 2010 re-election bid. ""I fully acknowledge that I could have dealt with these difficult circumstances better, and I remain focused on being a good father to my children and a strong representative for the people of Oregon,"" he said at the time. Wu's Portland-area district is heavily Democratic, and he won each of his races by double-digit margins. Rep. Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said his party has long dominated elections in Oregon's first congressional district, saying that ""a Democrat has held this seat in Congress since 1975, Senator John Kerry won this district in 2004 and President Obama won this district with 63 percent in 2008. ""We are confident that a Democrat will continue to represent the families in this overwhelmingly Democratic district.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown sat alone in court for 35 minutes on Friday while his lawyer talked with the judge and prosecutor behind closed doors in his probation violation case. The judge emerged from his chambers to order Brown to come back on June 10 because lawyers need more time to look at ""additional discovery"" in his case. While not much happened in Friday's hearing before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin, ultimately it could be big trouble for the singer. In a court filing in February, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the 180 days of community labor ordered when he pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in the beating of his girlfriend Rihanna. Rihanna shows support in court for Chris Brown . The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is ""at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting,"" District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said. Mark Geragos, Brown's attorney, said after the last hearing that the prosecutor's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court. ""And I don't mean just false, it is fraudulent,"" Geragos said. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has ""tortured"" Brown during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said. Despite the serious allegations outlined in the court filing, the prosecutor is not asking for Brown's probation to be revoked and the singer sent to jail. She is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer. Brown and his mother were in court for Friday's hearing, but Rihanna, who attended his last court date, was not there. When the pop star sat behind Brown in court at that hearing, it was Rihanna's second time in a courtroom with him. The first was the day in August 2009 when Brown was sentenced to five years' probation and ordered to stay away from her. Then, she was a witness for the prosecution. At the probation court date, when Geragos was asked why Brown's assault victim was in court, he replied, ""She thinks it's utterly ridiculous what they're doing to him.""

"(CNN) -- Now is not the time to repeal the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the U.S. armed forces, Sen. John McCain said at a hearing Thursday. ""At this time, we should be inherently cautious about making any changes that would affect our military, and what changes we do make should be the product of careful and deliberate consideration,"" the Arizona Republican said at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. His position is not that the law should never be changed, he said, but that ""it may be premature to make such a change at this time and in this manner."" In contrast, Defense Secretary Robert Gates urged that the repeal be signed into law as soon as possible, to avoid the issue being taken up again by the judiciary, where a repeal of the ban could be ordered immediately, rather than on the military's timetable. A judicial fiat would be ""hazardous,"" he added. ""This can be done, and should be done,"" Gates said of the policy change. McCain questioned the results of a report that found that most military personnel would not change their career plans if the policy was changed, saying that only a fraction of military personnel responded. He also noted that the survey found opposition to the change is much higher in Army and Marine combat units than elsewhere in the military. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, said he believes that even among those combat forces, a transition to a new law is possible. ""Should repeal occur, some soldiers and Marines may want separate shower facilities. Some may ask for different berthing. Some may even quit the service. We'll deal with that. But I believe, and history tells, that most of them will put aside personal proclivities for something larger than themselves and for each other,"" he said. In a tense exchange between Gates and McCain, the defense secretary reiterated Mullen's point. ""Most of the Marines who are in combat are 18 to 24 [or] 25 years old. Most of the them have never served with women, either. So they have had a very focused, very limited experience in the military and it's been a tough one,"" Gates said. ""But I think that with time and adequate preparation we can mitigate their concerns."" McCain responded, ""Well, I couldn't disagree more. We send these young people into combat. We think they are mature enough to fight and die. I think they are mature enough to make a judgment on who they want to serve with and the impact on their battle effectiveness."" McCain was upset that the military survey did not ask explicitly whether troops were in favor or against repealing ""don't ask, don't tell."" The questions asked how military units would respond and adapt if it were repealed. Gates and Mullen argued that asking troops for their opinions on the repeal would be akin to a referendum on the policy, something that Mullen called a ""bad precedent."" The argument did not sway McCain. He said that any good leader should get opinions from his subordinates before making a decision. ""I'm almost incredulous to see that on an issue of this magnitude, we wouldn't at least solicit the views of the military about whether this law would be changed or not,"" he said. Mullen responded that the survey that was done gave an adequate amount of opinion, even if the question was not directly asked. ""We've gotten in great parts their views as a result of this survey,"" Mullen said. On Friday, the committee will hear from the top brass of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. While a Pew survey showed that 58 percent of the public support repealing the ban, the heads of the four military branches have either directly opposed or been unenthusiastic about the policy change, at least until the Pentagon report was finished and released. Marine Commandant James Amos has said that he opposes the change while the United States is fighting in Afghanistan because of its potential negative effect on unit cohesion. He will be joined on the second day of hearings by another Marine, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright. Once the Armed Services Committee's hearings are over, the spotlight will turn to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. He will decide how the issue will move forward: whether to keep it as part of the Defense Authorization Bill or strip it off for a separate vote. With just weeks left for this Congress, the calendar could be the biggest factor weighing on whether the law is repealed or upheld. The House has already passed the repeal.","NEW: Troops' opinions on policy should have been solicited, Sen. John McCain says .

"(CNN) -- As we begin our initial descent into JFK, I lightly press the tip of my index finger to the iPad screen. A brief jostle from a bout of turbulence results in the display of the wrong page. I grumble in silence but grin because I no longer have to wrestle through pages of paper charts and manuals. Instead, my office -- the cockpit of a 777 -- is mostly void of paper. Cool stuff. My airline was the first to have the iPad approved for all phases of flight, takeoff and landing included. Almost a year has passed since that approval, a process that required six months of trials and training on each airplane type. And now the FAA is relaxing its rules on the use of personal electronic devices for passengers.  It was inevitable.  But is the new policy safe? Most safety concerns focus on the effect of electronic interference to navigation systems. But in most of today's airliners, those concerns are minimal. Navigation is no longer wholly dependent on signals sent from the ground from one of the VOR (Very High Omni Bearing Range) stations that dot the landscape around the world. Now GPS and sophisticated internal navigation systems integrate VOR signals into the calculations from onboard computers. The design of aircraft prevents electronic signals from interfering -- not only signals from outside sources but ones generated from inside the airplane, such as engines and generators. In short, the chance of a passenger's Kindle interfering with an automated landing in low visibility conditions is minimal if not nonexistent. Calls from cell phones are a separate story. I'm gratified that the FAA acknowledges that usage as potential interference. For one thing, in some circumstances, cell phone frequencies are close to those of VOR stations. The FCC prohibits their usage for calls because of the risk of overloading cellular systems from airborne phones traveling at the Mach speeds of jets. If you want a dead phone for your business meeting after a three-hour flight, be certain to leave it on for the entire trip. The phone will attempt to lock on to almost every cell tower signal available en route. So where is the potential safety threat? It comes mostly from electronic devices creating a distraction. How so? Takeoffs and landings are the most critical phases of any flight. In an abnormal situation, such as an aborted takeoff or an emergency landing that dictates a ground evacuation, time is of the essence. If you are focused on Angry Birds, will you have situational awareness? Will you understand the emergency instructions of the flight attendants in a highly stressful situation? And for that matter, if your concentration is on composing an e-mail to the manager of your biggest account, are you really paying attention to the location of the emergency exits during the departure briefing? You may say: How does the distraction of electronics differ from the distraction of The New York Times or People magazine? To which I would answer: They don't come with headphones. In any case, as it has never been done in the past, it would be an absurdity to regulate ink-on-paper reading now. Although the FAA has granted approval for the use of your iPad during takeoff and landing, each airline must incorporate the policy into its own operations. Assuming airlines will relax their policies just for the sake of competing with their counterparts, I would advocate that they hold the line on electronic devices being used with headphones or anything else that could potentially block passengers from hearing and understanding emergency instructions from crew members. One perk of this new electronic regulation? Some of the burden will be lifted from flight attendant duties. Although they still have to scold you about the seat back and tray table, the electronic device admonishment will be diminished. But don't be having a phone conversation with the spouse or be texting a buddy. Cell phone calls are still prohibited when that entry door closes. From my perspective as a flight crew member, I am pleased that our customers will have the opportunity to enjoy their electronic devices. But as cliched as it may sound, we are there for your safety. Regulation aside, I ask that you exercise discretion. There is a method to our madness, even for Alec Baldwin. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Les Abend.","Les Abend: FAA relaxing rules on electronics in flight; is it safe?

"(CNN) -- Imagine not being able to hear a siren during an emergency or to see a warning sign to evacuate. Imagine navigating knee-high mud in a wheelchair or trying to explain to a child with Down syndrome why he or she must seek higher ground. Those are just some of the challenges facing those with physical and cognitive disabilities -- people often least prepared to face a natural disaster. A largely overlooked report issued this month by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction found that the crucial needs of about 1 billion people living with physical and mental disabilities around the world are not woven into the disaster planning and emergency response plans of governments and civil society groups. The result is that a disproportionate number of disabled persons suffer and die in disasters because of a lack of attention to their needs. Emergency response systems and shelters are poorly designed to handle their requirements. According to the report, 70% of those with disabilities who responded to the survey in over 100 countries said they did not know how to tap into any existing emergency response system in their communities. They become largely dependent on the good will of families and neighbors. The report confirms the experience from recent catastrophes like the 2010 earthquake in Haiti -- where deaf victims were trapped underneath rubble, unable to hear the sounds of rescuers drilling above -- and the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, where victims in wheelchairs could not board evacuation buses or get into temporary housing that had no ramps. And we have seen in the U.S. during Hurricane Katrina and other major storms how those with disabilities suffer. In a post-Katrina study of survivors, reports found that people with physical or cognitive disabilities faced considerable barriers to transportation, evacuation, and housing. Dozens died in nursing homes and medical centers. Many of the disabled survivors did not have jobs, making post-crisis transition even more challenging. It is tempting to presume that people with disabilities are small in number. The reality, however, is that roughly 15% of people in the world live with a physical or cognitive disability -- many of them in developing countries that cannot afford care and inclusion. In the United States, 37.2 million Americans have some form of disability. Despite the success of programs like the Americans with Disabilities Act, there are millions of people left without meaningful employment, education, and services before, during, and after a crisis. The United States has a global imperative to address the needs of the disabled today -- especially in difficult fiscal times. Leaving aside the moral obligation, there is an economic driver at work. Worldwide, people with disabilities have higher unemployment rates than those without disabilities. In developing countries, 80% to 90% of persons of working age with disabilities are unemployed, whereas in industrialized countries the figure is between 50% and 70%. Their exclusion from the workplace deprives societies of an estimated $1.4 trillion in gross domestic product. As we plan for disaster relief, as well as routine development and assistance, it is vital that America lead with a sustained commitment to those with disabilities. The U.S. failure to ratify the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities -- a convention signed by 155 nations -- reinforces a perception that America does not care about the disabled. Yet despite the failure to ratify the convention, America has a good story to tell on inclusive development and disabilities. The U.S. Agency for International Development has led the way on supporting principles of universal design that not only fund specific programs to address the targeted needs of disabled citizens, but integrate disabilities into generalized programs that improve job training, education, quality and accessibility of care. Over 75% of U.S. missions and USAID offices report activities and programs that specifically include people with disabilities. The U.S. State Department has a special adviser for international disability rights and has made enormous progress in expanding the range of U.S.-funded exchange programs to include more participants with disabilities and to convene international experts around the issue. Recently, a major conference took place in Washington, with leaders on disability rights from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Tajikistan, and Uganda and representatives from NGOs, universities, and government offices in the U.S., to address challenges facing persons with disabilities in their home communities. The U.S. sent the first-ever official team of disabled sports envoys to China to promote inclusion and equality for persons with disabilities. This month we celebrate the 25th anniversary of National Disability Employment Awareness Month to pay homage to our own citizens with disabilities. The October campaign theme is ""Because we are EQUAL to the task."" This is a good time to think about those at home and overseas who are marginalized and excluded because of disabilities and make sure we are doing our part.

"London (CNN) -- The body found on Queen Elizabeth II's estate in Sandringham last week was a 17-year-old who had been missing since August, police said Sunday. DNA tests helped detectives identified the woman as Alisa Dmitrijeva, Norfolk police said in a statement. Police had been offering a Â£5000 reward for information leading to the missing teen. Police have not said what caused her death, but said detectives are ""investigating the murder."" In interviews with British newspapers last week, her family said they had immigrated from Latvia. Investigators were alerted last Sunday to the human remains, found by a member of the public near the village of Anmer, in the English county of Norfolk. Police are investigating activities that occurred around the site between the end of August and the end of September, Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said in a statement. ""We would like to identify people who may have worked in that area or were involved in organizing or running any specific events that may have taken place,"" he said. The body had been at the site between one and four months, the Joint Norfolk and Suffolk Major Investigation Team said last week.

"Dhaka (CNN) -- It will take a long time for the people of Bangladesh to get over deaths of more than 700 people crushed under twisted metal and shattered concrete at the workplace where they spent hours each day. But what is surfacing more with time is the discussion about who is responsible for the tragedy and whether it could have been averted. Preliminary results of a government inquiry into the collapse says ""heavy machinery and high-capacity generators"" were ""largely responsible,"" state media reported. It also pointed the blame at ""substandard materials"" used in the construction. A number of people have been arrested, including the owner, who is alleged to have illegally added three extra floors to the building, as well as the owners and senior managers of the factories who allegedly forced workers to go back to work even after cracks were found. Some local business people I spoke to said the owners were under pressure from their buyers for timely delivery, which was hindered due to the ongoing political crisis. The debate goes on about safety standards in factories in Bangladesh and whether compliance measures are in place. The buyers are not being spared and it is now being argued that they must ensure suppliers take the standard measures to ensure the safety of workers. A very pertinent question was raised about the huge profit buyers make and whether this is ethical. The role of the various government agencies involved is also being questioned. Could this have happened if the concerned agencies remained vigilant and performed their duties properly? Everyone seems responsible. Bangladesh's poor safety record . Savar's tragedy was not the first of its kind in Bangladesh. Last year, at least 117 workers died in a fire at a garment factory near Dhaka. In 2005, at least 100 workers died in the same area in a similar building collapse incident. Each year, workers continue to die in factories, in ship breaking yards and on construction sites. A study by Bangladesh Institute of Labor Studies shows more than 6,000 workers died on the job in the last decade. However, very few initiatives had been taken by the government or factory owners to prevent such disasters. The political system in the country is such where workers are used as pawns in the race to gain power and nothing else. The unholy nexus of politics, business and law enforcement has resulted in a culture where the basic rights of workers are often ignored. Who is ultimately responsible? So is it the responsibility of the buyers to enforce the government and businesses to comply with safety standards? Should the buyers pay more, as is always argued by the garment owners association, because the lower cost of production, compared with other markets, compels them to ignore safety standards? These are only arguments to avoid the responsibilities. Of course buyers can't deny their role in failing to demand and enforce the safety codes when placing an order with a Bangladeshi supplier. Nor can they remain oblivious of the fact that if they continue to pay less the workers' conditions will remain unchanged. The factory owners and their association must realize that they will lose the market if they do nothing to improve working conditions for their employees. The impression in the West that workers are maltreated at factories may turn out to be disastrous. Consumers are getting aware and might not want to buy products in future which are tagged ""Made in Bangladesh."" Political parties should stop cashing in on the plight of these poor people. They can't deny that it is because the recent spate of political violence has forced many garment and other factory owners to flout the rules and go for quick money. Having said that, the government and its mechanisms are ultimately responsible for the tragedy. Had the administration and its monitoring system been in place this could never have happened. For years, the rule of law was disregarded intentionally or let pass thanks to the omnipresence of corruption in the administration as well as in politics. 'Culture of impunity' persists . The absence of rule of law and the subsequent failure of the governments to improve it has led to a situation where a culture of impunity has made illegal money making lucrative. And it remains unpunished as well. This should come to an end and for that we need political will. Bangladesh has hit many remarkable milestones in the last few decades. The country's success in reducing child mortality and population growth can be models for other countries. We are the torch bearers of micro credit and social business. The rate of female education is better than our neighboring countries. Our garment products are considered to be best among consumers. It is time that corrective measures are taken to deal with malpractices that prevail in the garment industry. Corruption has to be contained with no space for impunity. The rights of the workers can no longer be looked down upon for the profits of a few. Rule of law must be restored in this sector. This daunting task can't be accomplished only by the business people, or the government or political parties. The buyers also have to lend a hand so that millions of workers are saved from a looming disaster and can live a life with dignity and safety. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"London (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange handed himself over to police Tuesday, promptly appeared in court where he was denied bail and left for jail in a police van. A judge will now decide whether to extradite him to Sweden to face questioning over allegations he had sexual relations with two women without their consent. He has not been charged with a crime. The judge at the City of Westminster Magistrate's Court ordered Assange jailed until December 14, despite several celebrities coming forward and offering to pay his surety, or bail. It was not immediately clear if the court would decide on that date whether to release him. The judge repeatedly said the case is ""not about WikiLeaks,"" but about serious sexual offenses that allegedly occurred on three occasions with two women. Assange, who was in court with security guards on either side of him and his lawyer in front, initially proved reluctant to declare a home address. At the start of the proceedings, Assange was asked for his address and at first gave a post office box. When told that wasn't sufficient, he wrote a location on a piece of paper and handed it to the judge. It was later revealed that Assange wrote ""Parkville, Victoria, Australia"" on the paper. In making his decision to deny bail, the judge cited the fact that Assange gave no permanent address and has a nomadic lifestyle, and that he has access to significant funding that would make it easy for him to abscond. Vaughn Smith of the Frontline Club, a journalists' organization that hosts many of WikiLeaks press events and gives WikiLeaks workspace in London, said he offered Assange an address for bail. Smith said he was ""suspicious of the personal charges"" against Assange. English socialite Jemima Khan had offered to pay bail of 20,000 pounds ($31,500), and journalist John Pilger also offered a sum of money. The media was allowed inside the courtroom initially but was later ordered to leave. Assange appeared in court after turning himself in at a London police station. He was arrested on a Swedish warrant. He refused to agree to be extradited to Sweden, so the court now has roughly 21 days to decide whether to order his extradition, said Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association. Ellis was surprised that Assange was denied bail, he said. But Assange will now face an uphill battle to prevent being sent to Sweden -- showing that he cannot get a fair trial there. ""That is difficult"" given Sweden's highly developed legal system, Ellis said. The Swedish warrant is a European arrest warrant designed for easy transfer of suspects among European states, Ellis said. If the court does decide to allow his extradition, Assange will be allowed to appeal that decision, too, elongating the legal process, he said. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, has said he has long feared retribution for his website's disclosures and has called the rape allegations against him a smear campaign. Sweden first issued the arrest warrant for Assange in November, saying he is suspected of one count of rape, two counts of sexual molestation and one count of unlawful coercion -- or illegal use of force -- allegedly committed in August. Swedish prosecutor Marianne Ny said in a website statement that Tuesday's actions don't represent any movement in the investigation. ""At present, the case is a matter for British authorities,"" she said. Ny also said that the arrest has nothing to do with WikiLeaks. ""I want to make clear that I have not been subjected to any kind of pressure, neither political nor of any other kind,"" she said. ""I am acting as prosecutor because there are suspicions of sex crimes committed in Sweden in August. Swedish prosecutors are completely independent in their decisions."" Assange's Swedish lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, told CNN affiliate TV4 that his client is innocent. ""Yes, I think that Julian Assange will soon be set free if all applicable laws are followed,"" Hurtig said. ""The prosecutor wants Assange to be arrested because he didn't participate in an interrogation. But once this interrogation has taken place, there won't be any more reason to keep him, so then he should be set free."" Claus Borgstrom, the Swedish lawyer representing the two women who have accused Assange, said he is ""very relieved, above all, on behalf of my clients."" ""Now we are just waiting for the next step which is for him to be handed over to Sweden,"" he said. The Australian High Commission in London said Tuesday it was providing consular assistance to Assange as it ""would to any Australian under arrest."" A spokesman for WikiLeaks said Tuesday the legal proceedings in London had not affected the site, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information. ""WikiLeaks is operating as normal, and we plan to release documents on schedule,"" spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said. WikiLeaks has been under intense pressure from the United States and its allies since it began posting the first of more than 250,000 U.S. State Department documents November 28. Since then, the site has been hit with denial-of-service attacks, been kicked off servers in the United States and France, and found itself cut off from funds in the United States and Switzerland. In response, the site has rallied supporters to mirror its content ""in order to make it impossible to ever fully remove WikiLeaks from the internet."" More than 500 sites had responded to the appeal by Monday evening, it said. WikiLeaks has also posted a massive, closely encrypted file, identified as ""insurance"" -- a file Assange's lawyer has described as a ""thermonuclear device."" Assange has said the more than 100,000 people who have downloaded the file will receive the key to decoding it should anything happen to him or should the site be taken down. ""The insurance file will only be activated in the gravest of circumstances if WikiLeaks is no longer operational,"" Hrafnsson said.

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho will leave Real Madrid at the end of the season, the nine-time European champion's president Florentino Perez announced at a news conference on Monday. By his own admission Mourinho, who won one La Liga crown and a Copa del Rey with Real after taking charge in 2010, has endured what he has called his ""worst season"" in management. ""The club and manager agree that the timing is right to bring the relationship to an end,"" said Perez. ""On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Jose Mourinho for all his hard work over the last three years."" Mourinho will stay on for Real's remaining league fixtures, with an away trip to Real Sociedad on May 26 and a final home game at the Bernabeu on June 1 against Osasuna. Real will finish second in La Liga this year, trailing champions Barcelona by 12 points after 36 rounds. The parting of ways comes three days after Mourinho was sent off as Real lost the Copa del Rey final 2-1 to Atletico Madrid, a first defeat by their neighbors in 14 years. Real president Perez explained that the decision was a ""mutual agreement"", so paving the way for Mourinho to make a return to England's Premier League. ""I know in England I am loved,"" said the Portuguese last month. ""I know I am loved by some clubs, especially one."" The 50-year-old has been heavily linked with a return to former club Chelsea, where he won two Premier League titles and one FA Cup between 2004 and 2007. This year's Europa League champions will be without a coach on June 1, with the contract for interim manager Rafa Benitez expiring at the end of May. The decision to part ways via ""mutual agreement"" means neither Real nor Mourinho will have to pay one another millions of dollars in compensation had either of them broken the terms of their contract. After winning La Liga last year, Mourinho had signed a new four-year deal with the Merengues. The compensation package was believed to be a potential obstacle to his return to Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich paid Mourinho and his coaching staff some $27 million after his contract ended early in 2007. Paris Saint-Germain coach Carlo Ancelotti, who formerly led Chelsea himself, is rumored to be Mourinho's replacement. On Monday, Perez denied that any deal has been agreed to replace the former Inter Milan and Porto manager. ""We have no pre-contract signed with any managerial candidate,"" he said. ""It's something we'll have to look at in the coming days."" Ancelotti confirmed on Sunday that he had asked to leave the French champions, while the club's Qatari owners suggested he already had an agreement in place with Real. Desperate to be crowned champions of Europe for a record tenth time, with their last success dating back to 2002, Real Madrid turned to Mourinho just days after he lifted the Champions League with Inter Milan, ending a barren 35-year run for the Italians. Yet the Portuguese was beaten in the semifinals of the competition each year with Real, who were knocked out by Borussia Dortmund last month. Without a trophy in the two years prior to his arrival, Mourinho did at least return silverware to the club - winning the Copa del Rey in his first season in charge. In 2012, he guided Real Madrid to their first league crown in four years and amassed a record tally of 100 points along the way, so eclipsing the previous best held by great rivals Barcelona. A new deal soon followed but matters soured this season as Mourinho clashed with several star players, notably goalkeeper Iker Casillas -- who was demoted from the first team in recent months -- Sergio Ramos and Pepe. During his 176 games in charge, Mourinho has led Madrid to 127 victories - losing just 22 games along the way.","Jose Mourinho to leave Real Madrid at end of season .

"(CNN) -- Blizzard conditions whipped through Colorado on Friday, closing some 70 miles of interstate highway as heavy snow blanketed the region, according to the state's Department of Transportation. Officials reported a total of 600 flight cancellations at Denver International Airport, while Southwest Airlines canceled all inbound flights to Denver until 1 p.m. local time. Denver's airport -- which was reporting 5 inches of snow as of 10:45 a.m. -- deals with an average of 1,700 flights daily, according to airport spokeswoman Jenny Schiavone. Light snow started falling in Denver Thursday as residents across the state braced for the storm. Winter weather in your area? Share your story with iReport . Parts of the region could be plowing out from under 2 feet of snow and higher drifts by Saturday, when conditions are expected to gradually taper off. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning starting Thursday evening along the Interstate 25 corridor, including the city of Denver. Most areas east of the city are under a blizzard warning, as snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour were expected. The warnings will remain in effect into late Friday evening. The airport has nearly 300 pieces of snow equipment and a team of approximately 500 trained snow removal personnel who plan to work throughout the storm. An avalanche watch that had been posted for the Front Range and Sangre de Cristo mountains was expected to expire on Friday. But rapid heavy snow on top of the currently weak snowpack structure could also quickly raise the avalanche danger, according to The Colorado Avalanche Information Center website. The storm will be slow moving, so a prolonged period of snow will occur through early Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. With winds gusting 40 mph or higher, blowing snow will make visibility at times near zero and travel on roads could be treacherous, if not impossible. A number of school districts in the Denver Metro area announced closures on their websites, including Denver Public Schools, Jefferson County Public Schools and Douglas County Schools. High temperatures are expected to remain in the 30s into early next week. CNN's Adam Shivers contributed to this report .","NEW: 600 flights are canceled at Denver International Airport .

"(CNN) -- New England braced Friday for another major snowstorm, just two weeks after a mammoth record-breaking blizzard buried much of the region. The peak of the storm is forecast for Saturday night through midday Sunday. It is not expected to be as strong as the blizzard, but the storm could still pack a powerful punch, with between 6-18 inches of snow expected in some places. Interior portions of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine will see the heaviest snow, while the major metro areas of Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City are expecting rain. Boston is on the line between rain and snow. ""I've had enough. I'm ready for spring,"" said Elaine Cardinal, a resident of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, CNN affiliate WHDH reported. The storm, combined with high winds, could lead to downed trees and power lines. It will likely disrupt travel on roads and create delays at airports, before heading out over the Atlantic on Monday. ""Boston will be ready,"" said Mayor Thomas Menino. ""We will be out treating the roads before the snow, and our plows are ready to hit the streets this weekend."" Arctic tailgate . The winter storm is separate from one that hit 20 states this week, pummeling baseball fans in Wisconsin and dumping record snow in parts of Kansas. In spite of the snow, Milwaukee Brewers fans showed up at Miller Park to camp out for their shot to buy individual tickets for Brewers home games. Tickets go on sale Saturday. ""Had a little heat in there. Covered up with three sleeping bags. I was good,"" fan Randy Gordon told CNN affiliate WISN. Unlike some other tents, Gordon's survived a blustery night. Video showed a heavy snow falling, whipping plastic panels on tents set up outside the ballpark. A lone grill sat unused. Some snow records . Wichita, Kansas, saw its second-highest storm snowfall total on record with 14.2 inches over two days, the National Weather Service said. Some parts of the state saw even more snow, and Missouri was not far behind, with accumulations of around a foot in some places. Neighboring Nebraska got less snow than expected. The snow set a record at Kansas City International Airport with 9 inches falling in a single day. The old record was 5.1 inches set in 2010. The airport closed Thursday evening but reopened overnight. Some businesses and universities shut down Thursday as state officials urged residents to stay off the roads. The white blanket emptied out the streets of Kansas City. Buses ran until 1 p.m. Thursday, but driving them wasn't easy, as some got stuck. One bus trying to negotiate a left turn on a snow-covered street fishtailed, swiping down a light pole on a sidewalk. The incident was caught on camera and made its way to CNN affiliate KMBC. Bus service resumed Friday morning, and a handful of businesses reopened, KMBC reported. Silver lining . While causing mayhem elsewhere, the snowstorm turned out to be a welcome one to many Kansans and many others throughout the Great Plains who are suffering a drought. This is the third straight year of severe drought in the nation's breadbasket -- affecting not just Kansas, but also Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and a host of other farm-heavy states. The Kansas Department of Agriculture expects those conditions to continue into April, but near-record levels of snowfall will ease the problem and could accelerate the drought's end. ""It snows so infrequently here. Now we've been in a really bad drought for several years; really, really hot summer and just no moisture. So we're thrilled to see snow or ice -- whatever moisture we can get,"" Wichita resident Kristen Woodburn said. Ranchers embraced the storm, even though bitter cold snowstorms can be deadly during calving season. Frank Harper, a Kansas rancher from Sedgwick and the immediate past president of the Kansas Livestock Association, said the storm did cause more work for him because he had to bring his calves inside throughout the day to warm them up. ""The saving grace is the temperature. It's not too cold tonight, so we should be in good shape,"" Harper said, adding that he hasn't lost any calves in the storm. He even called the snowstorm a blessing for bringing good moisture to the winter wheat.

"(CNN) -- So much for April showers. A large and unexpected storm came barreling through the Northeast on Monday, threatening to drop more than a foot of snow in some places. Winter storm warnings remained in effect Monday night for parts of Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia, according to the National Weather Service. Earlier in the day, Newfield, New York, was reporting 10 inches of snow, while Ridgebury, Pennsylvania, had 8 inches. More accumulation was expected, especially in higher elevations. CNN iReporter Quinten Johnson sent in a photograph from Smethport, Pennsylvania, where a sign advertising a spring bazaar was covered in snow. ""We've already seen broken branches, and we are worried about the power lines,"" he said. ""Everyone is shaking their heads and they are like -- that is life. Everyone put away their shovels and snow plows and got out their lawnmowers, and it is snowing."" The blustery blast follows a mild winter that saw little snow and the warmest March on record. ""The last time we had a big snowstorm across the East Coast was back in October,"" when fall foliage was still on the trees, said CNN Meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""This has been a crazy, crazy winter"" in the region, he said. Is it snowing where you are? Share photos and videos. Snowstorms of this magnitude are very rare for this late in April. Forecasters expect record snowfall for this time of year in some areas. The highest recorded snowfall for Pittsburgh on this date was a half-inch in 1956. Up to 5 inches of snow were forecast for Monday, the weather service said. Snowfall rates in central Pennsylvania were expected to reach 1 inch per hour at times on Monday afternoon, said CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris. One ""bull's-eye is Dubois, Pennsylvania,"" he said. Another is Erie, Pennsylvania, where snowfalls totals along the southern side of Lake Erie could reach 16 inches, Morris said. ""The snow will be heavy and wet. The weight of the snow accumulating on trees combined with gusty winds could cause branches to come down on power lines, resulting in widespread power outages,"" he said. Pete Petriani, who heads Erie's Bureau of Streets, told CNN affiliate CNN affiliate WICU that depending on how heavily it snows, crews ""may have to do a little filling up of the back of trucks just for weight if we have to go out and plow. But if it comes, we'll be ready. It won't be a problem."" Snowfall amounts of 6 to 14 inches are forecast for the Allegheny Mountains of western Pennsylvania and near Lake Erie, the weather service said. The snow won't last long, Morris said. Temperatures are expected to rise into the 40s and 50s this week, with overnight lows remaining above freezing. Late Monday morning, one weather watcher reporting to CNN affiliate CNN affiliate WIVB had recorded 5 inches of snow near Boutwell Hill State Forest, southwest of Buffalo. A public works dispatcher said 4 to 6 inches of snow had accumulated ""on the hilltops, somewhat less in the valleys"" of Chautauqua County in western New York state by early Monday afternoon. ""We have a few limbs that have fallen, nothing too big yet, nothing we can't handle,"" said dispatcher Rick Heath. ""All of our (plow) trucks are out, and we're looking at more snow tonight."" The system rained out both the Mets and Yankees baseball games on Sunday. A ""pattern shift in the jet stream over the weekend"" caused the weather change, with temperatures dropping in the country's eastern half and spiking in the west, CNN Meteorologist Sarah Dillingham said. ""This trend will continue through Tuesday and Wednesday,"" though by Wednesday, temperatures will be working their way closer to normal, she said.

"(CNN) -- ""The United States joins the government of Afghanistan in strongly condemning the murder of Najia Sediqi, who was killed in a drive-by shooting Monday morning,"" read a press release issued December 12 by the U.S. State Department and distributed by the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. ""The United States will continue to stand side-by-side with women who are carrying on Najia's fight, the Afghan government and all Afghan people to ensure that the hard-won gains made by women in the recent years are protected and advanced."" Yet as the 2014 deadline for withdrawal of NATO forces approaches many Afghans and some Americans wonder how, exactly, those gains will be safeguarded. And Sediqi's death, along with three other killings of Afghan women in the past several weeks, shows both the gains and potential losses facing women in Afghanistan. On a recent Monday morning, gunmen opened fire on Sediqi while she walked to her office in broad daylight in eastern Laghman province. She was the acting head of the region's women's affairs department, which meant that she handled everything from helping abused women get to shelters to overseeing regional economic empowerment programs. Her title was ""acting"" because, as Afghanistan's TOLO TV reported, only five months earlier her predecessor, Hanifa Safi, was killed in a car bomb blast that also left her husband in a coma. Both Sediqi and Safi are among the hundreds of Afghan officials and leaders who have been targeted for assassination. The killings of the Afghan officials come alongside several weeks in which horrific cases of violence against women came to light in the Afghan press. In Kapisa province, a 16-year-old schoolgirl named Anisa was shot dead after leaving the Mahmoud Raqi Girls High School. Days later Afghan women leaders gathered in Kabul to demand justice and a government investigation into whether the Taliban, which are suspected in the killing, were responsible. Some activists saw a link between Anisa's killing and her work volunteering for a polio eradication campaign the Taliban are known to oppose. In Kunduz province, 2012 has been the ""most violent on record for women and girls,"" with more than a dozen killed. Most recently, a 14-year-old was killed by a gunman as she opened her door, allegedly in connection to a failed marriage proposal. Another schoolgirl, Giseena, was found slain, her throat slit in what appeared to be retribution for her father's refusal to agree to her marriage. The girl's killing came while she was on her way to collect water for her home near the Tajikstan border. One of the men the police detained in the investigation was her thwarted suitor. This collage of horrific violence against women tells two stories. First, for Afghan officials, death is a frighteningly present possibility at all times, and women serving other women are among the leading targets. A slew of high-profile female leaders have been killed, from Malalai Kakar of Kandahar's police force to Safia Ama Jan, who headed Kandahar's local ministry of women's affairs office, the same position Safi and Sediqi held in Laghman. And second, as a U.N. official in Afghanistan noted this month, while violence against women remains ""largely under-reported due to cultural restraints, social norms and taboos,"" the last year saw ""an actual increase in reporting of incidents of violence against women,"" with prosecutors and courts ""convicting more perpetrators for such crimes."" Certainly the high-visibility horrors that ""reach law enforcement, that actually get to the court, or receive public attention due to their egregious nature represent only the tip of the iceberg"" when it comes to crimes against women in Afghanistan, but the fact is that more women are bringing their abuse to the authorities and a thriving Afghan media are picking up their stories. This reality points to progress, say advocates for women. And they say they are coming to believe that these steps forward will not recede as the international troops withdraw. ""I don't see that Afghanistan can go backwards,"" says Manizha Naderi of Women for Afghan Women, an organization that runs shelters for abused women across the country. ""Too many people have experienced and felt the freedom of how it is to live in a safe environment. I really don't think the young people will ever go backwards."" Certainly the years since 2001 have been marked by dramatic changes for Afghan women. Nearly 3 million girls are in school, and more than 3,000 midwives across the country save expectant mothers' lives. Women make up a quarter of parliament, and civil society -- groups pushing for human rights and better education -- is filled with 20-, 30- and 40-something women pushing for their rights and their country's future. In many ways the stories of these women are part of a larger narrative the American public, exhausted by the country's longest-ever war, has nearly stopped hearing: Some women are making great progress -- and taking great risks -- while some others have seen their lives change little and continue to be plagued by violence and deadly abuse. Their fates are linked. As three prominent Afghan women entrepreneurs who appeared in Washington at the U.S. Institute of Peace this month made clear, the gains of some women lead to the gains of more. Homegrown role models help show what is possible to the girls of the next generation -- and their fathers. In the political sphere they show that women can lead and they stand up for girls such as Giseena. And in the economic realm these entrepreneurs are creating jobs for women and men in a country that has an unemployment rate estimated to top 35%. As these women push forward they bring others with them and bolster families' prospects in the process. But their advancement takes time. In America's recent election, neither side wanted to discuss in any depth either the stakes of the Afghanistan conflict or a sustainable future strategy for the war. Poll after poll shows Americans no longer think it is a war worth fighting. But Afghan women are still in the fight and will be long after 2014. And their battle for a more educated, richer, healthier country is one in which everyone has a stake.

"(CNN) -- Armed forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo beat back dozens of gunmen who stormed three key locations in the capital Monday. Armed men attacked the country's airport, state TV headquarters and army headquarters in Kinshasa. At least 34 assailants were killed, according to an Interior Ministry statement. The statement called on ""victims of this terrorist attack ... to know that the assailants had no other purpose than to create panic and terror on the eve of celebrations so important to our culture."" In response, it said that security had been beefed up in the capital. African Union Commission Chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma condemned the attacks, stressing the AU's commitment to support Congolese efforts to consolidate peace, security and stability.","Gunmen storm the airport, state TV headquarters and army headquarters .

"(CNN) -- ""This block used to be full of pretty little houses with well-kept yards."" When you spend any time in the newly bankrupt Detroit, you get very accustomed to hearing the words ""used to be."" It's a phrase often uttered by the old-timer looking fly in the red suit and crocodile shoes, who may actually remember when Detroit was the pinnacle of industry. But it's also said liberally by young men and women who have been hearing about Detroit's good old days from their parents and grandparents. The thing is, when you are in or around Detroit for awhile, ""used to be"" seeps into your brain through osmosis -- a simultaneously fuzzy and vivid collective memory that makes the Motor City the most nostalgic place in America. My parents grew up in Detroit and, like too many others, fled to the suburbs in 1967 after years of lingering racial tension boiled over and riots rocked the city. That meant that my sister, brother and I grew up 20 minutes from Detroit's 8 Mile, the border that, like a hammer, separates the current and ""ex"" Detroiters. My grandma stayed stubbornly behind on Faust Street on the Northwest side of Detroit. I would visit on weekends and go through the attic, looking for clues of what Detroit used to be. I especially relished the boxes of black and white snapshots of my parents in the 1960s. There they were in one shot, sipping cheap Cold Duck sparkling wine while throwing a party at La Plaisance, their high-rise in Lafayette Park, a sweet pad that overlooked the Stroh's brewery. In another one of my favorites, they stand with my older brother PJ, then 3 years old, in front of J.L. Hudson's, the beloved department store where the elevators had operators and the restaurant served salads with celery seed dressing. It was hard not to be curious and a bit envious of this city life that had eluded my siblings and me. In high school, my girlfriends and I made pilgrimages past 8 Mile Road every weekend to hang out with the city boys who went to the excellent U. of D. Jesuit High. They introduced us to Rock n' Bowl, a bowling alley that blasted New Order and let us drink the Mad Dog 20/20 we had bought illegally from a liquor store with bulletproof glass. The city felt dangerous, but we felt immortal. Opinion: How Detroit can rise again . I finally got my chance to live in Detroit in 2010, when I moved there to make a documentary about the city. Like many Americans, I had caught a whiff of optimism from Detroit, rumors about newcomers and artists descending on ""The D,"" news of urban planners and visionaries who had a plan to make it the city of the future. So I came with my crew, ready to roll, even an uplifting title in mind: ""Detroit Hustles Harder."" But finding the easy comeback story proved challenging. Although we did indeed encounter a small gang of young creative types and revitalization efforts inside Detroit's small Midtown area, beyond these few blocks of hope we found a citizenry fending entirely for itself. The truth is, we encountered an endless parade of grotesquerie in Detroit: A scary dude named Jay Thunderbolt, face disfigured from a gunshot, running a depraved strip club out of his deceased parents' home. A young man named Chuck trying to make it as an R&B artist when his house gets shot up by men with AK 47s on Christmas Eve, his calls to the Detroit Police unanswered. An old woman, head of a community cleanup group, robbed in her home in broad daylight. Illegal ""scrappers"" dismantling an old Cadillac repair shop just to get money for beer. An overworked demolition crew, hired by the city, brimming with tales of finding frozen bodies during routine jobs. We were flummoxed. Was our truth-telling becoming an exercise in exploitation? Where were the solutions we came for? It was time to stop asking who may save Detroit and instead ask Detroiters what compelled them to stay in this dysfunctional place. We started with Tommy Stephens, a former schoolteacher who, despite thinning crowds, opens the Raven Lounge every weekend on a bombed-out block in East Detroit. He stays because ""Detroit without a black-owned blues club just isn't Detroit anymore. And somebody's got to do it."" Along Michigan Avenue, we met George, who, after 30 years still slogs away at UAW Local 22, trying, often in vain, to keep jobs in the city. ""The middle class was born right here in Detroit,"" he said. And across town, there was David, who turned down an easy life in California to run the Detroit Opera House. ""If a city has no cultural institutions,"" he said, ""then is it still a city at all?"" RoboCop creator: Detroit shows film's fictional future is upon us . All these people had one thing in common: A deep sense of duty and unflagging belief that they need to do their part to preserve some of what had made Detroit a source of great pride for this country. With looming slashes to pensions and the threat of more service cutbacks that will come with Chapter 9, I wonder how many loyalists will question their sacrifices? The subjects of the film, which in the end we called ""Detropia,"" could not escape the deep nostalgia that compels them to stick with Detroit. This burden of the past haunts even the 20-something Crystal Starr, who spends her time off prowling through abandoned buildings, flashlight in one hand and a book about Detroit's history in the other. She'd climb to the top floors and sit in old kitchens, looking out the giant windows, panes long gone, trying to recall a time when this place was on the rise. ""It's weird,"" she said one day, looking out at the cityscape. ""I wasn't even here for the good times, but still, I have the memory of this place when it was bangin'."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Heidi Ewing.","Heidi Ewing: People in Detroit always talk about how pretty, how lively, things used to be .

"Boston (CNN) -- If you lived in South Boston from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s, you either loved or loathed Whitey Bulger. He could be colorful and generous, or, if you were his enemy, it is said he could be cutthroat and cruel. In a federal courtroom in Boston on Wednesday, James ""Whitey"" Bulger, who spent more than 16 years in hiding, finally faced the judicial system. Charged with murder in the killings of 19 people, Bulger, wearing jeans and a green, long-sleeved T-shirt, listened intently as prosecutors and his lawyers gave opening statements. With references to Robert Kennedy, La Cosa Nostra and the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland, the trial of Boston's most famous fugitive got under way. Bulger, 83, who prosecutors said was the head of the Irish mob in Boston for nearly two decades, sat slightly hunched, watching grainy black-and-white surveillance videos of him as he appeared more than 30 years ago, trimmer and only slightly balding. In one of the clips, Bulger punches the air and uses his fingers as guns as he animatedly talks to several mob associates. Describing Bulger as a ""hands-on killer,"" prosecutor Brian Kelly told the jury Bulger ""did the dirty work himself."" He described how Bulger ruthlessly shot one mob associate after attempts to strangle him failed because the rope he was using was too thick. ""You want one to the head?"" Bulger reportedly said. ""Yes, please,"" the victim was said to have answered. Describing another killing, Kelly said, ""Death came calling in the form of Whitey Bulger,"" who allegedly lured his victim to a phone booth and then opened fire, along with partner Steve ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi. The trial is expected to take up to three months and has the potential to reveal sensational details about the mob and FBI corruption, especially if Bulger chooses to testify. His attorney, J.W. Carney, portrayed Bulger not as a killer but as the head of a successful criminal enterprise of drug trafficking, extortion and loan sharking that brought in ""millions upon millions of dollars."" His client would not leave his ""comfort zone"" to kill someone in another state, as prosecutors allege. Carney took aim at rogue FBI agents and police who were on ""Bulger's payroll,"" both to protect him and to alert him to impending wiretaps, surveillance efforts and indictments. The government will try to show that Bulger committed crimes while working as an informant for the FBI, revealing to the feds the mafia's secrets and corrupting them in the process to ignore his crimes. Bulger never worked as an informant, Carney said, adding that ""the worst thing"" a person of Irish descent could do would be to inform. But the defense acknowledged for the first time that Bulger was involved in drug trafficking and that he made millions of dollars from it. The defense blamed the cooperating witnesses for the killings, saying they are falsely blaming Bulger for their own acts. Carney urged the jurors to be skeptical about the credibility of the government's planned witnesses. ""Would you believe them beyond a reasonable doubt when you add the unbelievable incentives the government has given them?"" he asked. Bulger rose to the top of the notorious Winter Hill gang, prosecutors say, before he went into hiding for more than 16 years after an FBI agent told him in December 1994 that he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. But Carney claimed Bulger fled not because he was given the heads up on an impending indictment, but because he heard on the radio that federal agents were rounding up mobsters, an account heard for the first time ever. Bulger was captured in Santa Monica, California, two years ago, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city. At his July 2011 arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts. In the pretrial hearings, Bulger had argued he was given immunity by the FBI and a former prosecutor. A judge dismissed the claim, saying any purported immunity was not a defense against the crimes Bulger faces. Besides the slayings, Bulger is accused of using violence, force and threats to shake down South Boston's bookmakers, loan sharks and drug dealers. The Irish mob allegedly laundered its ill-gotten gains through liquor stores, bars and other property it owned in South Boston. ""The guy is a sociopathic killer,"" Tom Foley, the organized crime investigator who spent most of his career with the Massachusetts State Police trying to put Bulger behind bars, told CNN in 2011. ""He loved that type of life. He's one of the hardest and cruelest individuals that operated in the Boston area. He's a bad, bad, bad guy."" Tracking suspects down: Some landmark U.S. manhunts . Former Boston Globe reporter Dick Lehr, who wrote a book about Bulger, described him as a coldblooded killer whose gang went to lengths to avoid detection. ""When they killed someone -- this is pre-DNA -- they pulled the teeth out, cut the fingers off, tried to make it so the victims, if they were discovered from their graves, couldn't be identified. There's just no bottom. It doesn't get much uglier than someone like Whitey Bulger,"" Lehr said. Few people knew Bulger was a rat. FBI agent John Connolly, who was raised in the same housing projects as Bulger, cut a deal with the alleged mob figure in 1975. Bulger would give information about the Italian mob -- the FBI's prime target -- authorities said. Protected by the rogue FBI agent, Bulger got names of other informants who had dirt on him and rival gang members, people he is accused of killing. He knew when police were watching, knew when they were moving in. After he fled Boston, he spent more than a decade on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list before his 2011 capture. His girlfriend, Catherine Greig, was sentenced to eight years in prison last summer for helping him evade capture. Connolly is serving a 50-year sentence for second-degree murder and racketeering. Prosecutors plan to call as many as 80 witnesses. Among them will be Connolly and Flemmi, who was also an informant for the FBI. He is serving life terms without parole but avoided a possible death sentence by cooperating in the hunt for Bulger. On Wednesday, Carney called Flemmi ""a psychopath without a conscience."" Other former Bulger associates are expected to be called by the prosecution. Last August, Carney said his client planned to testify.

"Washington (CNN) -- Initial legal challenges to the government's sweeping electronic surveillance programs began to emerge with one couple alleging they were singled out for monitoring because they criticized the U.S. military. A $3 billion class-action complaint by Mary Ann and Charles Strange of Philadelphia was believed to be the first civil case against the Obama administration since last week's blockbuster disclosure in published reports about the super-secret National Security Agency surveillance efforts. The disclosures in the Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post have outraged civil libertarians, political liberals and some conservatives, and triggered new policy and privacy debates. But legal challenges are expected to be uphill fights in federal court. The Stranges' suit and another by civil liberties groups this week centered on phone monitoring in which the NSA is said to have received data from a major telecommunications company. ""This dragnet program is surely one of the largest surveillance efforts ever launched by a democratic government against its own citizens,"" said Jameel Jaffer, said legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, which joined with the New York Civil Liberties Union in filing suit. They argue the program, which the White House says is carefully and lawfully applied and a necessary tool in fighting terrorism, violates the First Amendment free speech rights as well as the Fourth Amendment right to privacy. No sign of NSA leaker as U.S. investigation builds steam . The complaint also charges the initiative exceeds the authority that Congress provided through the Patriot Act, which was a response to the September 2001 al Qaeda attacks against the United States. The Stranges' son, Navy SEAL Michael Strange, was killed in a 2011 helicopter crash in Afghanistan. Along with the government watchdog Freedom Watch, the Stranges say their phone records were illegally accessed by domestic spy agencies because they ""have been vocal about their criticism of President Obama as commander-in-chief, his administration, and the U.S. military."" A former NSA computer contractor, Edward Snowden, has admitted to leaking details about government surveillance activities, telling a British reporter that Verizon Business Network was ordered by a secret federal court to turn over details of phone calls published from April 25 to July 19. Intelligence officials later confirmed the program, which analysts say likely covers all U.S. carriers. That disclosure and a second involving NSA surveillance of e-mails have reignited debate about government collection of personal data in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals. Civil liberties advocates say the measures are unacceptable intrusions. But supporters say they are legal and have yielded evidence that has helped stop terror plots. The Stranges have sued Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, NSA director Keith Alexander, Verizon, government agencies and the judge who signed the secret order on phone monitoring. House has tough questions about secret surveillance . In the complaint, the couple claims their privacy and free speech rights were compromised by the alleged ""criminal acts."" The alleged surveillance ""violated plaintiffs' and class members' right of freedom of association by making them and others weary and fearful of contacting other persons and entities via cell phone out of fear of the misuse of government power and retaliation against these persons and entities who challenge the misuse of government power."" The lawsuit offered no specifics of any targeted surveillance. The Stranges based their allegations on ""information and belief."" They previously filed a lawsuit against the government over the Afghanistan copter crash that killed 38 people. Strange, 25, and fellow members of his elite SEAL Team VI were killed, along with other American Special Forces, National Guard, and Afghan military troops. The Stranges and other families of those killed have alleged a government cover-up, questioning the official story of the incident. The Stranges say that questioning has made them targets for surveillance. There was no initial response to the surveillance lawsuit from administration officials, including the Justice Department. Freedom Watch head Larry Klayman said in a statement it was necessary to hold the government accountable. ""We cannot allow a 'Big Brother,' Orwellian government spy on the American people to access their confidential communications to effectively turn 'citizens into its prisoners.'"" he said. ""That is why this class action lawsuit, which all Verizon users are welcome to join, no matter what their political persuasion, will serve as the vehicle for a second American revolution, one that is carried out peacefully and legally, but also forcefully."" Other lawsuits over the NSA surveillance program could be filed in coming days by other telecommunications customers. The ACLU, other privacy advocates and individual telecom customers have challenged various National Security Agency programs in the past, but have not been successful in federal courts. The Supreme Court in February blocked a lawsuit over sweeping electronic eavesdropping on Americans potentially linked to suspected foreign terrorists and spies. The Philadelphia case is Klayman v. Obama (1:13-cv-851). Second term mostly drama for Obama .","Philadelphia couple, ACLU file lawsuits over surveillance .

"(CNN) -- British graffiti artist Banksy has launched an art exhibition in Bethlehem that he hopes will focus attention on the poverty of the West Bank and draw tourists to the traditional birthplace of Christianity. A Palestinian man walks by Banksy's camel, painted on the security barrier near Bethlehem. As part of the project, Banksy has adorned the controversial security barrier around the West Bank town with spray paint and plaster works of art in a comment on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel says the purpose of the barrier is to prevent terrorist attacks being launched from the West Bank. Palestinian leaders however say the barrier amounts to an illegitimate land grab by Israelis, setting unilateral borders for an eventual Palestinian state. The new exhibition, called ""Santa's Ghetto Bethlehem 2007,"" is a collaboration by artists who say they are trying to revitalize tourism to Bethlehem and ""offer the ink-stained hand of friendship to ordinary people in an extraordinary situation."" Banksy's sketches on the security barrier flow towards Manger Square, across from the Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born. His images include a dove wearing a bullet-proof vest, a young girl in a frilly pink dress frisking a soldier and a donkey being checked for its identity papers. According to the Web site for Santa's Ghetto, Banksy thought he was making an ironic commentary with the donkey picture, but locals told him the animals are frequently asked for ID papers. Santa's Ghetto typically operates during the month of December out of a small store on Oxford Street in London, where underground artists showcase their work. Banksy, who started the initiative six years ago, says: ""I felt the spirit of Christmas was being lost. It was becoming increasingly uncommercialized and more and more to do with religion, so we decided to open our own shop and sell pointless stuff you didn't need."" His exhibition in Bethlehem is rife with the same satirical sentiments. Beyond the barrier graffiti, the work of Santa's Ghetto's diverse artists spread across three floors of a building in Manger Square. Inside, examples include a painting by Palestinian artist Suleiman Mansour in which a man carries the city of Jerusalem on his back, and London artist Peter Kennard's montage of dollar bills printed on pages from the Jerusalem Post. Proceeds from Santa's Ghetto sales go to charity. Little is known about Banksy other than that he was born in Bristol, western England. Collections of his original work, which attract the likes of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, have sold for more than $1 million (almost £500,000). Banksy's previous political statements have included hanging a picture of a cave man pushing a shopping cart in the British Museum and placing a doll of a Guantanamo Bay detainee in Disneyland. The doll was removed, but the ""primitive"" portrait became a part of the British Museum's permanent collection. Tourism -- even in the traditional Christmas peak season -- has been hard hit in recent years with Israeli checkpoints keeping most of the local Palestinians in and all but the most determined tourists out. As a result levels of unemployment are high. Speaking through the Web site, Banksy says tourists need not fear visiting the West Bank.

"(CNN) -- The recent email in my in-box was simply titled ""Trabajo,"" which in Spanish means ""work"" or ""a job."" It was from Valentin Garcia - a jobless man we met in 2012 telling us, rather excitedly, that he'd gotten a job, at last. No small feat in Spain's economic crisis. He'd been out of work for more than three years before getting hired as a tree trimmer on a city work crew. We met Garcia, who's done all sorts of manual jobs, in June 2012 at a Red Cross food bank where he came to get a handout. He'd lost his job as a waiter two years earlier. There was a line at the Red Cross site in the Madrid suburb of Tres Cantos, and the down-on-their-luck Spaniards and immigrants waiting there didn't want to talk to CNN about their plight. Garcia also initially declined. He was concerned about how it would look on TV but eventually he told us that a TV interview might help him be seen by potential employers. Read more: Thousands protests law in Spain . We said we could only tell his story, but not guarantee he'd get a job. He agreed to talk. ""If there is just part-time work, fine, at any hour, any job, even if I have to learn it from scratch,"" Garcia told us then. And then described the difficulties for a single man -- he was then 48 -- in Spain's crisis. His jobless benefits had run out, he had almost no savings, and he said he was really getting by thanks to help from his elderly mother. In October 2012, we covered the Spanish Red Cross's annual fundraiser that dates back more than a century and whose proceeds usually go to help people in disaster zones abroad. But for the first time, the money was being used to ease suffering at home, in Spain. We checked in with Garcia again. He still had no job, and was not very optimistic. Then came the joyous email about his new job. We went to update our story on him and found out there's some good news and some bad news. Yes, he's working, but only for six months. At 50, he's learning all about tree trimming, earning minimum wage -- about $900 a month. Watch more: Can Spain wine ease country's pain? ""It's a bit boring,"" Garcia said during a break. ""But it's what there is. Since they've given you an opportunity, at least you're busy."" The Spanish government says the nation has been busy trying to get out of the economic crisis, and Spain's unemployment rate is finally starting to decline, although it's still 26% with 5.9 million people jobless. Unions, citing government figures that the Ministry of Labor confirms, say about 1.2 million jobs are being created in Spain each month, but that most of them are part time and temporary. And a third of them last less than four hours a day. Garcia works five hours. He'd like to get more work but thinks his chances are slim because, he says, most companies aren't hiring older workers. He says he's too old to learn languages and move abroad, as many college-educated Spaniards, and even some without a degree, are doing, in search of work. The mayor of Tres Cantos, the prosperous suburb that employs Garcia, is from Spain's ruling conservative party, which has been touting the economic recovery -- including the temporary jobs. ""No, they're not the solution to Spain's problem of more than five million people unemployed,"" said Mayor Jesus Moreno. ""But they're important so the long-term jobless can get training.

Garcia, sitting on a bench and eating a sandwich, told us, ""I'd like to change places with the politicians for a month or two so they could see what it's like to suffer in the economic crisis.""

"(CNN) -- A violent crash on a dirt track in New Jersey has claimed the life of race car driver Jason Leffler, a NASCAR veteran lauded by fellow racers as a fierce and versatile competitor. Leffler, 37, died Wednesday, a little more than three months after returning to the world of short-track open-wheel racing after focusing on NASCAR circuits for more than a decade, according to his website. ""Sitting here in disbelief. ... All I can think about is Charlie,"" NASCAR racer Elliott Sadler said, referring to Leffler's 5-year-old son. Leffler's death at Bridgeport Speedway in Swedesboro, New Jersey, came during a qualifying race during the Night of Wings event, a 25-lap race for sprint cars equipped with stabilizing wings. Sprint cars are high-powered cars that usually run on dirt or paved oval tracks. Leffler was on the fourth turn of the preliminary heat when his car left the banked dirt track and flipped several times down the front straightaway, the South Jersey Times newspaper reported, citing witnesses. He had to be pulled from the vehicle, the newspaper said. ""NASCAR extends its thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies to the family of Jason Leffler who passed away earlier this evening,"" NASCAR said Wednesday in a statement. ""For more than a decade, Jason was a fierce competitor in our sport and he will be missed."" Condolences poured in from fellow drivers. ""Lost a good guy tonight in Jason Leffler. Prayers with your family!"" racer Bobby Labonte said in a Twitter post. ""My thoughts and prayers are with Jason's family and friends,"" driver Jeff Burton posted. ""Breaks my heart thinking of his little boy."" Leffler began racing when was 12 years old, according to his website, and went on to win four U.S. Auto Club racing championships -- including three back-to-back championships from 1997 to 1999 -- and a place in the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame. In 2000, he finished 17th in the Indianapolis 500. He switched his racing focus that same year to NASCAR's Nationwide Series and later to the Camping World Truck Series in 2002, according to his website. The Long Beach, California, native won two Nationwide Series races and finished in the top 10 in points for six consecutive years, according to his website. He decided to return to dirt racing for 2013, planning to compete in up to 65 sprint car races. ""I've got a lot of learning to do,"" he was quoted as saying on his website in March. ""It's cool to be able to race 3 times a week and figure things out."" Sprint car racing can be a dangerous sport, and accidents are not infrequent. A 22-year-old driver died three weeks ago in a crash at Bloomington Speedway in Monroe County, Indiana, CNN affiliate WTHR reported. In March, two spectators died when a car veered off-track at Marysville Raceway Park, outside Sacramento, California. In that incident, a car hit two tractor tires, sending it airborne and striking two spectators, a 68-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy. The driver was uninjured. In 2012, a 20-year-old driver died when his sprint car hit the wall at Calistoga Speedway in Napa County, California, according to the Napa Valley Register.

"(CNN) -- The death toll from the destructive typhoon that savaged the southern Philippines last week has climbed above 700, authorities said Tuesday, warning that the final number may be much higher. Nearly 900 people are still unaccounted for in the aftermath of Typhoon Bopha, the strongest and deadliest storm to hit the Philippines this year, according to the country's emergency management agency. The numbers of dead and missing have risen drastically during the past several days as government officials have gathered information from isolated areas where the scale of the devastation was previously unknown. Both of the grim totals are likely to increase further this week, said Benito Ramos, head of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, the emergency agency. Search and rescue efforts are continuing, he said, despite the declining chances of finding people alive. ""We are still hoping against hope that there are still survivors,"" he said by telephone, adding that some of the hundreds of fishermen reported missing after the storm could yet be found sheltering on small islands out at sea. If only a few of those missing are found alive, Bopha could eventually prove more deadly than Tropical Storm Washi, which killed 1,268 people a year ago. But its toll would still remain far below that of Tropical Storm Thelma, the country's most lethal storm on record that left more than 5,000 people dead in 1991. The worst of the death and destruction from Bopha took place on the southern island of Mindanao, where the storm hit first and hardest with gusts as strong as 220 kph (138 mph). In the provinces of Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental, the heavy rain set off flash floods and landslides that engulfed whole neighborhoods, and the winds ripped apart fragile houses. Many residents were unprepared or unaware of the typhoon's threat to the region, which rarely experiences tropical cyclones of such magnitude. Bopha, known locally as Pablo, was the most powerful typhoon to hit Mindanao in decades. Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental account for the vast majority of the 714 people killed and for most of the 890 still missing nationwide. A week after the typhoon struck, survivors there are facing many obstacles to rebuilding their lives. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in evacuation centers or relying on the government for other kinds of assistance, according to the national emergency agency. And hundreds more, who have not been able to find refuge in the centers, line the roads of Compostela Valley, said Arlo Ramos, a relief worker in the region for World Vision, a humanitarian group. ""During the daytime, they stand along the side of the road, they ask for food,"" he said. At night, they sleep in small, makeshift shelters cobbled together out of bits of wood and canvas scavenged from the debris, he added. In New Bataan, the town at the heart of the devastation, dead bodies are still being found and lined up in an open space in front of an evacuation center, according to Arlo Ramos. When aid workers or government officials arrive in the town, he said, residents crowd around them, hoping to get the food or water they desperately need, he said. The region's prospects for longer term recovery are also bleak, since the storm laid waste to a great deal of the agricultural land on which many residents rely for their livelihood. ""Farming communities have been the worst hit and it could take many years for them to fully recover,"" said Paul del Rosario, the humanitarian program coordinator for the charity Oxfam. The United Nations has announced a global appeal to try to raise $65 million to help those affected by the storm. And Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, who visited New Bataan and other severely affected areas last week, has declared a state of national calamity, which releases emergency funds and puts price controls on basic goods. Finger pointing has also begun among officials over the reasons why so many people lost their lives. Local authorities have been criticized for not anticipating the scale of the destruction. And a member of Aquino's government, Environment Secretary Ramon Paje, has said illegal logging and mining contributed to the landslides and flash floods on Mindanao. Paje has implemented measures aimed at clamping down on logging in Philippine forests. ""Several quarters are criticizing the declaration of a total log ban but look at what happened,"" he said last week, referring to the devastation on Mindanao, according to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN. ""It is now proving that we really must stop timber harvesting, especially in our natural forests.""","The numbers of dead and missing are likely to rise further, an official warns .

"(CNN) -- Despite the intense scrutiny and heated emotions surrounding his client's case, George Zimmerman's defense attorney says he has no immediate plans to ask for a change of venue or to put his client on the stand. Zimmerman's murder trial will begin with jury selection Monday in Seminole County, Florida -- the same county where 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was fatally shot last year. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said requesting a change of venue is only relevant if lawyers can't pick a suitable jury. ""If we can pick a jury in Seminole County, this is where the incident occurred and this is where the case should be decided,"" O'Mara told HLN's Jean Casarez. O'Mara also said there are no immediate plans for Zimmerman to testify. ""The defense doesn't have to present any evidence, any piece of paper, any witness including the defendant. It is all up to whether or not the State can prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" he said. ""In this case, they have to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. So if they get past all of that, such that we decide to put some witnesses on, we'll decide whether or not George should take the stand."" He noted that Zimmerman has already given several voluntary statements to police, ""so all of that information is already out there.""

"(CNN) -- There are cool whites instead of lush greens, herbal showers instead of holes-in-one and empowering juices not intoxicating malt whiskies on the bar menu. A sleek health club in central London and Muirfield -- home to golf's 2013 British Open -- might not have much in common but they are agreed on one thing -- they only accept members of a certain sex. Grace Belgravia is one of a few female private members club in the U.K. while, north of the Scottish border, Muirfield is notorious for its men-only membership code. Women are invited to play at the historic club as visitors or guests but cannot become members, a policy the club has no plans to change. But is there still a place in the 21st Century's equality-conscious society for single-gender institutions? ""Why should there not be?"" Kate Percival, co-founder of Grace Belgravia told CNN in the club's tranquil environs. ""It's not anti-feminist, it's not anti-men. ""It's just a fact that some women, not all women, feel more comfortable in an environment where there are other women around. Battle of the testosterone . ""The women that come here know it's a very relaxing place because the men are not here. This becomes a haven, a sanctuary from the battle of the testosterone."" At Muirfield the ""battle of testosterone"" will be very much in evidence when golf's oldest major tees off on Thursday and no-one watching the prestigious tournament will be particularly troubled by this primeval male instinct. But when the Open is awarded to Muirfield -- one of three clubs along with Royal St George's and Royal Troon on the Open rotation which still operate men-only membership policies -- there is always intense criticism. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has publicly pronounced his disapproval of the male-only policy by effectively boycotting the event. There is a view that holding a global tournament at a club which does not accept female members vindicates Victorian values of patriarchy and keeps women in their place. But Percival does not necessarily agree -- instead she argues that male-only or female-only policies represent an expression of freedom, not constraint. ""If what people are trying to say is that it is putting women down because they aren't allowed to join, I don't think that's the issue,"" Percival said. ""If men want to have their own club by all means have their own club, if women want to similarly. ""If some men choose to play golf only with men that is absolutely fine. No-one is forcing anyone to go to an all-male club. ""When Grace Belgravia opened there was just one comment right at the beginning when a journalist said this was anti-feminist. ""I think the point that they were trying to make is that women have striven for hundreds of years to have equality and someone is going backwards by having a women's only club but I just couldn't understand that argument. ""For me, this is really liberating and really being independent of thought, saying no, we want our space because there are lots of issues we want to take up."" Golf economics . Nestled at the back of the19th Century village of Lundin Links is a parkland golf course, home to the Lundin Ladies Golf Club -- which claims to be the oldest female-only golf club in the world and the only one in Scotland. The club was established in 1891 as a separate entity from the nearby men's club and is now run solely by women as a picturesque place for a game of nine holes. Men can play on the ladies' course but only women can become members. ""It's a nice welcoming environment for ladies getting into golf,"" club captain Anne Dobie told CNN. ""We have beautiful views up to the north."" But with a dwindling number of local ladies that play golf, Dobie concedes that it might be difficult to survive as a single-gender club. ""A lot of our members are quite elderly,"" Dobie explained. ""It's the way that things are now. Young women are working and working longer. That's a bit of a downside. ""Most clubs are just a ladies section in a mixed club so it does mean there are considerable extra responsibilities such as staff, ground maintenance, starters and two greenkeepers. ""Financially it's becoming more difficult as time goes on as we don't have the numbers. The older ladies here will talk about when they used to come up to pay to play on the course in the summer holidays. ""People used to be desperate to play and queue up but we're not in that favorable position now. ""We are finding it harder to make ends meet and the longevity of the club probably is not too rosy."" Just up the road at the Lundin Links men's club -- where a weekday round costs $120 -- the scenario could not be more different. ""There is no comparison with our wealth and the wealth that is in the men's club,"" Dobie added. ""They still have a waiting list for membership. They are in a very fortunate position financially. ""The ladies' club might just be sustainable if we have a closer relationship with the men's club."" In fact, Dobie argues that closer relationships between men and women in the game of golf -- and beyond -- could be the solution to the furore over the female-ban at Muirfield. ""We may all have to give in to the point where all clubs are mixed,"" she said. ""It's the way things are going in society and in sports. ""I don't see that sports clubs have any reason to be any different. It's just equality in all things. ""In time, what we're doing just now will look pretty archaic to future generations when they see that certain people were excluded from certain golf clubs."" Historic hangover . Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, which organizes the Open, argues that the single-sex policy of Muirfield -- and others -- is a historic hangover. ""Single sex clubs are still something of a feature in Scotland,"" Dawson told CNN. ""It's a historical thing actually because women came to the game of golf when men were already established. ""It's something that is reported as an issue far more than the actuality of it. We have a situation where about 1% of clubs in the UK are single sex - it's a very small number. ""Golf has moved on from the stereotypes of 50 years ago. It is chalk and cheese and we'll just have to wait and see what happens in the year ahead."" In Windsor in the south of England there is already a positive example of a single-gender club that has happily merged into mixed living. The Sunningdale Ladies' Golf Club -- which can count the late Queen Mother as its club captain in the 1932 -- was established in 1902 as a place for women to play the game. It took more than a century for men to be admitted as members -- but club secretary Simon Sheppard says the advantages of mixed membership are self evident. Good mixers . ""There are ladies out there who do not want to join a ladies-only club,"" Sheppard told CNN. ""Then there are other people who might feel intimidated by a male-dominated environment. Here those people might feel less intimidated. ""Society is mixed so there is no reason for this club not to be. The best friends I've made, I've made playing golf. ""I play golf here with my wife very happily and afterwards we have a damn good Sunday lunch in the clubhouse."" Whether it is tee for two or tea for two, the concept is one that Percival is also happy to endorse, even within the walls of female oasis Grace Belgravia. ""Invariably in the evening, our members invite male partners in for drinks or an event or lectures,"" Percival explained. ""A lot of women love the fact that they have their own space during the day but it's nice to have a mix of things. ""It's fine to invite the opposite sex in as guests -- it's quite civilized as men and women do sit side by side -- but if the core of the club is also about single-sex, that's fine too."" And if golf's global organizers wanted to make a stand for equality they could always hold the men's Open at a ladies-only golf club. Wouldn't that equal things out? ""The Open, held at a ladies club?"" Dobie ponders incredulously. "" It will NEVER happen.""","British Open - one of golf's four majors - starts Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Cicely Tyson's return to Broadway after three decades earned the actress a Tony on Sunday night. Tyson's acceptance speech for best actress in a play was an emotional highlight of the American Theatre Wing's 67th annual Tony Awards broadcast live from New York's Radio City Music Hall. Pop singer Cyndi Lauper won a Tony for writing the 15-song score for ""Kinky Boots,"" which led the night with six Tonys. Neil Patrick Harris didn't carry home a trophy, but he did carry the show in his fourth year as a singing-dancing host. Harris' opening number included scores of performers from current Broadway shows -- and a cameo by boxer Mike Tyson, who stars in his one-man show ""Undisputed,"" singing and dancing in a white tux. His musical tribute to Broadway, which has been a trademark for Harris, including a disappearing trick straight out of David Copperfield's Vegas show. ""We sing live eight shows a week, check it,"" Harris sang. ""We don't need close ups to prove we're singing live."" Harris did provide a gross-out moment by tongue-kissing Sandy, the dog from ""Annie."" ""You do know I'm in a relationship, right?"" he said to the dog. It appeared to be an unrehearsed moment spurred by Sandy's affectionate licking of Harris' face. Harris ended the show with another trademark -- a closing ""Tony hits lists"" rap written as the show progressed. Tyson's elegant acceptance was at the top of the list. Her best actress Tony is for her portrayal of a widow returning to her hometown in ""The Trip to Bountiful."" ""It's been 30 years since I stood on stage,"" Tyson said. ""I really didn't think it would happen again in my lifetime and I was pretty comfortable with that, except that I had this burning desire to do just one more. One more great role, I said. I didn't want to be greedy. I just wanted one more, and it came to me with no effort on my part."" She didn't miss a beat when the orchestra began playing ""Give My Regards to Broadway"" -- the musical cue that her 75 seconds was up. ""Please wrap it up, it says,"" she said. ""Well, that's exactly what you did with me. You wrapped me up in your arms after 30 years and now I can go home with a Tony."" Tyson is 79, according to her official biography. Some news reports put her age at 88. Lauper's Tony win puts her in the exclusive ""G.E.T."" club of performers who have a Grammy, Emmy and Tony. ""I can't say I wasn't practicing in front of the shower curtain for a couple days for this speech,"" she said. ""I want to thank Broadway."" Lauper also performed ""True Colors"" while surrounded by candles for the show's ""in memorium"" tribute to theater veterans who died in the past year. ""Kinky Boots"" star Billy Porter won best actor in a musical for his role as a drag queen in a shoe factory. If it had been a category, Porter also would have won for most excited acceptance speech, in which he said seeing ""Dreamgirls"" as a child was a big inspiration for his career. Two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks brought Hollywood star power to the theater, but his ""Lucky Guy"" role -- nominated for best actor in a play -- was not lucky enough to win. Tracy Letts, who already had a Tony as a playwright, won the category for playing George in the revival of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" While ""Motown The Musical"" lost out in all four categories for which it was nominated, the show likely gained fans with the musical medley performed by its cast during the Tony Awards. It included a spot-on replica of a young Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5.","Cyndi Lauper gets a Tony to go with her Grammys and Emmy .

"New York (CNN) -- Nearly eight months after Superstorm Sandy devastated low-lying areas, Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Tuesday for a $20 billion system of flood walls, levees and other measures to protect vulnerable regions from storms and the effects of climate change. A 400-page report outlines ""250 concrete recommendations for how to confront the risks we face, and build a stronger, more resilient city,"" Bloomberg said at a press conference. ""Sandy -- which tragically took the lives of 43 New Yorkers -- made it all too clear that, no matter how far we've come, we still face real, immediate threats,"" said Bloomberg. ""As bad as Sandy was, future storms could be even worse. In fact, because of rising temperatures and sea levels. Even a storm that's not as large as Sandy could -- down the road -- be even more destructive,"" Bloomberg told reporters. While the idea of long-term climate change is a controversial notion politically, it's accepted as fact by most researchers. The plan includes changes to the city's construction codes that will raise standards for new construction and infrastructure. Proposed protections include surge barriers and flood walls in Manhattan's Lower East Side, Chinatown, the Financial District, parts of East Harlem and the Bronx, and Brooklyn's Redhook. The plan details ways to strengthen coastal defenses, utilities, fuel and food supply, health care, transportation and telecommunications. Analysis will include infrastructure and risks faced due to climate change, according to a city press release. The plan outlines working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen dune systems and beaches across Staten Island, South Brooklyn and Queens, including Coney Island and along the Rockaways. ""Why shouldn't a tidal barrier in Coney Island also be a bridge to a new, protected waterfront park?"" the mayor said. ""Why shouldn't we integrate our coastal defenses into beautiful waterfront esplanades? Why can't a fortification that protects Lower Manhattan against rising seas -- also be the foundation for a vibrant new neighborhood?"" The price tag of these proposed projects is tentatively $20 billion. Bloomberg said money already allocated for Sandy relief provides $10 billion. The city could receive at least $5 billion more from the federal government and still more from the state. Bloomberg has been mayor since 2002, and his final term is up at the end of the year. ""The plan is incredibly ambitious -- and much of the work will extend far beyond the next 203 days. But we refused to pass responsibility for creating a plan onto the next administration,"" he said. ""This is urgent work -- and it must begin now.""","Mayor wants $20 billion to combat storms, climate change .

"(CNN) -- Istanbul's Gezi Park has seen days of sheer madness, but they have been punctuated with moments of beauty and joy. The melancholic sounds from a grand piano echoed through the park in a moment of welcome serenity Wednesday. One that traveled all the way from Germany to Turkey, so its owner could play a song dedicated to the protesters. Soon afterward, a video of the performance went viral on Facebook. Demonstrators gathered around in the darkness as Davide Martello clinked out his original composition ""Lightsoldiers."" Masks and scarves used earlier to weaken the sting of teargas dangled from their necks. Hard hats used to abate the thud of flying gas canisters and stones dotted heads in the audience. A cultural microcosm . The slice of life amid the mayhem was not a rare moment. In between their protest chants and water cannon dousings, demonstrators have spent the last two weeks camping out in one of the inner city's last green spaces -- the charming park they are attempting to save from bull dozers. The have transformed it into a cultural microcosm. Protesters have set up stations offering free food. Hordes of demonstrators have stood on pastel yoga mats in the sunlight, stretching their limbs to the sky. Others have sprawled out on the ground in clusters, musing over books on loan from an impromptu library. At least one couple has tied the knot. The violent eruptions of stone-throwing protesters clashing with police have led nearby galleries to shutter and have nixed scheduled concerts, local newspaper Hurriyet reported. As a result, many artists have strolled into the park to participate in the demonstrations. Popular TV actors have joined them, Hurriyet said. 'Good night Istanbul' Martello, who built his piano himself and outfitted it with lighting and heating to allow him to play in the dark and the cold, dragged it down in a trailer from his hometown of Konstanz, Germany. On his way, he stopped in Bulgaria and Kosovo to give outdoor concerts there. Aside from ""Lightsoldiers,"" he also tapped out a rendition of Paul McCartney's ""Let it be."" ""And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me. Shine until tomorrow, let it be,"" he sang. He left a message on Facebook for the protesters. ""Good night Istanbul, tomorrow I will playing again on the square for freedom and our rights."" Tear gas permitting.","Protesters have transformed Istanbul's Gezi Park into a cultural enclave .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China remained tight-lipped Thursday about its stance on NSA leaker Edward Snowden, who is believed to be holed up in a safe house somewhere in the semiautonomous territory of Hong Kong. Snowden provided fresh fuel Wednesday for the controversy he has sparked, telling a Hong Kong newspaper that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking networks around the world for years, including hundreds of computers in China. In the interview with the South China Morning Post, he also said he plans to stay in Hong Kong to fight any attempt to force him to return to the United States because he has ""faith in Hong Kong's rule of law."" His comments come as the FBI is investigating his case. His presence in the southern Chinese territory, which has a separate system of government from the mainland, has raised questions about how an effort by the U.S. government to extradite him would unfold and what role Beijing might play in the process. But China's first official comment on the matter gave away no clues. ""We have no information to offer at the moment,"" a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, said in response to a question about Snowden at a regular news briefing in Beijing on Thursday. She repeated the same answer to several follow-up questions. Snowden, 29, has rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community by providing documents to journalists revealing the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and the Internet activity of overseas residents. Differing reactions . U.S. security officials homed in on Snowden after Britain's Guardian newspaper informed the Obama administration that it was planning to publish articles based on documents it had obtained, a U.S. official said. Authorities then quickly tried to determine who might have access to such information, as well as what documents were downloaded and by whom. Snowden -- who had taken leave from work at an NSA facility in Hawaii a few weeks before -- quickly came to their attention, said the official. Authorities were ""making progress"" toward pinpointing the source of the leaks when Snowden went public, said a second U.S. official. Both officials spoke to CNN on the condition that they not be identified. There are ""no signs or indications"" that Snowden had accomplices or tried to sell secrets, this official said. Investigators think the leaker is still in Hong Kong and have a general sense of where he is in that Asian metropolis. Snowden's case has become a hot issue in that coastal city, making local newspaper front pages, stirring legal debates and prompting plans for a rally in support of him over the weekend. The reaction in mainland China, on the other hand, has been muted. State-run media outlets have covered the case cautiously, appearing to try to avoid focusing too much attention on some of the sensitive issues his disclosures have raised, such as government surveillance of citizens. The Snowden story has also so far failed to make big waves among China's tens of millions of highly active social media users. Some Chinese state media took the opportunity Thursday to highlight Snowden's comments to the South China Morning Post alleging that the U.S. government has hacked Chinese targets. In recent years, the Global Times newspaper said in an editorial, ""the United States has always claimed itself to be a victim of Chinese hacking activities. Many speculate that it's a cover up for hacking activities conducted by the U.S. government. Now, Snowden's revelation proves that such activities have already been going on for a long time."" Hacking claims . Among some 61,000 reported targets of the National Security Agency, Snowden told the Hong Kong newspaper, are hundreds of computers in China. U.S. officials have increasingly accused China of being the source of thousands of attacks on U.S. military and commercial networks. Beijing has denied such attacks. The South China Morning Post said it had seen documents provided by Snowden but was unable to verify their authenticity. The newspaper also said it was unable to independently verify allegations of U.S. hacking of networks in Hong Kong and mainland China since 2009. Snowden told the paper that some of the targets included the Chinese University of Hong Kong, public officials and students. The documents also ""point to hacking activity by the NSA against mainland targets,"" it reported. The claims came just days after U.S. President Barack Obama pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to address cyberattacks emanating from China that Obama described as ""direct theft of United States property."" Snowden's allegations appear to give weight to claims by some Chinese government officials that the country has been a victim of similar hacking efforts coming from the United States. His claims came as Gen. Keith Alexander, the National Security Agency chief, testified at a U.S. Senate hearing that the country's cyberinfrastructure, including telephones and computer networks, is somewhat vulnerable to attack. On a scale of one to 10, ""our critical infrastructure's preparedness to withstand a destructive cyberattack is about a three, based on my experience,"" he said. In the South China Morning Post interview -- published one week after the Guardian revealed the first leaks attributed to Snowden -- he said the agency he once worked for as a contractor typically targets high-bandwidth data lines that connect Internet nodes around the world. ""We hack network backbones -- like huge Internet routers, basically -- that give us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to hack every single one,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. A ""backbone"" is part of the inner workings of a computer network that links different parts of that network. It is used to deliver data from one part of the network to another and, as such, could expose data from multiple computers if hacked. 'Trying to bully' While refusing to comment specifically on a person under investigation, White House spokesman Jay Carney explained clearly how and why U.S. authorities consider the leaks to be ""very serious."" ""They go right to the heart of our efforts to combat terrorism, to combat efforts by extremists who desire to attack the United States and the American people,"" Carney told reporters Thursday. FBI Director Robert Mueller offered a similar assessment in testimony before Congress on Thursday. ""These disclosures have caused significant harm to our nation and to our safety,"" Mueller said. ""And we are taking all necessary steps to hold the person responsible for these disclosures."" Snowden hasn't been charged, but he has told The Guardian that he expects the United States to try to prosecute him. He worked for the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton until Monday, when he was fired after outing himself as the leaker. Snowden told the South China Morning Post that he felt U.S. officials were pressuring his family and also accused them of ""trying to bully"" Hong Kong into extraditing him to prevent the release of more damaging information. He vowed to resist extradition efforts if it comes to that, saying he ""would rather stay and fight the United States government in the courts, because I have faith in Hong Kong's rule of law."" ""My intention is to ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate,"" the South China Morning Post quoted Snowden as saying. ""I have been given no reason to doubt your system.'' But Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip, a former secretary of security for the territory, said Tuesday that while any extradition process could take months, Snowden isn't necessarily beyond the reach of the United States. ""If he thought there was a legal vacuum in Hong Kong which renders him safe from U.S. jurisdiction, that is unlikely to be the case,"" she said. Legal experts says that Beijing can get involved in the process to extradite a person from Hong Kong if the case significantly affects defense or foreign affairs. But some observers say that Chinese authorities are unlikely to want to rock the boat in this instance. ""Given the somewhat fraught Hong Kong-Beijing relationship, the political impact of Beijing interference in this Hong Kong legal matter could be grave,"" the Beijing-based analyst and blogger, Bill Bishop, wrote in an article for USA Today. The newspaper said Snowden has been hiding in undisclosed locations in Hong Kong since checking out of his hotel room Monday, a day after he revealed his identity in an interview with The Guardian. Snowden told the Morning Post he is not trying to evade U.S. authorities. ""People who think I made a mistake in picking Hong Kong as a location misunderstand my intentions,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. ""I am not here to hide from justice; I am here to reveal criminality."" The NSA and the national intelligence director did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Asked during a media briefing Wednesday for comment on Snowden's latest claims, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki declined. She said she had not seen the latest South China Morning Post report. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Greg Botelho, Carol Cratty, Barbara Starr, David McKenzie and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","NEW: There are ""no signs"" Edward Snowden worked with others, U.S. official says .

"(CNN) -- A fast-moving storm system struck parts of the Upper Midwest hard on Wednesday evening, delivering blows to Chicago and many other communities before moving quickly to inflict damage farther east. The Windy City itself experienced gusts that measured about 50 mph around 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), in addition to dime-size hail, the National Weather Service's Chicago branch said. Cities and towns near Chicago were affected as well. About 50 miles southwest, in Kendall County, residents were urged to hunker down after storm spotters ""reported wall clouds"" that suggest a possible tornado, according to weather service. In DeKalb County, some 60 miles west of Chicago, straight-line winds downed power lines, and some large trees appeared to be damaged, Chief Deputy Gary Dumdie of the country sheriff's department said. To the east in Lake County, Indiana, a severe thunderstorm warning advised residents to brace for 80 mph wind gusts and pingpong-ball-size hail. Some 35 miles south near Crete, Illinois, radar showed winds were blowing up to 80 mph. All this commotion was thanks to a swift and, at times, powerful storm system that moved across the Upper Midwest and into the Ohio Valley on Wednesday evening. One of the first indications that it would be tumultuous day came around 4:30 p.m., when a ""confirmed tornado"" touched down about 8 miles east of Belmond in Wright County, Iowa. Several businesses and one home in Belmond were destroyed, while three other homes suffered significant damage, said Iowa emergency management spokeswoman Stefanie Bond. Thankfully, there were no reports of fatalities or injuries. The storm's impact wasn't unexpected: The Storm Prediction Center had warned that Indiana, Ohio and much of Illinois, including the city of Chicago, faced a ""high risk"" -- the most perilous category -- of severe weather through Wednesday night. The portion of the United States under a moderate risk for severe weather extended farther and included the cities of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Columbus, Ohio. The threat of tornadoes was particularly high in southwest Wisconsin and northwest Illinois, thanks to severe thunderstorms capable of producing a twister. There was a possibility they could strike well beyond that, though, with the weather service issuing tornado watches through midnight Wednesday for much of Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Russ Schneider, director of the Storm Prediction Center, explained that the type of severe weather that hit the Upper Midwest was a derecho. Derived from the Spanish word for ""straight ahead,"" derechos are a weather phenomenon that traditionally happens only a few times a year. It is defined as a line of storms that produces a swath of damage more than 240 miles long with gusts of at least 58 mph. A derecho forms thanks in large part to warm, humid air, instability in the atmosphere and jet-stream winds, which can organize the storms into isolated storms called super cells. Those super cells rotate among themselves, then cluster into powerful wind systems that can become derechos, Schneider said. A line of such storms travels quickly, often at around 50 to 60 mph, which is much faster than most other types of storms. ""(So) what looks like a very dark cloud on the horizon very rapidly becomes an imminent threat,"" explained Schneider. ""(People should) make sure they know where they go to seek shelter, and what actions they need to take as warnings are issued."" Calmer conditions should return to the Upper Midwest on Thursday: Chicago's forecast, for instance, calls for a breezy, mostly sunny day with temperatures reaching a high of around 65. By then, the greatest severe weather threat will have shifted east. The Storm Prediction Center is forecasting that severe weather will be possible Thursday in the mid-Atlantic, an area that includes that includes Richmond, Virginia; Washington; Baltimore, Maryland; Philadelphia and the southern half of New Jersey. A much bigger chunk of the eastern United States -- from Alabama and Georgia extending north up the Appalachian Mountains to New York City -- has a slight chance of severe weather, likely in the form of strong thunderstorms. CNN's Tom Watkins, Joe Sutton and Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.","NEW: The mid-Atlantic will most likely have severe weather Thursday .

"(CNN) -- The crane operator facing charges over a deadly building collapse was denied bail Sunday. A Philadelphia judge refused to allow Sean Benschop, 42, to leave jail. He is charged with six counts of involuntary manslaughter, 13 counts of recklessly endangering another person, and one count of ""risking a catastrophe,"" District Attorney spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson told CNN. Wednesday's building collapse in downtown Philadelphia left six dead and 13 people injured. Benschop, who maintains his innocence, turned himself in Saturday. ""My client is being made the scapegoat in this situation,"" said Daine Grey, Benschop's attorney. ""The victims here aren't just those who died and their families. My client is a victim as well. He's currently being looked at as the cause of everybody's pain, but that just isn't the case."" Grey told reporters Saturday that while his client feels ""extremely sympathetic and remorseful,"" he is not guilty. ""This was an accident, but Mr. Benschop was not responsible,"" Grey said, in remarks captured by CNN affiliate WPVI. ""And we believe that, in time, the facts will show that he is not responsible."" Benschop had marijuana and pain medication in his blood after the collapse, a law enforcement source told CNN. Pennsylvania court records indicate Benschop, who also went by the alias Kary Roberts, has been arrested multiple times in the past two decades. Many of the related charges -- related to alleged firearms violations and theft -- were withdrawn, dismissed or resulted in not guilty verdicts, though he was found guilty in the mid-1990s on drug charges. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter blamed Benschop's ""reckless and irresponsible behavior"" for the building collapse and said Saturday he hopes that Benschop faces ""the harshest level of charges ... and he is punished accordingly."" ""Justice will only be served if Sean Benschop receives a sentence that buries him in a jailhouse forever, just like his victims were buried on Wednesday,"" Nutter said. Nutter is pressing for answers from two property owners who hired Benschop to operate heavy machinery, saying that, along with Benschop, they ""bear the ultimate and sole responsibility for this tragedy."" Benschop allegedly was working a crane to tear down a vacant building in downtown Philadelphia when a four-story wall collapsed onto a Salvation Army thrift store, causing an ominous rumble followed by panic on the streets. Afterward, searchers climbed over shards of wood, concrete and rebar looking for survivors, such as a 61-year-old woman pulled alive from the rubble early Thursday. The first lawsuit against him was filed that same day, by attorneys for a 54-year-old woman pulled from the rubble by a firefighter.","NEW: Attorney for crane operator says his client is ""being made the scapegoat""

"(Sunset) -- The first thing Laura Slipak says when I drag my stressed self into the chill lobby of the Mod Resort, her Austin Powers-chic hotel in Palm Desert: ""Oh, dear."" The mood is mod and the art is amazing. And you don't even need a car to enjoy it. The second thing she says: ""I think someone needs a Mod-tini."" Yeah, baby. I've just suffered through two-plus hours of Inland Empire gridlock so that I can unwind in the desert, and I plan to ditch my car for the weekend (if not, alas, forever). Which is why I've come to Palm Desert. Not only does it do the whole midcentury modern thing perfectly, but of all California's desert resorts, it's also probably the most pedestrian- and bike-friendly. Sunset.com: Top 10 dream towns . The Mod is just a three-minute walk to the glittery shopping and dining street El Paseo, and a short bike ride away from everything else I'm interested in checking out this weekend. That includes galleries, a recently unveiled collection of California landscape paintings at the Living Desert museum, and the new Eric Johnson Memorial Gardens (named after the ""desert landscape guru of the Coachella Valley,"" who was also a former garden editor for Sunset). Then again, if Laura offers me one more of her mood-altering apple martinis, I might just park myself beside the salt-water pool and spend the rest of the afternoon meditating on the cerulean water. Sculptures, cycles and cactus . Not to worry. After a mind-clearing dip in the pool, it's a sunset walk to downtown Palm Desert to scope out the town's public art, beginning with freshly installed sculptures rising out of the El Paseo median against a backdrop of rust-colored mountains. The air is as dry as chalk, the fading desert light gallery-perfect for pondering a 25-foot-long piece pairing an iridescent hummingbird with a damselfly. In the morning, it's a five-minute stroll to Funseekers to rent a bike. Okay, it would have taken five minutes if I hadn't diverted up the block to take a look at the black-and-white midcentury modern house of William Boyd (better known as Hopalong Cassidy) and then dropped in at the Desert Art Collection & Sculpture Garden, a very cool gallery with a large courtyard set with sculptures amid palm trees, cactus and bougainvillea. At Funseekers, I'm feeling conflicted. Not only does it have all sorts of bikes to rent, but it also offers Segways and mopeds. Still, I've pledged to be fume-free this weekend, so I opt for a hybrid bicycle and power a mile and a half up a bike lane along Portola Avenue to the Living Desert, where I'm just in time for the docent-led tour of paintings of woodlands, seascapes and deserts. My favorite: Granville Redmond's ""Cloudy Day at Monterey,"" from the early 1900s. Later, I ride the length of El Paseo to the Eric Johnson Memorial Gardens, an oasis of curving paths that take you past gurgling waterfalls, cactus-covered sand dunes and a shaded rock-wall canyon. If I could somehow get Laura to deliver one of her Mod-tinis here, I could just chill out all afternoon. No matter. After dropping my bike off, I hoof it to Pacifica Seafood Restaurant, known for its fresh fish and its vodka bar -- 130 kinds from 19 countries -- where vodka martinis are $6 all night long. Perfect. Even better, it's a short walk back to the resort. 48 hours in Palm Desert . Friday: Check into the Mod Resort (from $169), owned by a fashion designer from Malibu. Enjoy a killer margarita on the patio at Armando's Dakota Bar & Grill (average entrées $13-$20; 73-260 El Paseo; 760/346-0744). Saturday: Check out the Desert Art Collection & Sculpture Garden (free; 45350 San Luis Rey Ave.). Then rent a bike (from $25 per day) or a moped (from $62 per day) at Funseekers (73-865 State 111; 760/340-3861) and ride down El Paseo, making a stop at Imago Galleries (45-450 State 74; 760/776-9890), which, with its blue-chip artists, is practically the MOMA of the desert. The nearby Palm Desert Visitor Center (72-567 State 111; 760/568-1441) is a good place to pick up bike-trail maps and explore the surrounding Eric Johnson Memorial Gardens (free), a multisensory setting of desert plantings. The Gardens on El Paseo (73-545 El Paseo), an open-air shopping plaza, has a number of excellent dining spots, including Sullivan's Steakhouse (average entrées over $31; 760/341-3560), for steaks and jazz, and Pacifica Seafood Restaurant (average entrées $21-$30; 760/674-8666), for oysters on the half-shell and cheap martinis. Sunday: At the Living Desert ($13; 47900 Portola Ave.; 760/346-5694), mornings are a good time to catch the young animals -- like Maliki, a giraffe calf born in May -- at their most active.

"(CNN) -- It's the staple of almost every kung fu action film ever made: the hero is targeted for revenge after teaching the deadly and closely guarded secrets of the martial art to outsiders and, even worse, foreigners. But ask Lam Chun-fai Sifu -- the 73-year-old practitioner of the 300-year-old kung fu style known as Hung Kuen -- and he will tell you that making the martial art accessible to foreigners is the only way to save it from extinction. The son of a student to Wong Fei Hung, one of the legends of the fighting style and the subject of countless films, Lam Sifu (sifu is a Cantonese term that means 'master') says the fighting art may be growing fast overseas, but struggles in the region where it was born. To counter the decline, he has co-authored the world's first English-language manual on the ancient kung fu style that he has taught for 60 years and has been his family's trademark for more than three generations. Called Hung Kuen Fundamentals: Fok Fu Kuen, the manual outlines scores of moves and stances that were hitherto only taught and transmitted orally. While there are dozens of fighting styles in kung fu (the northern styles represented by fast, high kicks and rapid, fluid movements), Hung Kuen is a southern Chinese fighting art characterised by strong stances and fast footwork. One practitioner famously destroyed the bamboo planks in a demonstration platform simply by shifting his feet in the 'hard stances' of Hung Kuen. Lam Sifu, meanwhile, teaches a steady stream of foreigners the ancient fighting art in the cramped living room of his tiny apartment on the 7th floor of a tenement block in Hong Kong's North Point. In terms of Hong Kong kung fu, it's about as traditional as it gets, right down to the name 'Di Dat Clinic' which translates as 'Hit Fall Clinic'; a name unchanged from the days when kung fu masters, so used to treating the training accidents of their students, were the first stop for neighborhood trauma injuries and broken bones. Using a spear against his sword-wielding son Oscar, Lam Sifu is a blur of threshing weapons amid the armchairs, ornaments and computer printers in his urban home. ""Training in a small area like this is very good for control,"" he says in a space so cramped it looks like two men having a knife fight in a telephone booth. For his long-standing foreign students -- Hung Kuen teachers from Italy, the Czech Republic and Germany -- the turn of fighting speed still draws a gasp of admiration. ""Many students in Italy like traditional kung fu and especially this style which is the origin of the martial art,"" said Massimo Iannaccone, who runs an academy in Rome but perfects the art in Lam Sifu's living room on trips to Hong Kong. Pavel Adamek, who teaches Hung Kuen in Prague, Czech Republic, says his students are drawn as much by the Eastern philosophy associated with the martial art as they are by learning a fighting style. ""It's very popular in the Czech Republic -- people there are really looking for something more than fighting arts. They want to train their bodies and their minds -- this style is really very good for that,"" he said. While there may be more dedicated practitioners overseas than in Hong Kong, Lam Sifu's co-author Hing Chao, who also studies the Hung Kuen style, said that the form remains a potent cultural symbol in Hong Kong. ""It's rooted in a very specific Hong Kong identity as well,"" Hing said. Both he and Lam Sifu believe the style is so important as a cultural symbol, the government should recognize it as part of Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage. Hing, who has studied the interaction between the media, entertainment and the martial arts, says that Hollywood sometimes gives a lopsided view of Chinese martial arts, focusing on various personalities such as Ip Man, Bruce Lee's famous teacher, to the exclusion of all other equally famous teachers and styles. Despite this, he says its popularization in film sometimes unconsciously transmits positive aspects of kung fu culture. ""Besides the fighting, one of the reasons that Bruce Lee has been such a global celebrity until to today is because a lot of messages strike a chord and resonate among the marginalized,"" Hing says. ""Why would, for instance, a Black African community in the U.S. look on Bruce Lee as a hero? Because embedded in these films are messages of righteousness. Of someone who is disadvantaged but through dedication to kung fu can become empowered and through his own empowerment help the rest of the community. ""This is very positive and I would say the Bruce Lee path represents one of the best interactions between film and martial arts -- it's something we don't often see these days."" While foreigners may be beating a path to the kung fu clinic's door, local interest in Hong Kong is only just gaining ground after a long hiatus. Lam Sifu says modern distractions like videogames are sapping young people of the ability to focus on demanding martial art forms like Hung Kuen which can require learning as many as 300 movements in a single set. ""These days pupils can't stand any hardship. They say practicing is tiring and they give up easily,"" he says.","Masters of a southern Chinese style of kung fu have published the first manual in English .

"(CNN) -- Sad. Helpless. Shaken. That's how Morgan Pace felt as she drove past a large plume of smoke near her home in Monument, Colorado, which is about 20 miles north of Colorado Springs. It wasn't an isolated fire, but a large and growing conflagration that has spurred thousands to flee their homes. ""It was just surreal,"" said Pace, a CNN iReporter. Fear and anxiety were common Wednesday in much of central Colorado thanks not just to one, but two major wildfires that have threatened lives and property. Pace, a 38-year-old mother of four, is among tens of thousands affected directly and indirectly by the Black Forest Fire. So, too, is Lisa Aggarwal. After a sleepless night, she packed up and left her Colorado Springs home on Wednesday -- a hot and blue sky day, except for the looming smoke -- along with her three young children. ""My family is scared and just trying to remain calm,"" Aggarwal, another iReporter, said Wednesday. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Black Forest Fire had spread to 8,500 acres -- none of which were considered ""contained"" -- according to the Colorado Office of Emergency Management. ""We have some very unpredictable conditions,"" El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa said at an early media briefing. ""Priorities are saving lives (including) protecting first responders and firefighters."" At an afternoon update, he said the winds had shifted and moved the fire in two directions. He anticipated the fire would continue to grow by 3,000 acres. Mandatory evacuation orders, which extended over a 55-square-mile area, affected about 9,000 people in more than 3,400 households. Thankfully, as of Wednesday afternoon, there were no reports of casualties, but one person might be missing, Maketa said. Still, at least 92 structures were labeled as lost. Alicia Welch had two reasons to worry: Her son was out at a day camp before the flames forced them to head home, and her husband was still out hiking in another endangered area with Boy Scouts. ""He said that a lot of the boys, the Scouts he knew what was going on. The leaders care about their families and what's going on at home,"" Welch told CNN, her comments cut off as she broke down for a moment, overwhelmed with emotion. The Royal Gorge Fire, meanwhile, is burning on the other side of Colorado Springs, about 55 miles to the southwest. Authorities downgraded the number of acres burned from 3,800 to 3,100 late Wednesday. It was less than half the size of the Black Forest Fire. But it likewise was 0% contained and had damaged at least three structures, the state office of emergency management reported. It triggered the precautionary evacuation of some 905 inmates from the Centennial Correctional Facility, located in Canon City, between midnight and 9 a.m. Wednesday. Most of the inmates are ""special needs"" -- meaning they receive medical treatment -- said state corrections department spokeswoman Alison Morgan. The famous Royal Gorge Bridge that spans the Arkansas River is still intact but needs to be inspected before it can reopen for tourists, a spokeswoman for the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park said. The suspension bridge, which is 956 feet above the river and among the highest in the world, is made of more than 1,000 wooden planks. ""We did not know until today whether the bridge was still standing,"" Peggy Gair said. Gair says fire at the park burned a visitor's center, a tramway building, a carousel and several restaurants. Are you there? Send an iReport . There were other fires in the state as well, including in Grand and Huerfano Counties.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama hailed steps forward for gay, lesbians and transgendered people on Thursday, asserting this community's fight for rights has reached a ""turning point."" ""We've becoming not just more accepting, we've become more loving as a country and as a people,"" he said. ""Hearts and minds change with time; laws do, too."" His sense of satisfaction and optimism -- voiced at a White House gathering to mark Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Month -- follows milestone on gay marriage, the inclusion of openly gay U.S. military service members and boosting health insurance access for same-sex partners. But as the president himself acknowledged, obstacles remain. So, too, do frustrations among some gays and lesbians who have been steadfast Obama supporters but had hoped for even more action during his first five years in office. A CNN analysis of Obama's biggest fundraisers, known as bundlers, during the 2012 election cycle showed that at least 33 -- or about one in every 16 -- was openly gay. Together, they raised at least $8 million for the campaign between January and the end of March of last year. Even with that backing, some have challenged the president over what they see as delays in implementing such promises as an executive order that would ban federal contractors from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That irritation erupted during a recent Democratic National Committee fundraiser when Ellen Sturtz of the gay rights group GetEQUAL heckled first lady Michelle Obama. ""I had planned to speak tonight with DNC officials but, as the First Lady was talking about our children's future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives, I simply couldn't stay silent any longer,"" Sturtz said in a statement. ""I'm looking ahead at a generation of young people who could live full, honest, and open lives with the stroke of the president's pen, and I was hoping that the first lady would share my concern for all of our young people,"" Sturtz said. Disappointment 'Obama 'hasn't moved quickly enough' Both the president and the nation have evolved on the issue of gay rights. As a presidential candidate in 2008, Obama enjoyed rock star status among the gay and lesbian community. High-profile, openly gay figures such as musician Melissa Etheridge and DreamWorks SKG mogul David Geffen joined a grassroots army of supporters at campaign rallies. Once in the Oval Office, Obama's efforts at pressing the case for gay rights were more muted, activists said. Some in the community felt betrayed and thought the repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and his evolution on marriage took too long. Obama tries to reset with gay community . But some saw hope in the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the forces, Obama's biggest accomplishment in the gay rights cause. Administration criticism of a measure in North Carolina last year that banned same-sex marriage and made civil unions illegal and a similar Minnesota proposal also boosted the community's confidence that Obama would help further their cause. ""By and large the LGBT community is quite pleased with what President Barack Obama has done, but there is no doubt that some are disappointed that he hasn't moved quickly enough on certain issues,"" said Craig Rimmerman, professor of public policy and political science at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and author of ""From Identity to Politics: The Lesbian and Gay Movements in the United States."" Obama: 'America can change' During his inaugural address this year, the president placed the gay community's struggle for equality alongside similar civil rights fights by women and African-Americans. ""Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law, for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal, as well,"" Obama said in his address after being sworn in. The president and the nation have evolved on same-sex marriage . Engaging, pushing and chiding the president doesn't take away from the appreciation for what the administration has done for the gay rights community, said Evan Wolfson, president of the non-partisan Freedom to Marry organization. The gay rights community will be watching closely to see if Obama follows through on a promise to sign an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. And, should the U.S. Supreme Court decide gays and lesbian couples have a fundamental constitutional right to wed, the gay rights community will be looking to the Obama administration to act quickly to look at federal programs and make sure all couples are treated equally, Wolfson said. ""There is enormous support pride and appreciation for the president's extraordinary leadership and eloquent advocacy in ending discrimination against gay people,"" Wolfson said. ""The president himself has noted there remains an enormous amount to be done to end legal decimation and gay people and the millions of Americans want to see the president do more."" Obama said as much, admitting ""we're not done yet"" and pointing specifically to a Senate bill aimed at sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace. At the same time, he expressed confidence that the movement -- even in a capital oft defined by gridlock -- is in what he feels is a positive direction. ""Don't tell me that things can't happen when we put our minds to them,"" he said. ""The genius of America is that America can change.""

"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) -- Firefighters made little headway Thursday against a raging wildfire near Colorado Springs, Colorado, which has scorched close to 16,000 acres, destroyed 360 homes and claimed at least two lives. Witnesses spoke to the two victims in the afternoon, El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa told reporters. ""They said that they could see a glow to the west. They were packing their personal belongings, trying to get out,"" he said. Earlier, county spokesman Dave Rose told CNN that the Black Forest Fire, burning northeast of the city, now appears to be the most destructive in terms of property lost in state history. Some 750 firefighters were battling the blaze, which was 5% contained late Thursday. With the help of helicopters and air tankers, they established a loose perimeter. ""The fire is very, very active within the containment area, and we don't have a high level of confidence at all that we'll be able to hold all of these lines around this fire,"" Rose said. The fire's evacuation area was 93,000 acres, affecting approximately 38,000 people and 13,000 homes, and the flames were estimated to have burned through 15,700 acres, said Maketa. That marked a dramatic increase from the 8,500 acres officials said had been burned by Wednesday night, he noted. After he spoke, residents of about 1,000 homes in Colorado Springs were told to evacuate. ""Wind is probably our No. 1 threat,"" the sheriff said. Combined with dry brush and high temperatures, the winds have fanned devastating flames. Maketa struggled to find a phrase to describe how ferocious the fire is, settling on ""very dynamic."" ""If it's a draw, that's a victory today because we haven't had too many draws in the last couple of days,"" he said. 'The flames were there' Among those who lost their home were husband and wife, Jaenette and Kristian Coyne. ""We literally had five minutes, and we left because it was, the flames were there,"" Jaenette Coyne told CNN's AC360 Thursday night. She said she grabbed a baby album and a personal computer with pictures on it. She also took a firebox, which contained most of the couple's important documents. The Coynes actually saw their home burn on live TV. ""It was probably the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. You have that moment where you say: 'Is that really my house?' But we know it was. However, now I'm grateful that I know. A lot of people here just don't know,"" Jaenette Coyne said. In northeast Colorado Springs, CNN iReporter Heather Croze took photos outside her home, capturing a billowing plume of smoke. One shot shows just how wide the smoke was on the horizon. A county fairground northeast of the Black Forest Fire looked like a Noah's Ark with families who fled with their animals to escape the looming inferno. There were nearly 30 chickens, several hundred horses, a handful of cows and a couple calves, and many alpacas and miniature horses, according to the Elbert County Sheriff's Office. Assorted dogs, cats, goats and donkeys mingled with mules and llamas. Three stallions were there. And for good measure, one yak. At least eight families also have taken refuge at the Elbert County Fairgrounds in Kiowa, the Denver Post reported, which is about 35 miles southeast of Denver. Joanne Gaishin slept outside in her car after fleeing her home with 18 chickens and three turkeys. ""I stayed in the front seat of my car with all of my fowl in there, with the roosters crowing in the morning,"" she told the paper. 'We have each other' Paula Warren, one of thousands of residents forced to flee her home northeast of Colorado Springs, spoke about how difficult it was to leave and wonder if her home was all right. ""I thought I had about an hour, and it turned out to be about 20 minutes,"" she said. ""I had a pillowcase full of socks, and that's basically all I have."" By Thursday afternoon, she got bad news. A friend called her to say that her home was on an online list of residences that had been designated as destroyed. Warren didn't know exactly where the friend had seen the information but she believed it to be true. For a person who had just been told their home was gone, Warren had a cheerful attitude when talking with CNN, laughing and saying that she was just going to go back home when she could, hitch up a trailer on the property, live in that and rebuild her house. Her home sat on five acres and she doesn't think the land has been damaged. ""Trees are still standing,"" she said. For now she and her two miniature horses are staying with a friend on the outskirts of Colorado Springs. The animals have adjusted fairly well, she said. ""You can't just take 'em to a Motel 6,"" she said. ""And my friend is very tolerant."" Like Warren, CNN iReporter Mike Schultz lost his home. He sent images of it burned to the ground, showing charred remains. His wife, Caml Schultz, said their family was able to save only some photographs, paperwork and few items of clothes. ""But we have each other, and we're blessed. So many people have suffered loss, and so we're just thankful that we're here and safe and that we're loved, and that we have so many people that are willing to help take care of us,"" she said. Working to protect homes . Sheriff Maketa praised the swift and strong help that civilian workers have been getting from National Guard and other military responders. Authorities said that they are watching neighborhoods and homes to do everything they can to keep them safe while combating the blaze. Still, there have been losses. Maketa said Thursday that 360 homes had been destroyed; another 14 were damaged. Rose, the El Paso County spokesman, stressed later that those figures were preliminary, and said he would expect them to increase. ""There are areas of the Black Forest that we have not been able to get into at all to make any sort of assessment. So it's almost impossible to come up with another number, but it is safe to assume that that number will in fact rise,"" he said. Ken Litch, a 12-year resident of the area, watched Wednesday as the Black Forest Fire gained ground on his home. There wasn't much else he could do. ""A hundred homes would be nothing,"" he told CNN affiliate KUSA. ""Whatever is in its way, it's going to take."" The inferno is likely to continue for a couple more days as temperatures are forecast to stay in the 90s through Friday, with winds gusting up to 30 mph. Famous bridge still intact . Another major fire in the state is the Royal Gorge Fire, which is burning 55 miles to the southwest, on the other side of Colorado Springs. It burned several buildings around the iconic Royal Gorge Suspension Bridge, and threatened the bridge itself. Authorities downgraded the number of acres burned from 3,800 to 3,100 late Wednesday. The wildfire was 20% contained, the state office of emergency management reported. Twenty structures have been lost to the flames. ""We have made good progress on the fire today without any accidents or injuries,"" said Dennis Page, incident commander for the fire. The famous Royal Gorge Bridge that spans the Arkansas River is intact but needs to be inspected before it can reopen for tourists, a spokeswoman for the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park said.

"FOB Tillman, Afghanistan (CNN) -- U.S. troops have fired into Pakistani territory at least four times in the last 10 months in cross-border skirmishes that they say are in response to shelling from inside Pakistan, CNN has learned. The revelation is likely to stoke already tense relations between Pakistan and the United States, which hit a new low after a NATO airstrike last year killed 24 Pakistani soldiers along the volatile border. While the Taliban and Haqqani network, an Afghan militant group operating from Pakistan's Waziristan province, are generally believed responsible for cross-border attacks against troops, an Afghan army commander says Pakistani soldiers opened fire on him and his men as recently as April 14. ""When we went near the border, we were attacked with an anti-aircraft gun and mortars by the Pakistani army from their checkpoints. We are not only attacked from the Pakistani soil, but we are also attacked by the Pakistani army,"" Masoud Karimi, an Afghan army commander, told CNN. ""We just saw them with our own eyes that the Pakistani soldiers were firing at us and on the same day we reported to the Americans. But the Americans told us that it was from the other side of the border and they didn't have the permission to conduct operations ... there,"" he said. Army Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, confirmed Afghan soldiers were involved in a cross-border clash that day. He did not specify who opened fire upon the Afghans. U.S. troops do, however, sometimes fire back into Pakistan, as confirmed during a recent visit by CNN to Forward Operating Base Tillman in Afghanistan's rugged Paktika province. The commander at FOB Tillman, located just a few kilometers from the Pakistan border, said he has fired across the border in response to being shelled from inside Pakistan. Army Capt. Charles Seitz said he did not know the exact number of times he returned fire. But when pressed by CNN, and asked whether it was correct to say that he had fired into Pakistan more than five times, he responded: ""That sounds accurate."" The outpost is one of a handful along the Afghan-Pakistan border, and the captain's admission may indicate more cross-border violence than previously publicized. Cummings, the ISAF spokesman, said troops at Tillman have fired into Pakistan four times since June 2011. Pakistan is aware of the cross-border skirmishes. Gen. Athar Abbas, a spokesman for the Pakistani military, said he did not know the exact number of times FOB Tillman fired into Pakistan, but that four sounded accurate. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said they try to liaise with Pakistani military forces first. But that communication does not always happen, Abbas said. He said that most of the time U.S. officials or NATO inform Pakistan before firing across the border, but sometimes they do not and Pakistani military checkpoints are hit. Abbas said he was unaware of the April 14 cross-border clash. FOB Tillman is named for fallen Army Spec. Pat Tillman -- the Arizona Cardinals linebacker turned soldier who was killed in a friendly fire incident in 2004 in Afghanistan, near the border. Relations between the United States and Pakistan -- complicated at the best of times -- have become especially tense in the past year. The deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers in November added to anger already felt by Pakistanis over the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden at a compound in Pakistan in May, and continued American drone strikes on targets in the nation. Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, accused Pakistan's intelligence service of protecting the Haqqani network, calling it a ""veritable arm"" of the Pakistan spy agency. As a result, he said Pakistan bore some responsibility for the attacks. The combined effect was a chilling of Pakistani cooperation with the United States.","An Afghan commander accuses Pakistani soldiers of firing across the border .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Britain's Ministry of Defense has released files on UFO sightings dating back to the 1970s, including witness accounts and the government's response. The ministry on Wednesday released the files as part of a four-year project to transfer all of the UFO documents to the National Archives to make them available to curious members of the public. The documents include hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who describe seeing lights or strange objects in the sky, from southern England and Wales up to Northern Ireland. The files released Wednesday cover 1978 to 1987. The rest, dating from the 1950s and covering recent history, will be released over the coming years. Reported sightings typically describe various shapes and colors of lights, moving in formation or hovering in the sky. Witnesses reported orange, red, white and green lights that were diamond-shaped, square, or cigar-shaped. They reported them to police, who have a standard 16-question form specifically for UFO sightings. ""The vast majority of them are just ordinary people who've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it,"" said David Clarke, a professor at Sheffield Hallam University and a UFO expert who worked with the National Archives on the project. In one sighting in January 1985, a man near Cardiff, Wales, was closing his living room curtains when he saw an object in the sky. He said it moved ""up and down like a bouncing ball,"" then disappeared behind a mountain. Two police officers in Woking, south of London, reported seeing a white light in the sky on Christmas morning 1985. The light, they said, moved into the nearby area of Horsell, where author H.G. Wells had placed the Martian landing in his book, ""War of the Worlds."" The person who took the report noted the officers were aware of the connection, writing, ""Genuine report. Two competent officers slightly embarrassed (Horsell Common features in H.G. Wells)."" Two other police officers in Edgware, north London, reported seeing an object in the sky in June 1984. They viewed it with binoculars for an hour and sketched a picture, showing a white sphere with a ring of blue and red lights. ""The object moved erratically from side to side, up and down and to and fro, not venturing far from its original position,"" the officers wrote. Other reports came from stunned members of the public, pilots, and members of the military. The Ministry of Defense said it examined the reports and held onto the records solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated British airspace. Once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky, it did not investigate further.  Watch why the ministry is revealing what it knows about UFOs » . ""The Ministry of Defense has no other interest or role regarding UFO matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life-forms,"" it said Wednesday. That leaves many of the incidents simply unexplained, such as an April 1984 report made by a senior air traffic controller at an unidentified airfield. The controller was bringing in a light aircraft for landing when he noticed a series of lights appearing to come down on another runway. The crew of the incoming plane radioed that they saw the lights, too. All reported that they saw the lights come down ""at speed,"" touch down, and disappear. ""They were so concerned about this, they filed an official report,"" Clarke said. ""But what was the thing that they saw? There's no evidence from the papers that any further investigations were done and it remains a mystery."" In 1979, two years after Steven Spielberg's alien-visitation movie ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" reports of strange sightings had increased and the House of Lords decided to hold a debate on UFOs. One of the documents released Wednesday is a detailed briefing prepared by the Ministry of Defense for the debate, and it sheds light on the military's position on the matter. ""There is nothing to indicate that ufology (the study of UFOs) is anything but claptrap and no evidence at all of 'alien space craft,'"" read the briefing, prepared by the ministry for Lord Strabolgi, then government chief whip. At least one report in the files has since been explained, however. A report from August 1985 details the crop circles that two army officers found in a wheat field in Andover, in southern England. They noted one large circle surrounded by four smaller ones, all perfectly round with the wheat pressed down in a clockwise direction. No tracks led up to the circles, they said. The farmer called the army officers because he thought the Army Air Corps had created the circles, but the officers said they were stumped. ""None of us could offer any reasonable explanation,"" they wrote. It is now known that the crop circles were some of many created by two hoaxers named Doug Bowers and Dave Chorley, according to Clarke. ""Doug and Dave,"" as they were called, came forward in 1990 to say they created the circles with a garden roller and planks of wood, Clarke said. ""We now know that this particular circle near Andover was one of the ones that was created as a hoax by these two men,"" he said.","British Ministry of Defense releases files on UFO sightings dating back to 1970s .

"(CNN) -- Microsoft Office, the suite of productivity tools used by millions, has finally come to the iPhone. The move is a significant one for Microsoft and its users. Before, the popular set of tools, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook, was available only on Windows phones, which have captured a sliver of the smartphone market. The feature is available free in Apple's App Store for subscribers to Office 365, the cloud-based version of Office's business-like tools for home users. Subscribers pay a monthly fee. Office for iPhone is intended for people who need to edit PowerPoints or Excel spreadsheets on the go, not create them from their phones. The company said users can work with documents on their phones, and the updates will be transferred to those documents on PC versions. They'll also be able to share documents from their phones. ""When we launched Office 365 earlier this year, we committed to delivering regular updates and new capabilities to Office 365 subscribers,"" Julia White, general manager of Microsoft's Office division, said in a blog post. ""Office Mobile for iPhone is another great example of the value of subscribing to Office 365."" The announcement comes just days after Apple announced that its own iWork productivity suite will for the first time work with Windows systems. The Microsoft announcement serves as a counter, allowing the same kind of back-and-forth for the larger number of users who are already familiar with Office, considered by many the gold standard of productivity software. There is no similar version of Office optimized for the iPad, which has its own more fully developed Web browser. Microsoft also did not mention whether it's developing a version for Google's Android mobile devices. Office for iPhone is available now for users in the United States and will soon rolled out internationally, the company said.","Microsoft announced its Office suite is now available on the iPhone .

So, it's very much a case of the Chinese are coming, in quite a big way."" So for now, Geely is testing the ground in Europe; preparing it for their arrival. Johansen tells me the company is gaining ground globally. ""They will move into Western Europe and other places eventually, but their focus is on the markets closer to home in China where they are made,"" he said.

In the meantime, they face a challenge: How to improve their taxis? And how do they compete with the cheaper and lighter Eco City Vehicle which is customized by Mercedes-Benz? Japan's Nissan is also reported to be launching a taxi for the London market. But Johansen welcomes the challenge. ""Competition is always healthy,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Masonia Traylor doesn't look sick. The 25-year-old mother of two is poised. Sitting in a boardroom at AID Atlanta, an HIV outreach facility in Atlanta where she volunteers, she exudes confidence. But Traylor is HIV positive. According to the CDC, 50,000 Americans are infected with HIV each year, and 25% of those are between the ages of 13 and 24. Sixty percent of youth with HIV don't know they have it, despite recommendations from the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. A faceless disease . Traylor got her first HIV test as a teenager when someone living with the disease gave a presentation at her high school. She was about 16 and already a teen mother at the time. She knew she had been having unprotected sex and wanted to stay healthy for her young son. At the time, Traylor was in what she believed was a monogamous relationship. During her annual doctor's visit, she was disturbed to realize she had to ask specifically for an HIV test on top of a standard STD panel. She insisted on taking the test even though her doctor told her -- as a heterosexual woman involved in a monogamous relationship -- that she was low risk. Later Traylor broke up with her boyfriend and began a new committed relationship. That was the year her life changed. Despite vigilance in testing, Traylor wasn't prepared for what she found out at her doctor's visit that year: She was HIV positive. Two weeks later she learned she was pregnant with her second child. ""It was very difficult -- a lot of screaming in my head, a lot of tears -- as if I was going to a funeral every day,"" she said. The father of Traylor's baby tested negative for HIV and she was able to give birth to a healthy daughter. Traylor believes she contracted the disease from an ex-boyfriend who has not been tested. Over the past two years, Traylor has come to a place of acceptance, and she takes personal responsibility for taking a chance with her health by having unprotected sex. But in hindsight, she realizes that even though she knew about HIV, she didn't fully understand her risk of contracting it. ""At home we didn't talk about HIV because it just didn't exist in my world,"" she said. ""I was aware it was out there, but I didn't know what it looked like."" HIV doesn't have a face, and someone who is infected doesn't necessarily exhibit any physical signs. ""You think that you would see signs that a person is sick,"" she said, but since that isn't always the case, teens and young adults can feel a false sense of security. They may think, regarding their partner, ""we talk all the time, I trust them, so I don't need to go get tested,"" she said. Traylor wasn't always open with her status, but now she dedicates much of her time and energy to raising HIV awareness because she considers the often imperceptible nature of the disease a factor in its continued transmission. Love, sex and stigma . Jon Diggs, a prevention specialist and counselor for The Evolution Project, an Atlanta-based center that offers HIV and STD prevention, treatment, and counseling, calls teens' underestimation of risk part of the ""invisible syndrome."" Diggs works primarily with black gay, bisexual and transgendered men, a community that is disproportionately affected by HIV and AIDS. In 2010, the CDC estimated that 72% of new HIV infections in young people were transmitted through same-sex, male sexual activity. Fifty-seven percent of estimated new infections in this age group were in African-Americans. Michael Kaplan, president and CEO of AIDS United, which supports more than 400 grassroots organizations annually, said that as a young gay man he found it difficult to talk to his doctor about HIV testing. Despite seeing a doctor regularly for diabetes, Kaplan, now 44, said his doctor never offered him an HIV test and made assumptions about his sexual orientation. ""I would say, 'I don't date girls,' and hoped he might simply have a clue, but (he) never seemed to allow for the fact I could be gay,"" Kaplan said. He said doctors need to create ""an open and accepting environment that talks about sexuality as human nature."" ""The reality is, today, the majority of HIV infections are among men who have sex with men,"" Kaplan said. ""Without a doubt, we need broader screening efforts, but I think overall we need broader talk about sexuality in the United States."" If doctors aren't asking about sexuality and sexual activity, he said, then they miss the opportunity to recommend routine testing to young gay men. The reasons that members of this community don't get tested vary, but there are common threads that touch youth across all demographics, especially questions about what love and sex means after a positive HIV diagnosis. ""What is sex going to look like? ... What is life going to look like? Am I going to die?"" These are some of the questions Diggs hears often from those he counsels. The fear of stigma and isolation is great enough that it ""will stop people from wanting to know their status,"" he said, ""but it won't stop the sexual behavior that's happening."" For gay, bisexual and transgendered youth, he said, the fear of isolation can be intensified for those with strong religious backgrounds. They may feel their faith or community will abandon them because of their sexual identity. Diggs said he has seen this lead to risky behavior, and he urges parents to be involved early in an open dialogue about safe sex. This includes recognizing that a message of abstinence doesn't always work with teens and young adults, he said, and recognizing that the conversation should be focused on sexual health, not just avoiding pregnancy. For a gay teen, he said, preventing pregnancy doesn't translate to safer sex. Diggs suggests moving sex and sexual health out of the shadows by making testing a regular family event and using that time as an opportunity to talk about the family's belief system around partnering, sex and marriage. But being open about one's sexual health isn't always an easy thing -- a lesson Traylor has learned when she broaches the topic of dating. ""When I get to the point and I ask someone, 'Would you date someone that's HIV positive?' A lot of people can't answer that question."" Learning when to disclose her status has become part of the learning curve for Traylor. She said being upfront earlier about her status has made things better. People respect her honesty and it makes the conversation easier to have. Other obstacles . For a teen, finding and getting to a testing facility can be a challenge all its own. Ainka Gonzalez, prevention programs manager at AID Atlanta, said she has seen teens struggle to get tested simply because they can't get transportation to a testing facility. For a high school student, teens must find a location that operates outside of school hours if they don't want to involve their parents. And, if a teen tests positive for HIV, their parents may need to get involved anyway. ""Laws differ around the country, but usually if you do test positive for HIV and you're underaged, a parent would have to consent for treatment,"" Gonzalez said. ""If a young person may be having other challenges at home, this of course will amplify it."" Kaplan thinks easier access to testing is crucial. ""If kids got to a place where they were routinely offered screening ... they wouldn't struggle with 'Where can I get tested? Who do I talk to about it?' And a lot of the stigma would be eradicated,"" he said. The next hurdle is paying for treatment. Teens who are too young to have their own health insurance and young adults up to age 25 who are on a parent's health insurance plan will likely need family support to pay for medication. Without insurance, they often need to contact the department of health -- an option Traylor, whose medication runs $3,000 a month, finds ""terrifying."" ""At one point, I was so afraid that I wasn't going to get health insurance anymore that I stopped taking my medicine,"" she said, and hoarded medication because she expected a month-long wait for a doctor's appointment through the department of health. To find HIV testing facilities in your area, go to HIVtest.cdc.gov. The next generation . Traylor feels her HIV education in high school didn't offer crucial information about testing facilities and local rates of infection -- information you can find on CDC.gov. ""In school we learn(ed) that HIV can lead to AIDS and AIDS can lead to death. ... It's a fear and that's it."" Today, Traylor is raising two healthy children with the help of her mother, and is educating them early about HIV. The education starts at home, but it isn't always easy. Traylor helped her 9-year-old son with a project on the stigma of HIV, but admitted she was nervous to talk to him about sex. ""I said, 'If mommy had HIV, what would you do?' He said he wouldn't touch me, he wouldn't kiss me, (or) hug me anymore."" It opened the door for Traylor to talk to her son about how HIV is transmitted. Though she didn't tell him her status, she explained to him that HIV and AIDS can't be spread though common contact, like hugs and kisses. ""Then (he) said, ""OK, Mom, I'll hug you. And I'll kiss you. I'll still love you the same.""","A quarter of those infected with HIV are between the ages of 13 and 24 .
More than half of youths with HIV don't know they have it .

"(CNN) -- If I may speak for some of the dads who have spoken to me over time, this year, our kids can skip the ties, golf clubs and fishing poles. What many of us really want for Father's Day is an attitude adjustment for our kids. There's a story that a friend shared a few months ago that really made an impression on me -- as it did a roomful of other middle-aged parents who are struggling with raising their toddlers or teenagers. One day, my friend said, he walked into his house and casually told his teenage son that he needed some help with some minor chore outside. The son, who had been playing video games, was clearly bothered. Exasperated, he said, ""Dad, whenever you ask me to do stuff like this, it's just such an inconvenience."" Showing more restraint than I would have at that moment, my friend calmly apologized to his son for disturbing him. Then he picked up the phone, and fired his landscaper. Next, my friend sat down at the computer and ordered a gift for his son: a brand new lawnmower. This summer, the teenager -- who is now responsible for doing all the yard work at the family home -- is learning the true meaning of the word, ""inconvenience."" It's a great story. But what I found most interesting was the crowd's reaction. It amounted to thunderous applause. It was as if they were ready to name my friend, ""Father of the Year."" There must be a whole segment of Americans who are thirsty for this message. They're worried that in trying not to be too hard on their children, they've gone too far in the other direction and turned too soft. They're concerned that they've been too lenient on their kids, too eager to cater to their whims, too quick to spoil them and too determined to convince them that they're special. This was all done with the best intentions, but it has produced some bad results. Modern fathers face new expectations . Now, I suspect, a lot of people are experiencing a kind of parents' remorse. Many of us were raised in strict homes full of rules and expectations where mom and dad never tried to be our friends and weren't shy about yanking us back in line. And so, when we became parents, we took a different road. We bought into the philosophy that children needed unlimited self-esteem, maximum freedom and minimal pressure to succeed in life or contribute to society. We taught our kids to think of themselves as entitled and to see themselves as the center of the universe. Now instead of parents having expectations of their children, children have expectations of how their parents are supposed to behave. We're here to serve them, to make their lives as comfortable and convenient as possible. One father told me recently that all he wants from his kids is a little gratitude. That's it. He wants them to show even the slightest bit of appreciation for all that their parents are working hard to provide them. Things come too easy to them, he said. Whatever they want, they get. Now they've forgotten even how to say a simple, ""thank you."" Another father told me that he wants his teenage kids to toughen up a bit before they leave home in a few years and enter the real world. He would like for them to understand that, if you want something, you can't just demand it. You have to work for it. You have to earn it. As for me, I'm getting more comfortable with the idea of making demands on my children -- ages 8, 6 and 4. This Father's Day, and for all the rest to come, here's what they can give me: . I want each of them to stop acting like an only child, and learn to share everything with their siblings, including their parents' time and attention; . I want them to get out of their heads this corrosive idea that the world revolves around them, and all that matters at any given moment of the day is what they want, need or feel; and . I want them to treat people better, starting with their family members, and then moving on to complete strangers, and not look down on anyone -- ever. Of course, the rub is that this is what parents are for. It's our job to instill these values and teach children how to become good people. It doesn't happen organically. And it won't happen magically. It'll only happen if we set the standards and and lay down the law when they're not met. And fathers have a special role to play in all of this. It's not easy being a good dad. In fact, it's exhausting. And it can often be frustrating. In fact, frankly, a lot of fathers decide it is too hard. They give up, check out, hang back and essentially let their kids raise themselves. It's one of the reasons why we got into this mess. The only way out is for fathers to get back in the game. We have to be present in our children's lives. Forget about being their friends. They have friends. They need fathers. We have to be in our kids' faces, just like Grandpa and Dad used to be. And for the same reason -- because we care enough not to be anywhere else. Happy Father's Day.

"(CNN) -- Facebook and Microsoft disclosed that they received thousands of requests for user data from government agencies in the United States in the last half of 2012. Facebook said it got between 9,000 and 10,000 requests targeting between 18,000 and 19,000 accounts during that period. ""These requests run the gamut -- from things like a local sheriff trying to find a missing child, to a federal marshal tracking a fugitive, to a police department investigating an assault, to a national security official investigating a terrorist threat,"" Ted Ullyot, Facebook's general counsel, said in a post Friday night . ""With more than 1.1 billion monthly active users worldwide, this means that a tiny fraction of 1% of our user accounts were the subject of any kind of U.S. state, local, or federal U.S. government requests."" The disclosure comes amid a firestorm over revelations that both were among companies that turned over user data to the National Security Agency's web surveillance program. The U.S. government has a sweeping system for monitoring emails, photos, search histories and other data from major American Internet companies, including Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Skype. ""The Department of Justice reached agreements with certain providers that will allow the publication of additional data pertaining to U.S. government requests for user data in compliance with legal process,"" a Justice Department spokesperson told CNN Saturday. ""Under these agreements, the providers plan to begin publishing aggregate totals of criminal and national security requests received from federal, state, and local governments over a six-month period."" More transparency . Both companies got government permission to publish the reports as long as they were grouped with all others requests, including from state and local agencies. The grouping of the data made it hard to single out those made for national security reasons. Google publishes a transparency report using requests from governments worldwide. It said grouping information is a ""step back"" for users. ""We have always believed that it's important to differentiate between different types of government requests,"" Google said in a statement. ""... Our request to the government is clear: to be able to publish aggregate numbers of national security requests, including FISA disclosures, separately."" Facebook said it has been in talks with U.S. officials to seek greater transparency on national security-related orders. In an effort to combat criticism, Microsoft also disclosed information on its data requests Friday night. ""For the six months ended December 31, 2012, Microsoft received between 6,000 and 7,000 criminal and national security warrants, subpoenas and orders affecting between 31,000 and 32,000 consumer accounts from U.S. governmental entities (including local, state and federal),"" said John Frank, Microsoft's vice president. The Snowden index: Opinions about the NSA leaker . Both companies said the information they were allowed to publish falls short of what users need to better understand the issues. ""We are permitted to publish data on national security orders received, but only if aggregated with law enforcement requests from all other U.S. local, state and federal law enforcement agencies,"" Frank said. The Justice Department spokesperson said, ""These aggregate totals include all instances in which a government entity has served lawful process on the providers - be it a grand jury subpoena or search warrant in a criminal matter, a national security letter, a court order under FISA, or another type of request pursuant to statutory authorization. ""The publication of these numbers will show that an extraordinarily small number of accounts are subject to legal process. These agreements reflect our continued commitment to working with providers to afford greater transparency to the public while preserving confidentiality required for law enforcement or national security reasons."" Obama administration officials have pushed back against criticism on the domestic surveillance in the aftermath of the classified leaks last week that disclosed details of covert surveillance programs. Edward Snowden, 29, has admitted leaking the classified documents about the covert programs. Top-secret program . The top-secret program is legal, conducted properly and could have helped detect a 9/11 hijacker had it been in place before the 2001 terrorist attacks, FBI Director Robert Mueller said Thursday. Civil liberties groups and legislators are among critics condemning the program as government overreach beyond the intention and limits of the Patriot Act originally passed in the aftermath of the 2001 attacks. ""It's my fear that we are on the verge of becoming a surveillance state, collecting billions of electronic records on law-abiding Americans every single day,"" said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the judiciary panel. Conyers said he is co-sponsoring legislation that would address ""the overbreadth and impenetrability of the surveillance programs."" Wrong public perception? But legislators of both parties joined Mueller in defending the programs. ""This program does not target innocent Americans in any way, shape or form,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican. ""These programs have helped keep America safe. They have enhanced our ability to go after terrorists who want to bring harm to the American people."" Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said public perception of the government data mining was wrong. One of the programs, under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, collects billions of phone records to create a database for use in tracking suspected terrorists. Another under Section 702 of the Patriot Act deals with computer activity and other information of foreigners.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Investors around the world have far more fear than hope this week judging from a major selloff of global stocks and gloomy predictions from the World Bank and PIMCO, the global bond giant. Japan's Tokyo Nikkei led Thursday's rout across Asian stock markets, closing down 6.4% to a two-month low. The index has also lost a full 20% of its value since this year's high -- only set on May 22 -- meaning the bourse is now in bear market territory. The Shanghai Composite fell 2.8% while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 2.7%. ""The fear of markets in Asia is that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar could pose risks across the entire region,"" says Frederic Neumann, HSBC's Co-Head of Asian Economic Research and Managing Director. ""Asian equity markets are now reacting to that reality. We're at an inflection point and (the stronger dollar) will be with us for quite some time. We think the current volatility will probably persist."" The fall in Japan's stock markets was exacerbated by central bank inaction on June 11. The Bank of Japan announced it would keep interest rates on hold, dashing investor hopes for further monetary easing and sending the Japanese yen to a two-and-a-half month high. The yen now stands at $1 to 94 yen. A stronger yen means Japanese exporters profit less from goods sold overseas. ""We anticipate the yen will go below 90,"" says Ben Collett, Head of Asian Equities at Sunrise Brokers in Hong Kong. ""If we look at what the Japanese stock market has done year to date we're still sitting on some decent gains. If you're a U.S. investor in Japan and sitting on 10% profits, there's nothing wrong with taking that. Would I say empty the stock account? No, but you should be reducing."" As investors sold off stocks in Asia, they also digested a new research note from PIMCO, which runs the world's largest mutual fund. The California-based global firm predicts a 60% probability that the world will be hit with another global recession in the next three to five years. Adding a dash more trepidation about the global economy, the World Bank lowered its 2013 global growth forecast to 2.2% this week. In the developed world, ""the challenges are especially difficult in high-income Europe, where growth is being held back by weak confidence and continued banking sector and fiscal restructuring,"" said the twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report. Bright spots do exist in the developing world however. Overall growth in emerging markets is expected to accelerate to 5.1% this year, and to 5.6% in 2014. Developing countries in East Asia and the Pacific are forecast to enjoy the highest rates of growth from now through 2015 -- upwards of 7.3%. The world's biggest economy, the United States, is also on ""more solid ground"" despite the World Bank's prediction of slower global growth. ""I don't think it's anything to worry about,"" says HSBC's Neumann. ""This is really a rotation from emerging market-led growth to an advanced market coming back."" The last time an emerging-to-developed market rotation occurred, adds Neumann, was in the late 1990's when Asian markets saw a slowdown and the U.S. rose to the top with a budget surplus and the tech boom.

"(CNN) -- Today is the 46th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared unconstitutional any ban on interracial marriage. More than four decades after the historic and aptly named Loving decision, the U.S. Supreme Court is once again poised to rule in a case that could put an end to discriminatory bans prohibiting marriage, this time for gay and lesbian couples. This month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in a decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case brought by two California couples challenging the constitutionality of the state's ban on same sex marriages, commonly called Prop 8. Attorneys Ted Olson and David Boies -- a Republican and Democrat best known for battling each other before the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore -- have teamed up and taken the Perry case beyond California. Olson and Boies argued before the justices that the Supreme Court has the obligation under the Constitution to strike down not just Prop 8, but all state laws banning marriage equality for gay and lesbian Americans. After all, they say, this is precisely how the court ruled in Loving -- and 13 other cases dating back to 1888 in which a majority of the justices stood up to protect the fundamental right of every American to marry the person he or she loves. A broad ruling in the Perry case this month would be a historic step forward in affirming that gay Americans are entitled to the same rights and freedoms as everyone else. Although I firmly believe public opinion is irrelevant to the court's responsibility to ensure equality under the law, our nation is clearly ready to embrace marriage equality. When the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in 1967, a Gallup poll found that only 20% of Americans approved of such marriages. But the court fulfilled its duty to protect individual rights without regard to what was popular. Today, we have already have evolved much further on marriage equality. A growing bipartisan majority of voters -- 58% -- support marriage rights for same-sex couples. When Richard Loving told his lawyer to ""tell the court I love my wife,"" he could not have known that his words would still be applicable 46 years later in the very same courtroom. There is never a wrong time to stand up for justice and equality, but the time has never been more right to stand up for gay rights than in the Perry case. As the Supreme Court weighs equality for gay and lesbian couples, the anniversary of Loving provides a timely reminder of a new legacy they could write for the history books. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","46 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down a ban on interracial marriage .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese car makers are grappling with sluggish demand at home and abroad as well as a strong yen. So perhaps it's not a big surprise that one corporate titan is now trying an age-old marketing ploy aimed at female drivers. Honda has released a new model of the Honda Fit, interestingly named ""She's."" Some of it might sound like an idea straight from the 1950s -- a car made for women -- complete with numerous pink features, as well as a windshield and air conditioning that claims to help a woman's sensitive skin. In fact, the idea of marketing a car to women was tried in the 1950s. Dodge's La Femme featured space for a woman's lipstick and purse. It too came in pink -- but faded fast, lasting only from 1955 to 1956. Back in 2000, Ford teamed up with Maytag, pitching a minivan complete with a washing machine and microwave. The ""soccer moms"" never put it to the test though, as the Windstar Solutions never cruised past the concept stage. ""She's"" sticking to a fairly predictable road with pink stitching in the seats, pink tweaks in the dashboard and a windshield that the company says blocks more ultraviolet rays. Honda also adds, the ""plasma cluster"" air conditioning helps prevent dry skin. (When we asked about the perhaps more grammatically correct 'Hers,' we were told that the former apparently sounded better.) If you don't care for pink, there's white or brown as well. And when we asked if a Honda executive really did tell a Japanese newspaper that the colors are meant to ""match a woman's eye shadow,"" we're told yes -- with no tinge of regret that some women might find such a comment offensive. We also posed the question to She's designer: Essentially, was she concerned about offending some women with such a product? We were told people have different tastes. And in Japan, there is also a strong culture of all things cute -- or ""kawaii."" They are not wrong. Kawaii is the one word we heard nearly every time we showed the car's brochure to women on the streets of Tokyo. But of course what is more crucial to any car's success are its sales. And when it comes to that, Honda without giving a precise number says so far ""She's"" exceeding their expectations.","Honda releases new model of Honda Fit: 'She's'

"(CNN) -- Whether you like him or not, or think that his dominance is bad for Formula One, there's no denying that Sebastian Vettel is simply unstoppable this season. Even his teammate Mark Webber, with whom the German's relations have never been warm, admits that Vettel is ""in another category."" The four-time world champion won by more than 30 seconds in Abu Dhabi, having started Sunday's race second on the grid behind his veteran Red Bull colleague. While Webber bounced back from yet another poor start to ensure a 15th 1-2 for the team -- he has only won once from nine poles -- Vettel motored clear once again while his rivals scrapped for minor placings. It was the 26-year-old's seventh successive win, matching his personal best of 11 victories in a season. With two races left on the calendar, he can match Alberto Ascari's record of nine in a row in 1952-53 and Michael Schumacher's 2004 feat of 13 in one season. ""The car was absolutely brilliant. There is not much more to say. I was flying at stages -- at least it felt like it -- and there were some massive gaps, which was a big surprise,"" Vettel said. Vettel has been booed on the podium several times this year -- no doubt in part due to the Malaysia incident when he ignored team orders and passed Webber for victory -- but he celebrated at Yas Marina Sunday as he did in India last weekend on clinching a fourth straight title, with wheelspins. Red Bull paid the first fine, but Vettel -- who earns a reported $16 million yearly salary -- will have to take this one after the 37th victory of his young career. ""I think Sebastian can pay the fine this week,"" team principal Christian Horner said. ""That was a champion's drive."" Webber, who is quitting F1 at the end of this season, could only pay tribute after being forced to settle for second -- as he did in Japan last month after starting on pole. ""The start wasn't great,"" said the 37-year-old, who held off Mercedes' third-placed Nico Rosberg and Lotus' Romain Grosjean in fourth. ""Nico got an unbelievable start and Seb's was a bit better than mine. On the first stint we were not strong enough on the soft tires. ""After that the race went pretty well for me but Seb was gone -- he was in another category up front. I had a nice little battle with Nico for second. ""I think he (Vettel) is in a sweet spot, for sure. In the end, I did my best today and this was my overall personal best around here."" Mercedes stayed second ahead of Ferrari in the constructors' standings as 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton was seventh. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso remained second in the drivers' championship behind Vettel after coming home fifth, working his way up from 10th at the start, while teammate Felipe Massa was eighth. Force India had both drivers in the points as Paul di Resta was sixth and Adrian Sutil 10th, while McLaren's Sergio Perez was ninth as teammate Jenson Button paid the price for another early scrape and ended up 12th. Button's fellow former titleholder Kimi Raikkonen had even worse day. Excluded from qualifying --despite setting the fifth quickest time -- after his Lotus failed a technical test on Saturday, the Finn didn't make it past the first lap. While Vettel began from the pit lane in similar circumstances last year to finish third, Raikkonen -- who is joining Ferrari next season after a pay dispute with Lotus -- started with the tailenders and a ding with a Caterham ended his hopes of repeating his 2012 success in the race. ""We didn't touch hard, but I think the angle was very unlucky and it broke the steering,"" Raikkonen said.","World champion Sebastian Vettel equals his personal best of 11 wins in a season .

"(CNN) -- Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez is used to throngs of media clamoring to ask him questions, but the NFL star has never had to deal with them camping outside his home. But since reports that the player had been questioned in connection with a homicide less than a mile from his Massachusetts house, he has faced the gantlet for the past three days. A line of reporters waited on the road in front of his house Wednesday, along with neighbors eager for a word from the player. Nearby, police sifted through the woods for clues that could shed some light on what happened to Odin Lloyd, 27, who was found dead less than a mile from Hernandez's expansive home in North Attleborough. Three search warrants have been issued in the case, according to the North Attleboro criminal clerk magistrate Mark Sturdy. They have not been made public yet because the files have not been returned, and Sturdy would not comment on whether they involved Hernandez's house or property. See also: NFL launches help line for current, former players . Hernandez has yet to say anything publicly. Instead, a statement from his lawyer acknowledged there was an investigation, but didn't confirm media reports that authorities had questioned his client. ""It has been widely reported in the media that the state police have searched the home of our client, Aaron Hernandez, as part of an ongoing investigation,"" attorney Michael Fee said. ""Out of respect for that process, neither we nor Aaron will have any comment about the substance of that investigation until it has come to a conclusion."" His agency, Athletes First, also had no comment Wednesday. Lloyd died of a gunshot wound, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Thursday. Lloyd's sister, Olivia Thibou, told CNN that Lloyd and Hernandez were friends who were at a Boston nightclub together Friday night. She said her brother was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance. She did not know when or how her brother and Hernandez met. Thibou said she did not know of any problems between Hernandez and Lloyd, who worked for a landscaping company. She can't imagine why anyone would want to kill her brother, whom she described as a friendly guy who was like a father to her 7-year-old daughter. ""My son is a wonderful child,"" Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, said. ""He's a family guy. He has not done anything to hurt anyone."" Neighbors told CNN that Hernandez, 23, has been a quiet, respectful neighbor. Hernandez, who is rehabbing a shoulder injury, returned to the house Wednesday afternoon wearing a gray Patriots sweatshirt and blue sweatpants. He didn't acknowledge the presence of the media and appeared to spend the rest of the day inside or on the back deck. On the street between the home and where Lloyd's body was found, police searched through tall grass. Nearly a dozen Massachusetts state police officers entered Hernandez's home Tuesday evening, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Patriots spokesman Stacey James said Tuesday the team was aware of the reports but wouldn't comment during an ongoing police investigation. Hernandez has played three seasons for the Patriots, averaging 58 catches per year. He was selected for the Pro Bowl in his second season. ESPN reported he signed last year a contract extension that would pay him $40 million for the 2014-18 seasons. Forbes names Tiger Woods as highest-paid athlete . North Attleborough is about 15 miles from Gillette Stadium, where the Patriots play their home games. As the mystery was unfolding in Massachusetts, Hernandez and his attorneys were dealing with a lawsuit in Miami in which a man claimed Hernandez shot him after they rode in a car after an argument at a strip club. According to a court document, Alexander Bradley contends he lost his right eye because of the February incident. The case was dismissed Monday over an error in the initial paperwork, and was refiled a few days later. Bleacher Report: Aaron Hernandez reportedly questioned by police in homicide investigation .

"Geismar, Louisiana (CNN) -- A second man has died as a result of Thursday's explosion at a Louisiana chemical plant, the Louisiana State Police said Friday. Scott Thrower, 47, of St. Amant, died at a Baton Rouge hospital after suffering burns in the blast at the Williams plant in Geismar, state police trooper Jared Sandifer said. The Thursday morning explosion killed one other worker and injured more than 100 others in what company CEO Alan Armstrong characterized Friday as ""a terrible and unprecedented tragedy and an extremely difficult time for all of us."" Before Thrower's death was announced, the company said six people -- two employees and four contractors -- still were hospitalized Friday. Their conditions weren't available. The explosion at the plant, which Williams says produces about 1.3 billion pounds of ethylene and 90 million pounds of polymer-grade propylene each year, sent a plume of thick smoke into the air and initially forced authorities to ask people nearby to stay inside to avoid exposure to potentially toxic fumes. Investigators still were waiting for the plant to be safe enough to investigate the blast's cause, officials said Friday. Armstrong told reporters Friday that the incident was tough to take. ""A lot of us in this industry have spent much of our careers working to make it safe to operate, so when something happens like this, honestly it feels like a big failure,"" Armstrong said. ""I would tell you we're very committed to returning to a safe operation, but this industry works extremely hard to make these operations safe, so it's very, very disheartening when something like this occurs."" A dramatic image provided to CNN affiliate WAFB by a plant worker who did not want to be identified showed workers running from a towering orange column of flame ripping through part of the plant on Thursday. The fire has since been extinguished. The plant had a minor propylene leak Friday, but the chemical vaporized as it came out, Sandifer said. The state Department of Environmental Quality and Williams-hired air monitoring contractors are checking the site, and air-quality tests so far have found nothing concerning, he said. ""There is no threat to the public of any toxic chemicals being in the air,"" Sandifer said. Authorities lifted a shelter-in-place order for people in the area Thursday afternoon. Three employees and 100 contractors received medical treatment after the blast. More than 830 people were at the site -- more than usual, because of a plant-expansion project, plant manager Larry Bayer said Friday. Bayer said the blast happened in the plant's propylene fractionation area, but said he didn't know what led to the explosion. ""We have been waiting for the last amounts of residual hydrocarbons to escape from the ... piping through the night. An investigation to determine what happened is still pending and will begin as soon as our team is allowed to go back into the plant by the state police,"" Bayer said. About 25 workers were in the facility's control room Friday to monitor the situation, but the plant has effectively shut down, company officials said. The first worker who died, killed 29-year-old Williams employee Zachary Green, joined the company in October. Williams officials met with his family at their home Thursday, the company said. ""We are grieving for the loss of Zack, who was part of our Williams community,"" Armstrong said in statement Thursday. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this time of sorrow.""

"Oakland Township, Michigan (CNN) -- The FBI on Tuesday spent a second day digging in a Detroit-area field in the latest search for the remains of former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa -- an effort spurred by information from an aging reputed mobster. Agents began digging Monday in waist-high grass in Oakland Township north of Detroit, a location determined in part from information provided by alleged mobster Tony Zerilli. Media and curious onlookers gathered some distance from the private property. The search was stopped for the night as evening approached but will resume Wednesday at 8 a.m. Nothing yet has been found, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation said Tuesday afternoon. Oakland Sheriff Mike Bouchard said investigators are using probes to determine what the ground makeup is, but have not found samples that would require lab analysis. Two concrete slabs have been removed during the dig. It's unclear whether the slabs were foundations for a barn that once stood there. Scientists from Michigan State University were at the site Tuesday to help with soil analysis. Agents are expected to finish the search this week, possibly in the next 48 hours, Bouchard said. This is the latest chapter of the nearly four-decades-long search for Hoffa. It was sparked by ""highly credible"" information from Zerilli, according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation. Earlier this year, Zerilli, now in his 80s, told New York's NBC 4 that Hoffa was buried in a Michigan field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen in 1975. Hoffa, then 62, disappeared after being seen on July 30, 1975, outside a Detroit-area restaurant. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and to the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. The FBI spent months looking into Zerilli's claims before seeking court authorization to excavate the field and look for evidence of a shallow grave, according to a law enforcement source. Contrary to what's been thought for years, Zerilli said he was told Hoffa's disappearance was not connected to Anthony ""Tony Pro"" Provensano, the New York City-area Genovese family crime boss who allegedly wanted to get rid of Hoffa. Instead, according to the source, Zerilli -- convicted years ago of crimes in connection with organized crime in Detroit -- told the FBI that Detroit mobsters wanted Hoffa dead. At the time, Hoffa was thought to be trying to get back into a power position with the labor movement after his release from prison. He was convicted in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971. Zerilli was in prison himself when Hoffa disappeared. Zerilli, according to the law enforcement source, said that when he was freed, he asked a mob enforcer what happened to Hoffa. The mobster allegedly told Zerilli that Detroit's crime bosses ordered the Hoffa hit. They lured him to a meeting and then drove him to a farm owned by a mob underboss. The enforcer allegedly told Zerilli that Hoffa was killed and buried on the property, which covers several acres. Zerilli's attorney, David Chasnick, told reporters Monday that Zerilli was told Hoffa was hit with a shovel and buried alive. Zerilli published a manuscript about the Hoffa claim online that includes details of the alleged hit. ""He wasn't shot, he wasn't stabbed, nothing like that. A cement slab of some sort was placed on top of the dirt to make certain he was not going to be discovered. And that was it. End of story,"" Zerilli's manuscript says. The area being searched was described as relatively small -- about the size of a small party tent, according to the source. Aerial video showed a somewhat larger area had been cleared of grass. Zerilli has been to the site more than once, said Chasnick, who declined to elaborate. Hoffa's daughter, Barbara Crancer, told CNN by phone Tuesday that she is always appreciative when the FBI follows credible leads in the case. But, she said, she doesn't want to get her hopes up. ""We've been through it too many times,"" she said. FBI Special Agent Bob Foley, head of the agency's Detroit office, told CNN at the scene that the information leading to the search ""reached the threshold of probable cause, which was sufficient to allow us to obtain a search warrant."" The paperwork supporting the search warrant is under seal. ""If it didn't rise to that level then, certainly, we wouldn't be out here,"" Foley said. Hoffa's disappearance and presumed death have vexed investigators. As recently as October, soil samples were taken from a home in a suburban Detroit community after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after Hoffa disappeared. The soil samples were tested, and showed no evidence of human remains or decomposition. Zerilli was freed in 2008 after his last prison sentence. Keith Corbett, a former U.S. attorney, told CNN earlier this year that Zerilli headed a Detroit organized crime family from 1970 to 1975, but was in prison when Hoffa vanished. In an interview with CNN affiliate WDIV-TV, Zerilli denied playing any role in Hoffa's disappearance. Zerilli told CNN affiliate WXYZ on Tuesday that he hoped authorities would find the remains of his ""good friend,"" to put Hoffa's family at ease and put this story to rest. ""I'd like to see him exhumed and be buried properly, like he deserves to be,"" he said. Man convicted in mob crimes says he's 'certain' where Hoffa is buried .

"(CNN) -- A court has sentenced four relatives to years in prison for their roles in kidnapping and assaulting a gay man in Kentucky . The four were accused of luring Kevin Pennington into a truck in April 2011 and driving him up a deserted road into Kingdom Come State Park. They pulled him out of the car and assaulted him, and as they were looking for a tire iron to kill him, he escaped, according to prosecutors. David J. Jenkins, 39, was sentenced Wednesday to three decades in prison while his 22-year-old cousin, Anthony R. Jenkins, will be locked up for 17 years. A jury in London, Kentucky, found the two men guilty of kidnapping and conspiracy, but acquitted both of federal hate crime charges in a major blow to the Justice Department. Two female relatives who pleaded guilty to the scheme to kidnap and assault the man -- as well as taking part in a hate crime -- were also sentenced Wednesday. The women were the first to be convicted under the federal sexual orientation provision to the hate crime law. Mable A. Jenkins, 20, got eight years and four months in prison, and Alexis L. Jenkins, also 20, was sentenced to eight years. The two women testified against their male relatives. Some of the charges against the relatives fell under the Matthew Shepard James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a federal law that outlaws attacks based on a victim's sexual orientation. Federal hate crime law was expanded in 2009 to include a victim's perceived sexual orientation, gender or disability. The law was named for Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Both men were attacked and killed in separate incidents in 1998 that drew national attention to the need to toughen hate crime laws. Shepard was gay, and Byrd was killed in a racially- motivated attack. He was black.","The four are accused of luring Kevin Pennington into a truck .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to put the brakes on plans for a mall on a park in Istanbul for now, a compromise of sorts to end the two weeks of persistent unrest across the nation. The government will keep construction plans on hold until a court considers the objections of protesters camped out in the Taksim Square's Gezi Park, officials say, If a judicial ruling is not in line with what Gezi protesters want, a plebiscite on the park will be held. Erdogan also will investigate claims of excessive use of force by police -- a major concern of the citizenry. This comes after leaders of the protests in Istanbul's Taksim Square met last night with Erdogan at his home in Ankara, the capital -- an event regarded as a sign of reconciliation between the government and the protesters. The protesters -- part of a Taksim Solidarity coalition -- were pleased: ""This is just the beginning, resistance will continue,"" protesters chanted at a meeting in Istanbul. Erdogan, in a speech broadcast on TV Friday, called on people camped in Gezi Park to withdraw. ""We say please, come now and withdraw from Gezi Park, go to your homes. And if those from those illegal organizations remain there, then we will be left face-to-face with them. Because that Gezi Park is not a park of this illegal organization, these occupying organizations. It belongs to the whole of Istanbul and whole of the nation, and everyone should be able to benefit and enjoy this Gezi Park easily."" The sit-in against the development served as a symbolic stance against what many perceived as creeping infringement of rights in a secular society. People protested plans to bulldoze Gezi Park and replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of a 19th-century Ottoman barracks. What was a small protest broadened into an outpouring in the square and throughout the country as security forces cracked down hard on demonstrators. The images, seen worldwide on social media and TV, sparked criticism in world capitals as well as Turkey itself -- a NATO member and a U.S. ally. The unrest also signaled political danger for Erdogan -- a popular, populist, and democratically elected politician serving his third term in office. Erdogan has been criticized for heavy handed tactics, even among his allies, and for trying to impose developments without popular public input. The park plan is the final straw for many anti-Erdogan Turks, who think the government is intent on imposing its will whenever and wherever it wants. The criticism has been a blow to Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted party, which has overseen an economic boom in the country over the past decade. His actions have buoyed the secular opposition -- the one-time powerful demographic that feels marginalized by Erdogan's Justice and Development party, the AKP. But despite Erdogan's tough rhetoric toward protesters, he and his government appear to be hearing the diverse voices in Taksim and other squares across Turkey. He mocked what he saw as the protesters' lack of cleanliness and rowdiness and warned those people camped out in the park and the square to leave. After the meeting, Huseyin Celik, deputy chairman of the AKP, told reporters in Ankara on Friday that Gezi Park would be kept untouched until the court's decision. ""A plebiscite will be held to sound Istanbul people out to determine what they want and do not want. We will definitely respect the final decision of the people of Istanbul no matter what the outcome will be. Our government will undoubtedly implement the decision of Istanbul people."" Tayfun Kahraman, a city planner speaking on behalf of the Taksim Solidarity protest movement, thanked Erdogan and his ministers for accepting their demands for a meeting. He said Erdogan said the government would implement the final result of a plebiscite across Istanbul and investigate police behavior. ""We will closely follow his promises and the process. Unfortunately four people died in the incidents. We still feel the pain of their death. We will organize an activity in Gezi Park tomorrow, a commemoration for the dead as a lament and expression of deep sorrow,"" Kahraman said. Taksim Solidarity is a coalition of protesters that comprises dentists, pharmacists, engineers and other educated secularists. The government wants the protesters to leave Taksim, but there is no single organization or person capable of getting everyone to pack up and go. Many groups in Taksim and some -- such as the LGBT, Turkish Youth Union and Red Hack -- have already vowed to hunker down in the park. In Istanbul later, protesters stressed the importance of the police brutality issue, with one official saying their attacks ""trampled all human dignity."" That issue was hit home strongly during the meeting. Protesters said Erdogan didn't respond to demands that those detained should be freed and stripped of charges and that central squares across the country be opened for freedom of speech and expression. Earlier this week, many activists had backed out of a meeting with Erdogan out of anger over the tear gas against demonstrators by police this week. After two weeks of raucous anti-government street protests, calm settled over Istanbul for a second day Friday as the city prepared for pro-government counter demonstrations. Erdogan's party has organized counter protests for the weekend to give a voice to Turkey's ""quiet majority to the people and the world,"" he said. They will show the international community ""a real, true picture of Turkey."" Two rallies will be held away from anti-government protests to avoid possible confrontations, he said.

"New York (CNN) -- The FBI and New York police have released surveillance video of the unsolved 2008 bombing of a U.S. Armed Forces Recruiting Station in Times Square. The bureau said Tuesday it released a ""never-before-seen video of the suspect(s) and a picture of the explosive device."" The grainy, seven-minute-long video shows a bird's-eye view of the explosive device and a suspect riding a blue bicycle around New York City between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. According to the bureau, the suspect may be linked to similar unsolved incidents in New York -- one in October 2007 and one in May 2005. In the 2007 incident, a bomb was detonated near the Mexican Consulate. At that time, the authorities said the explosive device was similar to the ones used in the 2005 blast at the British Consulate. In both cases, authorities were looking for a person seen riding a bike in the area between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. Hoping for new leads, the FBI is using billboards and other outlets in a media blitz to encourage the public to take a close look at the newly released video. It also is advertising a $65,000 reward. The billboards will be seen in Times Square and much of New England, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. A hash tag for the investigation involving the three unsolved incidents will be posted on Twitter as #bikebomber. ""Someone, somewhere knows something about a bomber who's still on the run,"" said George Venizelos, the FBI's assistant director in charge in New York. Authorities believe the Times Square ""bike bomber"" had as many as five people acting as a surveillance team or lookouts at the time of the Times Square attack. According to the bureau, the explosive device was built using an ammunition can, something more commonly found on the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan than on the sidewalks of Times Square. The can was filled halfway with black powder and detonated using a time fuse. Although no injuries were reported, the device could have caused significant harm if people had been close to the blast, authorities said. A federal law enforcement source told CNN that bomb technicians say the Times Square bomb was stronger than the device detonated during the Boston Marathon in terms of destructive capability. But unlike the bombs used in Boston, it contained no shrapnel. Five years ago, police released a photo of a suspect, an image extracted from surveillance video. It shows a person riding a bicycle away from the scene shortly after the explosion. Police also distributed a second photo showing a blue Ross bicycle that was found in a garbage unit nearby. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said in 2008 that there is a ""possibility"" the three incidents are connected. ""The times are very similar,"" he said. ""All three incidents took place with an individual on a bike, leaving a bomb. So, that's a possibility. We can't say with certainty that that's the case, but that's one of our investigative premises.""","The FBI releases surveillance video and offers a reward to get leads in a 2008 bombing .

"(CNN) -- Sometime in late 2007, Basaaly Saeed Moalin, a cabdriver living in San Diego, began to have a series of phone conversations with Aden Hashi Ayrow, one of the leaders of Al-Shabaab, a notorious Somali terrorist group. Moalin had no idea the National Security Agency was listening in. In one of those phone calls Ayrow urged Moalin to send money to Al-Shabaab, telling him that he urgently needed several thousand dollars. At one point Ayrow told Moalin that it was ""time to finance the jihad"" and at another, ""You are running late with the stuff. Send some and something will happen."" Over several months in 2008, Moalin transferred thousands of dollars to Al-Shabaab. Moalin even told Ayrow that he could use his house in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, and ""after you bury your stuff deep in the ground, you would, then, plant the trees on top."" U.S. prosecutors later asserted that Moalin was offering his house to Al-Shabaab as a place to hide weapons. Earlier this year the San Diego cabbie was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to Al-Shabaab and of money laundering for the terrorist organization. In 2012, Al-Shabaab (""the Youth"" in Arabic) formally announced its merger with al Qaeda. However, there is nothing on the public record to suggest Moalin was planning an attack in the United States. Another financial supporter of a terrorist group who was detected by NSA surveillance was Khalid Ouazzani, a native of Morocco and a naturalized American living in Kansas City, Missouri. Sometime in 2008, Ouazzani, who ran Truman Used Auto Parts in Kansas City, swore an oath of allegiance to al Qaeda and, until he was arrested two years later, he sent funds to the terrorist group, providing a total of some $23,000 to al Qaeda. As revealed Tuesday at a House Intelligence Committee hearing about the NSA's surveillance programs, Ouazzani also had some kind of a ""nascent"" plan to attack the New York Stock Exchange, according to FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce. Ouazzani's attorney told CNNMoney he had no part in such a plot, and court documents in his case do not mention any plan to attack the stock exchange. Al-Shabaab's connection to San Diego and al Qaeda's connection to Kansas City were two of the terrorist conspiracies that were uncovered by NSA surveillance that Joyce and other top national security officials, including the NSA's director, Gen. Keith Alexander, pointed to at Tuesday's hearing as examples of how NSA programs have worked to interrupt terrorist plotting. These officials otherwise gave no new public information to substantiate the claim that Alexander had made last week that ""dozens of terrorist events"" had been averted by NSA surveillance, both in the United States and abroad. On Tuesday, Alexander said he would provide members of the House Intelligence Committee additional information about some 50 other terrorists plots that had been averted in the United States and around the world, but this would be behind closed doors as the details of these plots remain classified. The public record indicates that few of these are likely to have taken place in the United States. That's because traditional law enforcement methods have overwhelmingly played the most significant role in foiling terrorist attacks, according to a survey of all the jihadist terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11 by the New America Foundation. Jihadist extremists based in the United States have mounted 43 plots to conduct attacks within the United States since 2001. Of those plots, nine involved an actual terrorist act that was not prevented by any type of government action, such as the 2009 shooting spree by Maj. Nidal Hasan at Fort Hood, Texas, that killed 13. Of the remaining 34 plots, the public record shows that at least 30 were uncovered by using standard policing practices such as informants, undercover officers and tips to law enforcement. At Tuesday's hearing, Joyce also pointed to two other plots averted by NSA's programs; the 2009 plots by Najibullah Zazi to bomb the New York subway and by David Coleman Headley to attack a Danish newspaper that had printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Alexander had previously cited the Zazi and Headley cases as examples of how the NSA surveillance programs have averted terrorist attacks. Tuesday's hearing did little to reassure the public that the NSA's surveillance programs have done much to stop terrorist attacks at home, with the major exception of the plot by Zazi to attack the New York subway system around the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. As the FBI's Joyce explained at Tuesday's hearing this was ""the first core al Qaeda plot since 9/11"" that was directed from Pakistan inside the United States. There is no doubt that it was a serious plot, but if it was the only such serious plot on American soil that the government averted as a result of the NSA's surveillance programs, the public will have to decide whether it justifies the large-scale government surveillance programs -- no matter how carefully they are run so as to respect Americans' civil liberties.","NSA chief offered information on yield from monitoring phone calls .

"(CNN) -- Since President Obama seems to be a reflective soul, he must be reflecting on the irony of his latest predicament: as the man who came into office promising to change everything and who instead seems to have let much of what he promised to fix only get worse. First, the good news: Slowly but surely, the economy is coming back. And that's no small feat, given where it was in 2009. Then, everything else: The constitutional scholar, civil libertarian and antiwar activist can't seem to wake up each day without some basic challenge to his political ecology. The confirmed presence of chemical weapons in Syria now makes some sort of escalation there inevitable, just as the war in Afghanistan winds down. (More military support for the rebels? No-fly zone?) The newbie senator who railed against President George W. Bush's ""warrantless wiretaps"" is now defending his own version of government for-your-own-safety intrusion. (""No one is listening to your telephone calls."") He gives a speech defending drone strikes; he answers questions about the Justice Department's dragnet surveillance of media outlets in its leak investigations. He might be forgiven for asking himself James Stockdale's infamous vice presidential debate questions: Who am I? And what am I doing here? CNN poll: Obama numbers plunge into generation gap . Now all he has to do is answer them. The president has -- rightly -- called for a public debate about the proper balance between national security and privacy. But the debate can't happen without him. In fact, he needs to lead it. That's what presidents are supposed to do when the country is having a national conversation. It's part of the job description. In the National Security Agency controversy, we've heard from the leaker, the director of the NSA, the director of national intelligence, the members of the intelligence committees. We heard a bit from the president, who seems to be saying, in effect, that ""I'm glad you guys are talking about this, because we are going to have to make some tough choices as a society."" Here's what we know: The president entered office skeptical of the very programs he is now defending. But after vetting them and adding some additional protections, he now thinks they are important, even integral, to our self-defense. All of which makes sense to me personally. But it's hard to categorically decide something (especially when it affects you) without some more information. And if you're asking people to decide that Big Brother-ism in some form is OK -- and to trust that you are doing the right thing -- you've got to give them something to work with. Remember when Bush said ""I hope the American people trust me""? It turned out they didn't. Obama bristles at suggestion he's shifted on snooping . In fact, the public's view of the Obama administration's handling of civil liberties is beginning to eerily resemble what the public thought about Bush: Forty-three percent in a new CNN/ORC poll say the administration has gone too far in restricting some civil liberties in order to fight terrorism. In 2006, 39% thought Bush had gone too far. That's the same Bush that then-Sen. Obama excoriated for the ""warrantless wiretaps"" in 2006. But the worst news for the president is that he seems, at least right now, to be losing the benefit-of-the-doubt factor he has enjoyed because people think he's an honest guy who tries to do the right thing. The latest CNN/ORC polling shows that while 49% of Americans consider the president to be ""honest and trustworthy,"" that's down 9 points -- in one month. And his approval rating has fallen 8 points to just 45%. The unkindest drop, fueling the entire downward trend, comes from Obama's stalwarts, younger voters. A huge 17-point decline among the under-30 set has got to be some sort of wake-up call. Now, I know this president doesn't like some parts of his job. He doesn't much like schmoozing members of Congress, despite his recent share-a-meal plan with assorted Capitol Hill types. He doesn't like the LBJ-style strong-arming, either. He doesn't much like the messy lawmaking process in which personal relationships can often mean the difference between getting what you want and getting nothing at all. And he doesn't ever like to be pushed. Ever. No-drama Obama, remember? But he does like speeches. He likes writing them, redrafting them, pondering them. He likes giving them, too -- because he's good at it. So speak. The American people need some quality time here. An interview or two, sure. Declassify some information about thwarted terror attacks that can be shared without compromising intelligence. Let Americans in on the real secret they're puzzling: how this president has been affected by what he has seen from the Oval Office. Some may buy it; some may not. But letting us in on this secret is just part of the job. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","President Obama's numbers have taken a hit, according to a new poll .

"Ankara, Turkey (CNN) -- A peaceful gathering to honor a slain protester turned into chaos Sunday in Ankara as Turkish riot police used water cannons and tear gas to try to disperse rock-throwing demonstrators. In Istanbul, the sound of residents banging pots and pans together echoed down the streets as another face-off between police and anti-government protesters played out. The sound came from the buildings around Taksim Square and the adjacent Gezi Park, which authorities had cleared by force on Saturday. Thousands of demonstrators calling for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's resignation attempted to return to the square and park Sunday, only to be pushed back by police. The neighborhood south of the park was filled with the smell of burning as police swept through the area, firing tear gas at knots of protesters in the streets. At least 29 people were injured in Saturday night's clashes, Istanbul Gov. Huseyin Avni Mutlu said. Police had warned demonstrators who have occupied Istanbul's last remaining green space for more than two weeks to depart voluntarily or face being ejected. While the anti-government protests are unlikely to threaten the rule of Erdogan, who has been one of Turkey's most popular leaders and is credited with the country's decade of economic growth, they are raising questions about what critics say is a growing authoritarian rule. For his part, Erdogan accuses outsiders of taking advantage of the protests at Gezi Park. Earlier Sunday, thousands of Erdogan's supporters gathered at a rally a few miles from Taksim Square. They waved flags and sang songs at a rally that was widely viewed as a re-election rally for the prime minister. Erdogan, who has been defiant to protest demands, compared his supporters with the protesters: ""Hundreds of thousands in here are not like the vandals with petrol-bombs in their hands."" In Ankara, authorities had warned against a gathering to honor Ethem Sarisuluk, who was shot during protests two weeks ago. The gathering took place under a heavy police presence around Kiziyali Square, a different part of the city from where Sarisuluk's funeral procession was held. At one point, Sarisuluk's brother knelt in the middle of the road in an attempt to stop oncoming traffic, while police fired tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators. The protesters, in turn, threw rocks at police and put up makeshift barricades to block off streets. The protests started at the end of May over the prime minister's plan to turn Istanbul's Gezi Park into a mall. They quickly turned into large anti-government demonstrations that included calls for political reforms. Thugs or protesters? Erdogan complained Saturday that demonstrators were not meeting him halfway. ""We have reached out with our hands,"" he said. ""However, some people returned their fists in response. Can you shake hands with those who reach out with a fist?"" He also ridiculed the protesters' assertions that they are environmentalists, calling them ""thugs"" and citing their honking of horns as evidence of their insincerity. ""This is called noise pollution,"" he said. He accused demonstrators of inciting sectarian violence by attacking a woman in a headscarf, kicking her, dragging her on the ground and snatching her head cover. He said some demonstrators entered a mosque wearing shoes, drank alcohol there and wrote insulting slogans on the walls -- acts forbidden by Muslims. Erdogan praised his government's performance over the past 10 years, citing a rising standard of living, a quintupling of the central bank's reserves and plans to build an airport. Root of protests . The unrest began in Istanbul nearly three weeks ago, when a small group of people turned out to protest government plans to bulldoze Gezi Park and replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of 19th-century Ottoman barracks. Protesters said the plans represented a creeping infringement on their rights in a secular society. Turkey was founded after secularists in the early 20th century defeated Islamic Ottoman forces, and many modern-day secularists frown on Ottoman symbols. The protests broadened into an outpouring in the square and throughout the country as security forces cracked down on demonstrators. The unrest also signaled political danger for Erdogan, a populist and democratically elected politician serving his third term in office.

"(CNN) -- Celebrities developed a new reason to fear for their safety in 2008, thanks to five teenagers from the Valley. Over the course of a year, this group managed to steal a reported $3 million worth of goods from the homes of various A-list celebrities. They came to be known as ""The Bling Ring,"" and they let nothing stand in the way of their quest for fashion and fame. They wanted to be part of the lives of the celebrities they worshiped and the notoriety they assumed would accompany it. It has been more than three years since the Ring members were arrested and their activities were documented in a 2010 article in Vanity Fair by Nancy Jo Sales.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea proposed high-level talks with the United States to ""ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula,"" its state news agency reported early Sunday. The topics that ""can be sincerely discussed"" include easing military tensions, changing a truce treaty to a peace treaty and nuclear matters, according to a statement from the North's National Defense Commission, as reported by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. It left some details -- like where and when the talks might be held -- up to Washington, and insisted U.S. officials should not lay out any preconditions for talks. ""(The United States should) not lose the opportunity that is laid out and should actively agree with our resolute step and good intention,"" the commission said. For years, North Korea has been at odds with many in the international community, including the United States, over its missile and nuclear programs. Whether Pyongyang's offer is accepted -- and if so, on what terms -- and whether the talks happen remains to be seen. Last Tuesday, North Korea called off what were supposed to be the first high-level talks between North and South Korean officials in years. That meeting was supposed to start the next day. High-level talks between Koreas called off . South Korea's unification ministry said the North dropped out after a dispute about who should be involved in the talks, after both sides contended that the other wasn't sending a sufficiently high-level official to the delegation . The talks were to focus on, among other things, reviving joint economic activities. Amid a spike in tensions, the North in April halted activity at the Kaesong Industrial Zone, a shared industrial complex and major symbol of cooperation between the two countries. North Korea removes missiles from launch site, U.S. official says . It was not immediately clear what might be on the agenda if U.S. and North Korean officials meet. Washington has been at the forefront of those demanding an end to its nuclear program, pushing for sanctions and rallying other nations to their side. Tensions in and around the Korean Peninsula surged in December -- one year after Kim Jong-un assumed power after his father's death -- when North Korea launched a long-range rocket then conducted an underground nuclear test two months later. Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, the top U.S. commander in the Pacific, said in April that North Korea's missile and weapons programs posed ""a clear and direct threat to U.S. national security and regional peace and stability."" Why North Korean intelligence is so hard to read . That same month, North Korea set out demanding conditions for talks. They included calling for the withdrawal of U.N. sanctions against it and a permanent end to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. The United States and South Korea ""should immediately stop all their provocative acts against the DPRK and apologize for all of them,"" the North's National Defense Commission said in a statement carried by state-run media, using the shortened version of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. But those talks never came to be, with South Korean foreign ministry spokesman Cho Tai-young describing the North's demands as ""preposterous."" The United States has said that, in order for it to engage in talks, North Korea would have to show a serious commitment to moving away from its nuclear program. If it happens, this will be the second senior-level talks between the U.S. and North since Kim Jong Un took power. The first talks were in February 2012, when North Korea's first vice minister, Kim Kye Gwan, held talks in Beijing with Glyn Davies, the U.S. envoy for North Korea policy. At the time,, North Korea agreed to stop nuclear activity at its main facility in Yongbyon and impose a moratorium on nuclear tests and long-range missile launch in exchange for 240,000 tons of food assistance. However, the agreement fell apart after a U.N. sanction in response to North Korea's failed long-range rocket launch in April 2012.","NEW: U.S. should not lay out conditions, ""not lose the opportunity,"" state news says .
