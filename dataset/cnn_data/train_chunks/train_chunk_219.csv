"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two people were killed and 13 wounded Monday in a bombing that targeted polio workers in northwest Pakistan, police said. The blast took place on the outskirts of the violence-plagued city of Peshawar. Najeeb-Ur-Rehman, the senior superintendent of police, said the bomb was remotely detonated as polio vaccines and accompanying materials were being handed out to health workers. Police had earlier said that six people were killed in the attack. Pakistan is one of three countries in the world where polio has yet to be eradicated. Many Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program in 2011 to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. It wasn't immediately clear if the Taliban played a role in Sunday's attacks. Polio, a highly infectious viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours, has been eradicated around the world except for three countries where it is endemic: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After the number of cases spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 173 in 2011 to 58 in 2012, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

"(CNN) -- Professed ""Jersey girl"" Christeena Hockin-Minopetros began collecting sea glass from the New Jersey shore when she was 5. She recalls that when she was younger, before the glass became scarce, you could walk home with a bucketful after a day at the beach. Now, 10 months after Hurricane Sandy hammered the Atlantic coastline, the Florida resident says she's shocked by how many of the frosty relics she found while walking along Sea Bright Beach back home this summer. ""It's everywhere,"" Hockin-Minopetros said, explaining how she found two large bags of sea glass in a variety of hues: brown, white, blue, milky green and a ""gorgeous"" red piece she can't take her eyes off. We can thank Sandy for the finds, said coastal geologist Cheryl Hapke. ""This is an epic summer for a collection of beach glass,"" she said. Sea glass, or beach glass, begins essentially as garbage -- broken glass dumped into fresh or salt water. Over time, waves, water and sand smooth its sharp edges. It's the smaller pieces of sea glass that usually get brought onto shore for people to pick up, Hapke said. It's well-known that hurricanes erode seashores and hamper tourism, but, according to Hapke, a storm like Sandy -- which boasted record-high waves in late October -- can filter larger, coarse materials from the seabed and wash them onto the shoreline. That's good news for beach-side businesses that sell their finds. As Sandy swallowed beaches and deterred patrons, businesses in southern New Jersey's Cape May Point suffered, said resident Jeanette Bartolomeo. Her son-in-law's Sunset Beach Gift Shops, where Bartolomeo works as the jewelry manager, were among the few fortunate. Never mind the sea glass; Bartolomeo's eye is drawn to the ""Cape May Diamonds"" -- clear quartz pebbles that, when polished, resemble real diamonds -- and Sunset Beach Gift Shops are known for their collection. The pure quartz pebbles, which break off from pockets of quartz crystal in the upper reaches of the Delaware River, have always been in abundance, but bigger pieces churn up after a storm. That's why Hurricane Sandy and the February nor'easter were ""a blessing,"" Bartolomeo said. ""Thank God they keep coming in,"" she said. Though Sandy didn't damage Cape May as much as other parts of New Jersey, many residents and visitors assumed beaches and shops there were closed, so Cape May tourism suffered and business was slower than usual, Bartolomeo said. ""We had people calling, 'Are you open now?' "" she said. ""But we were never closed."" Gov. Chris Christie's administration announced last week that every public boardwalk and beach along the New Jersey shore is now open, after 10 months of renovations and ""beach replenishing."" Bartolomeo said she's already seen an increase in tourists this summer at Sunset Beach, where visitors can be found scouring the beach for the quarter-size ""diamonds"" washing up on the shore. Despite the good news for many businesses, Hockin-Minopetros is concerned that beach replenishing -- by which sand from other areas is used to revitalize an eroded beach -- might affect the abundance of sea glass, much like she worries construction and spiking insurance rates along the coast could affect the shoreline's pristine quaintness. ""I'm afraid New Jersey's shoreline will be one big McMansion, and that saddens me deeply,"" she said. In addition to the sea glass she collects to craft into jewelry, which she sells, Hockin-Minopetros also keeps a personal collection of about 500 ""really fantastic"" pieces, most of which she collected while living in Greece. But her best piece is one she picked up in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, she said. The heavy, 8-inch-long, clear glass is actually a deck prism, which sailors used in the upper deck of a ship to illuminate the ship's passageways below deck. It's one she won't be selling, she said. ""I only keep the real unusual,"" she said.","Sea glass, scarce before Hurricane Sandy, makes resurgence in New Jersey .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released approximately 1,800 pages of documents that shed more light on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The documents indicate that the National Security Agency violated its own internal guidelines relating to phone numbers it can ""query"" from among records the agency collects. Moreover, the documents indicate that the NSA presented false information to the surveillance court about the violation. ""The people responsible for authoring the report did not fully understand how the operation was working,"" a senior intelligence official said. ""That misrepresentation resulted in a factually inaccurate report."" Opinion: What the government is hiding from you . The documents satisfy a judge's order pertaining to public records requests from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocacy group, about FISA Court interpretations of the section of the Patriot Act dealing with collecting metadata, the so-called business records provision. The metadata program started in 2006 and allowed the NSA to seek to obtain more information about a number if there was ""reasonable articulable suspicion"" that the number was linked to terrorism. The NSA also kept a separate ""alert list"" that was used to compare the new numbers that were coming in daily and consider whether new numbers should be added to the category of those with ""reasonable articulable suspicion."" The alert list started with about 4,000 numbers and ended up with 17,835, most of which did not have the required suspicion, officials say. The court ruled that the NSA was allowed to have the alert list, but the agency could not run it against the larger database because it did not have the reasonable suspicion. Every day, phone companies sent metadata, which went into an archive. But each day, the NSA ran the alert list against the new information to see if it could establish reasonable suspicion. This went on from May 2006 until January 2009. ""To further complicate matters,"" an official said, ""reporting to the court, we described the alert list but did not describe (it) accurately."" NSA misrepresented scope of data collection to secret court . Senior intelligence officials attempted to assure reporters that the news was not so much the compliance violation, but the fact that the NSA uncovered the problem, reported it to the Justice Department and the FISA Court, ""took steps thereafter to do a thorough scrub of operations,"" and reported back to the FISA Court after the changes had been made. In one declassified order from March 2009, Judge Reggie Walton said the court would ""not permit the government to access the data collected until such time as the government is able to restore the court's confidence that the government can and will comply with previously approved procedures for accessing such data."" A senior intelligence official noted ""fairly strong language"" by the court, but stressed that it did not find any ""intentional attempt"" to violate the law or abuse the program. Because there was such confusion about the program, the NSA instituted new steps to guard against future violations, including adding a compliance director, the officials said. Reports: NSA has cracked much online encryption . One official said this proved that there was ""effective oversight by the executive branch and the court. NSA is not perfect and screws up from time to time."" But there never has been any indication that these programs have been abused by spying for improper purposes or exceeding guidelines with improper authority, he said. The officials said they did not know of any NSA employee who was punished or fired as a result of the problem. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement that the incidents were promptly reported to the court, which ordered NSA to seek its approval to query metadata on a case-by-case basis, except when lives were under imminent threat. ""The documents released today are a testament to the government's strong commitment to detecting, correcting, and reporting mistakes that occur in implementing technologically complex intelligence collection activities, and to continually improving its oversight and compliance processes,"" he said. Court renews secret U.S. surveillance program . The American Civil Liberties Union said the documents confirm that the agency ""cannot be trusted"" with such sweeping powers and that the ""secret and one-sided"" judicial review is not an adequate check. ""The abuses revealed in these documents are alarming but also predictable. These violations are the inevitable result of allowing the NSA to assemble a vast database of sensitive information about every American,"" Alex Abdo, staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project, said in a statement. The civil liberties group has challenged the constitutionality of the NSA phone records collection program in court. Internet companies fight to release more information on NSA requests .","Newly released documents show the National Security Agency violated phone-records rules .
Papers: NSA also submitted incorrect information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
The papers were released to comply with ACLU, Electronic Frontier Foundation requests .
The court required the NSA to seek approval to query data until processes were improved ."
"(CNN) -- Last summer, Jessica Rodriguez didn't want to go outside, or even open the door. She didn't want anyone to see she had lost her hair during breast cancer treatment. Rodriguez, 39, said she found strength from the support of her husband and children, and through an organization called Nueva Vida, a support network for Latinas with cancer based in Washington. At support meetings, she met other women who had lost their hair in cancer treatment and realized she was not alone. ""They were going through the same,"" said Rodriguez, who moved to the United States from Peru 12 years ago and now lives in Germantown, Maryland. ""I say: They're OK. It's only the hair. It's going to go grow back."" Some Latina breast cancer survivors such as Rodriguez have found comfort and assistance from organizations geared toward Hispanics. Nueva Vida and other groups are trying to address needs such as breaking language barriers, paying for treatment and finding support from others going through similar challenges. Rodriguez said she didn't know how she could have paid for treatment without Nueva Vida. It introduced her to a Maryland state program that covered her surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. ""I may be not talking to you,"" she said. ""I don't know. I don't think I could have made it without all the help."" What the statistics say . Cancer remains a major health problem among Hispanics, but statistics show they are at a surprising advantage compared with some other ethnic groups. Researchers are trying to figure out why. In the United States, the death rate from all cancers among Hispanics is about 129 per 100,000 people per year, compared with 191 per 100,000 for whites and 239 per 100,000 for African-Americans/blacks, according to the National Cancer Institute. Breast cancer incidence and mortality specifically are also lower among Hispanics than whites or blacks, according to the American Cancer Society. The figures are puzzling, given that Hispanics have a lower socioeconomic status on average than whites. Data from the Pew Research Center suggests the typical Hispanic household had $6,325 in wealth in 2009, while the typical white household had $113,149. Even more curiously, a 2013 study in the International Journal for Equity in Health found that, among Hispanics in Texas, mortality rates for several cancers, including breast cancer, tend to be lower among those with more socioeconomic deprivation. A low mortality rate does not correspond with low socioeconomic status in whites and African-Americans, the study found. More research needs to be done to confirm these findings. The phenomenon associating Hispanics with better health outcomes despite lower average income and education rates is called the ""Hispanic paradox."" A possible explanation for this trend is that smoking is much less common among Hispanics than non-Hispanic whites or African-Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another theory is that people who immigrate to the United States tend to be healthier than those who stayed in their home countries. It's also possible that some who get sick return to their home countries. Mentally ill Latinos struggle to seek help . Despite slightly better statistical odds of not getting cancer than whites or blacks, Hispanics are not immune to these conditions, and breast cancer kills more Hispanic women than any other cancer. More often in Hispanics than whites, breast cancer is detected at an advanced stage, according to the American Cancer Society. A 2013 study in the journal JAMA Surgery focusing on young women with breast cancer, ages 15 to 39, found that the time between diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer differed significantly depending on the ethnicity of the participants. Researchers found that about 15% of Hispanic and African-American women waited more than six weeks for treatment, compared with 8% of non-Hispanic white women. Longer waiting periods are linked to shorter survival time, the study found. Dr. Mariana Chavez MacGregor, breast oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said she believes that access to health care is partly responsible for the later detection of breast cancer in Hispanic women. ""If people have no health insurance, doing a test for something you don't even have, it's really at the bottom of the list,"" she said. There are also, she said, ""probably cultural reasons in which we may have more difficulty dealing with this and seeking medical attention."" What survivors say . Research is ongoing to narrow down the best ways to improve the quality of life among Hispanic breast cancer survivors and their caregivers. Nueva Vida is participating in a research project led by Kristi Graves at Georgetown University to figure out the best approaches. The issues that tend to arise among Hispanic women who have breast cancer aren't unique to Hispanics, and it is impossible to generalize across individuals; there are also many cultures that fall under terms such as ""Hispanic"" and ""Latina."" Nonetheless, Graves and researchers have picked up on some themes that often arise. ""Breast cancer isn't always talked about in Latino families,"" Graves said. ""In some of these families, when you mention cancer it's considered synonymous with death."" Some survivors Graves has spoken with didn't tell their families about the cancer diagnosis until they had to start chemotherapy, because they didn't want to worry them. ""For some of the women, when they did start talking about cancer, they were really pleasantly surprised at the amount of support and information that they received,"" Graves said. For women whose first language is Spanish, translation may be an issue. They may have a hard time finding a physician with whom they feel comfortable, and who can adequately explain treatment options and procedures. When family members step in to translate to doctors, some women hold back important details. For instance, one woman Graves met didn't tell her doctor about the problems with sexual functioning she was having during treatment, because her daughter was translating for her. Let's talk about sex ... and cancer . In her study, Graves will be testing an intervention in which survivors and caregivers share their concerns separately, in different groups, led by a facilitator, and then everyone comes together to talk about the topic. When tried on a smaller scale, ""(facilitators) delivered information separately to the survivors and caregivers; it seemed that each group could open up further and talk about their own specific needs,"" Graves said. Getting help . Another community organization supporting Hispanic breast cancer patients is called Comadre a Comadre in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A comadre is a ""non-biological close female kinship"" in ""the Hispanic/Latino extended family unit,"" the website explains. This group was founded by six survivors and director Elba Saavedra, who is also an assistant professor for research at the University of New Mexico College of Education. The organization works with women in a nonclinical setting, giving them resources and support during their breast cancer treatment. A grant from the Susan G. Komen for the Cure helped jump-start Comadre a Comadre in 2003. The organization offers support groups and classes in Spanish and English, one-on-one support and financial assistance. Comadre a Comadre is trying to get out positive messages about screening and break down some of the cultural barriers. For instance, many women put the needs of the rest of their family before their own. ""We need to be there for children and grandchildren; it's important we get in there and get those mammograms,"" Saavedra said. Dalila Romero, a co-founder of Comadre a Comadre, had breast cancer in her mid-40s. At the time, she had recently lost her mother to pancreatic cancer. The support group she tried didn't resonate with her; she couldn't connect with the women there, who had different backgrounds and life stories from her own. ""Not knowing the resources in the community, I had to basically support myself because I didn't know what the outcome was going to be,"" Romero said. Now she goes with women with recent diagnoses to their initial appointments for chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to help them navigate the system. Helping patients navigate health care system . Some women are private about their struggle with cancer, so much so they don't want to sit around other women who have it. Romero knows of one woman who moved because she didn't want anyone in her town to know she had cancer. When she learned about Nueva Vida, Rodriguez immediately liked the idea of finding support in other women who also had cancer, but she held back at first in telling her parents in Peru until doctors were sure of what it was. ""I didn't want my mom to get sad because she's over there and I'm here,"" she said. ""I didn't want to worry them. I took time to tell them."" Clear of cancer, Rodriguez is currently a Zumba instructor through Nueva Vida, and loves teaching. The women in this organization have a lot of need, she said. They are, she said, her ""sister survivors.""","Hispanics have a lower cancer incidence and mortality than whites and blacks .

"(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama met with former South African President Nelson Mandela on Tuesday as part of a weeklong visit to the continent, according to a spokeswoman for the first lady. Accompanying her on her visit with Mandela were a nephew, Avery Robinson, 19, and a niece, Leslie Robinson, 15, children of Obama's brother, Craig Robinson, according to Semonti Stephens, deputy communications director for the first lady. Obama also was expected to visit other luminaries in the country Tuesday after arriving in Pretoria Monday night. The first lady's trip highlights the value of South Africa as a viable partner with the United States in issues other than politics, said John Campbell, who holds the Ralph Bunche chair in African Policy Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""What is significant about the trip is that it underscores the fact that South Africa, since the establishment of nonracial (politics) has had a string of credible elections, is a country characterized by the rule of law, and is a democracy,"" Campbell said. ""Twenty-five years ago I think relatively few of us would have predicted such a happy outcome."" Obama is scheduled to visit several historical sites, including Robben Island, where Mandela was held for much of his 27-year imprisonment in his fight against apartheid. Obama, traveling on what officials have said is her second solo official visit to the continent, has brought her daughters, Sasha and Malia, and her mother in addition to her niece and a nephew. ""One of the things bringing them along demonstrates is the closeness of the Obama family,"" Campbell said. ""And this is something that the people of Africa respond very well to. Certainly before her, Laura Bush made a number of trips to Africa as well and was very well received."" The visit will further raise the profile on the continent of the first lady and the president, whom many Africans regard as a favorite son. ""The Obamas as a couple are extremely popular in Africa and obviously 100% well-known there,"" Steve Howard, director of African studies at Ohio University, said Tuesday. ""Her husband can't spend that much time there so they are dividing the labor, and she is representing them in South Africa, which is a major media market as well."" Howard said Michelle Obama's visit especially will resonate with the nation's youth. ""It has an enormous young population, probably more than 60% of the population is under 18,"" Howard said, ""and they have a lot of health-related issues, particularly AIDS, and so everything she does there will help bring attention to global health issues."" She is also expected to visit Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu as well as Soweto, just outside Johannesburg. In addition to visits with top leaders, Obama will be a distinguished guest at several public events, meet embassy officials and take part in community service projects in both South Africa and Botswana. ""The trip is a continuation of Mrs. Obama's work to engage young people, especially girls and young women, at home and abroad,"" the White House said. Her visit to neighboring Botswana on Friday will include attending a tribute to girls overcoming obstacles as well as a luncheon with women leaders. She will also meet with President Ian Khama before retreating to a local game reserve for the weekend. After a safari, she is scheduled to depart from the Botswana capital of Gaborone on Sunday. Journalist Craig Johnson contributed to this report.","NEW: The South African trip underscores the nation as viable partner, expert says .

"(CNN) -- Dear Miss America, . Thank you for reminding us what classic American beauty looks like today. For the rest of America -- in case any of you have been sleeping for, say, the past two decades, or clinging to out-of-touch fashion magazines -- here's an alert: Beauty is Serena Williams and Michelle Obama. Beauty is Angelina Jolie and Marissa Mayer. And yes, beauty is Nina Davuluri, Miss America 2014. Women's beauty cannot be debated or dictated by others. So in tribute to women across the globe, I celebrate your beautiful brown skin, your breathtaking Bollywood dance skills, and the hard work that I'm sure you put in, not only to earn top grades and graduate from the University of Michigan with a degree in brain behavior and cognitive science, but to become the first Indian-American woman to take home the tiara. I love it. The beauty pageant circuit is a tough act, as I learned early from my fleeting experiences as a teen who participated in several pageants. Don't laugh, that college scholarship money is no joke. Back then, there were no other brown girls on the stage. No matter. My family and friends cheered me on and told me how beautiful I was -- and I had the audacity to believe them. Sadly, it was the talent portion that always sunk me. Painting and poetry-writing just didn't cut it as a stage act. Lucky for me, I found journalism, but those pageants helped give me the confidence to believe that I could share the stage with anyone. Miss America, I hope you use your crown and platform well and that you have the courage to amplify the voices of those women and girls back in your ancestral home, India, who are valiantly fighting for full equality and the right to live without fear of the brutal sexual violence that plagues that nation. You are not the first woman of color to take the crown. It was 30 years ago that Vanessa Williams became the first black Miss America. Seven other black women and one Asian woman have won since then. And most went on to successful careers. But whenever this happens, those pesky bigots climb out of their caves to rant and rave and spew their ignorance about why it's not fair. Ignore them. Former Miss California: How do we teach kids diversity is beautiful? Clearly, those divergent voices -- and I admit there are many -- failed even the most basic fourth-grade geography lesson and likely couldn't even find India on a map, which is why they mistakenly think you are Arab. Perhaps they have you confused with Rima Fakih, a Lebanese immigrant from Dearborn, Michigan, who in 2010 was the first Arab-American to win the Miss USA pageant. Must be hard keeping up with a changing world when you've spent so much time trying to ignore and reject all those people who look different from you. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there are 3.2 million people of Asian Indian descent living in the United States. Their median income for 2010 was $90,711. In fact, Indians surpassed Filipinos as the nation's second-largest Asian population, after Chinese, the data show. Still, some people will never accept that it is families like yours that are helping to make America a stronger nation. Don't let them distract you on your journey. Sounds like you're on the right track: . ""I'm so happy this organization has embraced diversity,"" you said, according to The Associated Press. ""I'm thankful there are children watching at home who can finally relate to a new Miss America."" Asked about the negativity, you said, ""I have to rise above that. I always viewed myself as first and foremost American."" Use those haters to inspire you reach your dream to become a cardiologist, Ms. Davuluri. Reject voices that would try to define and limit you. Reject the magazine covers and fashion gurus, who may understand how to design and sell a pretty dress but have no clue about what defines a woman's beauty, as evidenced by the consistent and blatant lack of diversity on the runways during Fashion Weeks both here and abroad. Reject the critics -- men and women -- who bash women like television personality Julie Chen for getting plastic surgery after being told by her bosses nearly 20 years ago that her Asian eyes would hurt her career. Chen made her choice back then, and brava for her for starting a public debate now about Asian beauty standards. Today, Chen looks wonderful -- hard to tell from a 20-year-old photo if she had grown to be a natural beauty with her original face. But I, for one, want to live in a world where grown women have the right to decide what is best our careers and our bodies. Was it an awful message to give women in the workplace? Yes. But it's no different from the countless occasions throughout my career that I've witnessed women being told that they are too fat, too black or too Latina to succeed. In my first television job, the news director told me that I should study Diane Sawyer's look and voice in order to be better at my job -- like I was ever going to look like Diane. Thank goodness Oprah came along. Media is a tough career where regardless of your talent, looks really are still everything -- especially for us women. And to be fair, I've known more than a few men who've gone under the knife or tried extreme diets just to keep their faces in front of the camera. But to succeed, we must deal with it; work to improve the environment for the women behind us, and move on with our lives. There's room on the stage for all types of beauty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones: Indian-American Miss America a reminder of universality of American beauty .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Getting heard and understood in Westlands, Nairobi, on a typical Saturday afternoon is a challenge. You would have to compete with noise from the constant traffic, the shouts of the road side vendors, music from matatus -- Kenya's colorful (and loud) public transport minibuses. On the afternoon of Saturday 21 September 2013 you would have had to compete with the additional noise of gunshots and grenades as a group of ruthless and well-drilled militants launched a brutal attack on the Westgate Shopping Center at the heart of Westlands. At least 61 civilians and six Kenyan security officers died in the attack and rescue efforts, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Tuesday. Information on the attack on Westgate was first broken on social media as those in the mall and its environs flooded their Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts with text and images. The amount of information being generated quickly turned into a flood as more and more people started posting or sharing information that was previously posted. Just like on the streets of Westlands on a busy Saturday afternoon, getting heard on the streets of Kenya's social media was a big challenge. What does attack mean for Kenyan security? This is not surprising. Kenyans increasingly go online to share and look for information. Information on the large fire at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi on August 7 first broke on social media. Social media was one of the key sources of information for Uchaguzi, the citizen centered election monitoring website that was deployed for the Kenyan general election in March. Previously Kenyans have used Twitter to organize carpooling during a strike by public transport operators by sharing information using the hashtag #carpoolKE and even to find out which petrol stations had stocks of fuel during fuel shortages using the hashtag #findfuel. Ordinary Kenyan citizens have learned how to use social media and other digital tools to amplify their voices in order to have impact. Research by Portland and Tweetminster in 2011 found Kenya as Africa's second most active country on Twitter after South Africa. What is new is the increasing presence of official Kenyan government accounts on social media. President Kenyatta's election campaign invested heavily in its social media and digital communication, and this has continued in government. Kenya's top security decision making body, the National Security Council, includes the President, Deputy President, Attorney General, and the cabinet secretaries for Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Interior and Co-ordination of National Government, many of whom tweet regularly. At security agency level, the Ministry of the Interior and Coordination of National Government, the Kenya Defense Forces, the Kenya Police Service, Kenya's National Disaster Operations Center, Kenya's National Steering Committee on Peacebuilding and Conflict Management all have active and regularly updated accounts on Twitter. During the Westgate crisis these accounts have been updated with official government information on operations and casualties. Questions linger after Nairobi mall attack . At Ushahidi we constantly remind people that technology is a tool not a solution. Just as a hammer can been used for positive or negative actions social media is also a tool that can be widely exploited across the board. Al-Shabaab is very effective in the use of social media and other digital tools in getting its messaging across. Since Saturday when the attacks began Twitter has already shut down at least one account connected to Al-Shabaab, which may have been in direct contact with the militants inside Westgate. Having a presence on social media itself presents challenges for officials especially when it comes to the authenticity of the social media accounts. The Kenya Police Service for example has a long-running parody unofficial Twitter account. During the Westgate crisis several of the official Kenyan government Twitter accounts were verified, a process which establishes their authenticity and allows them to display a badge which identifies them publicly as official channels of communication. Now that the government's Twitter accounts have been identified as authentic the next challenge is to keep them relevant with useful information. Tweets from government urging Kenyans to hug each other during the height of the crisis were ill timed as the country waited to hear the fate of the hostages still held inside the shopping mall. Building credibility online, just like building credibility offline, takes time. On this the Kenyan government should learn from the digital media team at Kenya Red Cross. The Kenya Red Cross ran the most credible, useful and respected Twitter account during the entire Westgate crisis. The Kenya Red Cross is a pioneer in how social media can be used to crowdsource information online that first responders can use. Through its #iVolunteer hashtag Kenya Red Cross encourages all Kenyans to report incidents in which first responders are required and the Kenya Red Cross follow up these reports dispatching ambulances as required. What threat do foreign jihadists pose? Through its social media accounts the Kenya Red Cross was able to keep large groups of people updated on the Westgate crisis as it unfolded, was able to source information on where help was required inside and outside Westgate. In addition the Kenya Red Cross digital media team helped coordinate and publicize what was described as the largest blood drive in Kenya's history. About 6,380 units of blood were donated across the country in around 48 hours following the attack. In another record-breaking social media led campaign the Kenya Red Cross partnered with Safaricom, Kenya's largest mobile phone network, to launch a fundraising drive using Safaricom's M-pesa mobile money platform. As of 2pm EAT on 25th September, 76 hours after its launch, Safaricom reported that the #WeAreOne campaign had raised $783,485 in donations made largely by individual Kenyans. This is the latest in a series of successful partnerships between Kenya Red Cross and Safaricom who also partnered in 2011 to lead the Kenyans For Kenya campaign which raised around $11.5 million in four weeks for Kenyans facing severe famine. All these initiatives contribute to the continuing adoption and growth in popularity of social media across the region. Being able to quickly and accurately filter large volumes of data to identify which pieces of information are useful in your particular incident is a global challenge that Ushahidi is working to address by building a coalition and tools for a clearinghouse for crisis data. This we believe will lead to more effective online information management such as using citizens to triangulate each other's information, which in turn gives first responders data on which they can act on immediately. Once we have this, ordinary citizens using social media would become a much more effective tool in time of crisis, altering today's communication flows. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daudi Khamadi Were.","Information on Westgate attack was broken on social media, says Daudi Khamadi Were .

"(CNN) -- Bird populations native to several areas of the globe are in decline, with some teetering on the brink of extinction, according to a multi-agency report, the first of its kind, released Thursday. The Western meadowlark is an endangered bird species, according to a new report. But some other species are thriving, according to the ""State of the Birds"" report, which credited conservation programs and waterfowl management initiatives that it said can serve as a model in other areas. ""Every U.S. habitat harbors birds in need of conservation,"" said the report, issued by the Cornell University Lab of Ornithology in conjunction with federal agencies and other organizations. ""Hawaiian birds and ocean birds appear most at risk, with populations in danger of collapse if immediate conservation measures are not implemented."" Of the more than 800 species of birds in the United States, 67 are federally listed as endangered or threatened, the report said. Another 184 are ""species of conservation concern"" because they have small distribution, are facing high threats or have a declining population. Hawaiian birds, particularly, are in crisis, the report said. More than one-third of all U.S. bird species are in Hawaii. However, 71 species have gone extinct since the islands were colonized about 300 A.D., and 10 more species have not been seen in the past 40 years, contributing to fears they, too, have died out. Grassland and arid-land birds are showing the most rapid declines over the last four decades, while forest birds are also declining, the report said. ""Just as they were when Rachel Carson published 'Silent Spring' nearly 50 years ago, birds today are a bellwether of the health of land, water and ecosystems,"" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Thursday in a statement on the report. ""From shorebirds in New England to warblers in Michigan to songbirds in Hawaii, we are seeing disturbing downward population trends that should set off environmental alarm bells. We must work together now to ensure we never hear the deafening silence in our forests, fields and backyards that Rachel Carson warned us about."" The declines can be traced to a variety of factors, depending on a bird's particular habitat. But the causes most frequently cited in the report are agriculture, climate change, development and energy, and invasive species. For instance, some of the nation's fastest-growing cities -- Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona; and San Diego, California -- are located in arid lands, the report said. ""Unplanned and sprawling urban development is by far the greatest threat to arid lands."" In addition, invasive non-native plants have been introduced into the area, which can fuel wildfires and destroy native plants. Bird species of concern in arid lands include the elf owl, Bendire's and LeConte's thrashers and the gilded flicker, the report said. Some, such as the California condor, are already listed as endangered or threatened. In the grasslands, intensified agricultural practices have hurt bird populations, according to the report. ""Pastures cannot support many birds if overgrazed, burned too frequently or burned at the beginning of the nesting season or the end of the grass-growing season."" Also, public lands and parks are mowed too frequently and the grass kept too short to provide a habitat for birds, the reports said. Grassland birds showing marked population declines include the mountain plover, Eastern and Western meadowlarks, short-eared owls and Northern bobwhites. In the forest, some species are doing well, but roughly one-third of forest-breeding bird species are showing decline. The same is true for arctic and alpine birds, where 38 percent of the 85 species are of conservation concern, the report said. Game birds are also struggling. Of 19 resident game bird species, 47 percent are species of conservation concern, and two species are federally endangered, according to the report. The greatest hope for long-term management of game birds, however, lies in Farm Bill programs that retire millions of acres of land used for heavy agriculture, the report said. Along the coast and in the ocean, bird populations have been hurt by overfishing, pollution and climate change, among other factors, the report said. Each section of the report contains at least one ""reason for hope."" The California condor, for instance, has been reintroduced to some areas, and the bird's numbers are growing. Urban birds, such as the American robin, hummingbirds, sparrows and woodpeckers, show a ""steady, strong increase"" in the last 40 years. ""A surprising number of native birds have adapted to life around humans,"" the report said. ""... The wide variety of native birds that thrive in urban areas underscores the importance of these artificial habitats to the survival of many bird populations."" Wetland bird populations remain below historic levels, but ""management and conservation measures have contributed to increases of many wetland birds, including hunted waterfowl."" Research shows that wetland bird species began to increase in the late 1970s, ""coinciding with major policy shifts from draining to protecting wetlands,"" the report said. ""Dramatic increases in many wetland generalist species, as well as arctic-nesting geese and cavity-nesting ducks, contribute to this overall trend."" ""These results emphasize that investment in wetlands contribution has paid huge dividends,"" said Kenneth Rosenberg, director of Conservation Science at the Cornell Lab or Ornithology. ""Now we need to invest similarly in other neglected habitats where birds are undergoing the steepest declines."" Taking action now -- particularly in the area of habitat loss -- can help reverse the declining trend seen in some species, according to the report. ""The number and scope of severe threats to birds is daunting, but implementing solutions immediately and widely will pay off in benefits to society, the economy and the health of our environment."" It calls for measures such as increased monitoring of bird populations, stricter protection laws, more incentives, sustainable fishing practices and widespread education. ""Citizen science plays a critical role in monitoring and understanding the threats to these birds and their habitats, and only citizen involvement can help address them,"" said Greg Butcher, conservation director for the National Audubon Society. ""Conservation action can only make a real difference when concerned people support the kind of vital habitat restoration and protection measures this report explores.""","Report: Bird populations native to several areas of the globe are in decline .

"(CNN) -- Finding out who talks to who and who can influence other people is an age-old marketing tool. Now, companies are finding a goldmine of valuable information by mapping networks of influence -- both inside and outside their organizations. Take Danish consulting company Innovisor -- they took advantage of their employees' increased use of social media to land two major banks as clients. After locating all their employees' LinkedIn connections to two companies they were targeting as clients, they divided the contacts into three groups: Information providers, Influencers and Decision Makers. Working their way up the chain from information providers, they then asked their employees to gather as much information as they could about their target companies. ""Everyone, from the cashier at the bank had valuable information to add,"" says Jeppe Vilstrup Hansgaard, partner at Innovisor. ""By the time we approached the decision makers we understood the structure of the business and we brought a level of knowledge that created a far better dialogue than you would normally have,"" he added. Freedom key to workplace of the future . The process was inspired by Morten Hansen, professor at the University of Berkeley, and his book ""Collaboration: How Leaders Avoid the Traps, Create Unity, and Reap Big Results."" He calls the process ""Swarm the Target"" -- in this case the target being the prospective clients and the swarm being information seekers coming from all directions. In its essence, it's marketing. ""If you want to sell new sneakers you pinpoint the two or three most popular people to buy them,"" says Hansen, and adds that when you map a corporation's internal network, ""you pinpoint the most central people and contacts in a company."" When Innovisor is not putting their knowledge to creative use for their own benefit, this is exactly what they do. The company makes it their business to map the internal networks and relations of client companies -- helping them pinpoint who talks to who and who influences others. ""Relationships between people are invisible,"" says Hansgaard. ""By making them visible you can make them controllable. You can illuminate gaps in collaboration, you can build them and you can strengthen them."" This kind of knowledge can prove crucial to a company's efficiency, for example when implementing change. At Vestas, one of the world's largest wind turbine manufacturers, Innovisor pointed to one person as having a major influence on 58 people. ""He is someone you really need to have on board when you want to change things,"" says Hansgaard, and adds that one of the most amazing things is that a lot of companies are not aware who their ""influencers"" are. With one client in the Middle East, Innovisor found three major influencers. ""Two of them, the company leadership had no idea even existed,"" says Hansgaard. The mapping of a network can also highlight problems with collaboration, which according to Hansen can have a major impact on a company's bottom line. Case in point is Apple. ""The iPod 2001 was a collaboration across units in Apple and with partners outside,"" Hansen says. ""It was put together by already existing technology. In hindsight we know how important that was. The company that should have done it, Sony, was in a far better position to do it but they failed miserably to collaborate."" The bottom line is that businesses are people and relations matter. As networks grow broader, bigger and more global --- as they expand across distances, borders, cultures and functionalities -- so do their potentials and problems. Mapping networks, says Hansgaard, can provide a clearer picture for leaders to make decisions. ""It also provides a readiness to change by giving employees visible proof why it is necessary,"" he says.","Businesses are mapping networks of influence in their organizations .
Spotting and utilizing influencers is a marketing tool, says Berkley professor Morten Hansen .

"(CNN) -- John Oliver says America might be doomed. The ""Daily Show"" correspondent was recently in Montreal, where he was hosting a comedy gala called ""Decline of the American Empire?"" at the famous Just For Laughs festival. And while he emphasized the show title's punctuation, he also noted that, ""The question mark is getting smaller and smaller as the news progresses, particularly today."" Our video interview took place only a few days before the August 2 debt ceiling deadline so, naturally, we focused on the plight of America's finances. ""It doesn't really seem to make any sense, logically,"" he says. ""Other than pettiness is something that it seems America is now addicted to. And that's a hard habit to kick."" Oliver also spoke about the members of the tea party, giving them some credit for their role in the conversation, but also questioning what will become of them after the debt ceiling issue is resolved. ""They have brought to attention that America is $14.3 trillion in debt. That's a lot of dollars. That's more than $14. And it's more than $14 trillion. It's $14.3 trillion. That's a lot. So they've done that. They've pointed that out. And now they seem to be, for some reason, wanting things to get worse. So I don't know how they'll come out of it. I guess the same as they went into it -- angry and confused."" Of course, Oliver also had a few choice words for the media. ""The media has, as it's always done, done a terrible job reporting on this. They have seen the fire and they've decided to throw gasoline on it,"" he says. ""I'm sure they're proud of themselves as they always are. And that is a misplaced pride."" Oliver, who is British and works here on a green card, shouldn't be confused for a gleeful foreigner who relishes in the financial and political hardships of the United States. Perhaps it's good for his job as a comedian, but, personally, there's no sense of schadenfreude. ""I would much rather America was a more stable, wonderful place. You know, I love it. But it is odd seeing it do this to itself for no clear reason.""","""The Daily Show's"" John Oliver discusses America's debt crisis .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The repatriation to Seoul of six citizens who defected to North Korea in recent years has intrigued a South Korean public accustomed to the flow of refugees in the opposite direction, an observer says. South Korea's Unification Ministry announced the return of the six men, aged between 27 and 67, at the truce village of Panmunjom Friday, along with the body of the South Korean wife of one of the defectors. Arrest warrants were issued in relation to the men for breaching national security laws, said the ministry, and investigations would be carried out into the circumstances of their defections, and into the woman's death. Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency said it had ""leniently pardoned"" the men on humanitarian grounds, allowing them to reunite with their families because they ""candidly admitted and repented their crime"" of illegal entry. The men reportedly told officials that they had entered the North illegally through China between 2009 and 2012, either by jumping off Chinese cruise ships plying the rivers between the countries, or walking over the rivers when they were frozen, according to South Korea's semi-official Yonhap news agency. Citing officials, Yonhap reported that some of the men had suffered personal hardships, including business failures and family troubles, and expected that life would be better in the North. Some had participated in pro-Pyongyang campaigns online, and anticipated a warm welcome in North Korea in return for their efforts, it was reported. Instead, the men claimed to have been held and questioned in detention centers for up to 45 months before being repatriated, said the report. The widower of the dead woman told South Korean authorities he had strangled her as part of a failed suicide pact, according to Yonhap, but a statement from South Korea's Unification Ministry said that Pyongyang officials claimed the man had murdered his wife in a marital dispute. South Korea's National Intelligence Service and Unification Ministry told CNN they were unable to comment on the Yonhap report. Jasper Kim, founder of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group, said the story had been big news in South Korea, where defectors to the North were a rarity. He said the men appeared to have been motivated to defect largely out of ""socio-economic disillusionment"" and desperation. ""The people who left appear to have been part of the have-nots in the economy,"" he said. ""They definitely weren't greeted with leis and ukuleles playing. What they expected and what they got were vastly different things. ""It shows you maybe the people that went there weren't your typical South Korean citizens. I think it was a desperate, last-ditch move."" He said the return of the men could be viewed as a conciliatory turn from Pyongyang following a tumultuous pattern of brinkmanship this year, which has seen tensions with the South soar over a nuclear test in February, soothe with the re-opening of the Kaesong joint industrial park then ratchet up again with the North's cancellation of scheduled reunions for separated families. It also served a propaganda purpose for Pyongyang, in advancing a narrative that it wasn't only Seoul who was ""accepting refugees in search of a better tomorrow."" ""What they're saying to South Korea, but more importantly the world, is that it's not just North Korea that has economic woes,"" said Kim. Seoul returned four North Korean fishermen and their boat Sunday, a day after the vessel crossed into southern territory suffering engine failure, Yonhap reported. In August, South Korean fisherman Jeon Wook-pyo was reunited with his family in Seoul more than 40 years after he was abducted by North Korean agents, having escaped via a third country. Journalist Soo Bin Park contributed to this report.","Six South Korean defectors to the North were returned to Seoul on Friday .

"(CNN) -- A Tulane University football player who fractured his spine in a head-on collision with a teammate during a weekend game is ""alert and responsive"" after surgery, the school's athletic director said Monday. Devon Walker is expected to remain in intensive care for the next few days after a three-hour operation at St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Sunday, the Tulane athletics department said. Walker, a safety for the Green Wave, was injured Saturday when he collided head-on with a teammate while trying to tackle a Tulsa ball carrier. Rick Dickson, Tulane's athletic director, told reporters Monday afternoon that he was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the reports of Walker's condition, but had few details to offer. ""Devon is alert and responsive,"" Dickson said. ""How that manifests beyond that, I don't know how to respond."" He deferred questions about whether Walker was able to move parts of his body to doctors, saying the senior was ""in the hands of extremely competent and dedicated professionals."" Film aims to show football's culture of playing despite concussions . Walker lay motionless on the Tulsa field as trainers and doctors rushed to him. Dr. Felix Savoie, an orthopedist for Tulane University and chief of sports medicine at the school, said after the game Walker suffered a ""cervical spine fracture"" as well as an edema, or swelling from a build-up of excess fluid, in his neck. Tulane University's director of sports medicine Dr. Greg Stewart, who was with Walker on the field, said Sunday that, ""for the most part, he was coherent"" throughout the ordeal. Medical personnel did do chest compressions on Walker similar to CPR, mostly because it was difficult to assess his cardiovascular health given all the football gear he was wearing, said Stewart. But once EMTs arrived, they determined the player's heart was stable. Throughout the process and as Walker was loaded into an ambulance, Stewart said he acted like the player's ""eyes and ears,"" telling him what was going on and to ""relax, and being his calming voice."" Having been put in traction on Saturday, the more recent surgery to stabilize the spine involved putting a plate and screws on the front part of his spine so that the seven bones in his neck were on top of each other, the doctor explained. The doctor said it is too early to tell if Walker is paralyzed in any way. ""The reality of this is that it takes time for these injuries to settle out, so we know what's going on,"" Stewart said. ""We have another couple of days before we understand the extent of his injuries."" According to his bio on the Tulane athletics website, Walker is a 21-year-old senior majoring in cell and molecular biology. The New Orleans native, who weighs 173 pounds and stands 6 feet 1 inch tall, plays safety for the Green Wave, a team he's played with since walking onto the team and playing nine games as a freshman. After the game, which Tulane went on to lose 45-10, Green Wave head coach Curtis Johnson described the mood in Tulane's locker room as ""somber,"" calling Saturday ""one of the most difficult days ever."" ""I thought about just saying, 'Hey, look, let's not even do anything else, let's just get on the road and go,"" Johnson said of his feelings after Walker was hurt near the end of the first half. Walker is planning to attend medical school after graduation, according to Johnson. The coach described the senior as a ""self-made man"" who was ""probably the emotional leader"" of his team, thanks to his ""infectious"" spirit. ""He loves life, and he loves football,"" Johnson said. ""(Walker is) a very, very good kid, a very smart kid."" Professor Nancy Hopkins at Tulane said Walker had taken her biochemistry class in the spring of this year and was now registered in a biomedical writing course she teaches. ""He's a very pleasant young man,"" she said, noting that he always sits in the front row of her classes. Walker has kept up with his study program while playing football and is on track to graduate in May, she said. She described the outpouring of emotion on campus over Walker's injury as ""amazing."" ""This is such a tragedy, and we are all hoping and praying that he recovers,"" she said. Gupta on where 'Big Hits, Broken Dreams' began .

"(CNN) -- A U.N. peacekeeper was killed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in recent fighting, according to a statement release Sunday from the spokesperson for the Secretary-General. The Tanzanian peacekeeper was part the U.N. Organization Stabilization Mission in the unstable eastern part of the vast nation in Central Africa. The mission was joining the Congolese military in an effort to protect civilians about 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Goma, the largest city in the region, the statement said. The mission said Friday it was on ""high alert"" and monitoring the clashes between Congolese forces and M23 rebels. The U.N .mission stated that about 5,000 civilians from the town of Kibumba crossed the border into Rwanda on Friday. In the past year, clashes continued throughout the country's eastern region with rebels temporarily occupying Goma in November, according to the U.N. The organization said in the statement Sunday that it will remain committed to ""taking all necessary actions in line with Security Council resolution 2098 (2013) to protect civilians"" in the region. The eastern part of the DRC is a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of a bloody political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda.

"(CNN) -- Helen Fielding's latest novel on Bridget Jones isn't even out yet and it's already reportedly a shocker. This weekend, The Sunday Times published excerpts from Fielding's upcoming book, ""Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,"" that reveal a crucial character, Mr. Darcy, has been killed off. Cue the collective gasps of horror from around the world. Fielding first introduced heroine Bridget Jones in 1996 with her best-selling ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" a cheeky look at a 30-something single woman's adventures with life and love in London. During that initial installment, Bridget gets to know the prickly but sweet Mark Darcy, and in the follow-up, 1999's ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,"" he proposes. But by the time we get to ""Mad About the Boy,"" Darcy is dead and Bridget is a 51-year-old widowed mother of two. (At least they got to have kids before he kicked the bucket -- the reason behind which is still unknown.) Fielding said when the new novel was announced that Bridget would be in a different place with ""Mad About the Boy."" ""My life has moved on and Bridget's will move on, too,"" the author said in February. ""I hope people will have as much fun reading it, as I am writing it."" That's questionable, considering some of the intense reactions fans have had to the news of Darcy's death. ""Just found out Mark Darcy, from the #BridgetJones sequel, was killed off !!!! I can't handle this!"" said one fan. ""Helen Fielding killed off Mark Darcy in the new Bridget Jones book? My hopeless romantic heart is devastated,"" said another. Given that these reactions have poured in on Twitter, the conversation does occasionally turn hyperbolic: ""The news said that Mark darcy gets killed off in the 3rd Bridget Jones, my life has ended,"" tweeted one distraught fan. Posted another: ""If Mark Darcy is really dead I have no reason to live anymore. #overlydramatic #bridgetjones #whywouldshedothis"" Yet another clung to some ""Dexter""-inspired hope: ""Could it be that Mark Darcy fakes his own death & ends up as a lumberjack in the Pacific Northwest?"" the user queried. Either way, it is apparent that Bridget has moved on. In the Sunday Times excerpt, she describes her indecision between attending pal Talitha's 60th birthday party, and spending time with her ""toy boy,"" a nearly-30-year-old named Roxster. Both ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and ""The Edge of Reason"" were adapted into movies starring Renee Zellweger as Bridget and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy, and a third movie is expected to be on the way. At this point, we're not sure if Firth should be quite so excited.","Author Helen Fielding has killed off a major character in her third novel .

"(CNN) -- Throwing the World Series. Would such a brazen act be even remotely possible today? For baseball fans everywhere who will be watching Game 4 of the 2013 World Series, scheduled to be played Sunday night in St. Louis, the first instinct is probably: There is no way any team could come close to getting away with it. The 1919 Chicago White Sox -- forever known in American lore as the Black Sox -- thought, for a while, that they had pulled it off. At the behest of gamblers, a group of the team's stars purposely lost the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Their deed has become the stuff of legend in sports history, movies and books. By 1921, eight of the players had been banished from baseball. Today, though, with multicamera instant replays in the slowest of slow-motion and the closest of close-ups, with media saturation, with Twitter and Facebook available to disseminate conspiracy theories and rumors, players would seem to have no chance to do such a thing. Even looking back at it from the vantage point of our seek-any-edge-you-can era of performance-enhancing drugs, the audacity of what the Black Sox did is almost incomprehensible. Come on. Throwing the World Series? Say it ain't so, Joe. The supposition is that they were able to do it because back then, no one really knew for sure. There was no television, of course, but there was also no radio, as far as baseball was concerned. The first radio broadcast of a baseball game did not occur until 1921. Thus -- so accepted wisdom has it -- the Black Sox got away with throwing the Series because, whispers aside, no one at the time, or for the next year, was able to authoritatively pinpoint what was going on. But there is a fascinating and telling artifact in longtime sports columnist Ron Rapoport's new anthology, ""From Black Sox to Three-Peats: A Century of Chicago's Best Sports Writing."" One story in the book -- a straight sports-news report, written by James Crusinberry of the Chicago Tribune on October 7, 1919, right in the middle of the World Series (which was best-of-nine-games that year) -- nails it. Reading the story makes it clear: Even before social media, before sports talk radio, before all the ways of dissecting and discussing the minutiae of the games, a reporter with a good eye could spot, and document, games being thrown. Rapoport said that when he first came across Crusinberry's almost-century-old news report, he was startled: ""Here was a guy who was writing it in real time, as the games were going on. And he found a way to say it."" Here are some of the words from Crusinberry's reporting of that thrown Series: . ""'They aren't hitting.' ""Those few words spoken by Kid Gleason, manager of the White Sox, offered an explanation for a large part of the cause for the fourth defeat of the south siders yesterday in the World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. They got three hits off Hod Eller and never once in the whole game had a good chance to score a run. ""'I don't know what's the matter,' the Sox leader continued, 'but I do know that something is wrong with my gang. The bunch I had fighting in August for the pennant would have trimmed this Cincinnati bunch without a struggle. We hit something over .280 for the season in the American League pennant race. That's the best hitting any ball club ever did in the history of baseball. The way those .280 hitters batted against Eller, they couldn't make a place on a high school team.'"" And (again, manager Gleason talking to reporter Crusinberry): . ""I am convinced that I have the best ball club that ever was put together. I certainly have been disappointed in it in this series. It hasn't played baseball in a single game. There's only a bare chance they can win now.

And (in Gleason's hotel room as he spoke to Crusinberry, after the two had shared a cab from the ballpark): . ""[Gleason] clearly indicated he was mad enough to lick a lot of people and go to jail for it. He clearly indicated there was something wrong and that he intended to find out what it was. 'You know,' he spoke up, 'it doesn't seem possible that this gang that worked so great for me all summer could fall down like this. I tell you, I am absolutely sick at heart. ""'They haven't played any baseball for me. I thought all of them were my boys. I felt like a school teacher might feel toward his pupils. I loved those boys for the way they fought for me this summer. Those fellows were right around me and I would have staked my life they would have gone through for me in the world's series...Something has happened to my gang. If they would just play baseball for me for the rest of the series, they might even pull it out yet. The team I had most of the time all summer would do it. I haven't had the same team on the ball field in a single game.'"" Three days later, after the Black Sox had lost the World Series, Crusinberry quoted manager Gleason: . ""I don't know yet what was the matter. Something was wrong. I didn't like the betting odds. I wish no one had ever bet a dollar on the team."" Today, with millions of eyes, both human and electronic, on every move the ballplayers make in a World Series, the thought of a cabal of players presuming they could get away with throwing the games seems unfathomable. But in the most infamous World Series ever played, there were many, many fewer eyes watching. Yet some of those eyes, it turns out, seemed to understand what they were seeing. And what they were seeing just didn't add up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Throwing World Series?

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- In the technology world, a form of breaking bread can involve sharing hardware schematics. Facebook invited reporters, hardware makers and rival internet companies to its headquarters to debut a new initiative on Thursday for improving website infrastructure. With this Open Compute Project, Facebook is publishing documents that describe how to build the network of computers that support the site's millions of users and enormous banks of information. ""It's easy to look past what powers that,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his introduction. ""A lot of the stuff that the mass manufacturers (of servers) were putting out wasn't exactly what we needed and what a lot of the social apps need."" Representatives from Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Shutterfly and several other competitors were seen at the event. Some attending the meeting said they were there to learn and are mulling what contributions they could make or knowledge they could gain from the documents. Amazon.com announced a new pricing structure for its cloud hosting services on Thursday morning, which reduces the cost for some of its server-hosting programs. Many startups as well as big companies like Twitter and Zynga have relied on Amazon's Web Services at one time or another. Facebook's initiative could be seen as a potential jab at Google and Amazon, which closely guard information about their infrastructure and facilities, Forrester Research analyst Richard Fichera wrote in a report. Zynga Game Network, which makes FarmVille, provided an executive for a panel held after the announcement but didn't commit to the project. The company, with its 250 million players, is ""really intrigued"" about piloting the system on an internal network, Allan Leinwand, an executive for infrastructure engineering at Zynga, said on the panel. However, ""We haven't run it through its paces at this time,"" he said. Facebook says its new servers are about 31% more energy efficient than previous ones the company used, which were in line with the industry average. They keep cool using outside air funneled through a data center instead of pricey air-conditioning units. Facebook's main data center resides in Prineville, Oregon. A fairly large server farm can ring up an annual energy bill of $10 million, said Graham Weston, chairman of a large Web hosting company called Rackspace. Facebook's design could reduce that yearly power cost to $6 million, Weston estimated. ""We could continue doing things the normal way. Or we could take a little detour, and do things extra special,"" Jonathan Heiliger, a Facebook vice president for technical operations, said onstage. ""It's really good for the environment, and it's a really smart use of our resources as a small and growing company."" Servers aren't sexy, but Facebook certainly tried to make the underpinnings more broadly appealing. ""It's functionally beautiful,"" said Amir Michael, Facebook's hardware design manager, describing a server free of paint or screws like a car salesman might. ""It would be sweet if we could light the data center up in blue -- so that's what I ended up doing."" Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Intel had demonstration tables for its server technology in the back of the event, held in Facebook's cafeteria. Dell is already using Facebook's motherboards in its hardware, and Facebook has already secured 10 to 15 partners for the initiative, said Frank Frankovsky, Facebook's director of hardware design and supply chain.","Facebook is reaching out to rivals with a new initiative around Web infrastructure .
The social networking giant released documents to show how it builds data centers .
Meanwhile, Amazon.com, which provides Web hosting, announced new pricing plans ."
"(CNN) -- Simply put, it's impossible to imagine the past 50 years of rock without Lou Reed, who died Sunday at 71. Glam rock, punk and various strains of '80s and '90s indie and alternative rock would simply vanish without his example. Every New York rocker in a black leather jacket, from the Ramones to the Strokes, stands in Reed's shadow. David Bowie's early gender-bending persona was explicitly in Reed's debt. His songbook was a building block for rock's front ranks in the '80s and '90s: R.E.M., Nirvana, U2. Even peers of his band the Velvet Underground looked up to it. The Rolling Stones' 1968 song ""Stray Cat Blues,"" Mick Jagger later admitted, came from trying to emulate sound of the Velvets' ""Heroin."" Appreciation: Lou Reed, the minimalist god . Yet Reed was the first rock star that wasn't actually a star. Only one of the four classic albums he made with the Velvet Underground from 1967 to 1970 -- 1969's ""The Velvet Underground"" -- made the ""Billboard"" album chart, peaking at just 197. He would not climb high on the chart until 1972, when his solo single ""Walk on the Wild Side"" -- produced by Bowie -- reached No. 16, a position he never again came near. ""If something of mine ever got popular, maybe I could've stuck with that,"" he told Spin in 2008. ""But that was never the point. I had other goals."" And those were long-term. ""You may be drawing a circle for the thousandth time,"" he told Esquire in 2000, ""but maybe it's a slightly better circle."" Nevertheless, he became infamous -- and grew visibly weary of being infamous -- for singing about pursuing pleasures of the flesh well past the mandates of healthy, polite society. Bob Dylan had opened pop songwriting up to just about any topic, but Reed's refusal to flinch while singing about sadomasochism (1967's ""Venus in Furs,"" or the 1969 recording ""Foggy Notion,"" released on the great 1985 outtakes compilation ""VU"") and hard drugs on ""I'm Waiting for the Man"" and ""Heroin"" (both 1967) was unheard of in rock 'n' roll -- or really any music. So were the screeching, feedback-laden guitars. That thorniness was ingrained in Reed's public persona, in his unflinching demeanor and permanently alienated worldview. John Cale, his old Velvet Underground band mate, described Reed as gratuitously vicious, once ""the most difficult person to work with I have ever known."" Reed was, by many accounts, a fearsome challenge to interview; an anthology could be made of his most withering journalistic encounters (such as the Spin Q&A above). Artistically, Reed could be equally contrarian. In 1975, he issued a double-LP, ""Metal Machine Music,"" containing over an hour of machine-generated feedback, to critical howls, dismal sales and irritated fans. Reed didn't care. His last release, 2011's ""Lulu"" -- a heavily improvisational collaboration with Metallica -- was similarly derided. Chuck Klosterman, writing in Grantland, called it ""appalling,"" while Pitchfork gave it a 1.0 (out of 10.0). As ever, Reed proudly did whatever he damn well felt like. As a guitarist and songwriter, he practiced a conscious musical primitivism. The quote from Reed flying around Twitter the fastest in the wake of his death goes: ""One chord is fine. Two chords are pushing it. Three chords, and you're into jazz."" But rock was Reed's lifeline. In a 1966 magazine essay written before the Velvet Underground took off, Reed declared, ""The only decent poetry of this century was that recorded on rock-and-roll records."" While that may have been an exaggeration -- Reed studied under poet Delmore Schwartz at Syracuse University and was in that poet's thrall for the rest of his life -- it candidly reflected his ardor for the music. Having done so much to inspire punk and post-punk, Reed became a paterfamilias of the New York rock scene around CBGB's and Max's Kansas City in the 1970s; one of his finest solo albums, 1978's ""Street Hassle,"" nodded to that scene. (It also featured a vocal cameo from another fan, Bruce Springsteen.) It was the beginning of the phenomenon rock producer Brian Eno would allude to in 1982 interview with journalist Kristine McKenna, when he noted that while a relatively modest number of people bought copies of 1967's ""The Velvet Underground & Nico,"" everyone who bought one started a band. That process accelerated through the '80s. By 1986, Black Francis of Boston's Pixies -- whose sneak-attack approach to loud choruses was adapted by, among others, Nirvana -- was singing ""I wanna be a singer like Lou Reed"" on the band's first release, ""Come on Pilgrim."" Punk rock and its many offspring weren't all that Reed touched. In 1990, the rap group A Tribe Called Quest sampled Herbie Flowers' rolling bass line from ""Walk on the Wild Side"" on its hit, ""Can I Kick It."" Reed was a longstanding hip-hop fan; one of his last public acts was publishing a widely read paean to Kanye West's ""Yeezus."" ""There are moments of supreme beauty and greatness on this record, and then some of it is the same old s---"" Reed wrote. ""But the guy really, really, really is talented."" Sounds a lot like the guy who wrote it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michaelangelo Matos.","Michaelangelo Matos: Impossible to imagine past 50 years of rock without Lou Reed .
He says glam, punk and all alt rock in his debt; Stones, U2, REM among those influenced .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Believe the conspiracy theories: Out of sight and without your knowledge, governments truly are filtering what you see on the Internet. Internet users are increasingly having content blocked by governments around the world. The recent conflict between Georgia and Russia has highlighted many of the issues at play with Internet filtering, as its increasing use by governments raises serious doubts about the freedom of the Web. Georgian authorities blocked most access to Russian news broadcasters and Web sites after the outbreak of the conflict, and both sides reported Web sites being blocked, removed or attacked as the situation unfolded. According to one of CNN's iReporters in Georgia, the situation has been very frightening for citizens. Andro Kiknadze said an online forum he used to organize supporters appeared to have been taken down, and he described a ""cyberwar"" in which some Web sites appear to be blocked. ""Please, please help us. We are losing our treasure, our freedom. I am almost crying because I'm seeing my country is falling,"" Kiknadze said. So, what is Internet filtering, and why all the fuss? Filtering simply means restricting access, blocking or taking down Web sites. Karin Karlekar, senior researcher at freedom promoter Freedom House, said there were several ways in which content could be ""filtered."" She said governments could use purpose-built filtering technology, censor Web sites, filter search results -- with the assistance of multinational corporations, and block applications and circumvention tools -- to stop online applications like Facebook, YouTube or Voice Over IPs that enable social networking. And the use of these tactics appears to be quite widespread. According to a 2007 report by the OpenNet Initiative, which surveyed more than 40 countries, almost two-thirds of the states involved were filtering content to some degree. Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the Munk Centre for Internet Studies at the University of Toronto, said in the research, ""states are applying ever more fine grained methods to limit and shape the information environment to which their citizens have access."" ""Some states block access to a wide swathe of content, while others tend to concentrate on one or two narrow baskets. South Korea, for example, tends to block access only to sites related to North Korea,"" Deibert said. Although countries such as Iran and China -- home to the ""Great Firewall of China"" -- are obvious examples of where filtering is prevalent, other countries are also restricting content for varying reasons. Ian Brown, research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, said the Internet in some European countries, including the United Kingdom, was also filtered. However, this was mostly to block child pornography and content that incited or glorified terrorism, he said. Most democracies, and particularly those of the U.S. and India, had unrestricted Internet, though more than 40 countries were known to filter content, he said. And it's not just governments involved in filtering. Search engine Google has been heavily criticized for working with the Chinese government to block searches for material about Taiwan, Tibet, democracy and other sensitive issues on its Chinese portal. Share your views on filtering and censorship of Web sites. With recent developments in Georgia and Internet restrictions during conflict in Estonia last year, there are concerns that filtering could be further utilized in future ""cyberwarfare."" Brown believed that filtering would be used more commonly in repressive states in the future. Although he didn't have exact figures, Brown understood the Chinese military had more than 100,000 people employed to look at cyber warfare. Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard Law School's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said the tactic was very powerful. ""Filtering can help shape the message a country's citizens see, including, as may have happened recently when Georgia filtered some Russian Web sites, for the purpose of preventing enemy propaganda from reaching one's citizens."" Although Karlekar agreed that filtering was a strong aspect to cyber warfare, she said other trends were more concerning. ""Filtering isn't the primary technological way that Internet freedom can be compromised. The kind of 'cyberwarfare' that we hear about usually isn't filtering as much as 'denial of service' attacks that disable servers hosting particular Web sites, either of opposition media outlets or of foreign governments. ""Another type of 'cyberwarfare' that occurs more regularly is hacking into computers and stealing information, as well as planting Trojans or viruses,"" Karlekar said. So, if governments are stepping up their Internet filtering and the threat of cyberwarfare is increasing, how can citizens sidestep the restrictions? Zittrain said tech-savvy citizens are using a variety of tools to circumvent filtering. ""They range from the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Tor'software to commercial anonymizers and virtual private networks and 'buddy system' software like Psiphon, which allows a person in one place to handle requests for Web sites from someone in a place that filters."" In Iran, some citizens were overcoming Internet restrictions by using Freedom House's Gozaar Web site. Karlekar said the site offered news and debates with a plurality of voices and gave Iranians an opportunity to participate. The domain name was changed weekly to keep ahead of Iranian authorities, she said. Zittrain, a founder of the OpenNet Initiative, which tracks Internet filtering around the world, said the organization is working on a free tool that will let people easily report blockages as they find them. He believed that such tools could help citizens in heavily restricted countries bypass filters placed by their governments.","Governments filtering Internet content by blocking access and removing sites .

"(CNN) -- A Colorado woman charged with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists pleaded guilty on Tuesday, according to a U.S. Justice Department statement. Prosecutors say Jamie Paulin-Ramirez aided Colleen LaRose, a woman who called herself ""Jihad Jane,"" in a conspiracy plot to commit murder. LaRose is suspected of communicating with Paulin-Ramirez in August 2009, when the pair allegedly conspired to obtain military-style training in South Asia, traveling to Europe to participate and support violent jihad, according to a superseding indictment in 2010. Paulin-Ramirez accepted LaRose's invitation, traveling to Ireland with her child with the intent to live and train with jihadists, it said. ""Keeping our community and the country safe are a top priority of this office,"" said U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger, who lauded ""the importance and success of international collaboration when fighting terrorism."" Last month, LaRose pleaded guilty at a federal change-of-plea hearing in Philadelphia after being indicted in 2009 on four counts, including conspiring to support terrorists and kill someone overseas. She was allegedly part of a plot to murder Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who outraged some by depicting the prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog in 2007. But Paulin-Ramirez's attorney Jeremy Ibrahim denies the broader conspiracy claim. ""It's clear that she is not implicated in the larger conspiracy involving Colleen LaRose, a conspiracy involving a plot to kill,"" he said. Paulin-Ramirez was arrested in Ireland after LaRose. If convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison and a possible $250,000 fine at sentencing. Five other co-conspirators were allegedly involved, but have not been named by the government.","NEW: Jamie Paulin-Ramirez pleads guilty to a terrorism charge .

"(CNN) -- Clouds intrigued me as a boy. I was curious about what they were made of, how they got up in the sky and what it would be like to sit on one. I also thought they looked beautiful. Kids are often entranced by clouds. Unfortunately, such positive feelings rarely endure into adulthood. As we grow up, we start to moan about clouds. We consider them as metaphors for doom and gloom, describing someone who's depressed as ""having a cloud hanging over them"" and bad news in store as ""a cloud on the horizon."" Watch Gavin Pretor-Pinney's TED Talk . Clouds get a bad press. That's why, a few years ago, I started the Cloud Appreciation Society. It exists to remind people that, far from being things to complain about, clouds are among of the most diverse, evocative, and poetic parts of nature. TED.com: Sculpting waves in wood and time . It must be because they are so commonplace, so ubiquitous, so everyday, that we become blind to the beauty of clouds. We only tend to notice them when they block out the sun. So they come to represent the annoying obstructions in life, the things that get in the way. Our feelings about the weather are often articulated as if there is a battle between the sun and the clouds -- between good weather and cloudy weather. Such an opposition is, of course, just projection. The sun's energy powers the very movement of air around our atmosphere that causes clouds to form. ""The most beautiful thing in Nature,"" wrote Henry David Thoreau, ""is the sun reflected from a tearful cloud."" TED.com: Tom Shannon on anti-gravity sculpture . Not only should we appreciate clouds more, we also need to understand them better. The recent fifth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change includes one conclusion that all sides of the climate change debate can agree on. This is that the one factor contributing the greatest uncertainty in scientists' attempts to predict future global temperatures is the clouds. They have a huge and complex effect on the flow of energy to and from our planet, sometimes reflecting away the sun's heat, sometimes trapping in Earth's warmth. Scientists still don't understand enough about the formation of clouds to predict with confidence how cloud cover will be affected by changing atmospheric conditions. Without knowing that, they can neither be sure how the clouds will amplify future changes in global temperatures and nor make confident predictions about our climate in decades to come. But on the ground, in the meantime, the pleasures of cloudspotting, are all about the here and now. There is a satisfaction in learning to recognize the different types of cloud, from the fair-weather cumulus to the high, wispy cirrus, the fierce cumulonimbus storm cloud and the many other rare, unusual and fleeting cloud forms. TED.com: Nature, beauty, gratitude . Finding shapes in the clouds is an aimless, carefree pastime that we adults should also do more of. The digital age conspires to make us feel busier than ever. Cloudspotting, by contrast, is an activity that legitimizes doing nothing. These days, we need excuses to do nothing. Happiness comes not from a desperate search for stimulation elsewhere but from finding what is intriguing, surprising and ""exotic"" in the everyday stuff around us. You don't need to cross the world to be amazed. You just need to step outside and look up, every now and then, as if you are seeing the sky for the first time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gavin Pretor-Pinney.","Gavin Pretor-Pinney: Clouds entrance kids, but for adults are often metaphors for gloom .

"Cambridge, Massachusetts (CNN) -- In a recent discussion of what his administration might accomplish, Mitt Romney claimed that ""by virtue of the policies that we put in place, we'd get the unemployment rate down to 6%, and perhaps a little lower,"" over a period of four years. Is this goal attainable? It is. Indeed, it is not that tough a task. If the United States avoids new growth-retarding policies, such as the tax hikes scheduled for January 1, the economy's natural adjustments will lower unemployment substantially. These include downward adjustments in wages, reallocation of job-seekers from slower to faster growing sectors and regions, reduced in-migration plus increased out-migration, and withdrawals from the labor force. These adjustments do not always work quickly or for everyone (not every former construction worker can become a computer technician). But history suggests the adjustments do occur, as they have since the recession began. Over the next four years, they will continue to lower the unemployment rate, if not to 6%, at least near that territory. The more important task for either presidential candidate is restoring the economy to its prerecession growth path. Real GDP has historically grown about 3% per year, and major downturns have been followed by strong recoveries. Within two to three years, therefore, output is typically ""back where it would have been."" In this recession, the rapid recovery phase has so far been absent; real GDP is still well below where one would have predicted pre-2008, and with average growth under 3% since the recession ended, the gap grows larger every quarter. So can Romney, or anyone, get us back to a higher growth rate? Yes. Here is a program that will restore U.S. economic performance: . • Cancel all the tax increases scheduled to take effect at the end of 2012 and provide tax stability going forward. Make (all) the Bush tax cuts permanent. Repeal the alternative minimum tax. Eliminate the health care law's increases in the hospital insurance tax. All this will stimulate in the short term and set the stage for long-term growth. • Reform the tax code by eliminating the misguided deductions, exemptions, credits and loopholes that distort incentives and reward special interests. These features include big-ticket items like the deductibility of mortgage interest and employer-paid health insurance premiums, plus myriad small but senseless other provisions. • Lower the corporate income tax rate. The U.S. corporate tax environment is one of the least business-friendly in the world. Driving investment overseas cannot be good policy. • Slow the growth of entitlements. The U.S. can afford a social safety net, but our current programs are not sustainable, even in a robustly growing economy. Everyone should agree, at a minimum, to cuts that are sufficient to prevent these programs -- Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security -- from bankrupting the country. • Embrace immigration. Despite recent difficulties, the United States is still an attractive destination for those seeking a better life. By expanding immigration for low-skill workers, we restrain labor costs and reduce out-migration of manufacturing and other business. By easing immigration for high-skill workers -- many of them trained in the United States at taxpayer expense -- we get a return on our investment and retain industrious and innovative people. • Scale back military involvements around the world. A strong national defense makes sense, but it must focus on protecting the United States, not paying for Europe's defense or trying to force democracy down the throats of countries that are not receptive. • Cease the campaign against carbon-based fuels. Green energy may have its day, but only when coal, oil and gas become truly scarce. In the foreseeable future, traditional energy is much cheaper, and subsidies for alternative energy are a waste. • Stop scapegoating the rich and pretending that tax-hikes on the 1% can balance the budget. Everyone knows the numbers do not add up. • Respect capitalism. Anti-business rhetoric, which casts all success as undeserved, and which fails to recognize the improvements in material well-being that result from entrepreneurial success, just drive away talented people and guarantee our economic demise. If the United States adopts these policies, it will not only attain Romney's 6% unemployment goal, it will once again be the economic beacon of the world. What's wrong with that? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Miron.","Mitt Romney predicted he could reduce unemployment to 6% in four years .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Seven police officers were killed and nine were injured Tuesday in a series of attacks at security checkpoints in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, police said. The attacks happened in the town of al-Rutba, a predominantly Sunni Muslim community that for a few years was an al Qaeda stronghold after the 2003 U.S-led invasion of the country. In Tuesday's first attack, a suicide car bombing at a police checkpoint in northern al-Rutba killed four police officers and injured three others, said police officials in Ramadi, the provincial capital. Gunmen later attacked several security checkpoints in the town, killing three police officers and wounding six, police said. Information about the attackers' casualties, beyond the suicide bomber, wasn't available. Al-Rutba is about 435 kilometers (270 miles) west of the country's capital, Baghdad. Also Tuesday, a car bomb exploded near a busy market in the central Iraqi town of Musayyib in Babil province, killing one person and injured 11, police in Baghdad said. Musayyib, a largely Shiite town, is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Baghdad. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. Sunnis, who represent a minority of Iraqis, have felt politically marginalized since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003. Shiites make up a majority of Iraqis. So far in 2013, more than 6,000 people have been killed in Iraq. More than 350 of those deaths came this month, and almost 1,000 happened in September. Journalist Mohammed Adnan in Falluja contributed to this report.","Suicide car bombing kills four police officers in al-Rutba .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptian security forces arrested Mohamed Badie, the Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader, at a residential apartment in Cairo on Tuesday, state-run Nile TV reported. He was arrested in the Nasr City section of the capital without any resistance, Nile TV said, citing Gen. Abdel Fattah Othman, an Interior Ministry spokesman. Badie, whose title is supreme guide, is accused of inciting violence, according to Nile TV. The Brotherhood picked a Badie deputy to temporarily replace him, its political wing said Tuesday. He is Mahmoud Ezzat. Badie's detention came one day after 25 soldiers were killed in a Sinai ambush and onetime ruler Hosni Mubarak won acquittal on a corruption charge. Suspected militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades struck two buses carrying security forces and killed the soldiers in the city of Rafah, on the border between Egypt and Gaza, Nile TV reported. Interim President Adly Mansour declared three days of national mourning following the attack, Nile TV said. The Sinai Peninsula is a lawless area that was the site of frequent attacks even before Egypt's latest round of turmoil. In May, for example, seven Egyptian solders were kidnapped and held for six days there, a spokesman for Egypt's armed forces said. But the attack adds to the persistent tension across the country since the military ousted democratically elected President Mohamed Morsy in a coup. Over the past week, about 900 people -- security personnel as well as citizens -- have been killed. Deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo on Wednesday and violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations Friday. Billions in aid on the line: What will the U.S. do about Egypt? On Sunday, at least 37 jailed members of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist movement, were reportedly killed in what the Interior Ministry called an attempted jailbreak. Egypt's state-run EGYNews agency reported that the prisoners died from tear-gas suffocation and from trampling over each other, and Egypt's Prosecutor General Office ordered the arrest Monday of two police officers for their involvement in the incident. The prosecutor general also ordered that three police officers hospitalized for injuries sustained in the incident be held while the investigation continues. As for the Sinai ambush, the Brotherhood condemned the attack on Egyptian soldiers. ""Our peaceful protests (are) stronger than any weapon, and we don't accept any violence,"" said Murad Mohamad Ali, media adviser to the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. Morsy supporters, many of whom are members of the Muslim Brotherhood, and those aligned with the military-backed interim government blame each other for stoking the violence. Morsy has been in detention since his overthrow. Egyptian prosecutors have extended the detention for 15 days, pending investigations. Prosecutors have charged him with participating in the detention, torture, murder and attempted murder of Egyptian citizens; broadcasting false news to influence judicial authorities in their inquiries; and inciting thugs to use force and terrorize citizens. Questions about aid . The crackdown also spurred a call from a leading U.S. senator, John McCain, to cut off its $1.3 billion in aid to Egypt. He said the United States has failed to follow its own rule requiring suspending aid to states overtaken by a military coup -- though the United States has not officially described the recent regime change in Egypt as a coup. ""We have no credibility. We do have influence, but when you don't use that influence, then you do not have that influence,"" McCain said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said President Obama noted that ""every aspect"" of the U.S.-Egypt relationship is under review. U.S.-Egypt relations: 'Damned if you do, damned if you don't' He said the U.S. message to Egyptian officials has been consistent: The interim government should ""get back to an inclusive approach to reconciliation in Egypt. Will the regime get the message? The U.S. ability to influence events in Egypt is ""limited,"" Hagel said, but it's not ""without influence."" Speaking at a Pentagon briefing with his counterpart from China, Hagel said the United States has a longstanding relationship with Egypt. ""We have interests clearly in the Middle East -- interests that include hopefully a development of some progress toward an Israeli -Palestinian settlement. So we continue to work with the Egyptian interim government as well as the Egyptian military,"" he said. Hagel also said protection of Americans in Egypt is of the ""highest priority."" But Saudi Arabia's foreign minister assured Egyptians that Arab nations will support Egypt if any international aid to the country is cut, the Saudi Press Agency reported Monday. ""The Arab and Islamic nation is rich when it comes to the support of its sons and its potentials and will not shy away from providing a helping hand to Egypt,"" Saud Al-Faisal said. International response called weak, ineffective . The carnage has spurred a call from leading human rights group Amnesty International for a ""full, impartial and effective investigation in the shocking loss of life."" ""The interim government has already stained its human rights record -- first by breaking its promises to use nonlethal weapons to disperse pro-Morsi sit-ins and allow for the safe exit of wounded, and then by justifying their actions despite the tragic loss of lives,"" said Salil Shetty, secretary-general of Amnesty International, in a news release. ""The response of the international community has been weak and ineffective, even as everyone leaps to condemn the horrific loss of life. The international community must act decisively to send a message that no government can behave this way and retain any credibility."" Egyptian demonstrator: Why we are willing to die . The group documented a rise in civil strife since the July 3 coup and cited ""a string of serious human rights abuses, culminating in the wholesale attack by the security forces"" on pro-Morsy sit-ins last week. ""These abuses have included an alarming and unprecedented rise in sectarian violence against Coptic Christians across the country, ""seemingly in retaliation for their support"" for Morsy's ouster. It cited abuses by pro-Morsy protesters ""including beatings, torture and killings. ""In recent days, the scale of violence by some Morsy supporters have manifestly increased, as some attacked government buildings and police stations and personnel. Some protesters have also fired live ammunition on local residents,"" Amnesty said. Mubarak in court . As the upheaval persists in Egypt, Mubarak's court cases grind on. In Cairo, a criminal court acquitted the former president in a corruption case, Egyptian state TV reported Monday. The case stemmed from accusations of squandering public money allocated for renovating presidential palaces. He also faces at least one other outstanding corruption claim. Separately, Mubarak is also facing a more serious accusation: that he was involved in the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising. A Cairo court on Saturday adjourned a retrial in that case to this coming Sunday. Mubarak ruled Egypt, the most populous Arab country, for three decades until demonstrators opposing his rule forced his ouster in 2011. He was convicted in 2012 in the deaths of numerous protesters, but was later granted a retrial. After a lengthy trial, he and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters' killings. After appealing their convictions, they were granted a new trial early this year. Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year. After months spent in a military hospital, a public prosecutor sent him back to prison in April. The ousted autocratic leader's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had said that he was physically unfit to stand trial.

"(CNN) -- Authorities have discovered the remains of an infant in the backyard of a Long Island home after child protective officials were sent this week to check on the welfare of a 6-year-old. While they did not positively identify the recovered infant, New York State Police said Saturday that the woman who lives in the home told investigators that the death of one of her children had not been reported. The boy, named Justin Kowalczik, would now be around 3 years old. ""This interview also revealed a possible location of Justin's remains,"" police said of their talks with Heather Kowalczik. Colorado: Police catch break in missing girl case . Based on the interview, authorities obtained a warrant to search the family's property. ""It is absolutely a suspicious death,"" New York State Police Major Patrick Regan told reporters, saying authorities ""believe the child was there since approximately July of 2010."" The woman's boyfriend was identified by police in a news release as ""a person of interest"" in the case. A state police spokesman could not be reached Saturday for further comment. No charges have been filed. ""The Medical Examiners Office is conducting their investigation and the State Police are waiting for the confirmation of the identity and cause of death of the remains found,"" police said in the news release. The couple lived together in a two-story house in Farmingdale, a Long Island community about 35 miles east of New York City. According to police, they ""parented"" the 6-year-old child whom Suffolk County Child Protective Services employees had gone to check on earlier this week. It was during that investigation that authorities learned Justin Kowalczik, who was born in 2009, ""was unaccounted for."" Meanwhile, a 9-year-old child of Heather Kowalczik and her boyfriend was briefly sought by authorities after he didn't show up for school Friday. Authorities said the boy's father had driven off with him. Both were later found, state police said. More from CNN Justice: .

"(CNN) -- Football legend Diego Maradona has accused world governing body FIFA of being corrupt and run by greedy officials who have made millions from the sport. The 1986 World Cup winner delivered the broadside at his first press conference as coach of Dubai-based club Al Wasl on Saturday, as he reflected on the recent FIFA presidential elections in which incumbent Sepp Blatter ran unopposed. Blatter's main opponent, Mohamed Bin Hammam of Qatar, was suspended ahead of the vote along with fellow FIFA executive Jack Warner following accusations of bribery. ""There is a lot of corruption involving FIFA officials and they are all millionaires because of football,"" the former Argentina player and coach said. ""I wonder if Blatter has ever kicked a football in his life, and yet we have been under the control of such people who have refused to give up power in FIFA. ""Why don't they all just relinquish their positions, take the money they have made and leave the running of the sport in the more capable hands of former football players?"" Maradona, a controversial figure who was sent home from the 1994 World Cup for using drugs, said he had never liked the FIFA establishment. ""I don't support corrupt people and I will never be on their side. I have always been asked by them to support the FIFA family. But what family are they talking about? This sport belongs to us and they have never ever asked us to be part of the development process,"" the 50-year-old said. ""They have too much power and this has made them so arrogant and proud. This is not what a genuine football lover needs from such officials. After all football, is the biggest sport in the world. ""We will continue doing what we are doing so that these corrupt people go away. They are too old and since they have made so much money at the cost of football, they should simply take it all and go away. Please leave football alone."" Maradona, who turned up more than an hour late for the media briefing, added that FIFA had stifled his attempts to form a players' union. ""What did FIFA do? They worked against us to ensure the union never saw the light of day,"" he said. Meanwhile, FIFA is investigating Argentina's 4-1 defeat by Nigeria on Wednesday as part of a wider investigation into match-fixing, according to a report in Britain's Daily Telegraph on Saturday. The paper said there was evidence of irregular patterns as referee Ibrahim Chaibou of Niger allowed three extra minutes of injury-time in addition to the five already awarded before Argentina scored from a penalty. ""FIFA can confirm that this match between Nigeria and Argentina was one that we had an active interest in, and forms part of a wider ongoing investigation,"" it said in a statement to the Telegraph. The Nigerian Football Federation released a statement denying the accusation on Saturday. ""We are concerned at attempts by unscrupulous elements to play down the feat that our national team performed by beating Argentina,"" general secretary Musa Amadu said. ""This match was shown on many television stations, including ESPN, and in front of a crowd of 50,000, and we are certain that Nigeria's Super Eagles deservedly won that match, playing to the rules, and clearly outplaying our opponents.""","Soccer's ruling body FIFA condemned as 'corrupt' by Diego Maradona .

"(CNN) -- Switzerland's Lara Gut won the giant slalom as the World Cup season kicked off in Soelden, Austria on Saturday. The 22-year-old's first-ever victory in the discipline was clinched in a combined time of two minutes 25.16 seconds from two runs. Austria's Kathrin Zettel finished second, 0.84 seconds behind Gut with Germany's Viktoria Rebensburg a further 0.44 seconds slower in third. Read more: Seven to watch in Sochi . ""It's the first race of the season and already a win, it's amazing. I'm happy to bring a giant slalom win to Switzerland again,"" Gut said afterwards. ""In the first run I was trying to ski clean and push it to the limits although the snow was pretty aggressive. In the second run I just thought about skiing fast and didn't think about what could happen ..."" she added. Read more: Latest skiing news/features . Gut's previous best finish in a giant slalom race had been third -- in Lenzerheide, Switzerland earlier this year and at Semmering in Austria back in 2008. Zettel's second place earned her a record fifth podium finish in Soelden and the 20th of her career in giant slalom. ""It's a big podium here and quite a good beginning to the season. I felt confident before the race and I hoped to get a podium after a good summer of training in New Zealand,"" Zettel said. Mikaela Shiffrin was the best-placed U.S. skier finishing sixth, but compatriot Julia Mancuso had a disappointing opening day finishing down in 27th.

"(CNN) -- The National Security Agency scandal keeps getting juicier. Recent revelations, triggered by ex-NSA employee Edward Snowden's earlier disclosures, indicate that the National Security Agency not only collects volumes of metadata about the phone numbers people use, it routinely stores the contents of phone conversations, text messages, e-mails and Internet activity. Former Vice President Dick Cheney explains that the collection of all of this information is crucial, because NSA staffers cannot know what bits of it will turn out to be relevant to a counterterrorist investigation. In fact, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has agreed with that argument in approving bulk collection of American as well as foreign metadata for the past seven years. And if metadata must be stored for this purpose, it is an easy step from there to conclude that the contents of communications must be stored as well. The key question then becomes when the NSA may ""query"" or identify the source of the metadata it has stored and read the communications it has collected. The NSA reports that it conducts queries of metadata only when it has a ""reasonable, articulable"" suspicion that a number is linked to a foreign threat that has been identified as such by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Section 703 of the Patriot Act, as amended in 2008, limits looking at the contents of a communication to situations where the court has found probable cause to believe that information about a foreign threat will be revealed. Although one could ask for more oversight, this isn't a bad set of legal safeguards. If they were followed, the European naysayers about the NSA's exploits would not be so hot under the collar. Many countries besides the United States collect and analyze electronic communications for national security purposes. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that France and Spain helped our surveillance efforts by handing over phone records they collected on their citizens. Illustrated by the ease with which this spying took place, these countries impose fewer limitations on their surveillance activities than we do. The real question is whether we follow those limitations. Although the NSA may not conduct queries or examine content unless it or a court determines that ""national security"" is at stake, national security is apparently at stake quite often, if the recent reports about monitoring hundreds of thousands of foreigners' calls as well as the calls of foreign leaders are true. American journalist Glenn Greenwald, the principal conduit for Snowden's revelations, even claims that the NSA is as interested in economic intelligence as it is in exposing terrorist plots.  He offers as evidence documents showing that the U.S. has spied on conferences about negotiating economic agreements and on oil companies and ministries that oversee mines and energy resources. This may be the real reason European leaders are so incensed. Surveillance of terrorists is fine and probably can help them quite a bit. But surveillance of politicians and capitalists crosses boundaries that they might think should not be crossed, at least unless and until their intelligence agencies can do it as well as and as often as the U.S. can. In the meantime, Congress should get serious about making sure the NSA abides by the laws it has enacted. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Slobogin.","Evidence indicates that the NSA stores contents of phone conversations and e-mails .
NSA can investigate only when it can show reason it might be linked to foreign threat .
Christopher Slobogin: If it is monitoring many thousands of calls, are all those justified?

"Minneapolis (CNN) -- A federal jury found two Minnesota women guilty Thursday of raising money for Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-affiliated militant group in Somalia. According to the federal indictment, Amina Farah Ali, 35, and Hawo Mohamed Hassan, 64, of Rochester, Minnesota, solicited funds in ways that included going door-to-door ""under the false pretense that the funds were for the poor and needy."" The two were charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. U.S. officials designated Al-Shabaab a foreign terrorist organization in 2008. Ali was also found guilty of 12 other counts for, according to the indictment, sending more than $8,000 in 2008 and 2009. It's not the first time Minnesota has been connected with Al-Shabaab, which has been waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. In recent years, approximately 20 young men -- most of them Somali-Americans -- have traveled from the Minneapolis area to Somalia to train with Al-Shabaab, and a number of them have gone on to fight with the terrorist organization, U.S. officials said. Several of the young men are now facing federal terrorism charges because of their alleged involvement with Al-Shabaab. The alleged offenses include providing financial support to those who traveled to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaab, attending terrorist training camps operated by the group and fighting on behalf of it, federal prosecutors said in a release. Somali-American man admits to helping bring fighters to Somalia . Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has added to the humanitarian crisis in the nation on the Horn of Africa. Al-Shabaab has recruited more than 40 Muslim-Americans and 20 Canadians, according to U.S. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. Three Muslim-Americans have carried out suicide bombings in Somalia, King said. Two of those bombers were from Minneapolis: Shirwa Ahmed, 27, who was the first confirmed American suicide bomber in U.S. history, and Farah Mohamed Beledi, also 27. Ahmed killed himself and 29 others in the fall of 2008. The FBI identified Beledi as one of two suicide bombers responsible for killing two African Union soldiers in Somalia in May. CNN's John Fricke contributed to this report.","Indictment says women solicited funds under pretense that they were for the needy .

"(CNN) -- Jorge Lorenzo set up a thrilling last race finale with MotoGP title leader Marc Marquez by claiming the Japanese Grand Prix Sunday at Motegi. Defending champion Lorenzo led from start to finish on his Yamaha to relegate Marquez and his Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa to second and third places. It has cut Marquez's lead to just 13 points ahead of the final round in Valencia in a fortnight, the first time in seven years the title will be at stake at this stage of the season. ""Until we finish racing we know the championship is not over. I'm not the leading rider so it's not all up to me, "" Lorenzo told the official MotoGP website. ""I am the rider with the most victories in 2013 and that's very important."" added the Spaniard, who was wrapping up his 51st career victory and seventh of the season. Marquez, who was disqualified in the previous round in Australia for delaying a mandatory tire change, will be looking to seal the title in his debut season, but had to settle for second in Honda's home race. ""I felt I was too much on the limit and I said 'Ok, I'll take 20 points for the championship,"" he said. The race was run off in dry conditions at Motegi after rain and fog had hit practice and qualifying, but Lorenzo was dominant from the start although teammate Valentino Rossi dropped back after early mistakes. Italian legend Rossi fought back to finish sixth with Alavaro Bautista and Stefan Bradl ahead of him in fourth and fifth. Marquez, just 20, will go into the race in Spain needing to finish fourth or better to become the youngest winner of motorcycling's premier class. He finished just over three seconds behind Lorenzo, shaking off a nasty crash in morning practice which he blamed on a cold tire and change of track temperature.","Jorge Lorenzo wins Japanese Grand Prix at Motegi .

"(CNN) -- We've all been there: your plane? Delayed. The taxi driver? Borderline deadly. Your language skills? Severely lacking. Your trip is just beginning, and you're ready to hoof it back home. Then you arrive at your hotel: You reach for your suitcase to find that it's making its way through gilded doors in the hands of a dapper bellman. You follow inside and immediately inhabit a more peaceful world. In the case of the Four Seasons in Florence, a series of 15th-century bas-reliefs by Flemish artist Jan van der Straet encircles you. It might look like a polished museum, but you're in the hotel's lobby, a place where celebrations are held, aperitifs served and new guests welcomed with cocktails and room keys. While often unsung, a hotel lobby has a very important role. It's the property's gateway, responsible for a first impression that can last a lifetime. Which is not to say that any two great lobbies are alike. They can be as distinct as a hotel's location. Executive travel: America's best small towns . In fact, many of the best hotel lobbies reflect that sense of place. Take the Amanpuri, Aman's signature property on Phuket Island, where the makha-wood lobby with pitched roofs was modeled after an Ayutthaya period temple. Across the world at the new $250 million Mukul Resort & Spa in Nicaragua, the check-in desk is crowned with an oval palapa and chandelier made of 152 baskets woven by locals. Stellar views can also anchor an inspiring space. The Southern Ocean Lodge on Kangaroo Island in South Australia welcomes you with an oversize kangaroo sculpture (crafted from recycled metal) and panoramic Southern Ocean scenery. At the brand-new Oberoi, Dubai, a towering 252-room hotel, the iconic Burj Khalifa, currently the world's tallest building, is framed by two-story windows. No matter the view or design, though, the best entryways appeal to our five senses and withstand the test of time. ""Hotel lobbies have seen many new trends over the last few years, from a private living room concept to a front desk free space,"" says Rome-based tour operator Uri Harash, founder of Perfetto Traveler. ""Still, the hotels that nail that first impression have a host of similar qualities—they're sharp, beautiful, welcoming and unique."" Singita Sasakwa Lodge, Singita Grumeti, Tanzania . While the Edwardian-style safari lodge's antique English furnishings and zebra-hide rugs are striking, it's the view at the end of its lobby that makes you feel like the Lion King. French doors open to a manicured lawn that then links, almost like an infinity pool, to the golden Serengeti beyond. Even safari experts are impressed: ""The entryway to this property is one of the most memorable welcomes of any lodge in East Africa,"" says Dennis Pinto, managing director of luxury tour operator Micato Safaris. ""The combination of colonial opulence paired with the views towards Tanzania's untamed plains is truly exceptional."" St. Regis Lhasa, Tibet . Thanks to the hotel's vantage point at 21,000 feet (it's the highest St. Regis in the world), the third-floor lobby looks out on the hilltop Potala Palace, the former residence of the 14th Dalai Lama. The property is also modeled after the nearby Sera Monastery, giving it ""an immediate Tibetan sense of place,"" notes Guy Rubin of tour operator Imperial Tours, based in Beijing. Red lacquer columns and wooden statues of monks in prayer by a local artist help frame the view; a central table topped with religious and artisan works—prayer beads, a Buddha bust and urns—also graces the serene space. Executive Travel: World's most outrageous yacht travel . Amanpuri, Phuket, Thailand . Travelers are welcomed to Aman's flagship property with cold towels and refreshing lemongrass-ginger tea before entering the soaring lobby, modeled after an Ayutthaya-era temple by the resort's architect, Ed Tuttle. Golden walls are crafted from local makha wood while open-air spaces overlook a deep blue pool, towering royal palms and, in the distance, the Andaman Sea. It's a serene introduction to the property, where 40 guest pavilions (opt for Nos. 103 and 105 for water views) and a clutch of two-bedroom villas dot 100 tropical acres. The Oberoi, Dubai, United Arab Emirates . The latest property from Indian hotel family Oberoi, a 252-room tower in Dubai that opened in June 2013, overlooks the iconic Burj Khalifa, currently the world's tallest building, from its radiant lobby. Here, original works by Indian artist Mrinmoy Barua adorn the walls, 41-foot gold chandeliers descend through marble floors into a downstairs banquet and the international elite gathers for cocktails—the Cuatro Meses Mojito made with Añejo gold rum is one staff favorite—and Cuban cigars. Sophistication continues throughout the property, where rooms, starting at 560 square feet, have deep soaking tubs, hand-tufted rugs and downtown city views. Tierra Patagonia, Chile . Interior architects Alexandra Edwards and Carolina diPlano aimed to bring the outside in at the Tierra Patagonia. To that end its lobby, which shares a sprawling open layout with a lounge and bar, has panoramic views of Torres del Paine Park and Lake Sarmiento. Floor-to-ceiling windows are made of a double-paned glass, so even when landscapes whip wildly outdoors, guests stay cozy in low-slung furnishings around a 360-degree fireplace. Try a glass of carmenere wine made from Chile's namesake grape. Executive travel: Most outrageous hotel concierge requests . Mukul Resort & Spa, Rivas, Nicaragua . In addition to 37 plush suites and villas, 1,670 jungle acres and an 18-hole golf course, the new $38 million Mukul Resort & Spa in Nicaragua has a lobby worth bragging about. It's topped with an oval palapa, crafted by 15 people over the course of a month, as well as a chandelier dreamed up by interior designer Paul Duesing: The artful piece made up of 152 baskets was created by local artisans. Southern Ocean Lodge, Kangaroo Island, Australia . Sunshine the Boomer Roo, a giant sculpture crafted from discarded farm machinery by local artist Indiana James, greets guests as they enter the open lobby at this Kangaroo Island resort. He might momentarily steal attention from the understated furnishings, a collection of exquisitely fashioned pieces by Khai Liew, but he can do little to compete with the scenery. The resort sits on a cliff, affording it uninterrupted views of the Southern Ocean from panoramic windows. Aria Hotel, Las Vegas . While the City of Sin is full of impressive lobbies—at the artful Cosmopolitan and glittering Wynn, among others—the Aria entryway in Las Vegas' $8.5 billion CityCenter campus deserves a shout-out for its sophistication and dedication to sustainability. Its crowning feature is the 87-foot-long, 3,700-pound sculpture of the Colorado River, located behind the check-in desk. Made of reclaimed silver by artist Maya Lin (best known for the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C.), the sculpture quietly draws attention to the hotel's commitment to environmentalism. Other design elements—abundant natural light and live flowers and trees—are also green minded. Aviator Hotel, Hampshire, United Kingdom . TAG Group was the money behind this 2008 hotel, build with aviation-inspired architecture in mind (air travel and motorsports are among the company's subsidiaries). Its curving walls continue from the exterior inside where a stark white stairwell—often compared to New York's Guggenheim—greets guests. Sleek design carries on throughout a central, light-filled rotunda with chocolate plaster walls and taupe stone floors. Black American walnut elevators zip up and down four floors, and a glass-enclosed fireplace offers views into the hotel's posh Brasserie. Executive Travel: Best get-fit retreats around the United States . Four Seasons Florence . You'll feel like you're walking into a polished museum when entering the Four Seasons in Florence, a 15th-century palace and 16th-century villa on 11 acres that opened its doors in 2008 after a painstaking seven-year renovation. Notable families during the Renaissance often embraced public displays of wealth, and to that end the hotel's lobby greets travelers with a series of fine bas-reliefs depicting mythological and classical scenes, created by Flemish Mannerist artist Jan van der Straet beginning in 1555. Ace New York, New York City . Everyone in New York wishes the Ace Hotel lobby was their own personal living room, which is why you'll spot journalists armed with iPads at slate-topped tables mingling with hip execs meeting over cappuccinos in plaid armchairs. The lobby bar, a 10-by-25-foot space, was reclaimed from a Park Avenue apartment; the twin staircase is covered in a graffiti mural by artist Michael Anderson. Be sure to make a reservation in the neighboring Breslin restaurant for chef April Bloomfield's juicy lamb burger. Mandarin Oriental Tokyo . This lobby is all about its 38th-floor vantage point, which affords the sky-high space with a 360-degree lookout over the Tokyo skyline. From the lobby's west side, the Imperial Palace and Mount Fuji, now on UNESCO's World Heritage List, rises in the distance; to the east, guests will spot the Tokyo Skytree—the world's tallest broadcasting tower—as well as the Sumida River. The opulent lobby also has an intimate sushi bar and the eight-seat Tapas Molecular Bar, where a 20-course tasting menu is served. InterContinental Miami . This waterfront hotel in downtown Miami already had a lobby that centered on art—30 years ago, Henry Moore's Spindle sculpture was brought in by helicopter before brick and mortar was built around it—and now the hotel is fresh from a $30 million, tech-savvy renovation. Lounge pods, each with a touch-screen coffee table (known as a digital concierge in IC speak) where guests can order drinks and read up on local nightlife, dot the lobby. An expansive video wall, with a live feed of downtown Miami, also lights up the background. © 2012 American Express Publishing Corporation.

"New York (CNN) -- A Bronx middle school principal's job is in jeopardy after investigators say she failed to report student allegations of inappropriate conduct by a teacher who was later arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a female student. A report released Thursday alleges that Angelyn Donald, principal at PS 386, was told by a number of students about note passing and even kissing between their 10-year-old classmate and her 40-year-old special education teacher, Anthony Criscuolo. Criscuolo was arrested in June after the alleged victim's mother called police, according to NYPD Detective Marc Nell. He is currently jailed on charges of predatory sexual assault against a child. The investigation was conducted by Richard Condon, special commissioner of investigation for the New York City School District. When one student reported to Donald's office after witnessing the alleged victim and Criscuolo kissing and another told her about reading an allegedly sexually explicit note passed between the two, Donald told the students not to spread rumors and that she would look into the allegations, according to the report. Another student told investigators that Donald demanded proof of the alleged conduct. In an interview with investigators, Donald denied being notified of any inappropriate conduct by students. CNN's efforts to reach Donald for a statement were unsuccessful. She told the New York Daily News on Thursday morning, ""I don't know anything about that"" when asked about the alleged Criscuolo incidents. ""I have no comment."" Donald has been at PS 386 since November 2011 and the principal there since June 2012, according to David Pena, deputy press secretary for the New York City Department of Education. ""We take these matters very seriously. Department of Education employees have an obligation to report any suspected incident of sexual misconduct. The principal will be reassigned away from the school and we will be seeking her termination,"" Pena said in a statement. Investigators have turned their findings over to the Bronx County District Attorney's office, according to the report. The charge against Criscuolo stemmed from an purported incident in June in the teacher's car, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Criscuolo, who taught 5th grade special education, was immediately reassigned away from the school and any students, Connie Pankratz, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, told CNN. Criscuolo began working in the New York City school system in 2002 as a substitute teacher in the Bronx. In his most recent position at PS 386, he was paid $72,990, Pankratz said. Criscuolo's next court appearance will be January 24, 2014. CNN's Chris Boyette and Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report .","New York schools says principal failed to act on student concerns .

"(CNN) -- Gervinho's unsuccessful spell at Arsenal came to an end last summer when he was sold to Roma. The winger is now flourishing in Serie A and carried over his form to the international stage Saturday as he led the Ivory Coast to a 3-1 win over Senegal in the first leg of their playoff tie. He played a role in all three goals in Abidjan, earning a penalty that Didier Drogba converted in the fifth minute. His good ball led to an own goal in the 14th minute and he assisted on Salomon Kalou's effort that made it 3-0 in the 50th. But Papiss Cisse's goal deep into injury time left Senegal with slight hope of appearing at the World Cup for the first time since bursting onto the scene in 2002. Senegal, however, won't have full home-field advantage in the return leg, playing next month's match in Morocco because of a stadium ban in Dakar. The ban was imposed after an African Cup of Nations qualifier between Senegal and the Ivory Coast last year was cut short due to crowd trouble. The winner of the tie earns a place at next year's World Cup in Brazil and the Ivory Coast -- which lined up in Germany in 2006 and South Africa in 2010 -- will be expected to complete the job. There was controversy in the other African playoff contested Saturday. Burkina Faso, which has never featured at the World Cup, converted a late penalty to edge visitor Algeria 3-2. To the disbelief of the Algerians, Zambian referee Janny Sikazwe awarded the spot kick for Essaid Belkalem's handball, which didn't appear to be deliberate. Algerian players protested but the call stood and Aristide BancÃ© -- who missed a penalty in the first half -- broke the deadlock in the 86th minute. Algeria had twice come back in Ouagadougou. On Sunday, Ethiopia hosts Nigeria and Tunisia entertains Cameroon. Egypt visits Ghana on Tuesday.","Ivory Coast beats Senegal 3-1 in the first leg of their football playoff in Africa .

"(CNN) -- U.S. conservatives deeply admire Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In a March story, National Review hailed Harper as the new ""leader of the West"" -- and they didn't mean Western Canada. The Wall Street Journal and The Weekly Standard have added their own praise. Well they might. Harper has achieved more from a weaker position than any conservative leader of recent times. A decade ago, Canada's Conservatives were split between two antagonistic parties. Harper won the leadership of one of those parties, then negotiated a merger, with himself as leader of the united right. He then had to fight a rapid series of elections: In 2004 he reduced the once-dominant Liberals to minority status. In 2006, he won just barely enough seats to form a minority government himself. He won a stronger minority in 2008, but only in 2011 did he at last gain the secure majority he'd sought for a decade. Under desperately precarious political circumstances -- and in the face of the worst global economic crisis since the 1930s -- Harper achieved remarkable things. Almost 1 million more Canadians are working today than before the financial crisis -- the best employment record in the Group of 7. Incomes have recovered and surpassed pre-recession peaks. Canada's national debt burden is lower than that of any other major economy -- and less than half that of the United States. Corporate tax rates are lower in Canada than in the United States, and on the present trajectory the same may soon be true of personal income taxes as well. How did Harper and his Conservatives do it? Not the way that American conservatives are trying to do it. American conservatives have followed a radical path to repeated defeat. Canadian conservatives have followed an incremental path to accumulating success. Americans then might benefit as much as Canadians from reading ""The Longer I'm Prime Minister,"" a lively new book about the secrets of Harper's survival and success, written by one of Canada's leading political columnists, Paul Wells of Maclean's magazine. The title plays off a joke Harper frequently tells on himself: ""The longer I'm prime minister"" -- pause for dramatic effect -- ""the longer I'm prime minister."" It's a joke based on a grim political reality: Twenty-one men and one woman have served as prime minister of Canada. Six of them have lasted less than a year. Three more lasted less than three years. On the other hand, five prime ministers served more than 10 years. If the 54-year-old Harper completes his current term, he will have served for nine years. One more win after that, and he will have joined the champions. ""My models aren't Conservative prime ministers,"" Wells quotes Harper. ""My models are successful prime ministers."" Wells is not especially sympathetic to Harper's politics or purposes. But he has invested the close attention necessary to understand them. As Wells explains, Harper's first priority is to last. As Harper himself said in a 2004 speech that outlined his political program before a friendly audience, incremental gains are ""inevitably"" the only real ones. Revolutionary projects almost always fail. ""The surest rebuttal Harper can offer to a half-century of Liberal hegemony,"" Wells points out, ""is not to race around doing things the next Liberal could undo."" The better rebuttal, instead, is to build a counter-hegemony of one's own. What could be more foolish than futile provocative actions that serve only to consolidate the other guy's advantages? American conservatives enamored of their bold programs may disdain Harper's caution. Think again. ""Because he is temperamentally the most conservative Canadian prime minister of his lifetime, he will not ever run out of ideas for conservative things to do. So on any day he has a choice, he can do the big conservative thing that would be the end of his career, or he can do some of the small conservative things that won't. He is amazed that earlier leaders had a hard time choosing."" As Wells points out, however, a politician can accomplish a lot by the simple act of refraining from committing career suicide. ""How many decisions does a prime minister make in a day? Sixty? A hundred? Almost none go reported. He doesn't even have to keep most of them secret: the rush of events ensures they won't be noticed and assayed by the (press) gallery. As the 2011 election approached, Harper was approaching two thousand days in office. Imagine how different the outcome would have been if a different prime minister, with different assumptions, prejudices, and instincts had made those thousands of decisions."" Many U.S. Republicans argue that elections are won by boldly standing on principle. Sen. Ted Cruz articulated just that idea in his speech Friday to Iowa's Ronald Reagan Dinner. He lauded the House Republicans who nearly pushed the nation into bankruptcy as ""a profile in courage who stood strong and listened to the American people."" In fact, of course, those House Republicans appalled and frightened the American people -- and badly damaged themselves in the process. After the worst miscalculation of his own career -- a failed maneuver that nearly brought down his government in 2008 -- Harper explained the lesson he'd learned: Never surprise the voters. Do not outpace the consent they have granted. Lead from the front -- but never from very far in front. As for those bold ""Braveheart"" speeches so cherished by conservatives these days ... they are to be avoided at all costs. Wells observes the Harper speechmaking operation close up: ""He works at removing memorable turns of phrase and identifiable ideas from his speeches. He puts great effort into flattening his prose."" Why? ""All that stuff that sounds good in speeches -- 'We must,' 'I will never,' 'Mark my words' -- all that becomes a line in the sand. It gets held against you later. So that stuff's coming out."" I know Harper a little, and I can attest: It requires immense self-control to keep this relentlessly interesting intellect sounding dull. But politics is not a business for the self-indulgent. ""Observers looking for something to dislike get less fodder than they would if he were a loudmouth."" As I write, the Harper government is facing a moment of controversy. Harper appointees to the unelected upper chamber of the Canadian Parliament are accused of cheating on their expenses, and the opposition parties are making a familiar uproar over the familiar questions of what did the prime minister know and when did he know it. It's all very exciting, and likely all very fleeting. What is lasting is governance. American conservatives should rediscover it -- and Wells' entertaining and insightful study of North America's most governance-minded conservative offers an excellent place to start.

"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- The dragon is the Chinese counterpart of the phoenix rising from the ashes of destruction. And as we bring in the Year of the Dragon Monday, the most important of the years in the Chinese Zodiac, let's consider a great opportunity -- and an awe-inspiring responsibility -- to create an ethical world together. The challenge we must face: Every day, throughout the world, mothers, fathers, sons and daughters are arbitrarily detained, tortured and denied access to counsel and basic due process rights -- causing untold human suffering, perpetuating patterns of violence and impunity, and sapping vast economic potential. We may think of torture as a last-resort instrument of authoritarian regimes or rogue groups to extract information from political prisoners, but torture is a much more common occurrence than that. More than 100 countries -- including some we describe as democratic -- practice some sort of torture, often on a massive scale, and most of the tortured are not even political prisoners. Torture is actually used most of the time just because it is the cheapest form of investigation, less expensive than building a proper legal system. TED.com: What's the right thing to do? In the midst of this crisis exists an urgent opportunity. Of the 113 developing countries that, according to our database, practice torture, 93 have taken a strong first step in favor of human rights by signing international conventions and adopting domestic laws that safeguard the rights of ordinary citizens. Unfortunately, many of these laws remain unenforced due to a lack of trained lawyers, a lack of awareness of what respect for human rights really means, and a lack of resources to turn the situation around. These critical gaps allow entirely preventable human rights violations to occur over and over again, despite a legal framework being in place and governments being willing to accept international support. I first came to this realization in 1994 when I walked into a prison in Cambodia and met a 12-year- old boy who was tortured and denied counsel -- for stealing a bicycle. Over time, I came to realize that the vast majority of torture cases actually happen to everyday citizens throughout the world and not to political prisoners. And yet the global community spends the majority of its efforts on political prisoners and on punitive measures as opposed to preventive measures that create positive change. Suddenly, when I looked into that Cambodian boy's eyes, it became clear: Precisely because he was not a political prisoner, the Cambodian government had no interest in the boy, for better or worse. This was the way the police did their work. They didn't need to build a case based on evidence; they roughed up the suspects to get a confession. Thus, we recognized the opportunity to help him, and the many thousands like him throughout the world. This is the mission of International Bridges to Justice (IBJ), which was born 12 years ago, in the last Year of the Dragon. TED.com: The global power shift . In those years, defenders from throughout the world have joined our cause, seeking justice for the poorest of the poor, training local officials, and literally defending life and human dignity. From China to Zimbabwe, from India to Burundi, we see the seeds of justice starting to grow. Our starting point is not instances of torture and broken legal systems. We focus instead on the attainment of functioning courthouses, competent police officers, trained legal defenders, resulting in ordinary citizens everywhere encountering justice rather than brutality. Our challenge is to breathe life into existing legal frameworks, to stop investigative torture before it occurs, and to create a culture where the rule of law and respect for due process and human rights is the norm. Yes, this sounds incredible. Many would say it is simply not possible. Yet in in the country where I first encountered the 12-year-old tortured boy, IBJ today now represents indigent defendants in 13 out of Cambodia's 24 provinces. In those provinces where IBJ has its legal aid centers, investigative torture today is virtually eliminated, a dramatic turnaround from a culture of abuse and impunity in a few short years' time. Cambodia's government has asked IBJ to work on helping to build a legal aid system. We trained the police, we empowered the defense lawyers, we raised the population's awareness -- and where we work, torture is now the exception and not the rule. Imagine a 36-year-old Sri Lankan woman, held in pretrial detention for nine years. Only after an IBJ lawyer intervened did she regain her freedom and see her children again. And this story is one of the least unpleasant ones. At least she had not been severely tortured, raped or abused. Despite overwhelming challenges, courageous defenders are having the prophetic imagination to see a world without abuse and torture and are fashioning this hope into reality. They are enabling their countries to rise from the ashes of destruction by rebuilding stable societies through the safeguards of their legal system. For the latter half of the 20th century, as human rights became an important factor in international relations, activists played an excellent role in raising awareness of problems. But we've reached a point where there is only so much that this can accomplish. If we learn about abuses and only prosecute abuse after the fact, what good does that do? Instead of optimizing the approach by doing the same thing only a bit more effectively, we need to innovate -- that is, we need to do something new entirely. We can't play the game by the rule of the tormentors, whereby they torture and we decry. We won't always lose, but we'll never win. We need to act before the torture happens in the first place. A shift is taking place toward upholding human rights through legal rights -- using the infrastructure of the public justice system to ensure that basic protections are upheld. The payoff is preventing abuse, rather than exposing mistreatment and prosecuting after the fact. Just having a lawyer supervise the process of a suspect's detainment puts police and prosecutors on notice that they are being watched not just by a defender, but by society at large. There was a time when it was impossible to imagine a world without polio. There was a time when it was impossible to imagine the abolition of apartheid. But that did not stop those who believed in a better world, and I believe we can stop the use of investigative torture in the 21st century. The time is now. We are the Dragon. We are the Game. Let us rise up from the ashes of destruction and create our ethical future together. Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- After five and a half weeks in transit limbo, NSA leaker Edward Snowden was granted temporary one-year asylum in Russia on Thursday. The White House expressed ""disappointment"" and again raised the threat of possibly canceling the meeting between President Barack Obama and President Vladimir Putin next month when the U.S. president is scheduled to travel to Russia for the G-20 meeting in St. Petersburg. But just how disappointed should Washington be with this development? With Snowden being allowed to leave the transit area, the move can provide an opportunity for U.S. authorities to make contact with him somewhere in Moscow. It is my understanding that while Snowden has been in the transit area, it has not been possible for U.S. authorities to make contact with him, and this has been a real problem for Washington. Perhaps if Snowden had a clearer idea of what precisely his fate would be upon return to the United States, he might reconsider. That was certainly the purpose of Attorney General Eric Holder's letter to the Russians last week. Putin has made clear several times that his preferred option is for Snowden to leave Russia as soon as possible, and I am inclined to believe him. My hope for the past few weeks has been that there had been considerable back-channel communication between U.S. and Russian authorities, including most importantly at the Obama/Putin level, about finding a reasonably acceptable exit strategy from the dilemma. Russia has already gotten some PR bang from the Snowden affair, and we have to assume that Russian intelligence authorities have copied all materials that Snowden brought with him as well as whatever else he knows about sources and methods, intelligence personnel, internal operations, etc. It is hard to imagine that Russian special services have not had extensive conversations with him and likely this cooperation was an important factor in consideration of his asylum request. But staying in Russia longer only gratuitously inflames an already very shaky and vulnerable U.S.-Russia relationship that I do not believe Putin seeks to further damage, at least not because of Snowden. Putin has made clear that he will not extradite Snowden to the United States, and we should take him at his word on that. However, if Snowden himself decided that he preferred to return to the United States, then the Russians would be obliged, and perhaps happy, to let him go. Perhaps Snowden should heed the excellent story by Kathy Lally in The Washington Post on July 19 about the predominantly sad fates of U.S. citizens who have received asylum in the former Soviet Union and Russia. There is no way the ex-KGB agent Putin, who fundamentally despises and disrespects traitors and revealers of state secrets, will allow Snowden much running room in Russia. Putin does not really like public discussions of state surveillance of citizens, even if they are U.S. citizens, and when he states the condition of staying in Russia that Snowden stop harming the United States, he probably means he wants an end to public revelations of further documents Snowden claims to have. And if Snowden were to pursue his so-called human rights activities in Russia, he would meet a very unhappy fate indeed. Like many of his asylum-seeking brethren in the past, he may find his life so restricted that he turns to drink or some worse self-destructive fate. So Snowden should not only be clear about what his likely fate would be in returning to the United States, but he should also be clearly briefed by our Russian friends about how he will actually be treated upon receiving asylum in Russia if that were to happen. Finally, having received and accepted for now asylum in Russia, this is the second-best outcome for U.S. security interests after Snowden himself possibly deciding to return to America, something he still could potentially do. Since we have to assume that the Chinese and the Russians already have taken all the information that he had to offer, the United States should have no interest in seeing Snowden going off to other countries and even more widely distributing his secrets. Probably Putin himself would not like to see this happen either since it would diminish the value of the intelligence that Russia has received from Snowden. Despite the developments Thursday, Putin might also see that the best outcome is for Snowden to decide for himself that he should return to the United States. I have to think that our Russian friends can be very persuasive in making this argument, and I hope that Obama and his team are pursuing this more subtle and face-saving solution.

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Sandy wiped away my house. In one fell swoop I lost nearly everything that was meaningful to me. In the aftermath of the storm, one year later many people in my neighborhood and I are still in limbo. Here's what happened: My music group The Planotones and I were set to play on a ship cruise, with 3,000 passengers aboard celebrating the music of the 1950s and '60s. We were going to board in Puerto Rico on October 31. Before we left, the organizers called and urged us to leave a few days early to meet the boat in Puerto Rico, concerned about a storm that was heading up the East Coast. They wanted to make sure we avoided any problems that would prevent us from getting there on time. They were putting us up in a hotel on the island while we waited for the boat. I packed my bag, my Planotones hat, put food in the garage for my feral cat, called a cab and locked the back door, a familiar ritual for many years. My house on the beach in Rockaway, New York, was built in 1916, 22 years before the first of two bridges were built to connect the Rockaway Peninsula to Brooklyn on one end and Queens on the other. The house had survived many storms since 1916 and in the 40 years I lived in it. I felt so connected to my home -- it was my friend, my oasis and my place of healing after hard days on the road. After storms, there never was much damage, not much to fix and never any water damage in the basement, which contained, among many memorable items, my music studio. CNN iReport: Photographer revisits Sandy's path . In this studio were thousands of 45-rpm singles, hundreds of albums, microphones, amplifiers, a drum kit, my upright piano (from the Brill Building) 24 track tapes from ""Saturday Night Live,"" ""Eddie and the Cruisers"" and ""Animal House,"" demos, tapes and a vintage guitar collection collected over 50 years of playing music. In my hotel room, the Weather Channel was tracking Hurricane Sandy. It was pretty alarming, so I called a friend who lived on the next block in Rockaway. He was in the front of his house and told me that the water was rushing up the street from the ocean. He saw books and records from my house floating by. I lay awake most of the night, thinking of the worst ... but never really believing it could be true. I reached his cell phone early the next morning and he was walking up the block toward my house on the beach. There was silence. I said, ""Kris, are you there? What's up?"" No response. Again I repeated, ""What's up?"" Silence. ""Are you there?"" Finally he said, ""It's gone, it's gone ... your house, your house -- it's gone."" When the cruise ended, four days later, my friend Dave picked me up at the airport. He had saved my car by moving it out of my garage to higher ground. The trip back from the airport was a journey into a world of disbelief. The bridges to Rockaway were closed and in the small towns we drove through along the peninsula, the devastation was mind-boggling -- sand and debris everywhere, trees uprooted, houses destroyed, entire blocks burnt to the ground. When we finally reached my street, I saw something I will never forget: I didn't have a house anymore. No home, just a pile of rubble -- no driveway, no landscaping, no foundation. It looked like it had been bombed. At that moment reality ceased to exist. The mundane facts of everyday life hit me. Most immediately, where would I sleep? Where are my clothes? My bed? My socks, my eyeglasses, family treasures, boyhood photographs -- the pictures my grandchildren would never see of their great-grandfather and great-grandmother? Major decisions had to be made, and with much difficulty, I tried to gather my thoughts. I had to find a place to stay. Thank God my car was safe so I could get around. For three months I lived in a hotel room in Staten Island -- dealing with FEMA, having seemingly constant, endless conversations with many different people. Finally, FEMA reimbursed me for the hotel room. The only clothes I had were in my suitcase, so I had to buy all the clothing essential for living in winter, and additional suits for my show. Because so many businesses were wiped out, dealing with work and life details became all-day fiascoes. At least I had the money to pay for all this -- people who didn't have were in deep trouble. Living in the hotel room became a strain, and I felt very hopeless. It became important to return to my roots, to the place I was connected to deeply for 40 years. But searching for and finding a rental property in Rockaway was almost impossible; most of the houses were in bad disrepair and many had significant mold problems. Luckily, I finally found one that was mold free but empty, so I rented beds, TVs, kitchen supplies, sofas, chairs -- the works -- to turn this rental into a home. Today, I'm still living in the rental house, trying to tie up all the loose ends left in the aftermath of the devastating storm -- problems like what to do with the remains of my old property and dealing with insurance companies and all the red tape that comes with that. A busy work schedule helps in returning to sense of normalcy. And one night, fans surprised me with a presentation of many old recordings and memorabilia. I was so grateful. Many of us in Rockaway are still waiting to see what the new flood and homeowner's insurance rates and building codes will be, biding our time before making any future plans. But my spirit is intact and life must go on. It's funny how in life obstacles are put in front of us -- but they are there for a reason. We learn to climb over them, no matter how difficult, to eventually get to the other side.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian center-left politician Enrico Letta has fully accepted a mandate to form a government, he told reporters Saturday. Letta made the announcement after meeting with President Giorgio Napolitano, who had given him that mandate on Wednesday. The 46-year-old former deputy prime minister and his ministers will be sworn in on Sunday at 11:30 a.m., the presidential palace said. Parliament is expected to confirm his government through a vote of confidence on Monday. Letta's acceptance of the leadership role is expected to limit the uncertainty that has gripped the nation since February, when elections left none of the candidates with enough support to form a government. He gave reporters a list of his 18 ministers, two of whom are members of the center-right People of Freedom Party led by three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Three of the ministers are holdovers from the government of Mario Monti, the outgoing prime minister. Nearly all the others are members of Letta's Democratic Party or people close to it. Letta had accepted Napolitano's request to take the job with reservations . Napolitano, 87, was re-elected by Italy's Parliament on Saturday to an unprecedented second term as president. February's general election resulted in a three-way split among the right, the left and a wild-card party. Letta said this week that the most important step would be to tackle the country's 11.6% unemployment rate, which has pushed many young Italians to leave the country. The second most pressing issue facing Italy is the need for political reform, he said. Constitutional changes are needed to reduce the number of members of parliament and fix an electoral system that has kept the country locked in a political stalemate it can't afford, he said. ""We need to do this together with the largest participation possible,"" he said. He also said the European Union's policy of austerity needs to change.","Enrico Letta is to be sworn in as prime minister Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Are you worried that millionaires don't have enough influence in our elections? If you can't contribute more than $123,000 to politicians, are your free speech rights harmed? At least 99% of Americans would laugh at the absurdity of these questions, but not Shaun McCutcheon, an Alabama political donor. McCutcheon v. FEC, his court challenge to the $123,200 aggregate contribution limit, has made it all the way to the Supreme Court, where it will be heard on October 8. Aggregate limits -- or the total someone can contribute to federal candidates and committees each two-year election cycle -- was previously before the Supreme Court. In Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Supreme Court found the limits constitutional because they prevent corruption of federal officeholders and government decisions. The court wrote, ""But this quite modest restraint upon protected political activity serves to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise contribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate"" through ""contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate, or huge contributions to the candidate's political party."" Now, especially after throwing out a century's worth of law approving restrictions on corporate campaign expenditures in rulings, including Citizens United, one would expect the Supreme Court to leave some of its campaign finance precedents intact. With this challenge to another longstanding law, the court will have its chance. One argument advanced by McCutcheon's supporters is that because the Citizens United decision unleashed millions of dollars in independent electoral spending, much of it from anonymous sources, the role of political parties has been diminished to the detriment of our political system. That's hogwash. McCutcheon supporters propose throwing out aggregate limits so the parties can raise more than $1 million from a single contributor. Eliminating the aggregate limits would only invite more political corruption. First, it would provide another advantage for the tiny fraction of Americans who have the means to give so lavishly. In 2012, only four out of 1,000 Americans made political contributions of $200 or more, and the proportion of Americans who give the maximum amount of contributions allowed under federal law is much smaller. By way of perspective, McCutcheon challenges a contribution cap for individuals of $123,200 -- or more than twice the $51,017 the average American family earns a year before taxes. Eliminating this ""quite modest restraint"" would further empower the very few Americans who can afford to give such sums, and it would bring us pretty close to the definition of oligarchy. Second, the corruption that would arise from eliminating these limits is not hypothetical. The record presented to the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of McConnell v FEC -- the decision that upheld the McCain-Feingold campaign financing act -- confirmed that the parties can and do serve as conduits for huge donors seeking specific outcomes in Washington and state capitals across the country. Not only does the lower court record make clear that large contributions buy access and influence -- read the depositions of Sen. Warren Rudman, R-New Hampshire; Alan Simpson, R-Wyoming, and Paul Simon, D-Illinois -- but they also affect Senate action. For example, the court record shows that in 1996, during Senate consideration of an amendment to benefit Federal Express, Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, said a senior senator suggested to him that he support the amendment because ""they just gave us $100,000."" The record reports that a popular generic drug bill died in Congress in 2002, shortly after two Republican Party congressional committees held a large gala fundraiser to raise almost $30 million in contributions. Among the largest contributors to the gala were GlaxoSmithKline PLC, PhRMA , Pfizer, Eli Lilly & Co., Bayer AG and Merck & Co. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, summed up the problem this way: ""There's a terrible appearance when the Generic Drug Bill, which passes by 78 votes through the Senate, is not allowed to be brought up in the House shortly after a huge fundraiser with multimillion-dollar contributions from the pharmaceutical drug companies who are opposed to the legislation."" Third, allowing donors a direct route to funnel millions straight to parties and candidates will not stop the anonymous independent spending. These expenditures will persist because they offer distinct advantages: They allow donors to hide their identities from the public, and allow candidates to outsource the dirty work, like attack ads. If the Supreme Court sides with McCutcheon, all it will have done is open new routes for corruption without closing the old ones.

Authorities confirm they investigated a reported rape in July, that the alleged victim -- a 15-year-old girl with Down syndrome -- was taken to a hospital and evidence was collected, including a rape kit. Authorities also confirm that processing in the case was delayed in the days and weeks after the alleged incident. Despite questioning of a man identified by the girl's family and area residents as the suspect, no charges have been filed. On August 5 -- more than two weeks after the alleged rape was reported -- some residents of the Hubbard Farms neighborhood in southwestern Detroit decided they weren't going to wait for police and prosecutors to act. They recognized the man -- a resident of the area -- from handbills posted around the neighborhood that included the man's picture, and some residents went into action, chasing the man when he ran and hitting him with blows that including baseball bat strikes to the knees. While only a few residents took part in the beating, sentiment was strong that the man was a threat to the community and that police were not proceeding on the rape case, according to resident Angel Garza, also known by his artist name, Anjoe Block. ""It was way too long for (authorities) to do something. All we wanted to do was get him away from our neighborhood,"" said Garza, who did not participate in the incident involving the man, but told CNN he knew people who did. Garza, an artist, had taken to Facebook to grab community attention, posting online the neighborhood flier that identified the man by name and picture, and that said in all-capital letters the man ""HAS RAPED A YOUNG ... WOMAN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ... PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS MAN IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS."" The physical condition and whereabouts of the man, who had been arrested and released by police before the beating, could not be determined Tuesday. He has not been charged Tuesday. The 15-year-old alleged victim is with her family and is getting support from relatives and neighbors, according to a family friend. The Wayne County prosecutor's office confirmed that the alleged rape was reported to police on July 17. Police sent crews to the crime scene and took in evidence. But then processing of the rape kit was delayed, according to Jerome Warfield, a member of Detroit's civilian commission that oversees police. Detroit police e-mails reveals weight, bra sizes of female officers . The community learned of the incident from a family member's post on the community list-serve. An e-mail by the relative of the alleged victim outlined the incident, gave purported details about the man, and told how the family tried to contact police. Police issued an arrest warrant request on July 30, 13 days after the alleged rape, according to the Wayne County prosecutor's office. The man named on the neighborhood flier was taken into custody and questioned, but police could not formally charge him because the prosecutor's office didn't sign off on the warrant, according to Warfield. The man was then released. A few days later, the beating occurred. People in the community simply believe that law enforcement is not acting in any expedient way in the case, according to Garza. A spokesman for the Detroit Police Department told CNN this week, ""We are aware of the situation."" ""This is an ongoing investigation. We cannot confirm any details,"" said Sgt. Eren Stephens of the department's public information office. Not everyone in the community approves of the vigilante action. ""So it's OK to take the law into your own hands?"" said one user on the community forum on Facebook. ""And the people who beat him up weren't arrested?"" ""When are they going to arrest the people that beat him like they did,"" said another user on the forum. ""They are every bit as guilty as they believe he is."" According to a case record in the Wayne County Probate Court, the man is 43 years old and described as ""an individual with a developmental disability."" ""Because the victim and suspect, being significantly handicapped, there are rules and guidelines that we have to follow that we cannot treat the situation as a normal assault,"" said Police Commissioner Warfield. ""To that end, there is special questioning and steps to go through to make sure that their rights are protected. We are mandated by American Disabilities Act to take special precaution. That process can go a little bit slower."" According to Warfield, the processing of the rape kit was delayed some seven to 10 days for unknown reasons. ""If there was anything that the police could have done better, it would've been issuing the rape kit more quickly,"" said Warfield. Detroit files for bankruptcy . Following the beating of the man last week, vandals painted the word RAPIST in large letters five times on an apartment building, just below the man's unit, Warfield said. They broke in and ransacked the man's home, according to Warfield. ""I think people are hurt and scared, and certain people respond to that in an immediate and violent way,"" said Megan Heeres, a close friend and longtime neighbor of the 15-year-old and her family. ""But that's not the response the family wants."" Heeres said the family has been focusing on restorative justice more than anything, and helping the girl start living her life again. She said the victim is doing well with the support from her family. ""They want to see some changes from the Detroit Police Department. It hasn't been about vigilante justice. There should be a clear-cut process or protocol when responding to sexual assault to minors, so people can feel secure that there's movement (with their case),"" said Heeres. ""It's been such a tragedy,"" said John Van Camp, president of Southwest Solutions, an agency involved in neighborhood revitalization, counseling services, and economic development in the community. ""I've known the victim and family for many years. We provided as much support as we could. The fact that it's continuing to unfold is unfathomable."" Van Camp believes since the situation is still unfolding, all parties, including the 15-year-old girl, the people within the community and the man who was beaten, have now all become victims. Another police investigation is now under way for those responsible for beating the man and breaking into the home, according to Warfield. No arrests have been made in the beating of the man and, ""He has not been seen,"" according to Garza. ""We do understand that the neighbors were enraged,"" said Warfield. ""Detroit police understand how this is emotional. But vigilantism cannot be accepted when you're impeding upon somebody's rights.""

"New York (CNN) -- A fourth New Yorker is saying that he was targeted outside a New York City department store because of his race. Art Palmer, 56, of Brooklyn told CNN he was stopped by New York Police Department officers in April after he left the Macy's department store in Herald Square. He had two bags of merchandise on him -- about eight items total -- when, he said, police stopped him and searched both bags to see if his receipts matched what was in the bags. After being detained for about 10 minutes, Palmer said, police released him and told him he had been stopped because they had lost track of him on store surveillance cameras. Palmer said he has spoken to management at Macy's and officers at the NYPD midtown police precinct about the incident, and was told that the officers who stopped him outside the store were just doing their jobs. Palmer said that with the help of state Sen. Eric Adams, he has filed a complaint with the civilian review board. Macy's and the NYPD could not be reached for comment about the incident. The allegation of racial profiling comes after one other involving the same Macy's department store and two involving Barneys New York. HBO television actor Robert Brown said at a news conference this month that he was racially profiled at the Herald Square Macy's in June. Brown said at least three plainclothes officers stopped him, accused him of using a fraudulent credit card and detained him inside the store. Brown, star of HBO's ""Treme,"" has filed a lawsuit against the NYPD seeking yet-to-be-specified damages, he said. The NYPD did not respond to CNN's request for comment about Brown's claims. In an e-mail to CNN, Elina Kazan, vice president of media relations for Macy's, said the department store is investigating the allegations but does ""not comment on matters in litigation."" In a similar incident, Kayla Phillips, 21, told reporters last week that four plainclothes officers forcefully stopped her after she left Barneys with her purchase in February. She and Trayon Christian, 19, who said he also was racially profiled after purchasing a belt at Barneys in April, want damages from the store and the New York Police Department. Christian has filed a lawsuit. Phillips said that she had been eyeing a $2,500 orange suede Celine bag after a friend bought one for his mother. After showing the cashier her ID, Phillips said, she paid at a register and left the store with the item in a Barneys bag. She walked out of the Madison Avenue store to 59th Street, where the officers stopped her, she said. ""I was attacked,"" Phillips said. The officers -- three male and one female -- questioned her, she said. ""How did you buy this bag, where did you get the money from?"" the female officer asked her, Phillips said. Phillips showed them her debit card, which the female officer took and showed to her partners, bending and examining it, she said. After verifying Phillips' purchase and returning her card, the officers let her go and did not apologize, she said. In a prepared statement, Mark Lee, CEO of Barneys New York, said ""no customer should have the unacceptable experience described in recent media reports, and we offer our sincere regret and deepest apologies."" ""We want to reinforce that Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination. Our mission is to ensure that all customers receive the highest-quality service -- without exception,"" he said. Speaking to the claims by Christian, the company said no employee was involved ""in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale."" In a statement, the New York Police Department said, ""We are investigating the allegation."" The department directed CNN to its legal department. Kareem Vessup, Phillips' attorney, said an impending lawsuit could seek $5 million in punitive damages, but the exact amount is still undetermined. He said both Barneys and the NYPD should reevaluate their practices on ""shop and frisk."" ""There's a call for change,"" Vessup said. ""How long had this been going on? Who else may have been affected by this practice?"" Christian, a New York City College of Technology student, entered Barneys on April 29 to buy a Ferragamo belt he had seen rappers wear on television, his attorney, Michael Palillo, told CNN on Wednesday. Christian bought the belt, left the store and walked a block before two undercover police officers stopped him, Palillo said. When they saw the designer belt, they asked him how he was able to afford it, Palillo said. The officers allegedly accused him of purchasing the belt with a fraudulent card and said they had received a call from Barneys, according to Palillo. Christian said he was detained in a holding cell for two hours and interrogated, as police contacted Chase Bank to check his card, Palillo said. When they confirmed that his card was valid, police released Christian and apologized, Palillo said. Rap mogul Jay-Z -- who has been thrust into the debate over alleged racial profiling at Barneys New York -- broke his silence Saturday, defending himself from critics who have insisted he break off his partnership with the department store over the allegations. The music icon and entrepreneur spoke in an online statement the day after Phillips, an African-American college student, made her allegations. Jay-Z has a fashion line that is set to sell at Barneys. A Change.org petition calling for him to end this collaboration had more than 13,000 signatures Saturday night. ""Right as Jay-Z prepares to roll out a new partnership with Barneys New York for the holiday shopping season, I've been disappointed to hear new allegations about how the retailer treats young black consumers,"" wrote the petition's creator, Derick Bowers of Brooklyn. The celebrity -- born Shawn Carter, who in addition to being a rapper runs restaurants, a sport agency and other ventures -- on Saturday issued a statement on his website that said he doesn't want to jump to conclusions without all the facts. He said proceeds from his partnership will benefit his charitable foundation, not him, and insisted, ""My idea was born out of creativity and charity ... not profit."" Bringing him into this debate, the rapper added, isn't fair -- especially since the truth hasn't been established in the racial profiling cases. ""Why am I being demonized, denounced and thrown on the cover of a newspaper for not speaking immediately?"" he wrote. ""The negligent, erroneous reports and attacks on my character, intentions, and the spirit of this collaboration have forced me into a statement I didn't want to make without the full facts."" He added that he and his team are working ""to get to the bottom of these incidents and at the same time find a solution that doesn't harm all those that stand to benefit from this collaboration."" ""I am against discrimination of any kind, but if I make snap judgments, no matter who it's towards, aren't I committing the same sin as someone who profiles?"" he said. ""I am no stranger to being profiled and I truly empathize with anyone that has been put in that position. Hopefully this brings forth a dialogue to effect real change.""

"(CNN) -- The search for the missing crew members from a North Sea cargo ship collision has been called off Thursday afternoon, the Netherlands Coast Guard said in a statement. The search will not be resuming and passing ships have been told to be on the lookout, the Netherlands Coast Guard said. At least four people are dead and seven others missing after a container vessel collided with a car carrier Wednesday evening, the Netherlands Coast Guard said. The carrier Baltic Ace began sinking immediately after it collided with the container vessel in a busy shipping lane, about 60 kilometers (32 miles) west of Rotterdam, according to Coast Guard spokesman Peter Verburg. Thirteen crew members were rescued and taken to hospitals in Rotterdam and at the Koksijde Air Base near Ostend, Belgium. Those rescued were suffering from hypothermia and minor injuries, the spokesman said. The nationality of the crew was not immediately known. The Baltic Ace had been en route from Zeebrugge, Belgium, to Kotka, Finland; the container vessel was en route from Grangemouth, Britain, to Antwerp, Belgium.","NEW: Search is called off for crew members missing after a ship collision Wednesday evening .

"(CNN) -- You're wiped out, eating too much, your chest feels funny when you climb stairs, sex isn't working well, you can't wait for a drink and your spouse is looking at you warily. But you just bought health insurance online from a health exchange. Now, before you head for an ER, if only you could find a doctor... Primary care doctors -- the pediatricians, family doctors and internists who constitute the foundation of our medical system -- are also in trouble. Over quite a few years now, their numbers and accessibility have fallen. So it's important to consider the likely impact on these frontline doctors when the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, goes into full effect. Could Obamacare help turn this trend around? One thing is for sure. Obamacare has already accomplished something remarkable: No longer can previous illness or risk for future illness prevent an individual from obtaining health insurance. But as the new health exchanges offer affordable insurance to more and more Americans, there is risk that a flood of new patients may overwhelm the already-besieged primary care work force. The ACA incentivizes doctors, including specialists, to join and collaborate in ""accountable care organizations"" that contract with insurers to take responsibility for a defined population of patients. The goals are to contain costs, reward high quality care and help health professionals take care of more patients. The idea is also to move away from today's ""fee schedules"" that pay doctors and hospitals far more for cardiac catheterizations or surgeries than for treatments with medications that may be just as effective. Such ""perverse incentives"" can lead to low quality care and high cost. But the devil is in the details, and Obamacare doesn't have clear answers to some difficult problems. Primary care doctors worry about measuring quality of care properly and rewarding different types of practice fairly, especially since the enormous disparities in income among doctors create resentments in the medical community. Some of the challenges ahead include: . How to measure quality . Techniques for measuring quality are improving, but there's a long road ahead before doctors agree on their scientific validity, particularly when quality scores may affect their income. How do you grade care for patients with hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol levels? Numbers such as blood pressures, sugar or lipid levels tell only part of the story for individuals whose genes, cultural habits, psyches and social circumstances vary widely. Researchers are working hard to develop strong and replicable measures to measure quality, but this remains an enormous challenge. How to pay for different groups of patients fairly . Every practice cares for a different mix of the healthy and the sick. Those who are ill consume more time and resources from doctors. Unfortunately, we don't yet have good techniques for adjusting compensation fairly for different mixes of patients. Payers don't really know how to compare the work of doctors caring for many sick patients, as opposed to those managing individuals who are generally well. Income disparity among doctors . While doctors overall make far more money than most Americans, the ACA is unlikely to fix the extraordinary imbalance in incomes between primary care doctors and doctors who are subspecialists, particularly those who perform skilled procedures such as operations or colonoscopies. An equally skilled primary care doctor may spend hours helping a patient address the intertwined effects of diabetes, economic hardship and depression, but for that she or he is still paid far less than the surgeon who fixes a hernia or the dermatologist who removes an unsightly mole. That certainly doesn't raise the likelihood that students who graduate from medical school with enormous debt will choose primary care as a career. Bureaucratic burdens . In part because of ridiculous bureaucratic requirements for paperwork and documentation, primary care doctors have so little time for their patients that they all too often shunt them off unnecessarily to specialists. Recent data suggest that of all the money paid for outpatient care, 75% goes to specialists and only 25% to primary care doctors, a ratio that's certainly a factor in the high cost of care overall. Nevertheless, those in primary care, and especially young doctors considering careers in this complex and stimulating field, should take heart. Obamacare is supporting exciting new initiatives and pilot programs and spurring innovations that offer opportunities to make primary care more personal, more humane and more rewarding. Keep an eye out for the following: . -- Growing benefits from electronic health records that over time will provide the foundation for vital improvements to our health care system, including remote access to records when a patient needs care far from home, and better real-time coordination among everyone involved in a patient's care. -- Communication between doctors and patients that is more transparent, bolsters patient safety and leads to improved clinical outcomes by involving patients (and often their families) more actively in their own care. (My particular obsession is to invite patients to read the notes we write, to share those notes with others and to join us in shaping their care collaboratively). Opinion: Find out what your doctor really thinks about you . -- New technologies and delivery systems that promote care in the home, such as video visits with doctors or nurses, and automated monitoring of glucose levels, heart rhythms or blood pressures, along with many new tools supporting self-care. -- Watch out for the evolution of ""patient-centered medical homes"" where teams of primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, mental health professionals, case workers, family caregivers, community-based patient navigators, volunteers and others who bring additional expertise to patient care work together to increase both the quality and efficiency of care. The signs are promising for many of these new tools. At times, the path toward a better and more equitable health care system may feel slow and treacherous, but we should be hopeful. Nationally and at my medical school, we're beginning to see more young health professionals turning toward careers in primary care. I think the tide is turning. I believe that Obamacare is delivering a child whose tentative steps and inevitable stumbles will be followed by strong strides forward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Delbanco.","Tom Delbanco: The number of primary care doctors has fallen in the past few years .

"(CNN) -- Marvel's upcoming ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" is one of fall TV's most anticipated new shows. The cast and producers were on hand at Comic-Con to preview the series, which was created by ""The Avengers"" director Joss Whedon and will premiere on ABC on September 24. Those who attended the panel were treated to far more than just a teaser; the entire premiere episode was screened for the hall of fans, who gave the episode a standing ovation during the credits. The series follows Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee who seemingly died at the hands of villain Loki in the ""Avengers"" movie. However, it's revealed his death was faked, and he now heads the team that appears in this TV series. ""I didn't like being dead,"" Gregg said. ""But I really loved my death. I never thought anything could top that. I'm a longtime Marvel fan, so I just can't believe this is happening to me. I got a call from Marvel saying, 'You really do have a big part in ""The Avengers."" It's what happens to you that brings them together.' It was so amazing what Joss did and wrote. It was the greatest thing I'd done, and I was really pleased and proud."" ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" (Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division) extends the world created in the recent Marvel films, including ""The Avengers,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""Thor"" and ""Captain America."" While Whedon wouldn't confirm whether those characters show up on the program, he didn't rule out the possibility either. ""We may see some people [from the films] and we may see some people from the Marvel universe who are not cinematic,"" Whedon said. ""But the most important thing is that we get to see these people who are here every week. So probably (some of those characters will appear), but I can't say when because that would spoil it."" The show will introduce several new actors, and the producers see ""S.H.I.E..L.D."" as a true team effort. Agent Maria Hill (Colbie Smulders) is in the pilot episode, newcomer Brett Dalton plays Agent Grant Ward while Chloe Bennet plays a mysterious character named Skye whose true intentions come to light in the pilot. ""I have that feeling that I have not had for a long time where I have assembled this extraordinary ensemble of talented and soon-to-be very full of themselves people,"" Whedon said. ""The endless possibilities we have between them and among them and in their pasts and in their futures and their interactions. There's stuff we've taken from the Marvel universe, stuff we're bringing to the Marvel universe.

"(CNN) -- Metallica appeared at Comic-Con in San Diego on Friday to promote their upcoming 3-D IMAX concert film ""Metallica Through the Never."" The band debuted footage from the movie to a crowd of fans in the Convention Center's Hall H and later rocked an intimate crowd at a secret show. ""Metallica Through the Never"" was directed by Nimrod Antal (""Predators"") and intersperses live Metallica concert footage with a fictional narrative about a young roadie named Trip who is sent on a mission during the show. Actor Dane DeHaan (""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"") plays Trip in the film. There is a distinct storyline woven through the concert footage, but singer/guitarist James Hetfield confirmed that there is no dialogue involved. The front man wouldn't elaborate on the plot any further, but did say that a lot of thought went into creating the exact right film for Metallica. ""People have done live concerts,"" Hetfield told CNN before the band's Comic-Con panel. ""We've done live concerts and DVDs. If we're going to invest a lot of time and money and effort into something, let's make it unique. That's what we've always done. We had a ton of ideas for this thing. You get really creative with something way out of your budget and then you shrink it down. Some of the best ideas hang on and end up in the film. We wanted animation, we wanted CGI -- you name it! But I think the narrative is extremely potent and multilayered. There's a lot of dynamics going on at once. It's a couple movies in one.""

The actual concert footage showcases a massive stage with extensive visual effects, including pyrotechnics. Hetfield hinted during the panel that Metallica may eventually bring that stage setup on tour.

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo warmed up for Saturday's El Clasico by firing Real Madrid to victory over Juventus in the European Champions League. Ronaldo scored twice as Real defeated the Italian champion 2-1 at the Bernabeu to make it three wins out of three in Group B. The Portuguese star has now scored seven goals in this season's competition, netting either side of a Fernando Llorente strike to seal the points. ""We have taken a very important step towards securing qualification,"" Real captain Iker Casillas told reporters. ""It wasn't easy but we have taken the first step, getting nine points from three matches. We have to go to Turin now and at least avoid defeat."" Juventus now finds itself in danger of being eliminated at the Group Stage after taking just two points from its opening three games. Its case was not helped by Turkish side Galatasaray, which defeated FC Copenhagen 3-1 to move up to second in the group. Real, which is currently third in La Liga, will now travel to Barcelona with the mission of inflicting a first league defeat of the season on its arch rival. Coach Carlo Ancelotti could even give $138 million signing Gareth Bale a place in the team after the Wales international made a cameo appearance as a substitute following his recovery from a thigh injury. ""He came on when the match has lost its intensity,"" Ancelotti said at a news conference. ""That didn't help him play better but it was important for him to get some time on the pitch,"" added the Italian. ""I think now he is ready to start a match."" While Ronaldo stole the show in the Spanish capital, it was Zlatan Ibrahimovic who lit up Brussels with a four-goal salvo. The Swede, who is set to come up against Ronaldo in the World Cup playoff, scored a hat-trick inside 19 minutes as Paris Saint-Germain crushed Anderlecht 5-0. Ibrahimovic added a fourth on 62 minutes to take his tally to nine in his past four appearances. Edinson Cavani added a fifth as PSG underlined its credentials as serious challengers. ""It was a really good game with plenty of positives all over the pitch. It was the perfect match,"" declared PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""Ibrahimovic's four goals were exceptional. It is difficult to say which was the best. ""Winning the Champions League would be a dream for all the players and the board. But it is a difficult objective.

Defending champion Bayern Munich eased to a 5-0 win over Czech side Viktoria Plzen to maintain its perfect start to the competition. Franck Ribery scored twice, while there were also goals for David Alaba, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Gotze. ""I am happy with the performance of the players,"" Bayern boss Pep Guardiola told reporters. ""I believe that in the European matches this season, including the Super Cup win over Chelsea, we have played well but in the Bundesliga it has taken us longer to click into gear and perhaps we need more time.""

Manchester United claimed a vital 1-0 win over Real Sociedad at Old Trafford thanks an own goal by Inigo Martinez. The home side wasted several other chances to increase their lead while the visiting side struck the crossbar through Antoine Griezmann. ""I thought we played well tonight.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 29 people were killed and more than 120 others wounded in a dozen car bomb explosions in Baghdad and Kirkuk on Wednesday, police said. In Baghdad, 10 car bombs exploded in the predominately Shiite neighborhoods, killing 24 people and wounding 110 others Wednesday evening. The 10 car bombs exploded within two hours in the Baghdad communities of Kadhimiyah, Sadr City, Saidiya, Mashtal, Baghdad al-Jadida, Al-Husseiniyah and Zafraniyah. Two car bombs exploded in the oil-rich and ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk, about 240 kilometers (149 miles) north of Baghdad. The blasts killed five people and wounded 10 others Wednesday morning, police said. These attacks came amid growing tensions between Sunnis and Shiites, especially after an incident in Hawija in Kirkuk province, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. A clash between security forces and gunmen last month killed at least 50 people and wounded more than 85 others. Sunnis, who comprise a minority of Iraqis, had clout during the Saddam Hussein era but have been politically marginalized since his overthrow. Shiites, who make up a majority of Iraqis, now dominate the government. Since December, tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of predominately Sunni provinces -- including Anbar, Nineveh, Salaheddin and Diyala -- demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Such turnouts include protests at al-Atisam Square in Hawija. More people died violently in Iraq in April than in any other month since June 2008, the United Nations said. A total of 712 people died and 1,633 more sustained injuries ""in acts of terrorism and acts of violence,"" the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq said. Civilians made up most of the fatalities, 595 in total. They were also the vast majority of injured, numbering 1,438. Baghdad saw the most deaths with 697 fatalities. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Ten car bombs in Baghdad explode within two hours, killing 24 people .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius will go on trial on March 3, accused of premeditated murder in the death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. At a hearing Monday, prosecutors indicted Pistorius in the Valentine's Day shooting death. Pistorius has been charged with planned and premeditated murder, which comes with a mandatory sentence of life behind bars. The indictment says ""the accused did unlawfully and intentionally kill a person."" Pistorius also was indicted for allegedly violating South Africa's firearms control act. In South Africa, people can possess ammunition only if they're licensed to own a gun, and their ammunition must be specific to that weapon. Pistorius has acknowledged storing ammunition for a gun his father owned. Steenkamp would have turned 30 on Monday. The indictment follows the completion of the police investigation into the case. The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life in his home. He denies the murder charge and says he mistook her for a home invader. The first phase of the trial will take place in March, but the entire trial could take place at various times across a year or more because of potential motions and postponements along the way. In the indictment, the prosecutors included a list of more than 100 witnesses the state might call. The Pistorius legal team has not released a witness list. The police investigation team ""is convinced that the accused has a charge to answer,"" a police statement said last week. A tearful Pistorius . A phalanx of reporters snapped pictures of an emotional Pistorius as he entered the courtroom Monday. While the Olympic sprinter largely maintained his composure, an occasional tear streamed down his cheek. Before the proceedings started, he held hands with his brother and sister as they appeared to pray. The athlete's family said in June that he would resume running using his blade-shaped prosthetic legs. Pistorius has started sprinting again for the sake of his emotional health, not for training to compete again, the family said. Michael Steenkamp, the victim's uncle, said the model's family isn't focusing on Pistorius' guilt or innocence, and they will not attend any of the related court proceedings. The family said it would be spending time together remembering Steenkamp on Monday. ""My wife and myself are going up to (see) my brother in Port Elizabeth, and we will be there with (Steenkamp's parents) on Monday to be there for Reeva's birthday. What could we do? Bake a cake and, you know, sit down quietly and reminisce about the qualities of Reeva's life,"" he said. The uncle said his faith has helped him forgive Pistorius. ""If I can't forgive him, and I have been forgiven, then that is our sin. And I very much asked the Lord to guide me before I got to Port Elizabeth when the tragedy happened ... that took a lot of pressure off my shoulders,"" he said. Steenkamp's uncle: I forgive Oscar Pistorius . CNN's Kelly Phelps, Joseph Netto and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","Oscar Pistorius is indicted in a Valentine's Day shooting death .

"(CNN) -- Pfc. Bradley Manning is one of the biggest whistle-blowers in U.S. history, and his case is one of the Obama administration's unprecedented seven prosecutions against national security and intelligence whistleblowers. His disclosures to WikiLeaks revealed war crimes and torture -- topics that are surely in the public's interest to know. The fact that the mainstream media around the world reprinted the bulk of his disclosures is evidence of the clear value in knowing what our government is doing. Manning was sentenced to 35 years, but should have been sentenced to time served already: 3Â½ years, 112 days of which was improper pretrial detention, also known as torture. He suffered prolonged solitary confinement and was forced to be naked. Manning's trial was sparsely covered by the mainsteam media. The alternative media outlets who did cover the story comprehensively were faced with unprecedented secrecy, so much so that for months of pretrial proceedings, none of the court pleadings was publicly available. America should be better than secret courts and the criminalization of whistleblowing. The military prosecutors asked the judge to lock Manning up for 60 years in order to ""send a message."" Sending a message has everything to do with politics and nothing to do with justice. Although it was not the 60 years that the government asked for, Manning's 35-year sentence is still clearly intended to send a message for his conduct -- conduct that provided the public with evidence of clear wrongdoing and did no harm to the United States. The wrongdoers whose crimes Manning exposed enjoyed far gentler fates. Like Manning, my whistleblower clients, former National Security Agency executive Thomas Drake, who exposed warrantless wiretapping; and former CIA officer John Kiriakou, who exposed his agency's use of torture, were charged under the Espionage Act. Unlike Manning, they were not convicted under that act, although Kiriakou is serving out a 30-month prison sentence. As in Manning's case, the only person to be truly punished was the whistleblower. Drake and Kiriakou helped expose two of the biggest scandals of the post-9/11 era, yet they are the only two people criminally prosecuted in connection with them. The message is clear: It is safer for a government employee to violate the Fourth Amendment or to torture detainees or to gun down apparent civilians, as seen in the ""Collateral Murder"" video that Manning released to WikiLeaks. (That classified video shows a United States Apache helicopter firing on a group of people in New Baghdad in 2007 who do not return fire. Two of those killed were Reuters' employees; two children were severely injured. An Army investigation found the crew followed the rules of engagement). Manning's harsh sentence and the government's despotic desire to ""send a message"" represents yet another dismal step toward secrecy from a presidential administration that once pledged to be the ""most transparent in history."" The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Jesselyn Radack and Kathleen McClellan.","Writers: Pfc. Bradley Manning is one of the biggest whistleblowers in U.S. history .

"(CNN) -- An 18th century American slave finally received a proper burial Thursday, more than 200 years after his death, according to organizers of the service. The remains of Fortune, an African-American slave who died in 1798, lay in state in the Connecticut State Capitol rotunda in Hartford on Thursday before state police escorted them to a memorial service at the same church where he was baptized, according to Bob Burns, Director of the Mattatuck Museum, which had housed the skeleton since 1933. He was interred in one of the most well-known and distinguished cemeteries in Waterbury afterward. A ceremony at the Capitol included bagpipers and the singing of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic,"" according to Samaia Hernandez, a spokeswoman for Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's office. ""Fortune was a Waterbury man who worked, lived and died in our state at a time when African-Americans were denied basic civil rights. After 215 years, he will finally be laid to rest,"" Malloy said. ""While we can't undo the wrongs of the past, we can honor those who were affected and push for positive change in the future."" A memorial service was held at St. John's Episcopal Church in Waterbury, where according to records, Fortune was baptized in 1797, Burns said. A burial at Riverside Cemetery, a historic cemetery full of prominent Waterbury residents, followed the service. Fortune, his wife and their three children were the legal property of Dr. Preserved Porter, a Waterbury physician, according to the Mattatuck Museum. Shortly after Fortune's death in 1798, his children were sold off, and Porter, a bone surgeon, dissected Fortune's body and prepared his bones to keep his skeleton for anatomic study. Burns said Fortune's skeleton was passed down in the Porter family for generations before it was donated to the museum as an oddity. It remained there until the 1970s, when it was put into storage. Since the 1990s, Burns said the museum and the African-American History Project have worked to find out what they could about Fortune's life and death from his remains and ultimately lay the bones to rest. Scientists at Howard University and later Quinnipiac University X-rayed and examined the skeleton. ""His rugged bone structure suggests that he was powerful man accustomed to rigorous farm work,"" said Quinnipiac University researchers after performing X-rays in 2010. ""If you look his bones, you can tell he did not have an easy life,"" Professor Gerald Conlogue, co-director of Quinnipiac's Bioanthropology Research Institute, said at the time. The other goal of the researchers was to use a 3D scanning camera to create 3D images used to make 3D prints of the bones, allowing future researchers to continue studying the bones and while Fortune's remains are buried, according to Burns. ""That allowed us to honor the humanity of Mr. Fortune, and put him to rest,"" he said. According to the museum, Fortune may have died from a snapped vertebrae at the top of his spinal column. According to the official historic record, Fortune fell into the Naugatuck River and drowned at around age 55.","Fortune, an 18th century slave in Connecticut, was laid to rest after a funeral .

"(CNN) -- Federal agents say they've now linked 11 killings to admitted serial killer Israel Keyes and are looking into possible ties to killings in other countries. Keyes killed himself in December, about nine months after his arrest in the slaying of an Anchorage, Alaska, coffee barista. Police said he admitted to at least seven other slayings, from Vermont to Washington state, before his death. In a statement issued Monday afternoon, the FBI office in Anchorage said agents have now added three more to that grim tally, based on his statements: . -- a pale-skinned woman in an older car, ""possibly having a wealthy grandmother"" -- one in which the victim was posed to make it look like the death had been an accident . -- one ""in Texas or a surrounding state"" that he had denied committing before his death. Travels abroad . They also asked the public to share any information they had regarding Keyes' travels in Canada, Mexico and Belize between 2001 and 2008. ""Keyes traveled internationally and it is unknown if he committed any homicides while outside of the United States,"" the FBI statement said. Keyes lived in upstate New York at one point and ""reported several trips to Montreal in which he sought out prostitutes"" and drove through western Canada on his way to Alaska, where he lived before his arrest. The FBI on Tuesday released a detailed interactive map of Keyes' travels dating back to 1997 in hopes that the information might spur tips. Pins on the map show Keyes' location on specific dates. For instance, from March 1, 2005: . ""Day canoe trip to unspecified location; spotted camping at location only accessible by boat - Washington state,"" the interactive says. The pin points to a mountainous region east of Seattle. In April and May of 2007, the pins put Keyes in specific locations in California, including ""Hotel reservation (Best Western) - Kettleman City, California. April 27 - 28, 2007,"" and ""Reservation (Safari West wildlife preserve) - Santa Rosa, California. May 3, 2007."" ""If we have a missing person identified in a particular area, we work closely with that local police department to either connect the person to Keyes or not,"" Jolene Goeden, FBI special agent in Anchorage, said in a statement accompanying the interactive. ""We have his DNA."" Videos of Keyes' interrogations are viewable on the FBI's website. 'A murder addict' An Anchorage police officer described Keyes as a kind of murder addict who hunted victims in remote locations like parks, campgrounds or hiking trails. An Army veteran and contractor, Keyes studied other serial killers but ""was very careful to say he had not patterned himself after any other serial killer,"" Detective Monique Doll said in December. No remorse . Keyes killed himself by slitting one of his wrists and strangling himself with bedding, police said. He left behind an extensive, four-page note that expressed no remorse nor offer any clues to other slayings. Investigators said he had ""a meticulous and organized approach to his crimes,"" stashing weapons, cash and items used to dispose of bodies in several locations to prepare for future crimes. Authorities have dug up two of those caches -- one in Eagle River, Alaska, outside Anchorage, and one near a reservoir in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. Keyes also said he robbed banks to finance his travels, and investigators have corroborated his role in two holdups, the FBI said. CNN's Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","Israel Keyes is believed to have killed 11 people before his death in December, the FBI says .

"(CNN) -- Last winter, the Chicago Crime Commission and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration named Mexican billionaire Guzman Loera the city's ""Public Enemy No. 1."" Also known as ""Shorty,"" Guzman heads the world's largest narcotics operation, the infamous Sinaloa cartel, and allegedly pushes 1,500 to 2,000 kilograms of cocaine through Chicago each month. The commission's executive vice president, Arthur Bilek, said ""because of the direct link between the violence of the street gangs and the narcotics business, it can be said that Guzman's fingerprints are on the guns used in many of the shootings plaguing Chicago today."" We don't know if Guzman has ever been in Chicago, but The New York Times magazine reported he calls Chicago his cartel's ""home port."" The head of the city's DEA's office, Jack Riley, says the Sinaloa cartel causes so much havoc in Chicago that Guzman deserves the title. The only other time Chicago police took the step of designating a Public Enemy No. 1 was in 1930, when it targeted Al Capone. The gangster used the city as the hub for his various illegal activities, and authorized violent crimes to enforce his rule. Yet when law enforcement managed to put Capone behind bars, it wasn't for his brutal acts. The only serious offense they could make stick was Capone's income tax evasion.

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal airport screener has been charged with sexual assault after he allegedly assaulted a woman near his home in Manassas, Virginia, police said Tuesday. Police said Harold Glenn Rodman, 52, was wearing a uniform and displayed a badge at the time of the attack. Rodman is a Transportation Security Administration officer at Dulles International Airport, the TSA confirmed. He has been removed from security operations pending the investigation. According to Prince William County, Virginia, police, a 37-year-old woman and her friend were walking in a Manassas neighborhood when a man who was unknown to them approached, displayed a badge and then sexually assaulted the woman before fleeing on foot. Police responded to a call at 3:25 a.m. Sunday and, while canvassing the neighborhood, noticed a man matching the attacker's description exit his home, police said. The man was arrested in connection with the incident, police said. Rodman is charged with abduction with intent to defile, aggravated sexual assault, forcible sodomy and object sexual penetration. A TSA spokesman said the TSA is working closely with police on the case. ""TSA holds its personnel to the highest professional and ethical standards, and investigates all allegations of misconduct,"" TSA spokesman Greg Soule said.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Sala saunters in the red soil, her wrinkled skin glistening in the sun as she tries to keep up with the rest of the herd. It is hard to believe the 6-week-old, dwarfed by her human keeper, will grow up to be one of nature's biggest beasts. Until then, she lives at a Nairobi orphanage that takes in baby elephants struggling to survive. There, she walks around in the lush wilderness with her peers, drinks soy milk and waves her trunk playfully as her keeper applies sunscreen on her delicate skin. A red garment tied around her back keeps it safe from the sun's glare. Sala is one of scores of animals orphaned by drought, poaching and shrinking habitats, which have decimated wildlife across Kenya. The baby elephant was found wandering, alone and confused, after her mother died of starvation, her caretaker said. Conservation groups such as the David Sheldrick Foundation, where Sala is, have seen an influx of wildlife. The foundation takes in orphaned elephants and rhinos from across the country, a popular tourist destination because of its animals. ""You know if a human child came in need of care, you wouldn't put a bullet in or turn it away,"" said Daphne Sheldrick of the foundation. ""Elephants are the same. ... Whatever comes in, we have to make space."" The facility has more than 20 elephants in Nairobi and more at another center in Tsavo National Park, where they are also rehabilitated. Kenya depends on tourism as a main source of income. Sala taps into that to help earn the $900 monthly cost for her upkeep. She slushes and slides in a mud bath for throngs of tourists and uses her trunk to nudge the only other person she dwarfs -- a squirming toddler. Sala and the other animals will be released back into the wilderness when they are old enough, which takes years. Long after they are gone, their caretakers will still worry about the fragile animals they help nurture. ""After working with these elephants, it's no longer just a job,"" said Edwin Lusichi, the chief keeper. ""It is from inside your heart, the love that you have for these animals.""","Conservation groups have seen an influx of wildlife .

"(CNN) -- When two small caskets gradually descend into the ground Thursday in Atlanta, it may begin to sink into their father's head that his children are gone. It hasn't so far. As Mark Edge has cried over them, he has felt their presence at his side. Police recovered their bodies in a Santa Ana, California, hotel room nearly two weeks ago. Their mother poisoned them, authorities allege. Jaelen was 13, Faith was 10. A custody battle that raged around them for years had just been settled. Edge was supposed to be packing up their books and pencils back in Cobb County, Georgia, making their breakfast, and getting them off to school about now. Earlier this month, a Georgia court ordered his ex-wife Marilyn Edge to hand them over to him. But it seems she wasn't going to let him have them. Mark Edge's lawyer Marian Weeks had a feeling his ex would split town by how she behaved when the custody ruling came down. When the judge awarded custody of the children to the father in early September, their mother made an abrupt exit, Weeks told CNN affiliate WSB. ""When Judge Leonard was giving his order on Wednesday afternoon, she got up and left the courtroom in the middle of it,"" she said. Weeks told her client that she thought Marilyn Edge might flee to California, where she used to live. It wasn't the first time . She had bolted with them before, Mark Edge said. After her children's father received visitation rights a year ago, Marilyn Edge ran away with them to her native Arizona. ""But neither of us thought she'd kill the children,"" Weeks said. Police arrested Marilyn Edge not far from the hotel where Jaelen and Faith's lifeless bodies lay. She had rammed her car into poles protecting an electrical box in a Home Depot parking lot. Police think she was trying to kill herself. Orange County has charged her with two felony counts of special circumstance murder.  The special circumstances being multiple murders and murder by poisoning. She could spend the rest of her life in a state prison without parole if a court convicts her. Marilyn Edge is scheduled to enter a plea to the charges in a Santa Ana court on October 25. Indescribable pain . She had often used their children to hurt him, Mark Edge alleges. But finally they were going to live under his roof, and he was excited about that. ""I started doing all the preparations that I needed for my kids as far as trying to get them in school,"" he said. ""My mind was just on them."" Then the police appeared at his door. The news hurled him into a dark place. ""It hurt me so bad; I had a feeling that I never felt before. It was the total opposite of what I felt when they were born,"" he said. The pain was immense. He couldn't describe it in words. Edge checked himself into the Veteran's Administration hospital, his lawyer said. Facing his wife . Edge is still holding fast to his deceased son and daughter. He is together with them in God's hand, he says. And he is still doing things for them, imagines their future stretched out before him. He pictures his son going to his school prom. ""I don't see them as not being here with me right now. I see my children still here with me. When I sleep, I dream of my son, and I dream of my daughter."" Edge says he is strapped for cash. The Willie Watkins funeral home is taking donations to help pay for his children's funeral. And he is trying to raise funds on gofundme.com to pay for a trip to California, he told WSB. There, he may have to face his former wife again, at her murder trial. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","As he watches their burials, it may slowly sink in to Mark Edge that his children are dead .

"(CNN) -- A foul-smelling cloud wound its way through Argentina's capital Thursday, but it was not toxic as initially feared, officials said. Civil defense authorities in Buenos Aires advised residents to remain indoors with windows and doors shut as a cloud emanated from a container fire at the city's port. The smelly cloud and reports that the burning container had chemicals inside caused alarm throughout the capital. But it was quickly determined that the fumes were not dangerous. The container held sodium bicarbonate and posed little risk to the population, the country's security secretary, Sergio Berni, said.

I'd have given her the crown based on butt glue alone. Runner Up: Miss Kansas Theresa Vail, a tattooed army sergeant who sings opera but prefers to play Katniss. ""My original talent was going to be archery,"" she explained. ""I'm singing by default because there is a clause against projectile objects."" There is no clause against stealing our hearts, though.

Biggest Head-Scratcher: This fun fact, which flashed onscreen as Miss Georgia Carly Mathis sang ""On My Own"": ""Her dog has met the President."" Think they shook hands? Worst Judgment: ABC and the Miss America Organization determined that it was totally fair to ask the first finalist about Miley Cyrus, the second about scorned political wives... and the third whether she thinks the U.S. should intervene in Syria. One of those things: not like the others! Kudos to Miss California Crystal Lee for keeping her cool — and actually delivering a coherent answer to that absurdly tough question. Most Diplomatic: Miss Oklahoma Kelsey Griswold, who, for the record, believes that Miley's antics have been ""a little bit not super tasteful"" — but ""ha[s] to respect her creativity."" Most Skillful Non-Answer: As delivered by eventual winner Nina Davuluri, Miss New York. She was asked what message Julie Chen is sending by admitting that she's had plastic surgery on her eyes. Full transcript: ""Unfortunately, I don't agree with plastic surgery. However, I can understand that from a standpoint. But more importantly, I've always viewed Miss America as the girl next door, and the girl next door is evolving as the diversity in America evolves. She's not who she was 10 years ago, and she's not going to be the same person come 10 years down the road. So I wouldn't want to change someone's looks or appearance, but definitely be confident in who you are."" Clearest Foreshadowing: Miss New York and Miss California stood in front of a curtain decorated with the Miss America logo as they clutched hands, waiting to hear the panel's final verdict.

"(CNN) -- Two by two, the tandem skydivers leapt into the clouds over southern Mississippi, a routine plunge from thousands of feet in the air. James ""Jimmie"" Horak Jr. and his student were the last out of the plane Saturday morning. A videographer captured the moment when the veteran instructor opened his parachute, shifting a rapid freefall into a slow descent. But something tragic happened in the final seconds of the drop. Horak, 56, and his student never landed at the airport where they were supposed to. Instead, Horak's body was found in heavy mud in a swampy wooded area about a mile from the airport in Lumberton, Lamar County Sheriff Danny Rigel said. His student, a 26-year-old man whose name was not released, was in critical condition with broken bones and head injuries. It's unclear what went wrong. But based on evidence on the ground, Horak cut away the main parachute and deployed his backup, Gold Coast Skydivers owner Leanne Igo said. ""We just know that the main was cut away and the reserve was deployed,"" Igo said. ""Everything else beyond that is speculation."" Rigel said the others on the ride noticed there was some kind of equipment trouble, perhaps a problem with the lines. When the other students landed at the airport in Lumberton and noticed the pair weren't with them, they started a search that quickly included 30 skydivers on foot, a skydiving plane, a helicopter and local authorities, Igo said. The son of a nearby landowner eventually found Horak and the student while riding his Four Wheeler in the woods, she said. Horak and the student were so far inside the woods that ""there was no way anybody could spot them from overhead."" Deputies had to carry them out for a ""considerable distance"" to get them out of the woods, and the student was then airlifted to Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg, Rigel said. The Federal Aviation Administration will inspect the parachutes to determine if they were properly rigged by a qualified parachute rigger, and if the parachute operation was in compliance with federal regulations, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said Sunday. Local authorities will investigate the event and determine probable cause, she said. Horak's cause of death won't be known until after an autopsy, likely to take place Monday, Rigel said. A skydiving fan since the 1970s, Horak served with the Army Special Forces and was a pilot who also worked for the Veterans Administration as a physician's assistant, Igo said. ""Very professional, soft-spoken, kind-hearted, hard worker, a genuine person and highly experienced,"" she said of Horak. ""He had a wonderful wife and three children and everybody who ever met Jim never had anything ugly to say about him. He loved what he did."" Horak was also meticulous about safety, his friend and fellow skydiver Timber McKinney said. ""I've never met a more outstanding instructor in all my years of skydiving, 27 years now,"" McKinney told CNN affiliate WEAR. ""He really emphasized the safety side of it. He was about the fun side of it too, but he would definitely make sure that everyone that he touched understood the rules and that they follow them."" Horak was a safety and training advisor appointed by the U.S. Parachute Association, Igo said. Along with being a tandem instructor, he was a tandem examiner who trained other tandem instructors, she said. Woman on first date plunges to her death off 17th-floor balcony .

"(CNN) -- This week's New York premiere of Led Zeppelin's forthcoming concert film, ""Celebration Day,"" may have brought out both fans and rock stars, including Mick Jones, Stevie Nicks and Paul Stanley of Kiss, but beyond the 2007 reunion depicted on-screen, don't expect to see the legendary band in concert anytime soon. When asked at a press conference if there were any chance the band would play again together ""in the flesh,"" John Paul Jones said only, ""Sorry."" Jimmy Page suggested that ""if (in the five years since the movie was made,) there wasn't a whisper or a hint that we would get together to do something, it seems pretty unlikely, doesn't it?"" Jimmy Page on another Led Zeppelin reunion: 'I don't see it' But Robert Plant doesn't rule out the possibility entirely. ""We're pretty good at what we do, but the tail should never wag the dog,"" he said. ""If we're capable of doing something in our own time, that will be what will happen. We know what we've got. Que sera."" ""Celebration Day"" features a two-hour, 16-song set by surviving members of the iconic band, with John Bonham's son, Jason, filling in for him on the drums. The concert was a tribute to the group's friend and Atlantic Records founder Ahmet Ertegun. It was the first time the original members had played with each other since the mid-1980s. Directed by Dick Carruthers, the film uses 12 cameras on and around the stage, exploring the intense guitar playing and smiles between the band members throughout the show. ""It was clicking again,"" Jones said. ""You just fall into it. Time is condensed and you're right back there."" Six weeks of off-and-on rehearsals led to the big night that all the band members agreed was a resounding success. The film focuses on the musicians as they revisit many of the songs that made them one of the most influential and best-selling music artists in history, with sales of more than 200 million albums. From ""Stairway to Heaven"" and ""For Your Life"" to ""Kashmir"" and ""No Quarter,"" Plant's voice is as crisp as ever, Jones tackles the keyboards like few can and Page hasn't lost his touch as what some have called the finest rock guitarist ever. Led Zeppelin song gets the Mike Winslow treatment . This week's premiere marks the first time Led Zeppelin has been in North America since a tour in 1977. The group was preparing to return in 1980 when drummer Bonham died, causing it to break up. Page said the band owes a massive debt to America; Plant says they feel like Americans in a way. Led Zeppelin is expected to receive the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors in Washington in December. Plant said he is looking forward to the evening and meeting President Barack Obama, which he says is a privilege. ""Celebration Day"" will open worldwide on October 17. The band members will also appear Friday in London. Jones will appear at the Berlin premiere on Monday, while Page will be at the Tokyo premiere Tuesday. Can you convince Led Zeppelin to reunite?

"New York (CNN) -- Steve White knows firsthand just how difficult coming home from war can be. A 1st Cavalry Platoon leader and acting company commander in Vietnam, White experienced the struggles of war and the challenges of readjusting to civilian life. Now the executive director of Veterans Across America, White is working to help the new generation of veterans, mostly from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, find jobs. ""This group [of veterans] is extremely well-trained. It's just that they're coming home to a terrible economy, there are very few jobs for them, and they're just being dumped out on the street. We're doing our best to change that,"" says White, 67, who is anticipating increased work as a large-scale drawdown begins. Almost all of the 40,000 American troops in Iraq are on their way home after President Barack Obama's order in October to withdraw them by the end of the year. Through the VAA's Champion Mentor Program, veterans individually team up with a mentor who helps them on the road to employment. They do this through résumé evaluation and improvement, face-to-face meetings, and setting up professional networks for veterans to tap into. The nonprofit organization has already helped more than 7,000 returning troops find jobs. Frank Vazquez is one of the success stories. After graduating from Chelsea Vocational High School in New York, he served in the Navy as an ET3 (electronic technician third class) from 2000 to 2004. His aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz, was sent to the Persian Gulf in 2003 at the beginning of the war. Vazquez, 31, spent his tour ensuring that the ship's radar systems were up to date. After completing his service and returning home in 2004, Vazquez was searching for work. ""I had no guidance from anyone in the military about what I should do next,"" Vazquez told CNN. ""I also never heard from (Veterans Affairs) or other government programs. I actually didn't even know they offered anything."" Through his own efforts, Vazquez found a few short-term jobs as a technician between 2005 and 2008. In 2009, he met Glen Witt, VAA's Champion Mentor Program director. Witt became Vazquez's mentor and provided support and guidance toward finding employment. ""He was a huge help. He made sure I stayed on top of my applications; he was there if I needed to call him. He also met me and walked with me to my interview locations. When I didn't think things were gonna work out, he really stood by me and kept me going."" Vazquez is currently a personal banker at Chase in New York. He remains in touch with Witt and VAA. His experience is a far cry from Steve White's. In 1969, White says, he was spat on by Vietnam War protesters at Travis Air Force Base in California. White struggled to find a job and traveled to Florida to pursue a second degree. He enrolled at Florida Atlantic University but only stayed for one semester. He remembers his first day, sitting in class while students openly criticized him and other U.S. troops and the war effort. When applying for one job at a machinery plant, White -- he was 24 when he returned from Vietnam -- recalls getting rejected after being told that his résumé did not list any appropriate qualifications. ""The guy told me I didn't have any civilian experience. I was able to get 200 people I didn't know to follow my lead and fight in the jungle, but I supposedly didn't have the experience to get a few people to turn on their machines,"" White told CNN. He described his experience as a hostile reception at a time when many employers didn't look at military experience as a marketable background. Don Buzney, a college graduate and Marine Corps captain in Vietnam from June 1968 to March 1969, recalls applying for a position as a manager at a Chicago trucking company. ""After he looked over my résumé, the interviewer said, 'I've got a stack of résumés from people who were smart enough to beat the draft, so I'm not really sure what I can do for you.'"" Both men do, however, see the younger vets receiving more support from the American public. ""The difference today is that many people, whether they support the war or not, they're still showing support for our troops,"" White said. Michael O'Hanlon, director of research and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, said that the new generation of Veterans is better prepared to enter the labor force. He attributes this preparation to a combat experience older veterans didn't have. ""Our soldiers are having to function in many more capacities than they have in the past,"" said O'Hanlon. ""Sure they're expected to fight, but they have to know how to use technology that didn't exist before. They have to be leaders amongst their groups of soldiers and amongst the local populations. We saw some 'hearts and minds' type of efforts in Vietnam, but not nearly to the extent we see in these wars. All of these factors should be giving them skills they can use when they're back here."" Despite the public's higher support, official government agencies are having a hard time producing tangible success for vets. The 2010 unemployment rate among ""Gulf War Era II"" veterans (those who served after September 2001) was 11.5%, according to the Department of Labor. That number is a huge increase from the 6.1% rate of 2007. This is in contrast to the national unemployment rate, currently at 9%. ""The government and American businesses are throwing the yellow ribbon sticker on their cars, but they haven't gone forward to do anything,"" said Wes Poriotis, who founded VAA in 1996 at the request of then-President Bill Clinton. Veterans are simply guided to online portals, where they submit hundreds of copies of their résumés to jobs found on a list. Many applicants never hear back from the companies they apply to and have no other means of looking for work. ""One glaring omission from the government's programs (is) that they provide no real network for our veterans,"" said Poriotis. ""It's one thing if you're an officer and you've got a college degree and a network to lean on, but it's totally different for the majority of vets, who don't have a degree and are left to fend for themselves."" At any given time, VAA, headquartered in New York, has mentors in place for 200 veterans. Roughly 52% are Latino, 35% African-American, 10% Caucasian, and 3% a mixture of Asian and Native American, according to Glen Witt. About 15% of the veterans are women.","Steve White, 67, is executive director of the nonprofit group Veterans Across America .

"(CNN) -- No one ever handed her anything. She never had it made. Born in Iowa in 1905, an only child, she soon moved with her parents to Montana. As she grew up, she developed a love of reading and an interest in writing, and submitted stories to her small-town newspaper. She studied English at college in Montana; she briefly and unhappily married and then divorced. She worked whatever jobs she could find. Her husband had built up numerous debts, including gambling losses; she vowed that she would make good on all of them, and she did. She sold some stories to the Saturday Evening Post, using her full name as a byline: Dorothy Marie Johnson. She moved to New York, found work at the Gregg Shorthand Co., and eventually became the editor of a women's-interest magazine. But she was homesick -- and she yearned to write a different kind of story. In New York, she would go to the public library to read up on the saga of the West and would go to the movies to watch thrilling films on that same theme. She missed Montana, and what she most wanted to do was write Westerns. The authorship of Westerns -- tales of cowboys and rustlers and settlers and the rough-hewn world around them -- had traditionally been a men's club. Zane Grey, Max Brand, Owen Wister, Luke Short, Jack Schaefer, Louis L'Amour -- right up to today, those are the kinds of names most frequently associated with famous Western novels. There didn't seem to be much room for a Dorothy. She didn't care. She knew she was good enough to succeed. Here are six words for you: . ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."" She wrote it. She changed her byline to Dorothy M. Johnson, feeling that Dorothy Marie sounded too frilly; she wrote the short story that was turned into one of the greatest Western movies ever made. A men's club? John Ford, the director of the 1962 film, and John Wayne, James Stewart and Lee Marvin, the stars, welcomed her into their own club. So did Gary Cooper, who starred in another movie based on one of her stories: 1959's ""The Hanging Tree."" And Richard Harris, who starred in 1970's ""A Man Called Horse."" Last Sunday's column, about the immortality that the highest level of artistry confers upon the artist, centered on the life of Vincent van Gogh, but it also mentioned some authors whose work will long endure. In between the names of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Philip Roth, I placed the name of Dorothy M. Johnson. A number of you asked who she was. I'm glad you did. I was kind of hoping you would. Because, in addition to the wonderful talent she possessed, she is a prime example of how, if you set your heart to it, you have a chance to accomplish just about anything. She died in 1984, at the age of 78. According to the obituary published in The New York Times, she wrote 17 books, more than 50 short stories and many poems and magazine articles. After she moved back West, she taught college writing courses. The Western Writers of America bestowed upon her their highest honors. Her writing was so clean, so spare -- she knew just how to draw her readers into a tale and keep them hanging on right up to the last word in the last sentence of the last paragraph. Westerns may not be as popular as they once were, but beautiful writing is eternal. Your public library, if you're lucky, has some Dorothy M. Johnson books; I think you'll find them a treat. KUSM, the public-broadcasting station in Bozeman, Montana, put together an affectionate 27-minute documentary on her life called ""Gravel in Her Gut and Spit in Her Eye."" If you'd like to see it, here it is. Because she seemed to enjoy putting unexpected twists into her plots, and because we're talking about ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" I'll end this with a story about the movie I think she might have liked. During my years of musical travels, I became friends with Gene Pitney, the singer whose hits included ""It Hurts to Be in Love,"" ""Twenty-Four Hours from Tulsa,"" ""Town Without Pity"" and, of course, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."" Once you hear that song, you never forget it. Pitney told me that he constantly heard two things from fans. Either they would say: . ""I thought your song was one of the best parts of the movie."" Or: . ""I was watching 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' on TV last night, and they cut your song out of it. They must have had to edit it for time."" Both sets of fans, Pitney said, were wrong. ""I thought I was recording it for the movie,"" Pitney said. He was justifiably excited about the prospects. With that cast and that director, the film was destined to be a big hit. During the recording session, a friend of Pitney's left the studio, went outside for a few minutes and saw a marquee on a movie theater. The person came back, Pitney said, and broke the news to him: . ""In the middle of the recording session, I found out that the movie had already come out."" To say that made him a little depressed is an understatement. ""Here's a movie with Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin and John Wayne -- and the song doesn't get into the movie,"" he said. But people continue to think they heard it there. For a long time, Pitney would gently set the questioners straight. By the time he died in 2006, though, he often just smiled and let them believe what they wanted to believe. He was living up to a line with which every Dorothy M. Johnson fan -- and every fan of ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" -- is quite familiar: . When the legend becomes fact, print the legend. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Dorothy Marie Johnson yearned to break into the boy's club of Western story writers .

In ""Aleppo: Old City Fight,"" Paton Walsh goes right inside the fight for the historic old city. His report focuses on the improvised nature of the battle, with ""pot-shots at nothing in particular"" and what it could mean for the wider conflict. Paton Walsh says of the scene in Aleppo in 2012: ""People didn't really know where the front lines were. It was generally chaotic, and pretty much punctuated all day long with the sound of shelling, or jets flying in to hit civilian areas."" Paton Walsh was awarded the Emmy for outstanding writing for these stories and his report from Afghanistan on an epidemic of self-immolation among young married women in Herat. In its submission to the Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards, CNN highlighted Paton Walsh's ""poetic writing,"" saying it contrasted ""with the sobering environments from which his stories are usually drawn.""

"(CNN)  -- A man who shot his wife and three children to death before committing suicide in Middletown, Maryland, last weekend had about $460,000 in mortgage and credit card debt, the local sheriff said Tuesday. Five people, including three young children, were found dead in this house in Middletown, Maryland. Deputies who examined a computer taken from Christopher Wood's home found information that showed ""severe financial difficulties,"" including money owed on a home in Florida that the family had been unable to sell, Frederick County Sheriff Charles Jenkins said at a news conference. Wood was a salesman for CSX Railroad, where he earned about $97,000 a year, the sheriff said. He left six suicide notes, according to authorities. Jenkins said the medical examiner had determined that Christopher Wood, 34, shot himself with a shotgun Friday after shooting his wife, Francie Billotti-Wood, and their three young children -- Chandler, 5; Gavin, 4; and Fiona, 2 -- with a small-caliber pistol. ""Traumatic lacerations"" found on the bodies were made after their deaths, with either a kitchen knife or a pruning saw, the sheriff said, quoting the medical examiner. Both items were found in the house. ""The injuries were very horrific,"" the sheriff said. The wife and children apparently were killed while they slept Thursday night into Friday, Jenkins said. Authorities found a shotgun next to Christopher Wood's body and a .25-caliber handgun in a container in the kitchen. Sheriff's Office Cpl. Jennifer Bailey said Tuesday it was not yet known whether the handgun found was used in the killings. The federal Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agency was trying to trace the ownership of the pistol and shotgun. Authorities said Wood left individual suicide notes to his wife and each of the three children, expressing his sorrow and love. There was one note left to his mother, father and sister, and one more that was not addressed to anyone in particular but that was more apologetic than the others. In his sixth note, Wood described his ""day-to-day stresses,"" Bailey said. ""That one talks about financial problems, how he was going to raise his family, stresses, how he tried a number of medications to control his depression, but felt he had gotten worse over time,"" Bailey said. Jenkins said several medications were found in the house, including some used to treat depression and anxiety. Bailey said deputies went to the house shortly after 9 a.m. Saturday, after Francie Billotti-Wood's father found the bodies. Her father, concerned because he had not seen members of the family for about a day, had gone to the house and forced his way in when no one answered the door. Jenkins said the sheriff's office had no record of domestic violence or other family disputes at the Woods' home. He said the results of toxicology tests won't be available for a few weeks.","NEW: Christopher Wood was $460,000 in debt, sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- A judge refused Monday to reduce the bail for a ride operator who has been charged with three felony counts of assault after five people were hurt on a ride at the North Carolina State Fair. An attorney for Timothy Dwayne Tutterrow asked a Wake County judge to reduce the bail -- set at $225,000 -- arguing his client was no flight risk. Judge Keith Gregory declined the motion, but said the issue could be discussed at a later date and scheduled Tutterow's second court appearance for November 18. Tutterow, a 46-year-old from Quitman, Georgia, faces three felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious bodily injury. Tutterow's lawyer, Roger Smith Jr., said his client is devastated by what happened. ""Tim would never intentionally harm anyone,"" he said. ""He's a good man. He has a good heart."" Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison said Saturday investigators determined that the Vortex ride had been tampered with and ""critical safety devices were compromised."" Witnesses said the ride had stopped Thursday night and people were getting off when it restarted, resulting in five injuries. CNN affiliate WRAL reported that three of those hurt were still hospitalized at WakeMed Hospital in Raleigh as of Sunday. The two victims have been released. A ride attendant -- not Tutterrow -- was among the injured, though it wasn't clear whether he was among those still in the hospital this weekend. The victims included family members between the ages of 14 and 39. According to the sheriff's office, Tutterrow is an independent ride contractor for a company that only had one ride at the fair: the Vortex. Wake County District Attorney Colon Wiloughby said Monday the investigation is ongoing and that it was unknown at this point if and when anyone else would be facing charges. Dolores Quesenberry a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Labor, said operators are supposed to perform system checks three times a day during the fair and record the results in a logbook provided by the state.","Bail was kept at $225,000 while next court date was set for November 18 .

"(CNN) -- A string of car bombings in predominantly Shiite neighborhoods across Baghdad on Monday killed 37 people and wounded 155, adding to rising concern about sectarian violence across Iraq. According to police officials, 11 bombs exploded in busy areas of the city and its suburban districts, including three bombings in the predominantly Shiite Al-Shaab suburb. After several years of relative stability in Iraq, violence has been on the upswing of late. More than 5,000 civiilans have died and 12,000 have been wounded in terrorist attacks and other violence in Iraq in 2013, the United Nations Mission in Iraq reported this month. The region around Baghdad has been the hardest-hit, the agency said. The violence suggests that ""Iraq may be moving back to a level of civil conflict that will amount to a serious civil war,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies warned in a recent report. ""There is also substantial reporting to show that Iraq's violence is not simply the product of extremists and terrorist groups,"" authors Anthony Cordesman and Sam Khazai said in the September 9 report. ""Iraq's growing violence is also the result of the fact that Iraq is the scene of an ongoing struggle to establish a new national identity: one that can bridge across the deep sectarian divisions between its Shi'ites and Sunnis as well as the ethnic divisions between its Arabs and its Kurds and other minorities,"" they wrote. Last week, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said it was increasingly concerned that recent sectarian violence threatens to set off a new refugee crisis within the country. About 5,000 people have been forced to flee the recent violence around Baghdad, heading largely for Anbar and Salah Al-Din governates, the agency siad. The country is still struggling to deal with more than 1.3 million people who fled from one part of Iraq to another to escape earlier sectarian violence, the U.N. agency said. Funeral car bombings kill 53, wound dozens in eastern Baghdad .

"(CNN) -- ""Number nine. Number nine. Number nine."" ""The Beatles: Rock Band,"" to be released Wednesday, lets players strum along with classics. The repetitive refrain from one of The Beatles' most mind-bending journeys into psychedelia -- ""Revolution 9,"" the audio pastiche from ""The White Album"" -- is now serving as the backbeat of a big day for the biggest band in rock 'n' roll history. On Wednesday -- 9/9/09 -- remastered versions of the Beatles catalogue will be released, giving listeners what the remaining members of ""The Fab Four"" say is the closest reproduction ever of how their music sounded in the studio. The same day, the video game ""The Beatles: Rock Band"" is set to be released by Harmonix. Modeled after the already popular ""Rock Band"" game, and closely supervised by The Beatles and their estates, the game lets players sing and strum along on a huge list of Beatles classics over scenes ranging from Liverpool's Cavern Club to their final performance on a London rooftop. And on top of that, there's rampant speculation that a planned ""music-themed"" announcement by Apple Inc., also scheduled on 9/9/09, could involve the supergroup. The Beatles are one of a handful of groups whose music has never been approved for sale by Apple's iTunes, and the timing of the announcement has fueled speculation that could finally change -- or even that specialized Beatles iPods, like the ones sold in 2004 loaded with U2's music, could be in the works. It's a remarkable amount of buzz for a band whose roots stretch back nearly five decades. And it's a clear sign, observers say, that through time and a multitude of cultural shifts, the group's hold on the public's imagination has endured. ""People are still looking at Picasso. People are still looking at artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original,"" said Robert Greenfield, a former associate editor at Rolling Stone magazine who has written about the band. ""In the form that they worked in, in the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive than The Beatles were."" Research shows that more than 40 years after their last public performance, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr's music remains as interesting to young people now as it ever was. A Pew Research survey released last month showed that 81 percent of respondents between ages 16-29 said they liked The Beatles. Eleven percent said they dislike the band and only 4 percent said they have never heard of them. By comparison, current rockers Coldplay received 39 percent positive responses, with 45 percent saying they'd never heard of them. Forty-two percent said they like hip-hop star Kanye West. ""To put this in perspective: Try imagining young adults back in the 1960s putting the big jazz bands of the roaring '20s at the top of their list of favorites,"" the survey reads. ""Not very likely."" Walter Everett, professor and chairman of music theory at the University of Michigan, said his students know The Beatles catalogue as well today as they would have 30 years ago. He said the cultural phenomenon that was The Beatles -- the frenzy-inducing early concerts, the furor when John Lennon said the group was ""more popular than Jesus,"" the pre-Internet obsession over ""Paul is dead"" rumors -- made them something more than just another rock group. ""They were just idolized,"" said Everett, who has written several books on the band. ""It was a musical revolution, but [also] the hair, the clothing, their attitude about the establishment, their support of everybody, young and old alike, to try to understand each other at a very difficult time. ""Some of that message endures."" But at the heart of the phenomenon, experts agree, is the music. From the charming, school-boy bop of ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" to the blistering assault of ""Helter Skelter,"" the songs, they say, were just that good. ""The point is how great the music is,"" Greenfield said. ""It isn't about the fact that The Beatles were willing to practice and get better at what they did -- it was the fact that that band contained at least two-and-a-half geniuses [Lennon, McCartney and, at times, Harrison]."" Wednesday's announcements -- and, in Apple's case, possible announcement -- show that the minders of The Beatles legacy are keeping up with how today's music consumers behave, said Bruce Burch, director of the University of Georgia's music business program. ""A lot of bands and artists have been slow to embrace the fact that technology is driving the industry,"" Burch said. ""Their music is not going away and this is a step for them for their music to come into the 21st century."" EMI, which will be releasing the remastered recordings, has been famously protective of The Beatles brand and music. Digital reproductions like MP3s have lower sound quality than albums or compact discs -- one of the reasons they've been slow to embrace iTunes. But if an announcement on that front is coming, Burch said, it would signal an acknowledgement that such quality-control concerns may be obsolete for the majority of the music-buying public. ""It's just a different audience out there,"" he said. ""They're used to listening on ear buds. The sound quality, in some cases, maybe isn't' as important to them."" Everett said that, even with all of the news expected Wednesday, the Beatles music will no doubt remain popular for decades to come -- meaning more new wrinkles are almost certain. ""There's still more that can be done,"" he said. ""Who knows where technology may be in another 10 years? We may have holographic images."" And regardless of how it's delivered, no one's expecting another band to ever eclipse the four lads from Liverpool who would go on to shape popular culture the world over. ""There will probably be another artist that comes along and captures the imagination,"" Burch said. ""But it will never be like The Beatles.""","9/9/09 a big day for The Beatles .

"(CNN) -- Irony is a part of life, the clichÃ© goes. And right now, President Barack Obama is living the part, in a big way: He's the civil libertarian defending an activist drone program. He's the liberal with a spy agency caught eavesdropping on the private conversations of friendly leaders. And he's the high-tech health care reformer whose website got stuck at Go. And so the ultimate irony may be this -- a President who extols the virtues of government has now been sucked into the big government vortex, experiencing (up close and personal, as they say) what it feels like to lose control to the bureaucrats. The ones who are afraid to deliver bad news, not to mention those who don't deliver the news at all. (As in, ""the website crashed."") And the surveillance chiefs who, um, didn't initially volunteer that they're spying on the private phone lines of America's best friends. Maybe the President needs to figure out some new communications tools to make himself clear. (As in, ""Angela Merkel's cell is not just another data point."") Obama, we're told, is frustrated and angered by the pathetic rollout of his signature legislative achievement. He's also clearly re-examining how the National Security Agency decides to target friendly leaders, what we get from it and why we need it at all. A couple of ex-intelligence officials tell me they're not shocked gambling was going on in Casablanca. (""Our job is to know things,"" says one.) Whether the President should have known about the monitoring of these specific heads of state is another matter entirely -- and best left to intelligence aficionados. I've asked -- and gotten answers on both sides of the argument. But here are the larger questions that play into both the website fiasco and the NSA issues: How can a President take control of his own government? How can he make sure he knows what he needs to know? And as the pro-government cheerleader, doesn't he have a special responsibility to make sure it delivers, especially when his legacy hangs in the balance? The problem is it's never easy to untangle a bureaucratic mess. ""So you're the President, you're angry and you want to know how all of this happened,"" says a former senior administration official. ""And the truth is, even you may not be able to figure it out. You just won't have enough time left in office."" Stunning as that sounds, it's probably accurate. Presidents are often isolated, and always the first among equals. So it seems to me that especially in the White House one of the principal jobs of an executive is to understand the incentive subordinates have to conceal information selectively. People may report facts and then spin them. Bad news is not a good thing to deliver to presidents. Some are protective of the office and the President; giving the President plausible deniability of any problem is often the easiest and safest route. Or, as one former White House hand told me, ""People just don't want to upset the boss, or get him blamed for anything."" All of which a President should know going into the Oval Office. If the reason the President did not know about the epic website issues is because the problems were hidden from the ground up, how about this solution: Establish an atmosphere, at all levels, in which truth telling is rewarded, not punished. If Obama was surprised at the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, then on some level he failed one of the principal tests: Get the truth out of people, even if they know you are not going to like it. Yes, this is government and humans are humans. But Obamacare has been the signature legislative achievement of this presidency. Everyone knew how complex this would be to get going, at every level. So here's a question: Why wasn't the A-team led out of the White House, with a daily update to the president? Obama the campaigner was incomparably good at establishing metrics and using information technology to assess the extent to which those metrics were being hit. What happened here? What seems to have happened was what often happens: The work got delegated to the bureaucrats somewhere else -- HHS? CMS? -- and, as a result, it got bogged down, delayed and muddled. Mistakes went either hidden or unrecognized. If folks down the food chain knew, they were keeping it from their bosses. After all, no reward in telling the truth. The big question now is whether these problems are evidence of a huge management failure. ""One of the things you find after working in government is that, under tremendous pressure, organizations that are supposed to produce accurate information, often don't,"" says a former senior administration official (think Benghazi). ""And you can only rely on what people are telling you."" Or not telling you, as in the case of Merkel's cell phone. If the President and senior officials were not told about the wide range of the program, who thought that secrecy was a good idea? Does a President have to play a game of Twenty Questions with his own people to figure things out? Or, conversely, as some intelligence officials claim, if the President did know something -- some giblet -- why not more? It's not as if Obama is a passive examiner of intelligence; quite the contrary. So what gives here? Consider this: You're President Obama. You believe in the affirmative use of government. You're trying to govern a country that has lost confidence in the ability of that government to execute anything. And now you discover the website of your prized legislative achievement is a disaster. And the spies were tapping a good ally's cell phone, for no immediately obvious reason. The final irony may be this: Four out of five Americans have little or no trust in their government to do anything right. And now Obama probably feels the same way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger says President Barack Obama has been a believer in high-tech government .
She says the Obamacare website woes and NSA spy practices have to shake his faith .
Borger: Shouldn't White House have taken control of the signature health care initiative?

"(CNN) -- With their nation still absorbing the shock of Sachin Tendulkar's retirement, the next generation of Indian stars showed their ability with a stunning run chase to beat Australia in a one-day international Wednesday. Chasing an imposing 360 to win in Jaipur, India went past the target for the loss of just one wicket and with six overs to spare. It was the second highest score to win a 50 overs international, only beaten by the astonishing 436 runs by a South African side in Johannesburg in 2006, with Australia again the unfortunate opposition. Openers Rohit Sharma (141 not out) and Shikhar Dhawan (95) put India on their way before the more experienced Virat Kohli completed the task with a brutal innings. Kohli smashed 100 not out off just 52 balls, including seven sixes and eight fours. It was the fastest century by an Indian in one day internationals and the seventh quickest off all time. India's score of 362 was the highest ever in this form of the game for the loss of just one wicket and it enabled them to level the series at 1-1. Australia had looked strong favorites to take a 2-0 lead after amassing a formidable score on a superb batting wicket. Each of their top five batsmen scored a half century, with captain George Bailey top scoring on 92 not out. But the visiting bowling attack was powerless to prevent India racing to victory, with Sharma at first leading the way. India are the current world champions in 50 overs cricket, helped to victory on home soil in 2011 by national hero Tendulkar. He quit the shorter form of the game last year and announced his retirement from all cricket last week. Tendulkar will play his final Test match on his home ground in Mumbai next month against the West Indies, completing 200 appearances at this level.","India beat Australia in one-day international .

"(CNN) -- Pea soup. That crucifix. Those stairs. ""The Exorcist"" was released 40 years ago to great fanfare. ""This film, when it came out, lived at the very center of popular culture,"" film critic and author Richard Crouse told CNN. ""It was the only thing that people talked about. The speed of popular culture wasn't as fast as it is now. Even a big hit like 'Gravity,' people are excited for a week, excited for two weeks, and then it fades away until awards season comes around. But it wasn't like that in 1973. This movie, for a year, really inked out all available entertainment space."" Crouse, author of the book ""Raising Hell,"" recalled ""stories about people throwing up at screenings. Someone sued Warner Bros. because they were so overwhelmed by the movie they passed out, hit their head on the seat in front of them and broke their jaw. And Warner Bros. settled with them. Someone attacked the screen in San Francisco because they thought there were evil spirits inside the screen. Those stories played themselves out over months and months and months and turned the movie into something we're still talking about 40 years later."" Based on William Peter Blatty's 1971 novel of the same name, ""The Exorcist"" was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won Oscars for Best Sound Mixing and Best Adapted Screenplay. It remains one of the highest-grossing films of all time, and is also the first horror film to be nominated for Best Picture. Director William Friedkin (nominated for a Best Director Academy Award), however, never approached the project as a horror film. He saw ""The Exorcist"" as a story about the mystery of faith. Set in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., ""The Exorcist"" tells the story of 12-year-old Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair, who received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination), whose disturbing behavior prompts her mother, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn, nominated for Best Actress), to seek an exorcism after medical doctors are unable to help her daughter. The story is loosely based on real events. The book and the movie open during an archaeological dig in Iraq. Friedkin recalled shooting in Mosul. ""It was very rare to be given permission to film in Iraq,"" said the director, ""let along to film on an archaeological dig. Iraq, at that time, was not run by Saddam Hussein, but it was governed by the Ba'athist Party, which is Saddam Hussein's party. They allowed us to come over here and film on the condition that I would use Iraqi people on the crew and train them in film techniques; and, strangely, that we would show them how to make film blood."" The Iraq sequence introduces the exorcist himself, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow), who is also an archaeologist. The Jesuit priest comes to the realization that he will again fight a demon he has battled in the past. Friedkin recalled shooting in the northern Iraq desert. ""It would often be 130 degrees by 10:30 in the morning,"" he said in a commentary on the film's Blu-ray, ""and we'd have to stop shooting and then go into our tents until 7:00 at night when we then had four more hours of daylight in which we could film."" Chris, a Hollywood actress filming a movie in D.C., approaches Georgetown University psychiatrist Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller, who received a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination), a Jesuit who feels he's lost his faith. He is riddled with guilt over not having been able to better care for his mother who died poor, scared and alone. Karras, initially skeptical, agrees to conduct the exorcism. Father Merrin is summoned to help and the two work together to exorcise the demon Pazuzu out of Regan. The scenes that made audiences the queasiest didn't involve green vomit. People were reportedly sickened during the scenes that involved Regan undergoing medical testing in real time. Namely, the arteriogram. That scene was filmed at New York University Medical Center with a real radiologist and his assistant as they went through the step-by-step process of the invasive procedure. Some people in the audience fainted seeing the needle go in as the dye was injected and blood spurted. The now-famous spider-walk scene, in which Regan descends the stairs in the Georgetown home, initially couldn't be used in the film in 1973 because wires were visible. CGI was used to add the scene for a 2000 theatrical re-release, which included a few other scenes totaling 12 minutes. The film's other special effects, including the shaking bed and other moving furniture, were rather do-it-yourself. For example, Regan's bedroom set was refrigerated. Air conditioners wouldn't work because they take moisture out, and the point was to visually capture the actors' breath on film. Von Sydow was only 44 when he played Father Merrin, so makeup artist Dick Smith (who also created Marlon Brando's look in ""The Godfather"") transformed the actor into the elderly Jesuit who appears onscreen. He also did Blair's makeup, transforming her from cherubic to demonic. During the shocking scene in which Regan masturbates with a crucifix, a box containing a sponge with Karo syrup and red food coloring was placed between Blair's legs. The child actress didn't comprehend the meaning of the scene until years later. A mechanical dummy was used for the scenes in which the possessed Regan spun her head 360-degrees. The fake vomit was actually a mix of pea soup and oatmeal. Linda Blair wore contact lenses in a variety of colors and sizes during her character's various stages of possession, including an all-white pair for when her eyes rolled back into her head. When the priests chanted that famous line -- ""The power of Christ compels you!"" -- Blair's body had to be lifted mechanically. The background was lit with shadows that helped mask the wires, which were painted as a dotted line to break up the color so they blended in. Armed with a crucifix, holy water, faith (which was slowly beginning to return to Karras), and acting in the name of God, the two priests summon the power of Jesus Christ to drive out Pazuzu. Weakened by guilt and the demon's hold over his psyche, Karras takes a break. Upon returning to Regan's bedroom, he sees that Merrin has died. Enraged, he begs the demon to take him instead of the child. The demon obliges. Karras throws himself out of Regan's bedroom window, falls down a steep stairway, and is given last rites by Father Dyer (who was played by a real priest, Father William O'Malley), before dying. The infamous flight of stairs leading down to M Street NW in Georgetown consists of 97 stone steps. During filming, the special-effects team lined each and every step with a half-inch of rubber. The stuntman filling in for Father Karras dove down them twice. To this day, ""The Exorcist"" resonates with audiences. ""I think 'The Exorcist' holds up well because it is, first and foremost, a well-crafted film, cannily designed to be upsetting,"" Michael Calia, a professor of film at Quinnipiac University, told CNN. ""But clearly the narrative has a psychological depth and complexity that shakes us up on a number of levels."" It's not just about a demon inhabiting a little girl, but ""it's also about the vulnerability of those around her and how badly they are damaged by their having to deal with the possession,"" explained Calia, who pointed out that Father Merrin best summed up the demon's modus operandi when the priest stated that ""the demon's target is not the possessed; it is us ... the observers ... every person in this house."" ""The story can shake our understanding of the world and ourselves,"" Calia continued, ""and that's where the film functions on a level beyond mere entertainment."" While the film contains unforgettable images and great scares, Crouse said, ""what I think drew people to this movie is it takes you on such a journey where, in the end, good wins out."" The takeaway is that good and evil battle one another out, within everyone, every day. ""Everyone who sees 'The Exorcist' takes from it what they bring to it,"" said Friedkin. ""If you believe in the mystery of faith, in the power of goodness over evil; that is what you will take from the film.""","""The Exorcist"" is about the demonic possession of a girl and the priests who save her .

"(Fast Company) -- Twitter . For ballooning into a global phenomenon that, finally, has a business model. In 2009, Twitter boasted some 20 million users. Today? More than 200 million. During that period of hockey stick-like growth, Twitter unveiled a sleek redesigned interface, played an integral role in recent revolutions in the Middle East, and introduced Promoted Tweets and Trends, a stream of tweet-size ads that reportedly cost major companies at least $100,000 to purchase. Google . For launching the most radical upgrade to search in years with Google Instant--and still boasting a 98 percent adoption rate. With some 2 million searches per second and 3 billion per day, Google can't alter a pixel in its logo without the world knowing. Yet that didn't stop the Internet giant from unveiling Google Instant, a results-as-you-type search engine that has helped users save an average of 4 to 5 seconds on each query. Zynga . For turning what most social media companies can't: a ($400 million) profit. In January, social gaming company Zynga introduced CityVille, the follow-up to their blockbuster (not to mention addictive) FarmVille game. A little over a month later, CityVille already boasted more than 100 million users, making it the most popular app on Facebook. No wonder Zynga, which was recently valued at $7 billion to $9 billion, is worth more than Electronic Arts. Netflix . For boldly cannibalizing its own DVD-by-mail business. To defend against growing competition from Hulu and Amazon (Blockbuster, who?), Netflix launched streaming-only services in the U.S. and Canada -- both of which became instant hits. So in recent earnings reports, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings hasn't highlighted the company's monstrous $2.2 billion 2010 revenues (up 29 percent year-over-year), or the huge uptick in members to some 20 million subscribers (more than Stars and Showtime). Rather, he brought out the most astounding figure of all: nearly 70 percent of subscribers now stream content online, up from 41 percent last year. Foursquare . For fending off copycats, goosing growth, and making check-ins a must-use marketing tool for major brands. Astronaut Douglas Wheelock earned the NASA Explorer Badge when he checked in while orbiting the Earth -- a story that reflect Foursquare's meteoric rise. The company now boasts 7.5 million users, well more than double its total in September 2010. Most significantly, the company has steamed ahead in the face of growing competition -- from Gowalla, Google Latitude, Loopt, and especially Facebook Places. It launched a brand new version of the service in March, unveiled an innovative merchant platform that has brands reeling, and boasted some half-billion check-ins in the last year alone. Tumblr . For turning stray thoughts into big business. The New York-based Twitter-that's-not-limited-to-140-characters micro-blogging service is drawing around 30,000 new members each day -- and more impressively, around 4 billion page views per month. In November, it scored between $25 million and $30 million from investors, bringing its total past $40 million. Crimson Hexagon . For developing a revolutionary way to monitor and measure Twitter chatter. Crimson Hexagon began at Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science but has flourished into the prime analytics tool for HP, Microsoft, and CNN, which use the tech to gauge public perception. The company uses a ""statistical human-assisted approach"" to monitor the Web, tracking and learning the specifics of what people are saying in social media in real-time -- beyond the positive-or-negative analysis of keyword and semantic searches -- and with as much as 97 percent accuracy. Stocktwits . For creating the CNBC of the digital age. On this site, live streams are pulled from Facebook and Twitter; recently acquired service Abnormal Returns culls the best financial news stories from the Internet; weekly Webinars and video market recaps are offered; and StockTwits.tv features original programming around the clock. In other words, StockTwits has become an indispensible real-time financial tool for the social media age -- not to mention that it boasts more than 300,000 monthly unique hits. Microsoft . For reinvigorating search market competition with Bing, the only formidable Google challenger left. Thanks to strategic partnerships with Kayak, Yahoo, Twitter, and Facebook, Bing has begun nipping away at Google's market share--and kept its Mountain View-based foe from becoming a monopoly. Earlier this month, Bing became the second most-popular search engine worldwide. Conaco Productions . For harnessing the power of social media to keep Conan relevant long after he was yanked off the air. Even after his unfortunate departure from NBC, Conan O'Brien kept his brand red-hot (er, orange-hot?) thanks to a squad of 8 full-time Team Coco Digital staffers running his social media like pros. Cases in point: the millions of views on YouTube, hundreds of thousands of fans on Facebook, and millions of followers on Twitter. To hype his TBS show's November debut, Conan's team also started a 24-hour live webcast of the production, built fan pages on Flickr and Tumblr -- and launched a bright orange Conan blimp, which spotters could check into on Foursquare.

"(CNN)  -- A Navy helicopter whipped the waves as the U.S. Coast Guard closed in on the suspected drug traffickers abandoning their homemade submarine off the coast of Ecuador. U.S. Navy and Coast Guard personnel approach a sinking drug sub about 200 miles off the coast of Ecuador. The men didn't go down with the ship, but any evidence did. When authorities confront ""drug subs"" on the high seas, trafficking busts turn into rescue operations, the Coast Guard says. In the past, no evidence meant no case. But a new law aims to change that. The Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act of 2008 was signed into law in September. The statute makes it a felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison, to travel through international waters in the vessels, technically known as self-propelled semisubmersibles. Drug subs come in several forms and are built of fiberglass, wood and steel in the swamps along the west coast of Colombia, under the cover of heavy foliage, Coast Guard officials say. Despite costing upwards of $2 million, the vessels are generally abandoned at sea after delivering their cargo, according to the Coast Guard. But with cargo values estimated to range from $200 million to $400 million, the investment pays big dividends. They are hard to see, rising less than 2 feet (little more than a half-meter) above the waterline, and can be 80 feet (24 meters) long, large enough to move 10 to 15 tons (about 9,000 to 14,000 kilograms) of cocaine at a time.   Federal officials estimate drug subs now transport about one-third of all cocaine that moves by sea from South America to the United States. Detecting the vessels is nearly impossible for law enforcement even with advancements in sonar, radar and infrared technology. Catching them involves a combination of good intelligence and luck, and often relies on the use of helicopters. Once caught, suspected smugglers often ""scuttle,"" or sink, the subs, sending both vessel and cocaine to the bottom of the sea. Though maritime law requires drug-trafficking crews in distress to be rescued, the crews are usually released without prosecution, because of a lack of physical evidence. But under the new law, no physical evidence is necessary. Just being on board a drug sub is proof enough. A dozen suspected cocaine smugglers taken into custody between December 31 and January 8 could be among the first prosecuted under the new law. The cases are expected to develop over the next several weeks, according to a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office. Besides a stiff prison sentence, suspects could be fined up to $1 million if convicted. The suspects were taken in three separate drug sub incidents in which alleged traffickers sank the vessels and cargo. The first came December 31, some 200 miles (322 kilometers) off the coast of Ecuador. Another vessel was stopped January 7 about 550 miles off the coast of Ecuador. The most recent arrests were made January 8, about 150 miles offshore from the Ecuador-Colombia border.  ""As we go through the first prosecutions associated with this, we are actually kind of paving new ground here on how it is we have to prepare cases,"" said Adm. Thad Allen, commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. ""I think you can see where the planned operation of one of these vehicles on the high seas is a crime in and of itself significantly, significantly simplifies the prosecution for us,"" he said. The new law, while untested, appears likely to pass constitutional muster. ""This is a unique statue probably born out of the frustration of federal officials trying to prove criminal activity on part of the drug traffickers,"" said Robert Silbering, former special narcotics prosecutor for New York. ""This just throws another obstacle in the way of traffickers."" ""The idea here is we don't have to catch you with the drugs; if we catch you with the vessel, we are going to prosecute you for that,"" said David A. Moran, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. But as the law evolves, so do the traffickers' tactics, Allen said. ""The latest adaptation,"" he noted, ""is the introduction of liquid cocaine and smaller loads on faster boats hugging the coastline and trying to avoid us by staying in the territorial sea of another nation.""","Three ""drug subs"" intercepted in past two weeks, Coast Guard says .

"(CNN) -- At least three people died on a dust-covered stretch of highway Monday when at least 19 vehicles collided in a series of accidents because of poor visibility, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety said. Bart Graves said 12 other people were injured -- many of them seriously -- during the dust-storm-induced series of pileups that were flagged to CNN by Twitter. Six tractor-trailers, one motor home and a dozen cars and trucks were involved in one of the wrecks on Interstate 10 near Picacho Peak. That included one semi with its nose smashed back to the windshield. Another trailer appeared to have a car wedged underneath. A pickup truck lay on its side ahead of the main entanglement of crashed commercial trucks and cars. At least two helicopter crews were summoned to deal with the injured, authorities said. Westbound traffic bewteen mile posts 214 and 216 was being rerouted from the three-lane wide stretch to an adjacent side road.

"(CNN) -- Sean Penn and Gus Van Sant have a proposition for us: a biopic dedicated to the memory of San Francisco activist and City Supervisor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, who was murdered by a fellow supervisor in 1978. Sean Penn plays San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk in ""Milk,"" directed by Gus Van Sant. The subject may be a tricky sell, but the timing feels right -- a few weeks late to save Californians' same-sex marriage rights, admittedly, but the need to keep on fighting through adversity may be Milk's most important legacy. And ""Milk"" is a powerful movie that will stir more than a few hearts and minds. An audiotape Milk records ""just in case"" is screenwriter Dustin Lance Black's convenient structuring device, foregrounding the story's tragic outcome and allowing Milk to narrate his own life story. In this telling, it's a life that begins at 40 -- when he picks up Scott (James Franco), falls in love, comes out and drops out. The year is 1970, and San Francisco beckons. Their Castro Street camera store soon becomes a focal point for the booming gay community, and it's not long before Milk makes the first of several unsuccessful runs for district supervisor. Civic elections might seem like small beer, but the persecution that compelled Milk to run for office is no trivial matter. The gay rights movement's most critical accomplishment, the film suggests, is how it liberated gays to be themselves. As Milk tries to explain to his heterosexual colleague Dan White (Josh Brolin), this isn't about principles, it's about people's lives -- three of his lovers had threatened suicide. One of them, Jack Lira (Diego Luna), goes through with it. The political can't get more personal than that. Ironically, the devoutly ""normal"" White is the one who is truly messed up. Here's another irony: To earn the recognition and validation of the voters, Milk has to shed his reborn hippie uniform and ponytail, put on a suit and get a haircut. Making the same calculation, director Gus Van Sant has axed the long takes and experimentalism that made ""Elephant"" and ""Paranoid Park"" arresting but decidedly marginal experiences and turned in his most conventional movie since ""Finding Forrester."" In other words, he's playing it straight this time. The strategy is sound; the execution, nearly flawless. Van Sant captures the time and the place with unobtrusive precision, seamlessly mixing in reams of archival news reports. (She may not know it, but Anita Bryant has a co-starring role in this movie.) iReport.com: Share your reviews of 'Milk' Penn is studied and thoughtful, impassioned and immediately sympathetic as Milk. It's easy to see how he attracts so much support -- and how his drive and commitment don't leave enough time for a ""real"" life. When Penn smiles, there's always pain there -- it's almost a wince -- and he smiles a lot here. ""Milk"" may be a little too homogenized for some tastes. Like ""Philadelphia"" and ""Brokeback Mountain,"" it's careful how it advances its agenda (and it does have one). But it's not just a single-issue movie. In its conviction that ""change"" isn't effected through rhetoric alone, but through the hard slog of campaign work, persuasion, inspiration, inclusion and good old, bad old politicking, ""Milk"" says something about how progress is achieved in America. In that respect, it evokes the best aspirations of the country -- and, for that matter, of filmmaking.","""Milk"" is a biography of openly gay San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk .

"(CNN) -- Only two Republican presidential candidates will appear on the ballot in Virginia next year, regardless of how many are in the race. Mitt Romney and Ron Paul will have the Dominion State all to themselves. Supporters of Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann will have to be content with yard signs or donations as ways of cheering on their favorite would-be nominee. That's because their campaigns failed to gain the requisite 10,000 signatures. It is, to be sure, a self-inflicted wound, a measure of some organizational chaos. But it is also a function of illogically restrictive local laws. They not only impede ballot access but end up denying open representative democracy to operate on the road to the Oval Office. The United States is the only nation in the world, save Switzerland, that does not have uniform federal ballot access laws, according to Ballot Access News, a website run by Richard Winger that is dedicated to the issue. This may reflect the country's closely held federalism, but it can create chaos in a presidential year. In many cases, the rules are imposed by state party bosses who are less interested in democracy than in rigging the system to benefit their favored candidates. Take, for example, my home state of New York. It votes reliably Democratic in presidential years, at least since Ronald Reagan thrashed Walter Mondale in 1984. But the state's primary delegates can still be a prize in a protracted Republican nomination fight. In 1999, John McCain had to sue to even have his name appear on the ballot alongside George W. Bush because the Republican state party chair and his committee essentially decided that Bush would be their nominee without the inconvenience of putting it to a vote. Local laws allowed them to restrict ballot access until public pressure and a court injunction overruled their attempted end-run around democracy. Each presidential cycle, the corrupt kabuki continues. In this election season, Virginia's ballot isn't the only one with high barriers to entry. Indiana requires 4,500 signatures and Illinois 3,000. In Rhode Island, some Republican officials are warning that not a single Republican candidate could qualify for the state's primary ballot. Changes to ballot laws last spring now give candidates about two weeks after they declare on January 19 to collect 1,000 signatures from registered Republicans for a ballot spot -- a difficult task during the cold season. Because our primary system focuses intensely on the first few states -- notably January's gantlet of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida -- dark-horse candidates logically focus their efforts and limited resources on crucial early contests. But if they are able to build enough support in those states, they can find themselves cut off at the knees in later primary states with high-hurdle filing deadlines or signature requirements. This adds to the advantage of establishment candidates with enough big money behind them to build national organizations before the early states have even voted. Republican primary voters have watched their candidates debate more than a dozen times this year alone. They have informed opinions. By the time January is over, the current field of seven candidates will probably be cut to three or four. Certainly, at that crucial stage of the nomination, every registered Republican should have a chance to vote for his or her preferred nominee. One of the major problems in American politics today is that the parties have forgotten that they are not the purpose of our democracy. Independent voters like me -- now nearly 40% of the electorate and on the rise across the nation -- are effectively disenfranchised in the crucial closed partisan primaries where most elections are effectively decided. Open primaries, such as in New Hampshire, where independents are allowed to vote, often have the additional benefit of selecting the best general election candidate, the one best able to appeal to centrists as well as conservatives. Look, I'd like to see more open primaries across the nation as a means of achieving a more representative democracy, less disproportionately dominated by partisan activists. But surely, registered Republicans should have the ability to vote for the candidate of their choice, regardless of ridiculously restrictive local election laws. ""It's very disappointing watching people on TV act like its only Newt Gingrich or Rick Perry who are being affected,"" said Winger, who runs Ballot Access News. ""It's the voters who are being injured."" Gingrich, Perry and the other leading Republicans deserve to have their names appear on the ballot as long as their campaigns continue. Their supporters should have the right to vote for their favored candidate. Anything less is hiding behind legalisms, with other candidates defending the status quo because it suits their short-term self-interest, not because it is right or just. It is a coward's way to win a primary, and it demeans our democracy by denying voters the full range of choice at a pivotal point in the race for the presidency.

"(CNN) -- For Mike Chinoy, CNN's Beijing bureau chief at the time, one of the most significant moments in that heady spring of 1989 in China happened at 2:30 a.m. Beijing time on the morning of June 4, as the crackdown was taking place. Mike Chinoy: ""I described the gunfire and the bodies."" Chinoy was on the balcony at ""Tokyo base"" -- the network's nickname for its makeshift bureau at the Beijing Hotel down the avenue from Tiananmen Square -- watching soldiers march into the square with guns firing. He was also constantly on the phone with CNN Atlanta, giving the network live ""beeper"" updates on what was happening there. CNN's live video capability had long been pulled by the Chinese authorities. And CNN's first pictures from the square had already been confiscated.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Mississippi man was indicted Monday in the mailing of ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and two other officials. The five-count indictment charges James Everett Dutschke, 41, with producing and using the deadly toxin as a weapon, using the mail to threaten Obama, Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lee County Judge Sadie Holland. The indictment alleges Dutschke tried to implicate someone else for the crimes. That other man, an Elvis impersonator named Paul Kevin Curtis, was arrested on April 17. He claimed he'd been framed, and the charges against him were dropped less than a week later. Dutschke was then arrested April 27 and charged with producing the ricin. Curtis had said the two men knew each other and had a falling out. New poison letters put ricin under microscope . An affidavit released earlier said investigators conducted searches of Dutschke's home and former place of business and found incriminating items including latex gloves and a dust mask. The mask tested positive for ricin. According to court papers, each letter contained the same message, saying in part, ""Maybe I have your attention now Even if that means someone must die. This must stop. To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" What is ricin? The letters all ended with the words ""I am KC and I approve this message."" That was a phrase commonly used by Paul Kevin Curtis in online postings. The indictment claims Dutschke used such language in the messages ""to make it appear that Paul Kevin Curtis was responsible"" for the letters. If convicted Dutschke could face up to life in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Oxford, Mississippi, on Thursday. CNN's message to Dutschke's lawyer was not immediately returned. Ricin: Almost never deadly .","The indictment says the defendant tried to blame another man .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japan apologized once again to South Korea on Tuesday for colonizing the Korean peninsula for more than three decades in the early 1900s. While the apology is not the first from Japan, it coincides with the 100th anniversary this month of the annexation of the Korean peninsula. In his statement, Prime Minister Naoto Kan expressed ""deep regret over the suffering inflicted"" during Japan's rule. Cabinet members endorsed the statement, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. Kan also said Japan will hand over precious cultural artifacts that South Korea has been demanding. Among them are records of an ancient Korean royal dynasty. Japan controlled Korea from 1910 to 1945. During that time, Japan's military is accused of forcing about 200,000 women, mainly from Korea and China, to serve as sex slaves. They were known as ""comfort women"" for soldiers in Japan's Imperial Army. In the past, there have been street protests and lawsuits in South Korea over the sufferings of the comfort women. South Korea's ruling Grand National Party said the statement was ""a step forward"" from past statements, but ""not enough to allay"" Korean anger, the country's Yonhap news agency said. The statement ""has no mention of illegitimacy of the forced annexation and Koreans forced to work as sex slaves or manual laborers by the Japanese army,"" Ahn Hyoung-hwan, a spokesman of the party, said, according to Yonhap.","NEW: Korea: Statement not enough to ""allay"" anger .

"(Financial Times) -- A diet of drudgery in a takeaway might seem wholesome but it does open the eye to better things. One evening last week I was in the kitchen fixing myself a cup of tea when my son put his head around the door. I have hardly seen him since he left school last summer as he spends his days working in a sandwich shop and nights taking orders in a fast-food takeaway. How's it going, I asked. Good, he replied. These jobs of yours, I said. Have they taught you anything interesting yet about or work, or life -- or anything? Yeah, he said. They've taught me I like getting paid. See also: What can CEOs can learn from football managers? My question was prompted by a recent Harvard Business Review blog arguing that humble jobs teach young people more about work than any amount of poncing around as an unpaid intern in a film production company. The author, who is now a law school professor, was once a busboy and a cleaner -- jobs which he says taught him lessons that have come in handy ever since. Already I was seeing the sense in his general argument. My son's first key takeaway from the takeaway restaurant was spot on: . ● Getting paid really is nice. It is a pity most of us get so used to it that we forget to be pleased when payday comes around. So what else had it taught him? He said he'd think about it and tell me later: he had to go or he'd be late for his evening shift. This led to the second revelation: . ● If you are earning £7 an hour you need to work longer than an investment banker to make any money at all. And that, in turn, led to the third: . ● Earning the minimum wage makes you grateful to live at home where there is a warm bed and full(ish) fridge. For everyone else, it is a game of survival and he doesn't understand how they manage. Later that evening I got a text from him saying the restaurant was quiet and that we could talk. So I went over to find the place entirely empty apart from my son, who was loafing around by the till. This led to his fourth revelation: . ● Doing nothing sucks. It's the worst thing there is. It makes you so lethargic that when things get busier you can hardly bring yourself to budge. See also: five ways to resign in style . Isn't he also learning how to be professional, I asked -- leading the witness outrageously. Obvs, he replied. And then came lesson number five: . ● You have to be punctual. And reliable. You mustn't swear, or turn your back on customers, or answer them back. If you have a hangover you still have to get to work on time, and you have to pretend that you feel fine. Listening to him recite this list led me to contribute an insight of my own: . ● A fast-food restaurant is an excellent finishing school. It has succeeded in areas where 18 years of liberal parenting and seven years of hugely expensive private education have made little impression. Yet even though he has learnt how to be civil to customers, he has not learnt to like it. In fact what he has discovered is that: . ● Dealing with customers can suck. Some of them are friendly, but there are lots who don't even look at you. That gets to you after a while. My son looked anxiously at his watch and said his boss would be in soon. But I thought you told me you liked him, I protested. He shrugged. ""He's OK. In the beginning we went for a drink after the shift, but he decides how many hours I work, and he blames me for stuff like not ordering new menus, when that's not even my job. So drinking with him feels weird."" In other words he has learnt invaluable lesson number eight: . ● Being friends with your manager is never a good idea. Before I left him, I told him that his lessons bore no resemblance to the ones drawn by the HBR blogger, whose stint doing humble jobs taught him great truths about humanity: that most people want to take pride in their work, and that everyone has big dreams. What did he think of that? He pointed out it was hard to take pride in your work when the restaurant is doing badly and the manager doesn't care. See also: How millennials can score the perfect job . But even with good management, some people are still useless moaners, which led him to lesson nine. ● Working with whingers is rubbish. So what should be done about them, I asked. He looked at me as if I were an idiot. ""F-ing fire them,"" he said, momentarily forgetting lesson #5. And what about dreams? ""Yeah,"" he said. ""Everyone here has dreams."" Slightly dreading the answer, I asked what were his. To my relief he replied: ""To get into university and to get a skilled job."" © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Some of the world's most successful people honed their skills in part time jobs as teenagers .

"(CNN) -- It's not gardening the way most know it -- the people sifting through air plants, succulents and clumps of moss, often between glasses of wine. But terrarium gardens and other tiny plant projects are popping up at home, in classes and parties. It's a dÃ©cor trend that's partly about plants, and partly about getting personal. The small, easy-to-care-for gardens have shown up in home design magazines, and on the shelves of craft, dÃ©cor and nursery stores. They create scenes on a shelf, or hang in clusters from the ceiling, softening corners. As the DIY crowd continues to experiment with the form, they're being made into pendants and earrings or built into miniature containers, like light bulbs and snail shells. Some are even crafting terrariums to commemorate personal experiences. Share your style! It could be CNN Living's Design of the Day . ""I see them with their tweezers, pushing the plants into the moss and making everything just so. It's like a little Japanese Zen garden,"" said Nicolette Valdespino, owner of Terraria, inside the Atlanta home goods dealer Paris on Ponce. She sells terrariums and teaches monthly terrarium-building classes. ""Terrariums are a way of bringing the outdoors in, and I think we all need that. We need some grounding influence in our lives. ""We're never unplugged now. So maybe what we're looking for is that little bit of sanctuary, that little bit of peace."" Atlanta designer and architect Mark Williams said terrariums are popular right now as an antidote to rigid, architectural spaces. They provide an organic texture and color that designers love to work with, as well as create an interesting vignette in a room. ""Instead of putting a palm or a ficus in a corner, it's something you can install on a wall, in a series of containers on a grid, essentially what is a living wall,"" he said. But the harmony of terrariums in the home all comes back to texture and scale, Williams said. The plants themselves are gorgeous when you get up close, he said, but take a step back to appreciate the size, shape and color of succulents coming together. ""We love tightly compact clusters of succulents,"" Williams said of his design company. ""They're so different, not something we as Southeastern natives have grown up with."" Aquarium-style terrariums had a moment in the 1970s, but these days, there's an emphasis on fantasy, found objects and the creator's personality. Terrariums can be sparse and minimalist or multi-media. Some adopt Japanese forms, such as kokedama and Bonsai, or serve as a reminder of the owner's travels. Generally, all anyone really needs to make a terrarium is a vessel, a plant and a substrate for the plant to grow in. ""We've seen an increase in terrarium building for about two years now,"" said Melodie McDanal, a Pike Nurseries associate and Georgia-certified nursery professional. In terrariums, people use any plant that survives well in enclosed areas, including succulents, air plants -- plants that receive their nutrients from the air -- palms and begonias. ""There's a big variety now because the growers saw that it was doing really well,"" she said. Take CNN's Earth Day quiz . Moss has been a popular part of the trend, too. Its dense texture creates visual interest on a small scale, and it keeps plants moist like mulch would for an outdoor garden. Some moss can be used like a painter might blend colors on a canvas, Valdespino said. ""Reindeer moss, especially, is dyed in reds and greens and turquoise,"" said Terraria's Valdespino. ""When you tear it apart, it has this delicate, coral-like structure that is really beautiful in small spaces."" Sheet moss is a great option for wrapping small plant projects, like begonia balls. They're a Southern take on kokedama, an ancient Japanese hanging garden technique. Valdespino and her partner Vance McCoy took begonias out of their pots, wrapped the dirt in moss and then wrapped string around the ball of dirt. ""It's quiet greenery,"" she said. ""It doesn't get wild, it doesn't overgrow."" But as hobbyists are learning to make their own, they're as much about personal tastes and experiences as how they look in a room. ""The terrarium you make today is most likely not be the same as the terrarium you make five years from now. And that's a good thing because you're changing as an individual,"" Valdespino said. ""Terrariums are representative of you. These are little metaphors for you, for a place you've been or a place you want to go. ""It's not just a fern in a pot."" What's your tiny plant project?

"(CNN) -- In an unprecedented action, the NCAA is restoring scholarships to the Penn State University football team that were originally lost last year when the school was sanctioned for its handling of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. Sandusky, 69, a former defensive coordinator, was convicted last year of sexually abusing 10 boys he met through his charity. He is serving a 30-to 60-year prison term. But the sanctions against Penn State mostly revolved around an alleged cover-up by the university's former president, vice president and athletic director. All three men are facing trial in the spring on charges they lied to authorities and never reported an incident of sexual abuse witnessed in 2001 in the Penn State locker room facilities. The gradual restoration of scholarships was recommended to the NCAA board by former Sen. George Mitchell, the athletics integrity monitor for the university, for the school's ""groundbreaking work"" and ""strong commitment to restore integrity"" in the last year. Mitchell said Tuesday that the school has consistently cooperated with the NCAA since the sanctions were imposed. Mitchell said more than 120 reforms have been implemented, and Penn State has become a model for reform at other schools. Other sanctions levied last year, including a post-season ban, a $60 million fine and 13 years of vacated wins of legendary coach Joe Paterno, remain in place. Mitchell said he recommended a post-season ban stay in place, for now, to give the university a continued incentive to work toward reform. The NCAA has never before rescinded sanctions imposed against a university. The restoration will mean that Penn State's football team, under coach Bill O'Brien, will get five more scholarships next year, and 10 more each of the following three seasons. By the start of the 2016 season, Penn State will again have the full amount of scholarships. Penn State President Rodney Erickson said the change represents ""significant efforts over the past year to make Penn State a safer, stronger institution."" NCAA President Mark Emmert, who has been widely criticized for relying on the university's independent report instead of launching his own NCAA investigation at Penn State, said the board was ""pleased"" to make this decision. In making his recommendation to the NCAA board, Mitchell said he considered the sanctions that most affect student athletes. He also noted a great divide among the Penn State community over how the Sandusky scandal has been handled. The university recently settled lawsuits with several men who said Sandusky abused them. The role of Paterno, who died in January 2012, in the cover-up has been widely debated. In an internal investigation done for the university, FBI director Louis Freeh concluded that Paterno played a role, but former state prosecutors handling the case said they found no evidence of that.","Sanctions against Penn State mostly revolved around alleged cover-up by officials .

"(CNN) -- A host of Republicans is calling for the head of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius over the troubled health care website rollout. Thirty-three Republican members of Congress signed Rep. John Fleming's letter to President Barack Obama demanding that Sebelius be fired. But whether to sack her is not one of the questions we should be asking. The secretary spent 3 Â½ hours testifying before a congressional committee on Wednesday about the awful mess that was the launch of the federal website intended to allow millions of Americans to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Punctuated by moments of contrition and obvious frustration, her performance was intended both to signal resolve to the American people that getting the website fully operational was her principal priority and to shield the president from the slings and arrows of the many critics of Obamacare, who gleefully saw this as an opportunity to embarrass him and re-energize their efforts to derail the law. The news Wednesday was replete with stories of Obama's sagging popularity, and one can't help but tie this drop, at least in part, to the problems with the rollout. So what is he, as our nation's chief executive, to do? Should he heed those calls to demonstrate forceful leadership in a time of seriously flawed performance and fire Sebelius? After all, the argument goes, something like this would not be tolerated in the business world. The consequences would be swift -- the person responsible for the mess would be fired. And didn't she admit in her testimony that she was responsible? Yes, she did. But here's why the question of whether she should be fired is not the right one. Obama needs to keep his eye on the big picture. The issue is not Sebelius' future, it's what needs to be done to fix the mess. She has accepted responsibility and has specified a time frame within which she has said the dysfunction will be repaired. Obama should support the secretary fully in her efforts. It is much more important for the President in the long run to make sure that people can sign up for insurance coverage under the ACA than to finger a scapegoat and orchestrate a public beheading. The difference between forceful leadership and nuanced leadership is significant, and the context and circumstances should determine which -- or what blend of the two -- is appropriate. Whatever momentary boost a ""forceful"" action might give the president in the polls would not justify the potential long-term consequences of firing a Cabinet member who arguably has served well in turbulent times. Obama said Wednesday that he would take ultimate responsibility, acknowledging that the buck stops at his desk. Two very tough questions, however, lie ahead: First, what should he do about Sebelius if the mess isn't a whole lot less messy by the end of November? And second, what about his own political capital? Let's reserve judgment on the first one until the end of November comes around. At this point, my guess is that if implementation of the website hasn't improved very much, Sebelius will resign. Regarding the second, it's clear that Obama has a lot riding on getting the system to work ""well enough."" It might not happen by the end of November, but it will happen. It's not yet clear where the problem with rolling out the health care website really lies.  Why such a shambles? Early indications point in two directions: diffuse authority (no one was really in charge of the whole initiative) and poor execution (the contractors simply dropped the ball). As we learn more about how the website was designed and tested, we will be in a better position to figure out what went wrong and where. But for the time being, we don't know -- so why drop the guillotine blade and run the risk of beheading the wrong person? The problem is real, and so are the politics. Precisely because the ACA is so important to the President, its detractors see a golden opportunity to inflict possibly serious damage on its future. This is political hardball on steroids, and the grandstanding that we see in front of the cameras helps us understand -- as if we didn't already -- why 74% of Americans polled are unhappy with the behavior of Congress. Calls to fire the secretary are intended to put Obama in the position of seeming weak if he does not. So he needs to respond in a way that is seen as decisive yet supportive of the secretary. The rearview mirror on the health information exchange mess isn't quite in focus yet, because we're still in the middle of it. But it's true that little changes tend to have small ripple effects, and big changes, like the health care act, have huge ripple effects. And no change, little or big, is ever without a glitch. Life in Washington is a circus. There are many rings with different events going on in each, and all are vying for the audience's attention.

"(CNN) -- Utah multimillionaire Jon Huntsman Sr. said Friday the Salt Lake City cancer center that bears his name will get a $100 million addition, half of which is coming from his family. The 220,000-square-foot addition will be used to find cures for childhood cancers, and will double the Huntsman Cancer Institute's research space, said the 76-year-old businessman and philanthropist, father of former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr. Patients who are treated at the cancer center are teamed up with cancer specialists as well as researchers who are trying to find better ways to treat and, hopefully, cure them. The new laboratories will be used to further study genetic childhood cancers and cancers that affect families, including the three leading causes of disease death in children: leukemia, sarcoma and brain cancer. ""The only way to make progress on cancer is to keep delving deeper and deeper in the research technology."" says Huntsman. Cancer claims about 550,000 lives a year, something Americans have accepted as a way of life. But they would not accept losing 550,000 soldiers on the battlefield each year, he adds. ""The private sector should do more; the government should do more,"" says Huntsman. Huntsman says he wants to die broke because ""you can't spend money after you die."" His family ""has put about $400 million into the cancer center, and we've raised about a billion dollars for cancer research (overall),"" he says. For the latest expansion, ""the family is putting about half of it up,"" he says. He raised the rest of the funds from donors like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Utah Legislature and other major hospital groups in the area also contributed. Four-time cancer survivor gives back . Huntsman's riches grew out of a small plastics company he founded in the early 1970s. ""A small team that worked with me -- we invented the Big Mac hamburger container,"" he says. After selling that company, he founded Huntsman Chemical Corp. But long before he became a billionaire, Huntsman believed in spreading his wealth. ""There's just a certain joy in your heart to be able to help somebody else -- even when you're struggling,"" he says. ""When my wife and I made only $300 a month as a naval officer right out of college and I had debts to pay, we always gave $50 a month away to charity in addition to our tithing,"" he says. ""It was just something that in my heart I've always believed, that if you are generous and help others, you'll be blessed in your own life. And more importantly, it's just the right thing to do."" Huntsman spent more than a decade on the Forbes billionaire list, but he's fallen off it due to his many contributions -- something he's fine with. So far, he and his family have donated more than $1.2 billion to thousands of charities and individuals in the United States and abroad, and he's dedicated his life and fortune to curing cancer. That dedication goes back decades. Huntsman's mother, who taught him about the importance of giving, died from cancer, as did his father and stepmother. Huntsman himself has also battled cancer, and has survived prostate cancer, mouth cancer and two types of skin cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, one or two children develop cancer for every 10,000 children in the United States. While progress has been made in treating and curing children with cancer, it's still the leading cause of death by disease among U.S. children ages 1 to 14.","The Huntsman Cancer Center is getting a $100 million addition .

"(CNN) -- Just one day after the Federal Aviation Administration announced that airline travelers would soon be able to keep their personal electronic devices on throughout their flights, two airlines made changes. On Friday, a JetBlue flight from New York to Buffalo became the first commercial flight to allow ""gate-to-gate"" use of such devices, the airline said. Delta Air Lines also announced that it modified its rules regarding electronic devices as soon as it could. Until now, passengers in the United States were prohibited from using the devices until their plane rose above 10,000 feet. A ban on using cell phones for voice communication remains in effect. The FAA announcement came Thursday, and that same day, JetBlue asked to be allowed to implement the new rules. The FAA gave its approval Friday, and the airline implemented the rules immediately. Delta confirmed through its Twitter account that the FAA approved its plans, too. The FAA refused to say which airlines had applied for permission and which were granted permission, saying the agency prefers that the airlines release that information. When it announced the changes, the FAA predicted that airlines would apply the new rules by the end of the year. The FAA, following months of study by a group of aviation experts, said that airlines can allow passengers to use portable electronic devices such as tablets, laptop computers, e-readers and cell phones in airplane mode throughout the flight, with some circumstantial restrictions. The FAA had long said that using electronic devices during takeoff and landing posed a safety issue and that radio signals from the devices could interfere with an aircraft's communications, navigation and other systems. But a panel the FAA established last year to study the issue concluded that most commercial airplanes can tolerate radio interference signals. CNN's Jason Hanna and Katia Hetter contributed to this report.","The FAA this week announced that airlines can allow expanded electronics use .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Sandra Bullock will surely be popping open the champagne as her new romantic comedy, ""The Proposal,"" accepted the top spot at the box office this weekend by grossing $34.1 million, according to early estimates by Hollywood.com Box Office. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock have reason to celebrate after ""The Proposal"" takes top box office spot. Not only did ""The Proposal"" win the weekend, but it was by far the best opening of Bullock's career, nearly doubling the opening of her previous best, ""Premonition,"" which debuted to $17.6 million in 2007. While ""The Proposal's"" success was fueled mostly by women (73 percent of the audience was female), both women and men gave it a healthy ""A-"" CinemaScore rating, so expect the movie to hold up fairly well during the next few weeks. The weekend's other big release, the prehistoric buddy comedy ""Year One,"" landed in fourth place with $20.2 million -- an okay debut for the $60 million movie. However, all indicators point to a quick descent for the Jack Black/Michael Cera flick. ""Year One"" dropped 24 percent from Friday to Saturday (never a reassuring sign), and the movie received an unimpressive ""B-"" rating from CinemaScore. ""Year One"" is all but certain to join ""Land of the Lost"" as another box-office disappointment for high-concept comedies. On the other hand, ""The Hangover"" (No. 2 with $26.9 million) and ""Up"" (No. 3 with $21.3 million) continued to show off their box-office stamina, dropping only 18 percent and 31 percent, respectively, from the prior weekend. ""Up"" now stands at $224 million, and may levitate past ""Star Trek"" (currently at $239 million) to become the year's highest-grossing film. Finishing off the top five was ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,"" which fell an alarming 52 percent for an $11.3 million weekend stash. Also opening this weekend was Woody Allen's ""Whatever Works,"" starring Larry David. The New York-based comedy laughed up $281,000 from just nine theaters for a weekend-leading $31,000 gross per theater. The film will expand to more than 300 theaters on July 3. Overall, the box office was up 3 percent compared to last year's Father's Day weekend, when ""Get Smart"" debuted to a surprisingly sharp $38.7 million.

"(CNN) -- Young striker Mario Balotelli made a goalscoring return to Inter Milan's line-up as the Italian champions bounced back from last weekend's defeat to maintain a  one-point lead in Serie A on Saturday. The 19-year-old was welcomed back into the squad after apologizing during the week following his falling-out with manager Jose Mourinho, and helped Inter stay ahead of Roma with a 3-1 victory at home to Bologna. It was a successful end to a mixed week for Mourinho, who had announced his unhappiness with Italian football before Wednesday's 1-0 win over CSKA Moscow in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals. Brazilian midfielder Thiago Motta put Inter ahead in the 29th minute with the first of his two goals, firing in a shot from the edge of the penalty area after controlling the ball on his chest. Balotelli marked his first outing since March 7 with the second seven minutes after halftime with a cool finish following a pass from strike partner Diego Milito. Motta sealed a comfortable victory ahead of Tuesday's trip to Russia as he slotted in with five minutes left after a neat exchange with Dejan Stankovic. Second-placed Roma kept in touch with six matches to play following a 1-0 victory at mid-table Bari, where striker Mirko Vucinic returned from illness to net the winner in the 19th minute. The Montenegro hitman netted his ninth league goal this season after Francesco Totti combined well with Luca Toni, as Roma survived an earlier scare when defender Nicolas Burdisso had to clear Barreto's close-range effort off the line. Rodrigo Taddei missed a late chance to double the lead as Claudio Ranieri's team extended their unbeaten Serie A run to 22 matches. AC Milan remained two points behind Roma in third after winning 3-2 at mid-table Cagliari, with all five goals coming in the first half. Milan twice led through Marco Borriello and Klaas Jan Huntelaar, but teenage striker Daniele Ragatzu brought the Sardinians level both times before the hosts conceded an unfortunate own-goal in the 38th minute when goalkeeper Federico Marchetti knocked the ball onto teammate Davide Astori and into the net. Palermo suffered a setback in their bid to qualify for the Champions League after losing 2-0 at Catania, who moved seven points clear of the relegation zone. Maxi Lopez's first-half double meant that the fourth-placed Sicilians were joined on 51 points by Sampdoria, who won 2-1 at 10-man Chievo. Former Italy striker Antonio Cassano scored in the first minute and fellow forward Giampaolo Pazzini made it 2-0 in the 55th before the 14th-placed Verona side lost defender Santiago Morero following a second booking in nine minutes. Andrea Mantovani reduced the deficit on 76 but Sampdoria held on to boost hopes of a European place next season. Napoli took sixth place after a 1-1 draw at Lazio, who moved three points clear of the bottom three, as Juventus suffered a 3-0 defeat at Udinese in the late match. Udinese moved four points above the bottom three as Chilean midfielder Alexis Sanchez opened the scoring in the ninth minute, while Simone Pepe (65) and captain Antonio Di Natale (77) wrapped up victory in the second half. Fiorentina drew 1-1 at Parma to maintain eighth place on goal difference from Genoa, who were held by the same score at home to bottom club Livorno. Atalanta moved five points clear of Siena with a 2-0 win over the second-bottom side, but still remained in the drop zone.","Inter Milan maintain one-point lead in Serie A with 3-0 victory over Bologna .

"(CNN) -- Arsonists attacked the administrative offices of leading Israeli football club Beitar Jerusalem on Friday, police said. The attack occurred just days after the club signed two Muslim players. No one was injured in the fire, which was discovered around 5 a.m., police said. But the blaze damaged the club's trophy room. Last Thursday, four club supporters were arrested on charges of making racist chants, apparently directed at the Beitar's newest players, Zaur Sadaev and Dzhabrail Kadaev. They came from Russian League club Terek Grozny, based in Chechnya. On the same day they were signed, January 26, fans at a Beitar match waved a banner reading ""Beitar -- pure forever"" and chanted anti-Arab slogans. Four were arrested. The Israeli Football Association later fined Beitar $15,000 and ordered the club to close the area at the Teddy Kollek Stadium where the club's hardcore supporters usually gather. Meanwhile, investigators continue to figure out who is behind the arson attack. ""A thorough investigation has been opened by a Special Investigations Unit searching for suspects that fled the scene,"" police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the ""shameful"" arson attack in a statement issued Friday. ""We cannot accept such racist behavior,"" he said. Beitar's general manager, Itzik Kornfein, issued a defiant message, saying the club would stand by its signing of Sadaev and Kadaev. He said bringing them on was the ""right decision,"" despite the subsequent controversy. ""We will keep strong,"" he told CNN. ""The club won't change it's mind because of these criminals,"" he said. ""But I want to emphasize that a minority of people have been causing these actions. Beitar and most of its fans are not racist."" Rosenfeld said security will be stepped up ahead of Beitar's home match Sunday in the Israeli League against Bnei Sachnin, an Arab-Israeli team. Beitar, owned by Russian-Israeli Arkady Gaydamak, was founded in 1948. The club's crest features the menorah, which is also embedded in the emblem of the state of Israel. Throughout the club's history many of their fans have remained implacably opposed to the signing of Arab or Muslim players.","Beitar Jerusalem offices are set on fire days after it signed Muslim players .

"(CNN) -- Rapper DMX had another run-in with police in South Carolina this week, ending with a citation for marijuana possession. The arrest in Greer, South Carolina, comes four weeks after he was charged with drunken driving in Greenville, just one town away. DMX -- whose real name is Earl Simmons -- was a passenger in a Ford F-350 truck stopped by police for allegedly making an improper lane change Tuesday night, according to the police report. The police report said the officer immediately recognized Simmons, 42, and knew that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest for failure to appear in court for a previous charge. The officer reported seeing ""a bag of green plant material I knew to be marijuana"" on the passenger door where Simmons was sitting. The rapper denied it was his and then told police he ""had breathing trouble."" ""At this point, Mr. Simmons became very aggressive with his words and was making multiple idle threats,"" the police report said. ""The smell of alcohol coming from his person became very strong."" Simmons was placed under arrest for the warrant and also cited for simple possession of marijuana. He was booked into the Greer jail, but released on bail hours later, a police spokesman said. Hip-hop highs: Long on lyrics, short on rehab . The artist's publicist defended DMX in a written statement to CNN Wednesday. ""Although officers pulled them over for a minor traffic violation, DMX was asked to step outside so they can search the vehicle,"" Domenick Nati said. ""Officers then claimed that they found bags of marijuana in the floorboard and arrested X. No drugs were found on DMX or the other passengers and the alleged bags of marijuana were never shown to DMX or the other passengers."" Anitra Rhodes, 39, was charged with improper lane change and simple possession of marijuana after three bags of suspected marijuana were found under the driver's seat, the police report said. Nati said Rhodes is DMX's assistant. On July 26, troopers in Greenville pulled over in a 1978 Plymouth station wagon after spotting it traveling erratically, the South Carolina Highway Patrol said. DMX, who was driving, was given a field sobriety test and failed, the agency said. South Carolina authorities: DMX arrested, accused of DUI . The rapper was charged with driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt. DMX has faced various criminal charges in the past, including probation violation, illegal drug possession and animal cruelty. Maricopa County, Arizona, authorities said he was arrested five times after August 2007. That included a May 2008 arrest on drug and animal cruelty charges, when Simmons attempted to barricade himself inside his Cave Creek home, sheriff's deputies said. Simmons also ran into trouble while in prison, being placed on ""lockdown status"" and forced to eat only bread and water for ""jailhouse infractions."" In February 2009, he threw a food tray in anger at a corrections officer, according to the sheriff's office. In 2010 he was sent to prison after violating his probation. Four days later DMX was admitted to the Flamenco Mental Health unit for an undisclosed disorder.

"(CNN) -- Apple is testing iPhone display screens as large as 6 inches, according to a new report. The screens, ranging upward from 4.8 inches, would be a pretty massive leap from the 4-inch display on the iPhone 5. But don't expect to see them when Apple rolls out new iPhones next week. Citing ""people familiar with the matter,"" the Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that the bigger screens could signal a future move by Apple to offer iPhones of various sizes. That would put them more in line with their chief rival, Samsung, which has put a dent in the iPhone's dominance with devices like their Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lines. On Wednesday, Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Note 3, with a whopping 5.7-inch display that further blurs the boundary between large phone and small tablet. On Tuesday, Apple is expected to roll out two different iPhones -- an update to the iPhone 5 and a cheaper model that would be designed to appeal to buyers in emerging markets like China and India. Apple CEO Tim Cook has knocked Apple's rivals for making ""trade-offs"" in order to pack larger screens into phones, although he has not ruled out such a move for future iPhones. Opinions are split on whether Apple will also introduce other products, like a new iPad or a much-anticipated smartwatch, next week. The Journal report said the iPhones unveiled next Tuesday will likely have the same size screen as the current model. An Apple spokesperson, predictably, declined to comment.","Report: Apple testing bigger screens for future iPhones .

"(CNN) -- An animal control officer on disability kept 850 snakes, including two 6-foot Burmese pythons, while running an illegal snake business out of his suburban New York home, according to authorities who made the discovery on Thursday. Richard Parrinello, of Brookhaven, New York, kept the snakes in his detached garage, all neatly stacked in containers and at the right temperature, according to Roy Gross, chief of the Suffolk County SPCA. Burmese pythons are illegal in New York, and Parrinello's were taken from the house to a reptile sanctuary in Massachusetts while the rest of the snakes are still in his garage, according to Jack Krieger, communications director for the Town of Brookhaven on Long Island. Gross said all the snakes appeared to be in good health and there was no animal abuse or neglect. ""It was a well-maintained facility, it was very clean and organized, it was a business,"" Krieger said. By the numbers: Pets . Parrinello kept an online website, ""Snakeman's Exotics,"" which advertised a collection of pythons, boa constrictors and hognose snakes available for sale both domestically and internationally. After weeks of investigation into alleged workers compensation fraud, the town of Brookhaven, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Suffolk County Police and the SPCA executed a search warrant in Parrinello's home, where he lives with his wife and 10-year-old son, according to a news release from Brookhaven. Undercover investigators spoke to Parrinello, who claimed to have $500,000 in inventory stored on the premises, including snakes, turtles and turtle eggs, the news release said. Authorities also say they found a few tarantulas and a couple of freezers with frozen mice and alligator carcasses. 40 pythons seized from Ontario motel room . Krieger said Parrinello wasn't arrested or charged with any criminal activity, but he was running a business out of his residence in a residential area, which is a violation of the town code. Town Law Department officials are still investigating and will likely issue numerous violations in the coming days. When reached by telephone, Parrinello declined to comment. ""What makes this case especially egregious is that this individual was allegedly operating this reptile business out of his home, posing an unknown threat to the neighbors of this community,"" said Brookhaven Supervisor Ed Romaine. Peter Constantakes, spokesman for the DEC, said Parrinello was interviewed and issued two summonses for possessing wild animals without a permit and for possessing alligator parts without a permit, each one carrying a maximum fine of $250. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has banned the importation of Burmese pythons, along with three other exotic snake species and their eggs. While the pythons can run to double-digit lengths, University of Florida wildlife ecologist Frank Mazzotti said the average snake runs about 6 to 9 feet. They have no known predators.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- When Glynis McCants looks at Michael Jackson's life, she sees the number five. Numerologist Glynis McCants says that with his numbers, Jackson was a draw to fans. Jackson's talent was discovered when he was 5 years old, he came to fame as a member of the Jackson 5 and he planned a series of 50 concert dates in London, England, as part of a comeback tour before he died on June 25 at the age of 50. For McCants, a noted numerologist and author, those facts are very telling: ""Five is the number for drama, and it was in his life his whole life."" For many fans, the lure of Michael Jackson as a performer and pop icon was magical. Those who deal in the paranormal are tuned in to that magic. Numerology deals with the influence of numbers on personal characteristics and human affairs. McCants -- who has appeared on nationally syndicated television and radio shows and is known as the ""Numbers Lady"" -- said that by taking Jackson's birth date (August 29, 1958, or 8/29/1958) she could chart his personality. His was ""six life path,"" she said, meaning he was magnetic and drew people to him. That, coupled with the fact that he was born on a two day made him irresistible, she said. ""If you are born on a two day and are a six life path then America and the world seem to fall in love with you,"" McCants said. ""It's almost as if you always get a shot with that energy if you shoot for stardom, and then you can sabotage it,"" McCants said. ""Britney Spears was born on a two day, and she's a six life path; Lindsay Lohan was born on a two day, and she's a six life path; and Sarah Palin was born on a two day, and is a six life path."" Such people, McCants said, thrive on the attention. Psychic Eddie Conner said Jackson couldn't help but attract such attention, even if it resulted in a life of isolation. ""He's an old soul with an enormous amount of creative artistic energy that pours to him and from him,"" said Conner, who works as a ""soul intuitive"" in Los Angeles, California, and whose clients include celebrities he declines to name. ""Whenever he's doing his magic he's untouchable, and I think that's the reason everybody gravitates toward him."" And despite all of Jackson's troubles, Conner said he believes the star will have an opportunity at success and fame again. Unlike other souls that stay in the nonphysical realm anywhere from 70 to 150 years, he said, he believes the singer's soul will return quickly -- within the next 20 years -- because Jackson was such a perfectionist that he will want to ""pick up where he left off."" ""If not as a performer, then a Quincy Jones/Michael Jackson/whoever, the top producers that get mass [music] out to the world to uplift them,"" Conner said. Fans continue to gravitate toward Jackson even as they try to make sense of his passing because mourning him reinvigorates the energy and attention surrounding him, Conner said. ""He was untouchable when he was connected to his soul and what he came to this planet to do,"" Conner said. ""The average person looks at that and they believe that if they can touch it -- or have him touch them -- then maybe some of it would rub off."" The desire for such a connection can cause devastation now that Jackson is gone, said psychic consultant Jack Rourke, who has worked extensively in paranormal research and consulted for major Hollywood studios. ""Even though we've never met Michael, people create a symbiotic relationship with this image or this person,"" Rourke said. ""We project all of the positive aspects of ourselves, all of the wonderful things onto this image of perfection or near perfection that we see, and we imagine subconsciously that this person is in agreement with the deepest part of ourselves. ""When this is no longer possible because this person is gone, it creates a vacuum within us, so people need to maintain a psychological or even a spiritual stability by creating a fixed image of Jackson,"" he said. Rourke said he fully expects people to come forward claiming to have communicated with Jackson, but that any credible professional psychic or medium will not attempt to connect with Jackson for at least six months to a year and will only do so at the behest of a family member or an intimate friend of the singer. In the meantime, Conner said fans can still reach out to the singer's energy in a simple way: ""The greatest way to connect with Michael is through listening to his music.""","Numerologist says Michael Jackson's numbers add up to charisma .

"(CNN) -- Ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy is slated to stand trial starting on November 4 on charges of committing and inciting violence, state media said Wednesday. Facing trial alongside him are 14 other members of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, state news agency MENA said. Morsy, who is backed by the Brotherhood, will be tried at Egypt's Criminal Court on charges relating to his alleged involvement in violence that took place around the Ittihadiya Presidential Palace, the news agency said. U.S. to cut some military aid to Egypt after coup, turmoil . Egypt's military forcibly removed Morsy from office in early July. He has been in detention since then, and a military-backed interim government has been in power. In September, an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, drawing complaints from the international community. The Brotherhood, an Islamist group that rose to power after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, has called for the reinstatement of Morsy's government. Egypt has been in turmoil since Morsy's ouster, with the military and Morsy opponents battling Muslim Brotherhood members and others. Read more: What is the Muslim Brotherhood? In August, hundreds of people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed. Many of the deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo. Violence raged after Morsy supporters staged demonstrations a few days later. Each side blames the other for stoking the violence. The rise and rapid fall of Egypt's Mohamed Morsy . Morsy, who was backed by the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, was the country's first democratically elected president. But critics say he became increasingly authoritarian and forced through a conservative Islamist agenda during his year in power that alienated moderates. His ouster came after huge street protests calling for his removal. Western nations, including the United States and Britain, have urged Egypt's temporary government to have an inclusive political process. Egypt's interim foreign minister, Nabil Fahmy, told the U.N. General Assembly last month that the government is following a road map that will see nationwide elections by spring. U.S. military aid to be reduced . The Obama administration announced Wednesday a suspension of significant military aid to Egypt. The move, involving hundreds of millions in U.S. assistance to the Egyptian military, is the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to Morsy's ouster. ""As a result of the review directed by President Obama, we have decided to maintain our relationship with the Egyptian government, while recalibrating our assistance to Egypt to best advance our interests,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. The reduction involves a significant amount of military aid, including large-scale military hardware and cash assistance. Aid that will continue includes funds to uphold Egypt's obligations under its peace treaty with Israel, and money for counterterrorism and security in Sinai, where extremists have been able to set up base, Psaki said. The United States will also maintain nonmilitary funding that helps promote democracy as well as health and education programs. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman said that in the short term, the U.S. decision could have a positive impact for the interim Egyptian government. ""Immediately, probably, the Egyptian government is going to find it's going to gain somewhat in terms of local public opinion,"" he said. ""There seems to be a lot of frustration with the United States, given its role in Egypt over the last 2Â½ years since the revolution.""

"(CNN) -- Alyssa O'Neill sent a text to her mother earlier this month asking her whether she would take her to get a pumpkin spice latte the next day. Although her mother agreed, Alyssa was never able to try the drink. On September 4, the morning she was supposed to get the treat, the 18-year-old died of an epileptic seizure. ""We were just shocked at the sudden loss and didn't know what to do,"" her father, Jason O'Neill, said. ""So we tried to fulfill the one thing that she asked us. If Alyssa couldn't get a pumpkin spice latte, we would get them for other people and try to pass the kindness forward."" O'Neill had no clue how many people this random act of kindness would affect. Two days after Alyssa's funeral, the O'Neills went to a Starbucks in Erie, Pennsylvania, where they live, and purchased lattes for 40 strangers. O'Neill asked the manager to write the hashtag #AJO with a purple marker on each cup. According to O'Neill, the manager and employees, overwhelmed with the gesture, donated 50 drinks on top of the 40. ""It just kind of exploded at that point. We had somewhat of a following, but nothing like this,"" he said. Now the movement to raise awareness about epilepsy has gone beyond lattes. ""It was just random acts of kindness.

From Erie to Sri Lanka, the O'Neills have been receiving photos showing #AJO. The family knew of Alyssa's seizure disorder before the fatal episode. Alyssa was a high school cheerleader who hoped to become a nurse and help others with epilepsy. She was a first-semester student at Penn State Behrend. The O'Neills started the AJO Forever Fund to assist families of children with epilepsy and to bolster a scholarship fund for local cheerleaders looking to go into nursing.","Alyssa O'Neill never got to have the pumpkin spice latte she asked for .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Rafael Nadal's shock French Open exit at the hands of a player ranked outside the top 20 is already attracting suggestions that it may be the biggest upset in tennis history. Rafael Nadal faces media after his shock loss to Sweden's Robin Soderling at the French Open on Sunday . Nadal, the world number one had never lost a game at Roland Garros, winning the previous four titles in a row. However, Sweden's Robin Soderling proved too good for the ""King of Clay,"" beating him 6-2 6-7 6-4 7-6. The official French Open Web site called it ""one of the greatest upsets in Grand Slam history,"" while other news outlets have rushed to praise the Swede for the ""game of his life."" The result leaves the men's draw at the French Open tournament wide open -- with Roger Federer and Andy Murray now the highest-ranked players remaining. Undoubtedly a massive upset, Nadal's loss also raises the question of what have been the biggest men's Grand Slam upsets in tennis history. Is this is the biggest? Below, in no particular order, are ten of the most shocking.What do you think the biggest upset in recent tennis history is? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. 1. Robin Soderling beats Rafael Nadal, French Open 2009 Spain's clay master was unbeaten at Roland Garros and looking for his fifth title in a row when he was shocked by the 23rd seed Swedish player. Soderling was too good for Nadal, and deserved the win. 2. Michael Chang beats Lendl and Edberg, French Open 1989 American Michael Chang etched his name in history by winning the 1989 French Open aged just 17 years and three months. He beat legends Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg (in an epic five set final) to win the event and he is still the youngest winner of a Grand Slam. 3. George Bastl beats Pete Sampras, Wimbledon 2002 Swiss player Bastl was ranked 145 in the world when he took on the seven-time champion of Wimbledon, Pete Sampras. Bastl, who only got into the tournament as a lucky loser after failing to qualify, beat the American in five sets. 4. Mark Edmondson wins the 1976 Australian Open  The Australian only ever won one Grand Slam event, and he beat defending champion John Newcombe in the final to do it. The most remarkable point however, was that he was ranked 212th in the world when he did it. He remains the lowest-ranked player to win a Grand Slam title. 5. Goran Ivanisevic wins 2001 Wimbledon Left-handed Ivanisevic had lost the Wimbledon final three times before he finally won it in 2001. The eventual victory was a near-miracle, as he had only entered the tournament as a wild card. Ranked outside the top 100 at the time, he became the lowest-ranked player and only wild card to win Wimbledon. 6. Mats Wilander wins the 1982 French Open  The young Swede shocked the tennis world when at 17 years of age he beat the second, third, fourth and fifth seeds at Roland Garros to win the tournament. He was unseeded for the event. 7. Richard Krajicek beats Pete Sampras, Wimbledon 1996 Krajicek surprised everyone when he became the first Dutchman to win Wimbledon in 1996, but the biggest upset had come when he defeated Pete Sampras in the quarter-final. His win was Sampras' only loss at the grass tournament between 1993 and 2001. 8. Gustavo Kuerten wins the 1997 French Open It's no surprise that ""Guga"" was a Roland Garros favorite. When he won the 1997 tournament he was ranked 66th in the world and he beat three former champions along the way. He remains the third-lowest ranked Grand Slam champion. 9. Lleyton Hewitt beats Andre Agassi while ranked #550 The Australian went on to win his first ATP tour title after beating Agassi in the semi-final of the Adelaide International. The win over former world number one Agassi was remarkable given that he was ranked at 550th and only 16 years old. 10. Vladimir Voltchkov makes 2000 Wimbledon semi-final The Belarussian was ranked 237 when he managed to make it through to the semi-finals of Wimbledon -- becoming the lowest-ranked player to ever make the last four at the London tournament.","""King of Clay"" Rafael Nadal records his first loss at the French Open .

"(CNN) -- Nothing tempts hackers quite like a high-profile new target. A website is offering a bounty of more than $16,000 in cash and other prizes for the first person to successfully hack the Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the new iPhone 5S. The site, IsTouchIDHackedYet, was created by Nick DePetrillo, an independent computer-security researcher known for demonstrating hacks of smartphones, and Robert David Graham, owner of Errata Security, a cybersecurity firm. It invites donors to contribute to the bounty, which so far includes an assortment of cash, bitcoins (a form of digital currency), several bottles of booze and ""a dirty sex book."" A successful hack of the phone had not been verified as of Monday morning, although a German hackers' group claimed over the weekend to have bypassed the biometric security of the iPhone 5S by photographing a fingerprint left on a glass surface and using the image to create a fake finger to unlock the phone. They demonstrated their exploits in this video. ""We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you canÂ´t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token,"" said Frank Rieger, a spokesperson for the group, the Chaos Computer Club, in a post online. How secure is your iPhone 5S fingerprint? According to terms DePetrillo posted on Twitter, to collect the bounty a hacker must lift a fingerprint from the phone or elsewhere and reproduce it in such a way that will allow them to unlock an iPhone 5S in less than five tries. All the steps must be documented on video. ""The whole point of #istouchidhackedyet was to put up or shut up with regards to criticisms of Apple's Touch ID security and implementation,"" DePetrillo said Saturday on Twitter. ""I personally believe (for once) a company has implemented a unique feature (Touch ID) in a reasonably secure way,"" he added in another tweet. DePetrillo tweeted Sunday that he had been in contact with the Chaos Computer Club and was ""waiting on a complete video documentation of the process (of their hack) before declaring valid."" The iPhone 5S, which went on sale Friday, has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Apple calls the new security system Touch ID. Phone owners must ""register"" their print with the device, after which they can unlock the phone by placing a finger or thumb on the button. Other users' fingerprints will not unlock the phone, which protects it from thieves. The Touch ID system is meant for human fingerprints, of course, but it apparently works with animals, too. A Minnesota man posted a video Friday to CNN iReport that showed him using the paw of his pet Chihuahua to unlock his new iPhone. DePetrillo and Graham are so-called ""white hat"" hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems. Tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues, which they can then patch before users' personal information is compromised. Apple did not immediately respond to a request from CNN for comment.","NEW: German hackers' group claims to have hacked the iPhone 5S .

"(CNN) -- Sudan ordered a number of international aid agencies to leave the country Wednesday after an arrest warrant was issued for the country's president, a United Nations source in the capital city of Khartoum said. Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir waves to supporters in Khartoum on Wednesday. The International Criminal Court issued the warrant earlier Wednesday for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It accuses him of complicity in a brutal campaign of violence against the people of Darfur, in the west of the country. Sudan told as many as 10 humanitarian groups to leave Darfur, and seized the agencies' assets, U.N. deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe said. The aid groups include Oxfam, Solidarities and Mercy Corps, she said. The exact number of groups involved was not given and some groups were not identified, both to protect their people on the ground in Sudan and because they are hoping to reverse the decision. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon is ""concerned"" about the reported expulsions, a spokeswoman said. ""He notes that this represents a serious setback to lifesaving operations in Darfur, and urges the government of Sudan to act urgently to restore these NGOs to their full operational status,"" spokeswoman Michelle Montas said. Sudanese government officials ""have insisted on accompanying some (international non-governmental organization) staff members into their offices and taking lists of assets and staff,"" Montas said. She called the aid agencies who had been kicked out ""the main providers of life-saving humanitarian services, such, as water, food, health, and sanitation. Their departure will have an immediate and serious impact on the humanitarian and security situation in North Sudan, (and) especially in Darfur."" Sudan's ambassador to the U.N. declined to confirm any details on the subject. But Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad said: ""We will deal very firmly with any organization that is violating the hospitality and the laws of the country."" The Dutch section of Medicins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said in a statement it was ""outraged"" by the move, which leaves more than 200,000 of its patients without essential medical care. Other sections of MSF continue to operate in Darfur, it said. Oxfam, which is based in England, urged Sudan to reverse its decree. ""If Oxfam's registration is revoked, it will affect more than 600,000 Sudanese people whom we provide with vital humanitarian and development aid, including clean water and sanitation on a daily basis,"" Penny Lawrence, Oxfam's International Director, said in a statement. The agency's statement added that ""400,000 of them are affected by the ongoing conflict in Darfur -- where people continue to flee from violence and the humanitarian needs remain enormous. It will also affect another 200,000 poor people in the east of the country and Khartoum state."" The agency has 450 staff in the country, 90 percent of whom are Sudanese, it said. It emphasized in the statement that it has ""absolutely no links to the ICC. Oxfam does not have an opinion on the Court's activities, and our sole focus is meeting humanitarian and development needs in Sudan."" The International Rescue Committee, which has worked in Sudan for nearly 30 years, said that it had been ordered to close its programs as well. ""We are extremely distressed by the forced closure of our aid operations,"" said George Rupp, the group's president and CEO. ""It appears the international aid effort in the region is being shut down and that raises grave concerns about the welfare of millions of Sudanese people who rely on humanitarian aid for survival."" The ICC order to arrest al-Bashir is the first warrant ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. CNN's Terence Burke, Barbara Starr and Phillip Warrington contributed to this report.","Up to 10 aid agencies ordered to leave Sudan, U.S. source says .

"(CNN) -- ""Unguarded"" with Rachel Nichols premieres tonight at 10:30 p.m. ET and CNN's newest host sat down with CNN Digital to talk about hot-button issues surrounding athletes, her experiences as a woman in sports broadcasting and why ""Unguarded"" is far from your typical sports show. Below is an edited version of that discussion. CNN: How is ""Unguarded"" going to be different? What can the audience expect to see? Rachel Nichols: There's all kinds of sports shows and most of them are on sports networks. I did that for a long time so I like that stuff. I am a viewer of those shows. Those shows are geared toward hardcore sports fans who can tell you the third stringer on their favorite teams and every little detail. We want it to be a show for a more general fan that's looking at sports from the sort of bigger picture perspective. This is not the same show I would be doing on another network. This show is very purposefully on CNN. CNN: Most people don't associate CNN with sports coverage. How are you going to make CNN a sports destination? Rachel Nichols: I like to think of it kind of as opening up a newspaper. I think for a long time news on CNN was politics and hard news. Well that's the first section of the paper, really. Part of the idea is to have this be the whole newspaper. We're the sports section. I like the fact that CNN is saying, ""Hey, the broader audience is interested in sports, along with their finance and everything else, and we're going to be that component."" CNN: You were in China interviewing LeBron James. What was that like? Rachel Nichols: LeBron James is one of the most documented athletes in the world. Finding something new about LeBron James is not an easy task. However, one thing a lot of people might not be aware of is that every summer LeBron takes a trip for about two weeks to Asia and conducts the business that comes with being a global phenomenon -- promoting his sponsorship deals, generally trying to increase his popularity in that half of the globe, promoting basketball, shooting some commercials. It's a business trip and it's a pretty crazy business trip because like a lot of people on business trips away from home, he has to figure out things with the language, he has to eat food he's not used to, he's been on a plane and he's jet lagged; and I liked the idea that there was this crazy superstar having what many of our viewers will recognize as a common experience with the travel and the jet lag and missing your family. LeBron actually invited us. It was the first time he ever allowed cameras on this trip. We had all kinds of exclusive access with him. It was a great example of what ""Unguarded"" can do. Watch: LeBron James on what he eats in China . CNN: Do you feel certain camaraderie with other women in sports broadcasting? I noticed you sent a congratulatory tweet to Sage Steel when she was named host of ESPN's NBA Countdown. Rachel Nichols: Absolutely. There's definitely a ""we're all in this together"" feeling about it, at least for me. People love the word ""catfight;"" they love to pit women against each other. One of the things I love about women in sports broadcasting is that you actually don't see that. You really see incredible support. I know it doesn't make for as sexy a story that that's the case, but it actually is the case and the fact that you see the colleagues that you respect doing so well is really fun and, again, moves the ball forward. The fact that Sage is hosting NBA Countdown is a great example. I don't think that job would have necessarily gone to a woman 20 years ago. CNN: Is there a particular sport or major sporting event that you enjoy covering the most? Rachel Nichols: I'm an adrenaline junkie, so whatever time of the year it is where the sport matters the most, that's what I'm interested. Right now it's the World Series. When the NBA Playoffs are going on I'll tell you it's the NBA and so on. That makes me a huge bandwagon jumper, I recognize, but that's the answer. It's when stuff matters the most. CNN: What are your thoughts on how the NFL is handling head injuries? Rachel Nichols: We've seen enormous change in the last five years, and we'll see enormous change continue. I think the overall question is going to be: Is there a point where the information fans are hearing about what happens to these players from playing the game of football, the more stories we see, the more heavy hits there are, at some point does that diminish the ability to enjoy the game as you're watching it? What we have started to see is more and more parents who are saying to their kids, ""You know what? I don't think I want my kid playing football."" That's going to have a significant impact. Baseball used to be the national pastime. We have seen the NFL overtake that. There's no question that our most popular sport is football. That doesn't mean it's always gonna be football. CNN: Does social media impact the way you cover sports? Rachel Nichols: I pay attention to social media. The biggest impact I would say that it has on me is actually reading the athletes' social media accounts because the information that they give you is so much more insightful and provides so much more access than we got before social media. CNN: In the last year we've had a few current pro athletes say they're gay. Do you think we'll see more prominent athletes coming out in the future? Rachel Nichols: I do. I think that as we see more people talk about it in society and talk openly in society, we'll see the same thing reflected in sports and I think that it's fantastic that people are comfortable talking about who they are as people and the fact that sports is becoming more accepting of that is a terrific thing and something we should celebrate. CNN: Should college athletes be paid? Rachel Nichols: It's complicated. That's part of the problem. That's why nobody's come up with some genius solution. Do you give them a stipend? If you do, where does that money come from? The athletic departments will tell you that the money they use that they get in from this tremendous revenue from football has gone to the women's lacrosse team or the men's gymnastics team. If they use some of that money to pay the football players, then the lacrosse team or the gymnastics team doesn't get equipment or they don't get funded anymore. Do they pay all athletes? Does the lacrosse team also deserve payment? Is it just the football team because that team earns revenue? That doesn't mean we shouldn't pay these athletes. It doesn't mean that the answer should just be ""we give up,"" but I do think that it is more complicated than simply saying ""they should get paid.""","""Unguarded"" premieres tonight at 10:30 p.m. ET on CNN .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A car bomb detonated in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Saturday, causing material damage but no casualties, local officials said. The Benghazi Local Council said in a statement that the rigged car detonated in al-Majuri district outside a school used as a training center for local municipal elections. The blast damaged vehicles and nearby buildings, according to the council. The Benghazi Local Council said it holds the government and the Interior Ministry responsible for what it described as the ""dire situation"" that has ""plagued"" the city for a while with the lack of security highlighted by killings and bombings. In recent weeks there has been an uptick in violence in the city, most notably in an assassination campaign that has primarily targeted members of the security forces, most of whom held positions under the former regime . Over the past week at least four senior members of the security forces, including the head of the country's military police, have been assassinated in Benghazi. In a report released by Human Rights Watch in August, the watchdog reported the death of more than 50 people in what it said was a ""broadening wave of political assassinations"" focused mostly in the eastern cities of Derna and Benghazi. But in its report, Human Rights Watch said the number of those killed ""is probably higher."" No group has claimed responsibility for these attacks, and there has been public outrage in the city over what activists and residents say is a lack of accountability. So far no one has been brought to justice in the escalating violence in Benghazi. This week Libyans marked the second anniversary of the fall of the Moammar Gadhafi regime, but many Libyans are concerned about the deteriorating security and the increasing power of the hundreds of militias with different regional and political loyalties that continue to operate freely in the country. Following last year's attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, and a series of attacks targeting foreign diplomatic missions, there has been concern about the growing presence and activity of Islamist militant groups, some with ties to al Qaeda, mostly in the eastern part of the country. The weakness of Libya's central government and its inability to build an army and police force was underscored this month with the kidnapping of the country's prime minister by a militia force that seized him for a few hours before releasing him. Amid the growing concerns about the situation in the north African nation, NATO on Monday said it had agreed to Libya's request for the alliance to provide advice on defense institution building. NATO said it will create a ""a small advisory team to conduct this effort."" Many Libyans welcomed the move, but said this was something Western powers should have done two years ago following their military campaign that led to the overthrow of the regime.","A car bomb damaged buildings in Benghazi .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Come November 24, the eyes of boxing fans will be trained on the Cotai Arena in The Venetian Macao in Macau, the venue for what organizers say will be the biggest professional boxing match ever held in China. American Top Rank CEO Bob Arum is promoting the ""Clash in Cotai"" with boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao fighting Mexican-American Brandon Rios the main card. It will be Pacquiao's first fight in China. ""It's going to be a good fight. It's going to be a one of a kind fight,"" Pacquiao said during a promotion tour in Beijing last week. ""This is a good chance to promote boxing in China. Don't miss it."" One added attraction for Chinese fans will be the undercard fight featuring Zou Shiming, the 22-year-old boxer from southwestern Guizhou province. With 2008 and 2012 Olympic gold medals under his belt, the up-and-comer has served as the emblem for the re-emergence of boxing in China in the past decade. Zou made his professional boxing debut at the Venetian Macao this April, winning the ""Fists of Gold"" match in Macau's Cotai Arena. On July 27, he won another bout against Mexico's Jesus Ortegas in the same venue. Cotai Arena, which seats 15,000, is part of the 40-story, $2.4 billion luxury resort, The Venetian Macao, the largest single structure hotel building in Asia and the largest casino in the world. Macau, a tiny Chinese enclave near Hong Kong, has already eclipsed the Las Vegas Strip as the world's most lucrative gambling market. Last year, the former Portuguese colony, which like Hong Kong is now a quasi-autonomous region of China, made $36 billion in gambling revenue, six times its Las Vegas counterpart. This autumn, the ambitious Venetian Macao hopes to lure elite high-rollers along with boxing aficionados, including those in China. It started with street brawls . Boxing in China began in the 1920s in port cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou as a street sport among foreign sailors who sparred against local fighters. The sport spread largely unsupervised by the Chinese government, even after the Communists took over the mainland in 1949. In 1953, a boxer died after a bout in a big competition in the port city of Tianjin. Six years later, Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong banned the sport for its violent and capitalist characteristics. It took another strongman to rehabilitate boxing in the People's Republic. In December 1979, then paramount leader Deng Xiaoping met boxing legend Muhammad Ali in his residence, sending the message that winning medals in boxing is glorious. In 1986, the ban was lifted and teams of Chinese athletes started to train for amateur boxing competitions, including the recent Olympic Games. Cashing in on the ring . Arum, long famed for promoting the likes of Muhammad Ali, has set his sights on the vast potential of Chinese markets by bringing two cards. One is a world-class brawl between Pacquiao and Rios. Arum says Pacquiao, who boasts of 10 world titles in eight different divisions, will appeal to the crowd with his athletic prowess and legendary storyline. In between fights in the past three years, Pacquiao has served as a legislator in the Philippines, spearheading campaigns against sex trafficking while donating part of his boxing earnings to aid local hospitals and schools. ""Manny Pacquiao represents the best that boxing has to offer-- hope as an athlete and as a human being,"" Arum gushed in a recent press conference in Beijing. ""He has done more humanitarian work than any athlete in the world and certainly more than most people in the Philippines."" THE FIGHTERS: Pacquiao rises for toughest fight . Pacquiao attributed this philanthropic drive to his impoverished childhood. ""I entered politics because I want to serve the people. I want to help them,"" Pacquiao told the press in Beijing. ""My dream is not only to become a champion but to help people. A champion to public service."" The contenders . Pacquiao's younger and taller opponent, Brandon ""Bam Bam"" Rios, is better known for his dynamism and bravura. The fighter from Los Angeles has gained a large following among young boxing fans because he represents ""a typical young man in America,"" Arum noted. Rios, wearing a baseball cap with ""I heart Haters"" logo, said: ""I'll get ready to give Manny the best fight he ever had. He is a warrior, I am a warrior. That's our trait. It's going to be a hell of a fight."" ""We want to give the fans a really exciting fight,"" Arum said. ""Brandon and Manny will be hitting each other from the opening bell to as long as they last."" Arum's other card is the Chinese boxing sensation Zou Shiming, who Arum thinks could be polished into a superstar under the tutelage of Freddie Roach, Pacquiao's trainer. ""He's quite smart and a quick learner,"" Roach said of Zou. ""He'll get better and better."" ""The problem is that it is a different sport,"" Arum said. ""Amateur boxing rewards boxers for the quantity of punches, not the quality of punches, and professional boxing is more about the quality of punches,"" Arum said. ""We have high expectations of him improving as he goes along."" If all goes well for Arum, the Western sport of boxing might finally sink a long-delayed clinch hold over the East. Byron Tseng, Feng Ke and Audrey Shi contributed to this report .","Manny Pacquiao to fight Brandon Rios in the ""biggest"" boxing match ever in China .

"(CNN) -- Frankel's babies will be on the Christmas wish list for hundreds of potential owners -- but they'll need to pay up $198,600 for the honor. The four-year-old won all 14 of his races and racked up $4.77 million in prize money before retiring to stud following his victory in the Champions Stakes at Ascot in October. Each owner whose mare breeds with Frankel, will need to pay nearly $200,000 for the privilege with Frankel's owners expecting over 100 females to be impregnated in this year alone. Frankel retains unbeaten record in dramatic fashion at Ascot . Frankel will stud at owner's Khalid Abdulla's Banstead Manor, which is part of his Juddemonte Farms group after leaving Warren Stables, the yard of trainer Henry Cecil last week. ""The fee for Frankel reflects his merits as being perhaps the greatest racehorse we have ever witnessed,"" said Juddmonte Farms' general manager Philip Mitchell on the firm's official website. ""He is by Galileo, who is now recognized as the best sire in the world, and out of Kind, a winner of six races (from five to seven furlongs) and herself a daughter of one of the most influential stallions in the history of thoroughbred breeding, Danehill."" Fabulous Frankel: What made the thoroughbred so special . Frankel, named after American trainer Bobby Frankel who died three years ago, ended his career in perfect style at Ascot last month by winning the Champion Stakes.

"(CNN) -- We recently learned that U.S. intelligence agencies had at least three days' warning that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was preparing to launch a chemical attack on his own people, but wasn't able to stop it. At least that's what an intelligence briefing from the White House reveals. With the combined abilities of our national intelligence apparatus -- the CIA, National Security Agency, National Reconnaissance Office and all the rest -- it's not surprising that we had advance notice. It's not known whether the U.S. shared what it knew. More interestingly, the U.S. government did not choose to act on that knowledge (for example, launch a pre-emptive strike), which left some wondering why. There are several possible explanations, all of which point to a fundamental problem with intelligence information and our national intelligence apparatuses. The first possibility is that we may have had the data, but didn't fully understand what it meant. This is the proverbial connect-the-dots problem. As we've learned again and again, connecting the dots is hard. Our intelligence services collect billions of individual pieces of data every day. After the fact, it's easy to walk backward through the data and notice all the individual pieces that point to what actually happened. Before the fact, though, it's much more difficult. The overwhelming majority of those bits of data point in random directions, or nowhere at all. Almost all the dots don't connect to anything. Rather than thinking of intelligence as a connect-the-dots picture, think of it as a million unnumbered pictures superimposed on top of each other. Which picture is the relevant one? We have no idea. Turning that data into actual information is an extraordinarily difficult problem, and one that the vast scope of our data-gathering programs makes even more difficult. The second possible explanation is that while we had some information about al-Assad's plans, we didn't have enough confirmation to act on that information. This is probably the most likely explanation. We can't act on inklings, hunches, or possibilities. We probably can't even act on probabilities; we have to be sure. But when it comes to intelligence, it's hard to be sure. There could always be something else going on -- something we're not able to eavesdrop on, spy on, or see from our satellites. Again, our knowledge is most obvious after the fact. The third is that while we were sure of our information, we couldn't act because that would reveal ""sources and methods."" This is probably the most frustrating explanation. Imagine we are able to eavesdrop on al-Assad's most private conversations with his generals and aides, and are absolutely sure of his plans. If we act on them, we reveal that we are eavesdropping. As a result, he's likely to change how he communicates, costing us our ability to eavesdrop. It might sound perverse, but often the fact that we are able to successfully spy on someone is a bigger secret than the information we learn from that spying. This dynamic was vitally important during World War II. During the war, the British were able to break the German Enigma encryption machine and eavesdrop on German military communications. But while the Allies knew a lot, they would only act on information they learned when there was another plausible way they could have learned it. They even occasionally manufactured plausible explanations. It was just too risky to tip the Germans off that their encryption machines' code had been broken. The fourth possibility is that there was nothing useful we could have done. And it is hard to imagine how we could have prevented the use of chemical weapons in Syria. We couldn't have launched a pre-emptive strike, and it's probable that it wouldn't have been effective. The only feasible action would be to alert the opposition -- and that, too, might not have accomplished anything. Or perhaps there wasn't sufficient agreement for any one course of action -- so, by default, nothing was done. All of these explanations point out the limitations of intelligence. The NSA serves as an example. The agency measures its success by amount of data collected, not by information synthesized or knowledge gained. But it's knowledge that matters. The NSA's belief that more data is always good, and that it's worth doing anything in order to collect it, is wrong. There are diminishing returns, and the NSA almost certainly passed that point long ago. But the idea of trade-offs does not seem to be part of its thinking. The NSA missed the Boston Marathon bombers, even though the suspects left a really sloppy Internet trail and the older brother was on the terrorist watch list. With all the NSA is doing eavesdropping on the world, you would think the least it could manage would be keeping track of people on the terrorist watch list. Apparently not. I don't know how the CIA measures its success, but it failed to predict the end of the Cold War. More data does not necessarily mean better information. It's much easier to look backward than to predict. Information does not necessarily enable the government to act. Even when we know something, protecting the methods of collection can be more valuable than the possibility of taking action based on gathered information. But there's not a lot of value to intelligence that can't be used for action. These are the paradoxes of intelligence, and it's time we started remembering them. Of course, we need organizations like the CIA, the NSA, the NRO and all the rest. Intelligence is a vital component of national security, and can be invaluable in both wartime and peacetime. But it is just one security tool among many, and there are significant costs and limitations. We've just learned from the recently leaked ""black budget"" that we're spending $52 billion annually on national intelligence. We need to take a serious look at what kind of value we're getting for our money, and whether it's worth it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","U.S. intelligence agencies had some prior warnings about Syria's chemical attack .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Every morning at the crack of dawn, residents of a New Delhi slum gather by the railway tracks to do what most would only do in private -- go to the toilet. One by one, they arrive with water bottles in hand. Some try to hide, while others are less coy. Many seem unfazed by the trains that rumble past, blaring their horns, warning people to move off the tracks. This has been shop owner Mukhesh's morning routine for the past 40 years. ""I guess I do get embarrassed but what can I do?"" Mukhesh asked with a shy grin. India's vast railways system, which carries some 11 million passengers a day, is often called the lifeline of India. But one government official has dubbed it something else. ""The Indian railway is really the world's biggest open toilet,"" said Jairam Ramesh, Minister of Rural Development, at a recent bio-lavatory launch. ""Nearly 60% of the people in the world who defecate in the open belong to India, we should be ashamed of this,"" he said. Kalaiselvi, 24, was embarrassed to talk about it. In search of a better life, she left her village in southern India and moved to New Delhi a year ago. Little did she know she'd be struggling to find the most basic of facilities in the country's capital. 'Not a single toilet here,"" she said. ""I really feel very ashamed, men and women (go) nearby, it's really difficult conditions."" She said she only goes before sunrise at 4 a.m. and then after sunset at 7 or 8 p.m. Both Mukhesh and Kalaiselvi live in a settlement colony with 3,000 people, just minutes away from New Delhi's Commonwealth Games Stadium and a major five-star hotel. The neighborhood is typical of most Indian slums, small, one-room houses crammed with all the trimmings of modernity -- satellite television, refrigerators and air coolers -- but not a single household has a toilet. According to the World Health Organization, open areas are the only toilet option for an estimated 625 million Indians. A recent government census showed nearly half of India's households do not have a toilet, but more people own a mobile phone -- 53.2% of Indians have a mobile phone compared to 46.9% with lavatories. Kalaiselvi couldn't build a toilet even if she wanted to; there are no sewage drainage lines at her area. ""Out of 7,935 towns in India, only 162 have sewage treatment plants,"" said Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh International -- an NGO working to provide low-cost environmentally friendly toilets to India's poor for more than 40 years. Now Pathak has an innovative and simple solution that has helped transform the lives of millions of Indians. It's called the Sulabh Shauchalya, or Sulabh toilet, and it's based on a two-pit system. Both pits are attached to one latrine, but when one pit is being used, the other does the composting. No concrete is used and the soil naturally turns waste into fertilizer over time. It can be set up for as little as US$15 and it also only requires one liter of water to flush, while normal septic tank latrines require some seven to 10 liters of water. Sulabh International has built some 1.2 million household toilets and 8,000 public toilets across India. Pathak says the Indian government has made 50 million toilets based on the two-pit design. He's also taken the technology to 14 other countries in Africa. In a village in the Mewat district of Haryana, just under 62 miles (100km) from New Delhi, Sulabh has built a two-pit toilet in every household. ""Before we used to go to the jungles and we used to get bitten by mosquitoes and flies and get sick. Since the toilets arrived, everything has changed, it's much cleaner and a lot better, said Shakuntala, a local resident. It's something the villagers of Mewat take pride in -- they keep their toilets clean and say they feel like they have finally progressed. ""Mobiles phones are very useful, but with a toilet I feel we have more dignity. I only have one mobile phone but I have two toilets now,"" Shakuntala said proudly.","World Health Organization: Open areas the only toilet option for millions in India .
Most Indian slum housing lacks basic facilities such as toilets .

"(CNN) -- Park rangers have recovered the body of a Colorado man who fell to his death on the slopes of Wyoming's nearly 14,000-foot Grand Teton over the weekend, the National Park Service reported. Edward Tom was looking for a campsite in a strong storm Friday evening when he fell nearly 100 feet, according to the Park Service. Two physicians were in the area and rappelled down to him, but attempts to revive him failed, it said. Tom, 40, of Boulder, Colorado, was at a backcountry camping site known as Petzold Caves when the storm hit, bringing heavy wind and hail. He and a climbing partner planned to spend the night there before climbing the 13,770-foot peak on Saturday, the Park Service said. Grand Teton is the highest peak in Grand Teton National Park, located outside Jackson, Wyoming.","Edward Tom died in a weekend fall in Grand Teton National Park, rangers say .

"(CNN) -- Iranian intelligence officials have detained the sister of Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer and human rights activist said. Ebadi said Monday that three men and a woman arrived at the Tehran home she shared with her sister, searched the house and seized Nushin Ebadi, 47, and her computer. ""They have detained her so I stop my work,"" Shirin Ebadi, 62, told CNN's Reza Sayah in a phone call from London. ""She has done nothing wrong. She's not involved in human rights work, and she's never participated in any of the protests."" Nushin Ebadi's arrest came in the middle of a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests that has left at least eight dead, according to the Supreme National Security Council, although the Iranian government denies its forces have killed anyone. Shirin Ebadi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 for her human rights work, left Iran for a conference in Spain the day before June presidential elections that sparked an earlier round of violent protests. Friends, she said, warned her not to return to Tehran. The Nobel laureate said she spoke with her sister Monday, a few hours before the 9 p.m. visit by ministry officials while Nushin Ebadi was at home with her husband and two sons. Iranian Information Ministry officials contacted Nushin Ebadi several times previously, her sister said, telling her to leave their apartment and warning her not to contact her sister. Both women thought those demands were absurd. ""Not only does my sister not do any human rights work, she doesn't do any cultural work either,"" Shirin Ebadi said. ""They only took her because of me."" Information Ministry officials contacted Nushin Ebadi on Wednesday and told her to tell her sister to stop her work and stop saying the things she says, according to her sister. Nushin responded, Shirin said, that her sister was 15 years older and would not listen. Shirin Ebadi's law firm represents seven members of Iran's Baha'i Community who have been charged with espionage. She said she is certain Iranian officials are trying to intimidate her by harassing her sister, but, she said, she will not back down. ""They want to intimidate me,"" she said. ""The only thing they want is for me to change my work."" ""I am worried. I'm worried because she [Nushin Ebadi] was detained because of the work I do,"" she said, adding it was that work that made Nushin a target. ""She's not interested in this kind of work. She's not involved in this kind of work."" Shirin Ebadi said she advised her sister to contact an attorney when Information Ministry officials first began approaching her and that she did so. Nushin Ebadi and her husband are professors of dentistry at Azad University in Tehran, Shirin Ebadi said, and Nushin Ebadi's husband also has a private dental practice.","Ebadi left Iran for a conference in Spain the day before June presidential elections .

"Dali, Guizhou, China (CNN) -- Shi Wenchang has been an elementary school teacher in this remote rural village for 39 years but he doesn't teach his mother tongue, even though it's used by almost three million people. His job is to get the village, home to members of the Dong ethnic group, chattering in Putonghua, also known as Mandarin -- China's national language -- although he can switch into the local language -- Dongyu -- in the early years to bridge any gaps. ""When they start learning to write, they start learning the Han language,"" he says, referring to China's largest ethnic group, which makes up 90% of the population and is politically and culturally dominant. Teacher Shi thinks it's important they master Putonghua, which will enable them to seek work beyond the confines of their isolated village, but fears his language is disappearing. ""If we don't have our own language, there are many things, many stories from the past that we won't have and that will be a big loss."" The threat is not just the result of an education system that prioritizes the official national language. As China's economy has boomed in recent years, many have left their villages to work in coastal factory towns and returned more at ease conversing in Putonghua than their native tongue. Some slip into Chinese for even the closest family relationships, calling their mother and father mama and baba. ""Before we'd never use these words,"" he says. ""In our Dong language it's bu (father) and nei (mother)."" China is home to 55 ethnic minorities, but only two -- Tibetans and Uighurs in China's far West -- get much international attention, usually because of discord with their Han Chinese rulers and neighbors. The others are dotted around the country, with most, like the Dong, clustered in the poorer mountainous regions of southwest China. Ostensibly, there is little overt friction with the Chinese majority although Shi says when he was younger, he was afraid if Han people came to the village. As minorities, they are not subject to the strictures of China's one-child policy but carving out a distinct cultural identity is difficult. China is happy to have the appearance of ethnic diversity, but the wider trend is of gradual assimilation, says June Teufel Dyer, a professor at the University of Miami. ""It's a wrecking of their culture under the guise of preserving it,"" she says. ""People complain that their folk tales are rewritten to fit Communist ideals."" The Dong's cultural heritage is also weakening as a younger generation adapts to more modern ways. The ethnic group has a strong musical tradition and when Teacher Shi was a teenager, songs were used for courtship. Accompanied by a gang of friends, he stood outside the house of his now wife and declared his love for her in song. ""The girl keeps the door shut and you have to keep singing until they open it and let you in,"" he says, before plucking a stringed instrument off the wall of his living room to demonstrate he still has the knack. However, things have changed since his youth. Shi Tao, a 25-year-old factory worker back in the village for the birth of his son, laughs when asked if this was how he met his wife. ""Our grandparents did this, we do not,"" he says. Teacher Shi hopes that tourism may reinvigorate the Dong's unique culture and encourage younger people like Shi to stay closer to home and engage in traditional pursuits. The village, a picturesque cluster of timber houses surrounded by bamboo groves, has been designated a heritage site and earmarked for tourism development. ""The tourists will come here to see our people's traditions and culture. If more people come then maybe the preservation of our traditions will be stronger,"" says Teacher Shi. Elsewhere though, tourism has proved, at best, to be a mixed blessing. In villages already on the tourist trail, minority culture is a commodity to sell to passing crowds. ""Some villages become human zoos,"" says Dyer. ""Some are happy about what they get out of it but others resent it."" This spectacle is on display in nearby Xijiang, home to the Miao ethnic group, where villagers perform a live show every afternoon in a specially created outdoor amphitheater. It's standing room only and the audience laps it up. But, with girls performing in mini skirts and skits lampooning the group's predilection for drinking potent rice wine, it makes some older residents shudder. ""These performances aren't real Miao culture,"" says Tang Cheng, the village chief. ""People just want the entertainment factor."" The hope is Dali will escape the rampant commercialization that has engulfed some minority villages -- its development is being overseen by the provincial bureau of cultural heritage with help from a U.S. NGO, the Global Heritage Fund. Both organizations want to preserve the village's cultural DNA and hope it can become a UNESCO world heritage site. Still, the lives of Teacher Shi's three children, who all work outside their village, demonstrate that the chances of a cultural revival for the Dong are slim. In their 20s and 30s, one is an accountant in Wuhan, a large city in central China. The other two are teachers in the same province. They only wear traditional clothes when they come home. Shi has no grandchildren yet but is sanguine about the chances of his descendants speaking his native tongue. ""If they are always living outside the village, then they will definitely speak Putonghua, "" he says.","China has 55 official minorities but preserving language and culture is difficult .
Education system prioritizes national language Putonghua .
China likes appearance of ethnic diversity, but wider trend is of gradual assimilation .
Tourism a mixed blessing; some villages like ""human zoos"""
"(CNN) -- At points, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius sounded downright Orwellian in her testimony before Congress on Wednesday, such as when she explained that ""the website never crashed. It is functional, but at a very slow speed and very low reliability and has continued to function."" Prolonged periods of minimum usefulness, perhaps, but don't call it a ""crash,"" she said with a straight face. On the other half of the television screen, CNN showed a live shot of HealthCare.gov with the message displayed, ""The system is down at the moment."" But in the world of Obamacare, a mandate is an ""option,"" expensive is ""affordable,"" and now apparently failure is ""function."" Of course, the problem with Obamacare isn't just the website, and the loss in credibility isn't just the secretary's. President Barack Obama and other supporters of the law spent years telling the American people that ""if you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period."" They said detractors who suggested otherwise were lying. They said Republicans were just trying to scare people. The President and his allies were the dishonest ones, as is now clear to everyone. Even while they were promising Americans nothing would change if they liked their policies, ""the administration knew that more than 40 to 67 percent of those in the individual market would not be able to keep their plans, even if they liked them,"" as NBC News reported this week. Already more than 2 million people have had their insurance plans canceled -- three times as many as have signed up for Obamacare. Yet the President continues to insist, as he did Wednesday in Boston, that ""if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law"" -- of course, it was the law that made them ""substandard,"" by definition -- ""and you liked that plan, you were able to keep it."" In the same speech, he took credit for liberating Americans from those ""substandard"" policies. This is as good an example of ""double-think"" as anything we've seen in American politics. While the President and the other pitchmen of Obamacare have certainly lost credibility, however, Sebelius in particular needs to be held accountable for the launch failures. She added the problem of terrible management on top of the law's many flaws, and in doing so has put the health, financial security and personal information of hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk. Across the country there are people who will have to buy insurance through the exchanges in just a few months, some because Obamacare caused their policies to be canceled, some because Obamacare caused their employers to dump their coverage. Many of these people will face steep new costs that they weren't anticipating. But today, a full month after the exchanges went live, Americans who visit HealthCare.gov to find out what coverage they and their families will have and how much it will cost them must spend hours of frustration trying to navigate a broken system. Even more alarming, the secretary's bad execution of the President's bad plan could put thousands of Americans' personal information at risk. Sebelius told Rep. Mike Rodgers on Wednesday that she would have to get back to him on whether there had ever been a complete security test of the system. When the person who is supposedly overseeing a system into which hundreds of thousands of people are entering their personal information says she will ""get back to you"" about whether there has been thorough security testing, it is terrifying. And on top of everything else, the exchange website is a complete boondoggle. Sebelius testified the government has spent almost $175 million on HealthCare.gov so far, and the real tab will surely be much higher after the emergency repairs. Already, this is substantially more than Apple spent to develop the iPhone, and even (as I pointed out recently) more than NASA spent on the Mars Pathfinder mission. It likely makes HealthCare.gov the most expensive website ever built, and certainly the most expensive not to function -- although perhaps that word no longer means what we thought it did. These failures of management make the pain of a bad law even worse. I oppose the law. I have always opposed the law. I believe it will fail and cannot be improved. But most of all, honesty counts in public officials, and after Sebelius' testimony Wednesday she should have lost her credibility even in the eyes of Obamacare's supporters. It's time to offer her the option of mandatory retirement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of Newt Gingrich.","Newt Gingrich: Sebelius sounded Orwellian when she said website never ""crashed""
He says millions are losing their health care policies despite promises .
Gingrich says they will be forced to try to navigate a dysfunctional website .

"Washington (CNN) -- They smelled blood. And they pounced. Sebelius: 'I apologize, I'm accountable' Obamacare is one issue that unites Republicans and any opportunity to disparage the law was not wasted Wednesday as the woman in charge of implementing it, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee to explain what is going on with the program's problem-plagued website. As Republicans lobbed question after question and challenged her credibility and competence, Sebelius held it together, mostly. I'm sorry . It started with an apology. Sebelius apologized for HealthCare.gov being a ""miserably frustrating experience"" and said she is ""as frustrated and angry as anyone."" ""I'm accountable to you for fixing these problems,"" she said in the first minutes of the 3Â½-hour grilling. But it went downhill from there and Sebelius at times grew visibly frustrated. 'I was wrong' Sebelius didn't sugarcoat the website's problems. She shielded President Barack Obama from responsibility for the faulty enrollment website. ""I told the President that we were ready to go. Clearly I was wrong. We were wrong,"" she said. ""No one ever imagined the volume of issues and problems that we've had and we must fix it."" Crash . Then she did sugarcoat the problem. ""I would suggest the website has never crashed. It is functional, but at a very slow speed and very low reliability and has continued to function,"" she said as a video monitor in the hearing room showed that the website was down. The Republican National Committee launched an online Web campaign that included an ad with an overweight man lying on the floor saying, ""I'm not down. I'm just functioning at a very slow speed."" 'Whatever' ""Whatever,"" was one of her responses during a grilling from Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Mississippi, on whether Obama was responsible for the debacle. After responding, ""Whatever,"" the secretary put both her hands in the air, briefly, then resumed. ""He is the President. He is responsible for government programs,"" she concluded. Exasperated Sebelius to questioner: 'Whatever' A Republican senator who was not at the hearing, John Cornyn of Texas, put out a statement criticizing the secretary. "" 'Whatever' is hardly a fitting response from a Cabinet-level official being asked legitimate questions about how hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars have been wasted on a botched product that not only doesn't work but is also putting consumers' personal information at risk,"" Cornyn said. It then became a GOP talking point. 'Don't do this to me' During one grilling session in which Sebelius was aggressively asked why she isn't buying her health insurance through the exchanges, a visibly annoyed Sebelius had a ""hot mic"" moment that has become online fodder. At the end of an intense questioning session by Rep. Billy Long, R-Missouri, viewers could (barely) hear an audible moment of exasperation when she muttered, ""Don't do this to me.""

"London (CNN) -- The salerooms of London were last week crammed with art and antiquities from across the Islamic world, as the city's auction houses celebrated ""Islamic Week."" A growing interest in work from the region saw records fall for centuries-old pieces and contemporary creations alike. Auction houses Christie's, Sotheby's, Bonhams and Baldwin's all held sales of Islamic artifacts, from ancient carvings to calligraphy, coins and carpets. The biggest record was set at Sotheby's Orientalist Sale, where Russian painter Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky's ""View of Constantinople and the Bosphorus"" sold for $5,215,556 last week -- far in excess of its pre-sale estimate of $1,943, 530. The work, completed in 1856 by Aivazovsky, who was official painter to the Russian admiralty, sparked a bidding war: a spokesman for the auctioneer said at least five would-be buyers had battled it out to own the piece. Last year, Sotheby's set a new record for the sale of an Islamic artwork when an illustrated folio from the Shahnameh -- an epic Persian poem composed around 1,000 years ago -- sold for $12.2 million. Claude Piening, head of Sotheby's Orientalist department, said his field -- works depicting Turkey and the Arab World -- ""has enjoyed robust growth over the past 10 years ... because of new interest from North Africa and the Middle East."" That time period has seen a ""perfect storm"" of art collectors in the Middle East, according to Antonia Carver, director of Dubai-based art fair Art Dubai. Leading the way have been Gulf states like Abu Dhabi and Qatar and cities such as Beirut and Cairo, she says. Sotheby's also saw a record price for a work by modern Turkish artist Nejad Melih Devrim, whose 1952 ""Abstract Composition"" went under the hammer for $1,191,017 -- almost three times its pre-sale estimate. See Also: Modern art boom in Turkey . At Christie's, the proceeds of one of several Islamic and Indian themed sales will go to Oxford University's Bodleian Library, to fund the creation of a research post in Sasanian (early Iranian) studies. Highlights of the ""works on paper"" auction, all of which came from a single private collection, included sought-after items of calligraphy, such as a ""Mufradat"" manuscript -- a work of exquisite calligraphy -- and several rare Qurans, as well as Indian miniatures and portraits. The sale raised more than $2.4 million. Baldwin's sale included coins minted in Mecca, a rare glass weight for measuring silver, and the ""Magnus Princeps"" bronze portrait medal of Ottoman sultan Sultan Mehmed II, who conquered Constantinople in 1453. ""Mehmed II overthrew the Byzantine empire,"" explained coin specialist Graham Byfield. ""There are only two or three contemporary portraits of him in the world -- this is the earliest of them, and it is thought to be unique.""","London's auction houses hosted a week of sales dedicated to art of the Islamic world .

"(CNN) -- After being detained in the South Korean port of Jeju since Friday, the Chinese luxury cruise ship, Henna, finally set sail just after 7:30 p.m. local time on Monday. The ship is now headed back to China and expected to arrive at the Tianjin Dongjiang International Cruise Port near Beijing at 11 a.m. on Wednesday. The departure was confirmed by the ship's operator, HNA Tourism Cruise and Yacht Management Corp. According to HNA, by the time of departure, 1,558 passengers had been flown back to China after their vacations were interrupted by a South Korean court order and unexpected detainment. Perhaps the most shocking news surrounding the departure is that 87 resolute passengers, undeterred by the international commotion and four days in Jeju, were so determined to finish their trips that they chose to return to China with the ship. Henna saga . The Henna was impounded in Jeju on Friday by a local court following a seizure application filed by Chinese state-owned shipping company, Jiangsu Shagang Group, against Beijing-based travel organizer HNA Tourism, according to China's state news agency, Xinhua. Jiangsu Shagang Group filed the application with South Korean authorities due to a legal dispute with HNA Tourism, related to a legal proceeding over outstanding lease payments with an HNA subsidiary, Grand China Shipping. The Henna is under the ownership of Sanya Artemis Yacht Entertainment Co., Ltd, a subsidiary of HNA Tourism. At least seven airplanes were dispatched to fly the 1,659 passengers and approximately 650 crew members back to China, according to a statement from HNA Tourism. Passengers will receive compensation of approximately RMB 2,000 (about $250) for the stunted trip, said the company. Difficult detention . China state media reported that during the ship's weekend detention, two passengers suffered heart attacks; according to HNA, however, only one passenger suffered a heart attack. A child suffered from a fever. All were taken to a local Korean hospital for treatment. An HNA Tourism spokesperson told CNN the company believes the timing for the seizure was ""deliberate."" The Jiangsu Shagang Group filed its application on Friday at 4 p.m. local time, knowing many public offices would soon be closed for the weekend, according to an HNA spokesperson. HNA says the timing led directly to the suffering and inconvenience of its passengers.Â . According to HNA (link in Chinese only), the company paid an RMB 16,880,000 ($2.75 million) bond by 3 a.m. on Saturday to release the ship, after receiving the detention notice. However, the Jeju court delayed payment of the funds over the weekend. Representatives from the Jiangsu Shagang Group were unavailable for comment. Described by HNA as China's first luxury cruise ship, the Henna made its maiden voyage in January of this year. 'Lack of respect' toward Chinese . On its official Weibo page, HNA says South Korean authorities ignored the rights of Chinese tourists and acted ""inappropriately"" in dealing with the issue.Â . According to state-owned China Youth Daily, China accounts for 35% of tourists in South Korea, and that number is on the rise. The story of the Henna has gone viral on Chinese social media networks. Many Chinese Netizens question the detention order issued by the South Koreans. ""They shouldn't let the tourists suffer no matter what happened! This (shows) a lack of respect to the Chinese,"" posted one commenter. Anger has also been directed at HNA, following Chinese media reports that HNA's unpaid debt was the primary reason for the legal dispute. ""Someone loaned money to a villain, the villain doesn't want to return. Then, you ask people to shush, and not talk about it aloud,"" posted another Chinese netizen. South Korean officials in Jeju said that while the incident was regrettable, they weren't concerned about long-term damage to South Korea's reputation as a holiday destination for Chinese travelers.","Detained in South Korea since Friday, China's first luxury cruise ship has finally left port for home .

"(CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States will not let up its pressure on Iran over its disputed nuclear program despite recent diplomatic overtures between the two countries. ""We will pursue a diplomatic initiative with eyes wide open,"" Kerry said in Rome during a meeting Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ""aware it will be vital for Iran to live up to those standards other nations that have nuclear programs live up to as they prove those programs are indeed peaceful."" Despite a softening of rhetoric on some fronts by the regime in Tehran, there have been fears by other countries in the region that the United States might be too quick to offer incentives to Iran in the latest round of negotiations between Iran and the group known as the P5+1, which includes the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany. Netanyahu, who has said Iran's nuclear program poses an existential threat to Israel, was cautious in his assessment of the current state of play. ""Iran must not have nuclear weapon capability,"" he told Kerry. ""I think no deal is better than a bad deal."" For Netanyahu, any deal with Iran must include a prohibition on centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium to a weapons grade level, as well as the dismantling of a plutonium heavy water plant in Arak that has yet to come on line. ""They should get rid of the amassed fissile material, and they shouldn't have underground nuclear facilities,"" Netanyahu said in reference to the Fordow facility near the city of Qom, which was discovered in 2009. Netanyahu is not alone in his plea for the Obama administration to take a slow and cautious approach in the latest round of negotiations. Members from both parties in Congress have urged the administration not to loosen any of the sanctions that are choking Iran's economy prematurely. Legislation is being drafted that could tighten the sanctions regime until a deal is reached. ""No deal is better than a bad deal,"" Kerry said echoing Netanyahu as the two began approximately seven hours of talks about Iran, Syria, and the peace process with the Palestinians. ""But if this can be solved satisfactorily, diplomatically, it is clearly better for everyone."" The next round of talks with Iran and the P5+1 is scheduled to take place next month in Geneva.","Kerry: ""We will pursue a diplomatic initiative with eyes wide open""

"(CNN) -- A 6-year-old girl has died after her 8-year-old brother took her on a joyride in their mother's car and crashed Wednesday night in South Phoenix, police said. The children's mother believed they had been kidnapped when she discovered they were missing, said Sgt. Steve Martos of the Phoenix Police Department. ""It's a tragic story, all the way round,"" said Martos, who did not give the children's names. The mother gave the children a bath and put them to bed around 9:30 p.m., he said. The children's grandmother, who lives nearby, was driving home when saw her daughter's front door open. She went in, woke up the woman, and they discovered both the children were missing, Martos said. As they came out to check with neighbors, the children's mother discovered that her car -- a 2010 Hyundai Elantra which had been parked outside -- was also gone, Martos said. The frantic mother called 911 around 10:25 p.m., saying she believed someone had kidnapped her children. Police said they started to get numerous 911 calls starting around 10:15 p.m. One caller said the car had struck a fence. Another who followed the vehicle reported that children were inside. At around 10:30 p.m., when police tried to pull the vehicle over, it veered to the right and hit a pole, Martos said. ""This was one of those situations when the officers believed they were trying to rescue kids from a possible kidnapper,"" Martos said. ""When they ran up to the vehicle, they found an 8-year-old in the driver's seat, and a 6-year-old in the passenger seat, severely injured."" Responding officers started life-saving measures until the fire department arrived, Martos said. Both the children were dressed in their pajamas. The 6-year-old was not wearing a seat belt. The air bag did not deploy. The mother, who lives within a block of the where the accident occurred walked to the scene and discovered that her children were in the car. The 6-year-old died around 4 a.m. Thursday in a local hospital. The 8-year-old boy was treated for minor injuries. Martos said at this point they do not know what prompted the 8-year-old to take his mom's car. They have not spoken to the boy, but no criminal complaints are expected to be filed, he said.

"(CNN) -- Some skygazers along the East Coast of North America witnessed a spectacular solar eclipse Sunday morning. The eclipse was visible for a few minutes from parts of North America, South America, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. NASA said the eclipse would be one of the most interesting solar events of the year, because it was a hybrid annular-total eclipse. That means for part of its path, it was an annular eclipse -- where a thin ring of sunlight is visible around the moon's shadow -- and for another part, it was a total eclipse. That phenomenon was only visible from a narrow band of the North Atlantic and equatorial Africa, NASA said. In a much broader area, viewers saw a partial eclipse. But photographers in the eastern United States liked what they saw. Jeff Raybould photographed the eclipse from his apartment in Wilmington, Delaware. ""I'm on the 15th floor, and I knew I had a great view of the sunrise, so I set my alarm and crossed my fingers that the clouds would cooperate,"" he said. For him, the eclipse lasted only five minutes before the sun ducked behind the clouds. ""By that time it was too hard to observe anyway due to the increasing brightness of the sun,"" he explained. ""But I'm glad the clouds cooperated. I've never seen a solar eclipse and just found out yesterday that I would have a prime opportunity this morning."" Military photojournalist Matthew Hecht woke up at 6 a.m. to see the much-anticipated eclipse. An avid follower of space and science news, Hecht set his camera up in front of his home in Absecon, New Jersey, and started taking photographs. ""I pointed the camera and tried not to look through the lens because it was so intense. I was constantly adjusting the camera to make sure I was still pointing at it. I just got lucky,"" he said about the images he captured. Despite reports that the eclipse would only last a few minutes, Hecht says he was surprised to see the event last more than 10 minutes. ""It was unbelievably vivid. I have never seen an eclipse at sunrise before. It was actually very haunting. It looked like something out of a movie,"" he said. Greg Hogan said he only saw the partial eclipse for a few short minutes. Hogan photographed the eclipse during a chance opportunity. He read about the event the night before but forgot about it soon after. When he woke up Sunday morning, he realized the eclipse would be happening in 20 minutes. He put his 5-year-old son and 6-year-old nephew in his car while they were all still in their pajamas and drove them to the highest point in their town of Bonaire, Georgia, which is an elementary school called Hilltop. ""There were a few other people hanging out there to see the eclipse. It was surprising, but sort of neat,"" he said. He and his boys watched the eclipse happen over the horizon. ""My kids thought it was really cool. They are really into Minecraft -- a video game where you watch the sun rise and set -- and showing them a real life version of that was great,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Let's play a little game. Which of the following signs did protestors hold at the March on Washington, 50 years ago this week, and which were held up this year by fast-food workers: . 1. ""WE MARCH FOR HIGHER MINIMUM WAGES . COVERAGE FOR ALL WORKERS NOW!"" 2. ""WE ARE WORTH MORE"" 3. ""I AM A MAN"" 4. ""WE MARCH FOR JOBS FOR ALL . A DECENT PAY NOW!"" The exclamation points, which apparently were more popular in the 1960s (despite what Twitter would have you believe!!!), are your best clue. Signs one and four are from 1963. Two and three are from 2013. Fifty years later, it's easy to forget that the full name of the 1963 ""March on Washington"" was actually ""The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom."" Sutter: 99 must-reads on economic inequality . But flip through some pictures from that rally, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous ""I Have A Dream"" speech and where civil rights leaders, to borrow his words, bent the arc of history towards justice and greater equality, and you'll see protest signs that put the economy as a front-and-center issue, just as it is now. ""CIVIL RIGHTS . PLUS FULL EMPLOYMENT . EQUALS FREEDOM."" President Obama, in commemorating the 50th anniversary of that march this week, smartly picked up on the theme that economic equality is ""the great unfinished business"" of King's vision for a just and fair America. ""...[A]s we mark this anniversary, we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks had joined the ranks of millionaires; it was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard, regardless of race, into the ranks of a middle-class life,"" Obama said Wednesday. ""The test was not and never has been whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few. It was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many, for the black custodian and the white steelworker, the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran."" The subtext of his argument: Class may be the new race. It's not that all battles for racial equality have been won -- they haven't -- or that we live in a post-racial society. But, in some remarkable and troubling ways, class has become an increasingly significant barrier to equality in modern America. The gap between rich and poor has been growing in the United States since the late 1970s, and our level of income inequality, one proxy measure for that gap, is now on par with many sub-Saharan African countries. Sutter: Who cares about the economy? ... You! It's become more difficult for the poor to move up into the middle class and more difficult for the middle to dig in its heels to stop from slipping into poverty. The American mantra of ""work hard and you'll get ahead"" is not always enough to sustain people. It's harder now to secure a financial future. This is the theme that underlies much of what's happening in America today. And it's something that goes back much farther than the recent recession. The fast-food workers, for example, who scheduled demonstrations across the country on Thursday, are frustrated by the fact that they can't make ends meet on $7.25 per hour. If you doubt whether that's true, please take a look at one fast-food worker's budget. Some workers, as Forbes reports, have to choose between paying for rent or food. ""Should I pay my light bill (or) should I pay my gas?"" one fast-food worker asks in this CNNMoney video. ""I never can pay it all at once."" ""Right now the gas is off,"" she says. The workers demand a living wage of $15 per hour. I'm not sure what the fair wage would be. That's the subject for another column...or perhaps a book. But I do know that, as The Atlantic reports, fast-food workers in Australia make $14.50 an hour, about twice the U.S. minimum wage. And burgers haven't become too expensive Down Under. Some context is helpful for understanding that movement as well. The U.S. minimum wage is actually lower than it was in the late 1960s. Five years after King's speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the federal minimum wage, when converted into 2013 dollars, was $10.70, compared to $7.25 now. (The nominal minimum wage, according to the Congressional Research Service, was only $1.60 per hour in 1968. The $10.70 amount is adjusted for inflation). Sutter: White House should pay its interns . Education is another example. There's evidence poverty is a better indicator of educational achievement than race. ""According to a 2011 research study by Stanford sociologist Sean Reardon, the test-score gap between the children of the poor (in the 10th percentile of income) and the children of the wealthy (in the 90th percentile) has expanded by as much as 40% and is now more than 50% larger than the black-white achievement gap -- a reversal of the trend 50 years ago,"" Sarah Garland writes for The Atlantic. ""Underprivileged children now languish at achievement levels that are close to four years behind their wealthy peers."" Four years behind their peers. Just because of their income. That challenges the very notion of who we are as Americans. We see ourselves as a middle-class country -- a place where anyone can work hard and succeed. And many do. We're a country of fighters. But it's become more difficult for the non-rich to make it. The country has made great strides toward racial equality since the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But, in the 50 years since King's speech, economic justice seems to have become the more distant dream. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Fast-food workers scheduled protests across the country this week .

"(CNN) -- When I first meet Zaha Hadid she's as tight-lipped as a closed door. This is a woman who doesn't do idle chit chat. Why would you when you're the world's most famous female architect? Asked if people needed to be a little afraid of her, the brusque answer is ""No,"" before shooting me a case-closed expression. ""I think people are always intimidated by something. I don't do things that scare people off."" ""Full of lies,"" is her response, when I refer to one article in which she demanded flight crew swap her plane, while taxiing on a runway. Forty minutes later, Hadid has softened somewhat, opening the door on a remarkable life that began in 1950s Baghdad, before smashing through the ""boy's club"" of international architecture, to become one of the most celebrated -- and divisive -- designers on the planet. Perhaps the urban legends about her formidable demeanor are part of the mystique that has built up around the 63-year-old Iraqi-born Briton, who today boasts over 400 staff and 950 projects in 44 countries -- including plans for Japan's 2020 Olympic Stadium and the recently opened Serpentine Sackler gallery in London's Hyde Park. Dozens of models of Hadid's distinctive white, sweeping, space-age designs sit on undulating plinths in her gallery in east London's fashionable Clerkenwell. The installation is called ""City of Towers,"" and sitting a little behind this mini metropolis is the creator herself, dressed in a black cloak at a long table of rippling glass. ""Frames like veins"" Her latest project is for German superyacht builders Blohm+Voss -- the same company behind billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich's ""Eclipse,"" the second-largest private yacht in the world. On the wall behind her, a plasma screen flashes computer-generated images of her six boats, their gleaming exoskeleton frames seamlessly weaving together each luxurious level. They range from a 128-meter ""master prototype"" to a 90-meter version called ""Jazz."" There's barely a right angle in sight. So just what goes on in the mind of an architect who has created buildings with the most intriguing shapes? ""The idea was that the frames could be like veins,"" explained Hadid. ""I like this kind of project because every time you do them, you learn about some other type of parameters which you had not always considered. ""Unfortunately, architecture, as much as we'd like it to float, it doesn't. That's one thing that's different -- architecture is tied to gravity."" ""I never took 'no' for an answer"" Gaze across the sweeping roof of Hadid's London Aquatic Centre or the overlapping limbs of Rome's MAXXI museum, and you get the feeling these fluid forms are not harnessed by gravity at all. For fans, they're beguiling creations which redefined architecture for the modern age. For detractors, they're overbearing and over budget. Either way, there's no denying Hadid's phenomenal success, the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize in 2004 -- regarded as architecture's Nobel -- and in the last decade going from the architect who never built anything to the architect who built everything. ""I never took no for an answer. I never sat back and said 'walk all over me, it's OK,'"" she says about her headstrong approach. ""In London it was very timid, people behave well, they're polite -- especially if you're a woman. A woman should behave properly. It means that you don't challenge the situation."" Indeed, when Vienna's MAK museum had an exhibition of her work in 2003, attendants wore t-shirts emblazoned with Hadid quotes such as, ""Would they still call me a diva if I was a man?"" Is there a defiant twinkle in her eye as she recalls the incident? ""If you're a man you're seen as someone who's tough and ambitious,"" she says. ""But when a woman is ambitious it's seen as bad. I think things have changed in the last 20 years. They're better. But there's still prejudice."" From an outside perspective, Hadid's determination has paid off, finally cracking the notoriously masculine world of architecture. She disagrees. ""I think it's a boys' club everywhere,"" she says. ""And I'm not privy to that world so much -- they go fishing, they go golfing, they go out and have a drink. And as a woman you're excluded from that bonding. It's a big difference."" ""We were building a new world"" Hadid grew up in a Bauhaus-inspired home in Baghdad, her father leader of the Iraqi Progressive Democratic Party, a man who highly valued education. She and her two brothers were sent to boarding school in England, before later gaining a degree in mathematics from the American University of Beirut. As a teen she was inspired by a 1960s post-war boom in modernist architecture, when exciting new designs made the cover of Time magazine. ""There was a sense of optimism, we were building a new world that was demolished during the war,"" she said. ""There were new ideas, new materials."" At 22 she moved to London to train at the radical Architectural Association, under the tutelage of influential Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, who famously called her ""a planet in her own inimitable orbit."" What did he mean by that? ""I often wonder that myself,"" Hadid says with a chuckle, revealing a cheeky gap-toothed smile. ""When he said it at the time, I was upset. But in a way he was right -- I should not have a conventional career and he was absolutely spot on."" The renegade planet that is Hadid kept hurtling forward, setting up her own London practice and, in 1993, completing her first building -- the Vitra Fire Station in Germany. She recently returned for its 20th anniversary. ""When I go back 20 years later, buildings look very different -- they're either smaller or not as you expect them."" But it was the 1995 Cardiff Bay Opera House in Wales -- a commission she won twice, but was thwarted by local politicians -- which nearly ended her career, and helped shape the steely woman who last year was honored by Queen Elizabeth for her services to architecture. ""I know a lot of people thought I would give up, because it was such an awful, painful experience. I remember the day it happened I thought, 'I will not let this finish me.' In a way, it saved me. I think it did make me stronger,"" she said. ""I wouldn't build a prison"" Today, it's difficult to imagine many developers turning down the celebrity architect, her buildings dotted everywhere from Beijing to Azerbaijan. Is she concerned about the human rights credentials of the countries she works in? ""As an architect, if you can in any way alleviate an oppressive situation, or elevate a culture, then I think that you should. It's different if someone asks you to build a prison -- I wouldn't do it. But if I'm doing a museum or a library, I think that's different,"" she said. And the conditions of the construction workers? ""It's not your responsibility really. I think different nations should take care of their workforce. ""As an architect, if you are involved in every layer then honestly you don't do anything. I'm not saying I shouldn't be thinking about it, but I think it's a job for the politicians, for the media, for the locals, to deal with it."" One country yet to host a Hadid original is her native Iraq, though she has been commissioned to build Baghdad's new central bank -- when that will actually happen is anyone's guess. But you get the feeling that no matter how hugely successful Hadid is, she will always paint herself as the feisty underdog -- as much a part of her distinctive brand as undefinable space-age shapes. ""When you're younger you just want to bang ahead. But it is very tiring, this constant fighting,"" she said. ""Of course, we are more accepted now, but there's always a reminder of the time when they resisted -- the only fundamental difference is before they resisted because they thought we were crazy. ""Now they resist because they think we're successful.""","Exclusive interview with world's most famous female architect Zaha Hadid .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The family of Georgia teen Ayvani Perez got a call hours after she was abducted demanding money and drugs for her safe return, according to a criminal affidavit filed Thursday. Kidnappers did ultimately free Ayvani -- without getting anything in return -- leaving her at an aunt's house in Conyers, Georgia, and ending a harrowing 36-hour ordeal that began 25 miles away with a brazen pre-dawn break-in punctuated by gunshots, threats and screams. While there's no dispute young Ayvani was abducted against her will, there are questions as to whether it was a random act. The affidavit's claim that her kidnappers asked for drugs, in addition to money, in their phone calls may speak to this point. A man tied to this week's kidnapping, Juan Alberto Contreras-Rodriguez, was one of five arrested in a 2012 raid in Henry County, south of Atlanta, in which authorities found 500 pounds of marijuana, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents told CNN affiliate WSB-TV. One of those arrested with him -- on a marijuana trafficking charge, which was later dropped -- was Ayvani's mother, Maria Corral. Corral was at the center of this week's drama in the community of Ellenwood, where two men toting handguns pried open her back door around 2 a.m. She hid in a closet with two of her children and their dog before the intruders realized where Corral and the children were hiding, and kicked in the door, according to the federal affidavit filed to support a complaint and arrest warrant against one of the suspects. The men demanded money and jewelry from Corral, but she refused. Around that time, the dog Ayvani had been holding jumped out of her arms and began barking -- at which point one of the suspects shot the animal, who later died. Ayvani was eventually forced at gunpoint down the stairs, then eventually out the back door, over a fence, then behind several houses with the two kidnappers, an FBI agent wrote in the affidavit. And the men did not turn back when Corral went outside screaming her daughter's name. Later that morning, a man phoned Ayvani's family several times telling them that the 14-year-old girl was unharmed, and making his demands. Authorities were able to trace that phone to a man named Wildrego Jackson. Jackson's girlfriend later said she'd loaned him a gray Dodge Challenger she'd rented, which was similar to one spotted by neighbors around the crime scene that Tuesday morning, the federal affidavit said. The two kidnapping suspects pictured in sketched released this week by FBI investigators remain at large. But two others have been arrested in connection with the case: Contreras-Rodriguez and Jackson, a 29-year-old Atlanta man. Jackson is being held on charges of conspiracy to kidnap a minor female. The criminal complaint alleges he used a cellular phone in commission of this crime: In fact, the affidavit ties him to two phones used around the abduction site. Contreras-Rodriguez, a 40-year-old Mexican national, is being held on immigration-related charges. Authorities haven't detailed how these two men were arrested, beyond Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter saying it happened ""through hardcore police work."" Porter focused more on the fact young teenager was unharmed, and back home. ""This is a good day for the Perez family, but more importantly for Ayvani,"" he said. ""She is safe.""","NEW: An affidavit says Ayvani Perez's family was called hours after abduction .

"(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson achieved it on his Old Trafford debut but David Moyes has had to wait a little longer. After a mixed start to the Premier League season (win/draw/loss) and a vaguely farcical conclusion to the transfer window, United's new boss can now quietly rejoice after his first home win. A win was always on the cards. Their opponents -- Premier League new boys Crystal Palace -- last won a league fixture at the ""Theatre of Dreams"" way back in 1989. And United hadn't lost to a newly-promoted side on home soil for 12 years. The first of United's two goals came courtesy of a controversial penalty awarded on the stroke of half time when Kagisho Dikgacoi was adjudged to have brought down Ashley Young. The South African midfielder was giving his marching orders by the referee before Robin van Persie calmly converted the spot kick. Read more: Bale scores on Real Madrid debut . Ten-men Palace did well to deny United more goals for most of the second half, but a decisive second eventually came courtesy of a Wayne Rooney free-kick nine minutes from the end. The English striker, who returned to action after gashing his forehead in training late last month, fired home from 25 yards to ensure all three points for Moyes' team. Read more: Eto'o: 'It's not about the money' ""Like any manager, to win a game, there's always an element of relief. I'm pleased to get the first win out of the way,"" Moyes said. ""I think if we had lost I don't think I'd have been talking to much about it, but we won today ..."" The victory comes ahead of a vital week for the new manager. Moyes takes charge of United in the Champions League for the first time on Tuesday against Bayer Leverkusen before traveling across town to play Manchester City the following Sunday. Manuel Pellegrini's City side, who have also made a stuttering start to the season, dropped points against Stoke City on Saturday playing out a goalless draw at the Britannia Stadium. Mourinho blues . Jose Mourinho tasted league defeat for the first time since returning to Stamford Bridge in the summer as Everton recorded a famous 1-0 win over the Blues at Goodison Park. Steven Naismith headed in from close range moments before halftime to give the Toffees the lead which they held despite a second-half onslaught from a Chelsea side that included new signing Samuel Eto'o. Roberto Martinez's first league win as Everton manager lifts the Merseysiders up to ninth in the table while Chelsea drop to sixth. Elsewhere, Mesut Ozil made his first appearance for Arsenal since moving from Real Madrid for Â£42.2 million ($67 million). The German international helped the Gunners to a 3-1 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. Olivier Giroud opened the scoring in the 11th minute before a Craig Gardner penalty put the home side level three minutes after the break. But two goals in ten minutes from Aaron Ramsey saw Arsene Wenger's side seal their third league win on the trot. Tottenham Hotspur were also comfortable winners on Saturday beating Norwich City 2-0 at White Hart Lane. Gylfi Sigurdsson gave Spurs fans something to cheer about in the post-Bale era. The Icelandic international scored in each half to give Andre Villas Boas his third win in four league matches. Newcastle United recorded a second consecutive win with a 2-1 away to Aston Villa while the games between Hull City and Cardiff City and Fulham and West Bromwich Albion both ended in 1-1 draws. Southampton entertain West Ham United on Sunday. Liverpool will look to maintain their 100% record when they travel to Swansea on Monday evening.","David Moyes secures first home win as Man Utd beat Crystal Palace 2-0 .

"(CNN) -- Strike up that ""Pink Panther"" theme song and hum along: Da-dum-da-dum, da-dum, da-dum-da-dum-da-dum. Because the closest thing ever to the fictional Pink Panther diamond that sent bumbling Inspector Clouseau on cinematic goose chases is going under the gavel this year. And it is expected to fetch the highest price in history for any diamond ever purchased, says auctioneer Sotheby's. By the time the bidding battle ceases on November 13, in Geneva, Switzerland, the chunk of pink ice known as (drum roll) The Pink Star is expected to be SOLD! for more than 60 million smackeroos. The fictitious Pink Panther had a flaw that looked like a lunging panther, thus its name. The Pink Star, on the other hand, is flawless. Sotheby's calls it ""the largest internally flawless fancy vivid pink diamond that the Gemological Institute of America has ever graded."" That's supposed to be very rare. The rock the size of the pope's ring is 59.6 carats huge. It took two years to cut its dozens of facets out of the original raw stone and polish it into its current oval shape. CNN's Samira Said contributed to this report.","The 59.6-carat pink diamond goes on auction in November, Sotheby's says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. ties with Egypt go deeper than aid, America's top diplomat said Sunday. ""Let me make it clear here today: President Obama and the American people support the people of Egypt,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. ""We believe this is a vital relationship."" Kerry's visit marked the highest-level U.S. official trip to Egypt since former President Mohamed Morsy's ouster in July. And it came just a day before Morsy is expected to make his first court appearance as he stands trial on charges of inciting violence. Kerry's trip to Egypt was his first time in the country since the U.S. suspended significant military aid to Egypt over the bloody crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, whose political arm backed Morsy. After meeting with Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy, Kerry pushed for reforms as he defended the U.S. decision to suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance. ""It's not a punishment,"" Kerry said. ""It's a reflection of a policy in the United States under our law."" The move was the culmination of months of debate within the Obama administration about how to respond to the coup that removed Morsy from power. But on Sunday, Kerry described the aid as ""a very small issue."" ""Our hope is that we can make the progress we need on democracy, the rights of people, the protections of people, the ability of the country to have its civil society strengthened and restored, and then we will march together hand in hand into the future, with Egypt playing the vital role that it has traditionally played in this region,"" Kerry said. Kerry stressed that U.S. humanitarian support to Egypt continues, in addition to counterterrorism efforts with the military and work to ensure safety in the Sinai Peninsula. While in Cairo, he hosted a meeting with civil society organizations, including faith-based groups, human rights advocates, and youth and labor organizations, ""to discuss how Egypt can continue on its path to political and economic reform,"" a senior State Department official said. The aid suspension last month roiled Egyptian officials. Fahmy told CNN's Christiane Amanpour at the time that the decision raised concerns about the U.S.-Egypt relationship. ""This has been a relationship that has a continuity to it, especially on strategic issues like military cooperation. And any disruption in that continuity raises concerns. ... This is a very important relationship to both countries, and we need to work to enhance it, because it serves both sides,"" he said. Kerry's visit to Egypt was the first stop on a 10-day trip to the Middle East, Europe and Northern Africa. He left Cairo on Sunday for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. CNN's Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","Secretary of State John Kerry visits Egypt a day before Mohamed Morsy's trial starts .

"(CNN) -- New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez sharply criticized Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig and the league's investigations division Thursday. ""I am deeply troubled by my team's investigative findings with respect to MLB's conduct,"" Rodriguez said through his spokesman Ron Berkowitz. Rodriguez accused Selig of turning a blind eye to what he said was ""gross, ongoing misconduct"" of the division that he claims was responsible for his suspension. Rodriguez is appealing his 211-game suspension for alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs. His legal team will present its side of the case to an arbitrator on November 18. Major League Baseball had a similarly sharp response for the three-time MVP and 14-time All-Star. ""This latest, sad chapter in Mr. Rodriguez's tarnished career is yet another example of this player trying to avoid taking responsibility for his poor choices,"" said the league's Chief Operating Officer Rob Manfred. He continued, ""Mr. Rodriguez's use of (performance-enhancing drugs) was longer and more pervasive than any other player, and when this process is complete, the facts will prove that it is Mr. Rodriguez and his representatives who have engaged in ongoing, gross misconduct."" War or words between MLB, A-Rod continues . Since the arbitration hearing began on September 30, Rodriguez has filed two lawsuits: one against Selig and MLB, and a second against Yankees team physician Christopher Ahmad and his hospital, New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Earlier this month, Manfred strongly denied any improper conduct on behalf of the investigative team. ""Our investigators have complied with all legal and ethical requirements throughout the process,"" he said. Manfred confirmed authorizing $125,000 for documents to find out about violations of the league's drug policy. The files in question come from the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in South Florida, which MLB says supplied steroids to at least a dozen baseball players. A police report obtained by CNN shows the files were reported stolen from the car of a former Biogenesis worker. A-Rod grocery store seeks new name . The worker told police that MLB representatives had ""offered him a job and up to $125,000 for the client files."" The last offer was on March 18, and the documents were stolen six days later, according to the police report. Manfred told CNN that no one from Major League Baseball knew the documents were reported stolen. ""In fact, the people we bought them from made representations to the contrary,"" he said. Performance-enhancing drugs in sport . Rodriguez was one of 14 players suspended in connection with the Biogenesis scandal and is the only one who appealed his suspension. Rodriguez, 38, is fifth on MLB's list of all-time home run leaders, just six behind Willie Mays. He would make $25 million in 2014, if his suspension is overturned. If his suspension is upheld, he won't be eligible to return until 49 games into the 2015 season. Alex Rodriguez suspension case: Evidence comes at a big price .

"(CNN) -- Artists Isabel and Ruben Toledo share a romantic magnetism that binds together their personal and professional lives. They finish each other's sentences; they encourage each other's fantastical whims. It's the kind of chemistry that creative types covet. The Cuban-born Toledos met in high school in West New York, New Jersey, and married in 1975. Since then, they have achieved success in their respective worlds: Isabel, as a fashion designer who counts Michelle Obama among her clients; and Ruben, as a cartoonist whose drawings have appeared in The New Yorker. They live and work together in a loft that takes up several floors in Midtown, New York, and offers a view of the Empire State Building. Neither considers their ascent to fame conventional and, in many ways, they still regard themselves as outsiders in the fashion world. So, when Isabel was approached about writing a book of fashion advice for women, she seized it as an opportunity to tell the world that there is no straightforward path to success, especially as a designer. Naturally, Ruben provided the drawings for ""Roots of Style,"" which was published this year. And, of course, he was wearing a black jacket and pants designed by his wife when they visited Atlanta in May for a student auction at the Savannah College of Art and Design. They spoke with CNN about love, life and labor. Below is an edited transcript of the conversation. Instant chemistry . It was ""love at first sight"" (for Ruben at least) in high school. Isabel, however, took a few years to come around. They have since been together for more than 30 years in a union, equal parts romance and business, that's the marvel of the fashion world. Ruben: Isabel walked into my Spanish class, and it was love at first sight within three seconds. Four years later, Isabel finally realized how she felt about Ruben. Isabel: I missed him. I missed the energy. And I kind of pursued him. Ruben: By then I was in a band -- I was already in Manhattan, I was doing my thing. I really grew up, so I think that was attractive to Isabel. So then we started dating, and then I wanted to marry her. She said no. Isabel: I was playing hard to get. Just like after high school, Isabel decided to make the definitive move in her own time. Ruben: She said, you know, I'm ready to get married. And then that freaked me out totally. I was like a deer in the headlights; I was like, 'Oh my god really!' You know, for us men, it's an important moment. I had to think, 'Now I'm responsible for this woman for the rest of my life.' Isabel: I went away. Ruben: You went away again! Isabel had accepted an internship restoring costumes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she stayed for about four years. Despite the odds, Ruben and Isabel somehow found their way to the altar -- over and over again. Isabel: We got married three times. Ruben: I called City Hall to ask 'I want to get married,' and they said 'this is what you do, you come to Room 34 at Window B,' so I thought I was getting married but in fact it was just to get the license. So all our parents went and threw rice at us. Isabel: So we turned around and said, 'we're married!' (The officials) were like, 'What?' Ruben: And they threw the rice, and we ran off to Canada, but we couldn't tell (our parents) we were living in sin, so we had this lovely honeymoon. Then we came back and had a secret wedding at City Hall with my brother and your sister as our witnesses. And then we had the official church wedding. It was very low-key because Isabel's dad had just passed away. It was very sad. White wedding, it was raining. Isabel: It was sealed. Art as self-discovery . Isabel's passion for ""engineering clothes"" began with sewing classes as a child in Cuba. For Ruben, drawing is the way he thinks and expresses himself. Whatever the means, both consider themselves artists first and foremost. Isabel: I've been sewing since I was 8, and I started sewing because I didn't find anything that I loved. We had this condo in Cuba, and (my mother) wanted us to go to a baby sitter. My older sisters were like, 'No way!' And she said, 'No, no, no, it's not a baby sitter, it's sewing classes.' So we thought we were going to school. And I'm the only one that picked up on it. My elder sisters were not interested. So it was by accident. Ruben, on the other hand, knew exactly what he wanted to do with his life from the start. Ruben: I could draw before I could write or talk. Drawing is how I think. To understand something, I have to draw it. I'm like the original caveman. Ruben and Isabel agree that being an artist means to have complete freedom. Ruben: I'm lucky enough to only take on the projects that interest me, whether it's doing somebody's portrait or doing a mosaic or doing animation or doing ceramic or doing book covers for whatever it is. That's a good place to be. You don't have to lie. You really do what you believe in, you really do what you care about. It's a wonderful gift. Success in synthesis . Isabel Toledo the fashion designer became a household name in 2009, when Michelle Obama wore a lemongrass shift and matching overcoat to her husband's inauguration as 44th president of the United States. Ruben: (The dress) was a gift from the universe. That was like one of those marvelous things. To be woven into history, it's beyond you! Isabel had a creative block; when time was running out, she noticed a small swatch of lemongrass fabric in her studio, and everything clicked. Isabel: The emotion behind the dress was that piece of fabric. And immediately, I think it was overnight, I kept saying, what is it gonna be? What is it gonna be? And we laugh about it because I had a tantrum: 'But it's too late now, it's too late!' And he says, 'Just send it, just send it!' Ruben: Isabel doesn't sketch anything. My job was to sketch it with the swatch and send in an e-mail and suggest it. So I finally buckled her down and said, 'Tell me what you want to do.' So she described what she wanted, and I sketched it down, we sent the quick sketch with the e-mail. Isabel: That same Saturday! Ruben: And five minutes later, we got an e-mail saying, 'Make it happen, make it warm.' Isabel: I still sweat thinking about that day. Isabel wasn't always into fashion, though, and to an extent she still isn't. Isabel: I'm not supposed to say I'm not a fashion person, but I'm not. I just, I love design. Design is so different than fashion. That's why design lasts forever. It's like an engineer. I love to engineer a garment. To make this thing work, to make it stand, to make this sculpture work. I get all enthralled if I have to come up with: How do I sew this cloth? What am I saying with the fabric? It's nothing to do with, 'what does it look like?' The next generation . When Isabel was asked to write a book of fashion tips, she refused. ""I don't give tips,"" she said. ""I make what I make, and women take to it. And they trusted me."" The couple does have a few choice words for today's young artists: . Save everything you make, because you'll never be in the frame of mind to create the same thing twice. Ruben: Mistakes and false starts, that all leads to where you are. It's important. And it makes you 'you.' Isabel: That's your identity at the end. It's OK not to have a plan. Ruben: We didn't have a plan either, just be sincere in what you love. You don't have to lead, or even follow. Isabel: Just do what you do. Privately, in your own world. Ruben: We don't have a business partner. We've never had regular backing. We're independent. Expose yourself to art so you know how to make it -- and if you don't know how, make things by trial and error. Ruben: You may have great ideas and great concepts, but if you can't make it materialize, you're back at square one, you know? You're also at the mercy of people telling you it can't be done. Believe in your ideas. Ruben: We know that some things Isabel makes are years ahead of its time, but it's our job to let it happen, and perfect it in fact, so that when the world catches up to that idea, we're the best at it. That's why I think we're still around after 30 years. Are you in a dynamic relationship like Isabel and Ruben? Do you know someone with a similar story?

"(CNN) -- Lionel Richie is back and ready to hit the stage. The crooner is gearing up for his ""All The Hits All Night Long"" North American tour, which kicks off Wednesday in Hollywood, Florida. CNN caught up with Richie at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles during the singer's final rehearsals for the 19-date tour. It's there the music legend advised fans not to be fooled by the tour's name. ""If they're waiting for all night long, let me tell you, I gave that up a long time ago,"" Richie told CNN. ""I always used to say to them, all night long went all night long when 'All Night Long' was out. Now it's down to a fierce 30 minutes, but if you want anything after that, I can pretty much guarantee an hour-45 to two hours solid."" Richie promises the tour will be a mix of classic hits and fan favorites, ranging from his Commodores days to his 2012 release, ""Tuskeegee."" To keep fans on their toes, the hit maker has a list of 14 songs to choose from each night. Richie compares planning out his shows to coaching a professional sports game. ""It's like going to a football game and you know the plays,"" he said. ""So when I call out a different play, they'll go to it."" Richie's last album found him recreating his biggest hits as collaborations with some of country music's top names. Who does he want to jump on stage with him during this tour? The list is extensive. ""Bruno Mars. Come on Bruno, where are you? Sting. I could do Kenny Chesney any day of the week. Tim McGraw. I'm sure these guys were in the Commodores at some time. I just have to go back to see if their pictures were there, because they're so familiar. The beautiful part about it is that the one thing they say to me when they meet me is, 'I know every song.'"" With Mars confirmed to perform at the 2014 Super Bowl halftime show, Richie has no doubts the 27-year-old will do a great job. ""My boy is going to kill it. Are you kidding?"" Richie said. ""Listen, Bruno is the real deal. And what I love about him the most is that he's a songwriter. He'll take care of business. I'm not worried."" As a music industry veteran, Richie has some sage advice for those up-and-comers who resort to shock tactics when hitting the stage. ""I've always said this -- this is my little anecdote -- but once you start taking off your clothes, that means you've got to have a hit record,"" he said. ""You've got to back it up with something. My philosophy is -- I'm the other way around. Give me the hit record first and you don't have to take off your clothes. Taking off the clothes means, 'I need that hit record.'"" The ""Hello"" singer admits he's still surprised to see younger fans in the crowds at his concerts. ""There are days I have to stop, blink, and turn around just for a moment to say, 'OK, that's right, it has been that long,'"" Richie said. ""There was the 21-year-old in the front row when the Commodores started and there's the 21-year-old in the front row now."" ""The greatest thrill of this to me is what started out to be just, 'Can we meet some girls on campus at the university?' ended up being a career, and the songs still work. The music's been around long enough where the next generation is taking possession of it.""","Richie kicks off his new tour Wednesday in Hollywood, Florida .

"Moscow (CNN) -- At least four bodies have been found and 49 people are missing after an offshore drilling rig capsized in the Russian far east Sea of Okhotsk, the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said Sunday. At least 14 people were rescued from the rig, which was being towed from Kamchatka, regional Emergency Services spokesman Aleksandr Ivelsky said. But he insisted that it was too early to declare that the four people spotted in the water without signs of life were dead, since rescuers had not yet recovered the bodies. There were 67 people aboard the Kolskaya platform, which was subcontracted to a company working for the Russian energy giant Gazprom, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported. Two ships were on the scene, the icebreaker Magadan and the tugboat Naftogaz-55, and will work on rescue operations through the night, Ivelsky said. Helicopters were involved in the early phase of the rescue, which was made more difficult by the storm that sank the rig, Ivelsky said. They have stopped flying for the night but will resume work in the morning, he said. The rig was floating about 124 miles (200 km) from Sakhalin Island, authorities said -- north of Japan and northeast of China. It was drilling a well about 11,480 feet (3,500 meters) deep, RIA-Novosti said. Taimuraz Kasayev, a spokesman for the regional emergencies service, told RIA-Novosti the accident poses no environmental danger because the rig's fuel stocks were hermetically sealed and would not spill. The television channel Russia Today reported that the rig was being towed into position when pumps failed, causing it to take on water and sink. CNN's Alla Eshchenko and Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","NEW: A government official says it's too early to declare people dead .

"(EW.com) -- In movies like 1974's ""Death Wish,"" where Charles Bronson played a walking statue of stoic wrath, vigilante justice is mean, nasty and also good, clean fun. But then there's the kind of movie, like Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs,"" that salutes lone-wolf vengeance while also making you feel the spiritual toll it takes — a breed of thriller that's exciting, cathartic and powerfully disturbing. ""Prisoners"" is that kind of movie. It's rooted in 40 years of Hollywood revenge films, yet it also breaks audacious new ground. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, a brawny survivalist who is also a gentle-voiced suburban dad. On a rainy Thanksgiving afternoon, Keller brings his wife (Mario Bello) and kids over to the home of neighborhood friends (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The two families eat, drink and joke around, and nothing too remarkable happens — until everyone realizes that Keller's little daughter, Anna (Erin Gerasimovich), has left the house and disappeared, along with the other family's daughter, Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). EW: Fall movies we can't wait to see . A search turns up nothing, but later that night, the police find a pale, mostly mute young creep (Paul Dano) in smudged aviator frames and oily long hair hanging around in his skeevy RV camper — the same vehicle that the girls were trying to crawl up the ladder of that afternoon. The cops arrest this damaged-looking sad sack, interrogate him, and find no evidence. So they let him go. But Keller, after an encounter with the suspect outside the police station, is convinced that he's guilty. So he takes action. He kidnaps the creep, brings him to an abandoned apartment building, and beats him to a bloody pulp, over and over again. He threatens to kill the young man unless he confesses. But the suspect/victim says nothing. If he is, in fact, innocent, then what Keller is doing is an unholy atrocity. But what if he's guilty? Are Keller's one-man torture-squad tactics justified then? And what if many people (along with the law) would declare that no, those tactics are still not justified? What should Keller do, given that every bone in his body is telling him that this is the only way he'll ever see his daughter again? What if every bone in his body is right? ""Prisoners,"" directed by Denis Villeneuve (""Incendies"") from a script by Aaron Guzikowski, is no shallow payback thriller. It's a dazzingly potent, ambitious and complex movie, a film that forces you to ask questions that have no easy answers. What I've described is merely the film's first act. There are a great many twists and turns — both suspenseful and thematic — to come. Yet at the heart of ""Prisoners"" is something primitive and elemental and gripping, an obsession with torture, morality and the impotence of the justice system that speaks to our time as intensely (and maybe controversially) as the pitch-dark vigilante thrillers of the '70s once spoke to theirs. EW's Jess Cagle talks porn sets with Hugh Jackman . Jackman, in a staggering performance that's unlike anything he has done before, acts with an unbridled rage, and he invests every snarl and rasp of that anger with meaning. Keller knows that in missing-child cases, each day the victim doesn't turn up radically increases the chances that she never will, and so his fury, even at its craziest, comes off as a desperate display of committed action. Haunted by what might be happening to his daughter, he has — at least in his own mind — transcended the law, yet that leaves him with nothing to believe in but himself, and Jackman takes us on every step of that brave, terrible journey. Each of the film's major performances is powerful. As the cop heading up the investigation, Jake Gyllenhaal has a moody danger that all but redefines him as an actor (for the first time, he doesn't seem like too nice a guy), and Melissa Leo, as the suspect's mother, unnerves you with the sinister banality of her homepsun Middle American quirkiness. She's the nightmare mom next door. In its treatment of torture as a means to an end, ""Prisoners"" is very much a post-""Zero Dark Thirty"" movie, even if the sin at its heart is child abduction rather than terrorism. Keller's remorseless treatment of his suspect echoes America's treatment of its captives at Abu Ghraib and other hidden locales after 9/11. Only this time it's personal: a desperate father out to save his daughter. ""Prisoners"" takes the mythic simplicity of the vigilante film and adds arresting layers of ambiguity. Watching the movie, we behold Keller's actions and feel that they may be horribly unjustified — a daring place for a film to put its hero — and we also behold his actions and feel that they may be what true morality demands. t's a sign of the film's power that either scenario could turn out to be true, and that each one is just as scary.

"(CNN) -- After a weekend of intense investigation, authorities are piecing together more details about Friday's fatal shooting at Los Angeles International Airport -- including the suspect's behavior earlier in the week and a warning from his family that may have come moments too late. Here is a rundown to get you up to speed: . THE SUSPECT . Paul Ciancia, 23, of Los Angeles is charged with murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport. He was shot by officers Friday and was in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center Sunday. A source said Ciancia was unable to speak to investigators. CLUES OF A MOTIVE . A note found on Ciancia indicated he wanted to kill TSA employees to ""instill fear into their traitorous minds,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich said. According to someone who knew Ciancia and his three roommates well, Ciancia began asking for a ride to the airport days before the shooting. He claimed he needed to fly to New Jersey to help his sick father, but he never said what day he needed to leave, the source said. On Friday, Ciancia burst into a roommate's room and demanded a ride to the airport immediately, said the source, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity. The roommate obliged. Investigators don't think the roommate had any idea of Ciancia's plans. THE NEAR SAVE . At around the same time, Ciancia was sending text messages to family members in Pennsville, New Jersey. Ciancia has no known history of mental illness, but he said in the texts that he was unhappy. And one message suggested something bad would happen. That alarmed Ciancia's father enough to call Pennsville Police Chief Allen Cummings. Cummings, in turn, called Los Angeles police and asked them to check on Ciancia. Perhaps 45 minutes after Ciancia left for the airport, officers arrived at his apartment, said Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. The two roommates at home did not know where Ciancia and the other roommate had gone. THE ATTACK . About 9:20 a.m. Friday, Ciancia walked up to a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint in Terminal 3. He pulled a .223-caliber assault rifle from a bag and shot TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez ""at point-blank range,"" according to a court document filed by an FBI agent. Ciancia then went up an escalator but returned to shoot Hernandez again, apparently after seeing him move. He continued walking and shooting. Witnesses said he went from person to person, asking, ""Are you TSA?"" ""I just shook my head,"" traveler Leon Saryan told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And he kept going."" THE VICTIMS . Hernandez, 39, was the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty since the agency was created in 2001. ""He took pride in his duty for the American public and for the TSA mission,"" his wife, Ana Hernandez, told reporters. The couple, who married in 1998, had two children. Two other TSA officers -- James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36 -- were wounded but were released from the hospital. A traveler who was shot in the leg, 29-year-old Brian Ludmer of Lake Forest, Illinois, was in fair condition Sunday . THE POLICE RESPONSE . TSA officers are unarmed. So Ciancia was eventually shot multiple times in the chest by airport police officers. Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said the FBI told him his officers were 60 seconds behind Ciancia. He praised their response, even though he acknowledged that he had moved his officers away from positions inside the checkpoints during the past year. ""The threat ... at the airport does not exist behind security at that podium, the threat exists from the curbline on,"" Gannon said. ""So ... we have our people stationed throughout the airport."" WHAT'S NEXT? If convicted, Ciancia could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole. The U.S. attorney general would decide whether to pursue a death sentence. TSA Administrator John Pistole said the shooting has prompted a review of security protocol with partner agencies. McCaul said better coordination with local law enforcement could improve security at checkpoints. But the congressman acknowledged that ""it's very difficult to stop these types of attacks."" ""It's almost like an open shopping mall,"" he said.","Suspect Paul Ciancia, 23, is in critical condition and could face the death penalty .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama unveiled initiatives Saturday in education and health for war veterans and highlighted how his administration has reduced by 20% the government's woeful backlog of veterans' disability claims. ""We're turning the tide. We're not going to let up until we eliminate the backlog once and for all,"" Obama told a gathering of disabled veterans in Florida. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have overwhelmed the Department of Veterans Affairs with disability applications. ""It results in longer waits. That's been unacceptable to me,"" Obama said. He acknowledged that the 20% dent isn't enough. ""I'm going to be honest with you. It has not moved as fast as I wanted,"" Obama said. Obama also put attention on the growing suicide rate among veterans. His administration increased spending for VA mental heath services by 7.2%, and the veterans agency has increased the capacity of its crisis line by 50%. ""We also need to keep improving mental health services because we have to end this epidemic of suicide among our veterans and troops,"" Obama said. The White House announced Saturday a National Research Action Plan to reduce soldier suicides and treat post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Under the initiative, the VA, Pentagon and other federal agencies will share data to advance research. The University of Texas and Virginia Commonwealth University will receive $100 million from the VA and Defense Departments to research PTSD and the links between traumatic brain injury and mental health issues. Obama also rolled out another initiative with 250 higher-education institutions to help war veterans complete their degrees. Obama made his remarks in Orlando, Florida, before more than 3,000 people attending the annual convention of Disabled American Veterans, an advocacy group deploring the one- or even two-year delays of processing disability claims and urging more mental health care for returning servicemen. When Obama announced the $100 million in research, many in the crowd of seniors wearing military caps shouted, ""Yeah, let's go!"" One attendee, Kathie DiCesare, who maintains a blog about PTSD and military suicides, said Americans aren't fully aware of the suicide rates among veterans, and she criticized Obama for not holding his joint chiefs accountable for the epidemic. Her husband is a Vietnam War veteran with PTSD. ""The only thing that I can complain about is he's not holding any body accountable. I know he cares,"" she said. ""Suicide rates have skyrocketed."" Earlier this year, the Pentagon said as many as 349 U.S. service members committed suicide last year, which would be the highest number since the Department of Defense began keeping detailed statistics in 2001. Of several high-profile veterans issues facing the nation, the backlog of health and disability benefits has been among the more controversial. Last March, Allison Hickey, undersecretary for benefits, told U.S. senators that veterans indeed wait too long to receive benefits. Thousands of war vets still waiting for health benefits . A recent report from the Center for Investigative Reporting found that since Obama took office in 2009, the number of veterans waiting more than a year for their benefits has skyrocketed, from 11,000 in 2009 to 245,000 in December 2012, a jump of more than 2,000%. The VA states that the average wait time after a veteran files a claim is 273 days. But for veterans filing their first claim, including Iraq and Afghanistan vets, the wait is up to 327 days, nearly two months longer. In big cities such as New York, veterans could wait for almost two years. CIR analyzed the data obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request. The number of claims has also increased. In 2001, the VA completed approximately 480,000 claims, in 2002 approximately 796,000 claims and in 2003 around 827,000 claims, according to Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, the VA completed more than 1 million claims each year, he said. Veterans service organizations say filing a claim can be as challenging as filing a complex tax return or defending yourself in a lawsuit. In the meantime, veterans experience hardships. Study: Mental illness, not combat, causes soldier suicides . In the expanded education initiative, Obama called the measure ""8 Keys to Success"" and said more than 250 community colleges and universities would help veterans afford and complete degrees, certificates, industry-recognized credentials and licenses. The education would help the veterans land jobs in high-growth areas of the economy. Obama said among his priorities is ""making sure that our veterans have the opportunity to pursue the American dream."" Obama also pressed Congress to adopt his $5 billion Veterans Jobs Corps proposal that would put former servicemen and women to work building infrastructure such as roads and bridges, similar to the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s. At a time when the nation is struggling with the legacy of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama sought to shore up support for his veterans agenda one day after he signed into law the Helping Heroes Fly Act, which eases travel and seeks to expedite the passenger screening process for severely injured and disabled veterans and active service personnel. Obama also sought to make permanent two new veterans' tax credits, which will expire at the end of this year. Under the Returning Heroes tax credit, an incentive up to $5,600 is given to employers hiring jobless veterans. Under the Wounded Warrior tax credit, a tax credit up to $9,600 is extended to firms employing long-term unemployed veterans with military-related disabilities. By the numbers: U.S. war veterans .

"Yosemite National Park, California (CNN) -- Susan Loesch and Curtis Evans just started settling into their second home in California's Sierra foothills a few months ago. Now, they're worried it could go up in smoke as a massive wildfire spreads. ""This is kind of a little paradise up here for us. ... To think this would all be gone would be devastating,"" Evans told CNN Sunday. Cradling their chihuahua, Cuervo, they prepared to leave the area on Sunday as more than 2,800 crew members struggled to corral the sprawling Rim Fire, which had devoured nearly 134,000 acres. ""It's scary,"" Loesch said. ""You worry about the firefighters being on the line. ... It's overwhelming."" The wildfire, which remained 7% contained, was spreading primarily to the northeast and east and threatened to grow amid extremely dry conditions and hot weather. After days of battling the blaze, things were looking up on Sunday, said Vickie Wright, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. ""We're a long way from complete,"" she said, ""but at least our boots on the ground are getting a better handle on it."" A top priority is stopping the fire from spreading further in Yosemite National Park. Yosemite fire: Blaze spreads to national park . ""The park is a national treasure,"" she said, ""so no matter what it takes, we're going to do everything in our power to protect that park."" While the Rim Fire had consumed 12,000 acres in the northwest section of the park by Saturday, so far it has had little or no direct impact on Yosemite Valley, a popular spot for tourists and home to many of the famous cliffs and waterfalls in the park. About 4,500 structures, many of them vacation homes, were under threat, according to InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. Several helicopters and air tankers were aiding firefighting efforts. The inferno threatened the Yosemite gateway communities of Groveland and Pine Mountain Lake just outside the Stanislaus National Forest. The Tuolumne County Sheriff's Office, meanwhile, issued evacuation advisories for the town of Tuolumne and nearby Ponderosa Hill, according to InciWeb. It was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory. Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17. The cause is under investigation. Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman told CNN on Saturday that the Rim Fire's impact was restricted to a park entrance closure at Highway 120 West and a backcountry section used by hikers. The park typically has 15,000 visitors on a busy summer weekend. August sees an influx of visitors from other countries, a few of whom have called to check on conditions. Still, there's little indication so far it's keeping many people away. Ranger programs went on as normal Saturday and campgrounds were full. ""If somebody cancels, there are 10 people that will take their spot,"" said Gediman. Yosemite, with hundreds of campground sites and lodging units, had nearly 4 million visitors last year, according to the National Park Service. What you need to know about wildfires .

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government said it will recommend that new cars have rear-view video systems, a move immediately denounced as ""insufficient"" by safety groups who say the cameras should be mandatory. The camera and monitor system enables drivers to see whether people or objects are in the blind spot behind vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday it will add the rear-view video systems to its list of recommended features under its New Car Assessment Program, designed to encourage car manufacturers to improve vehicle safety. But safety groups called the action a stalling tactic, saying the agency is dragging its feet in fulfilling a congressionally imposed deadline to issue a rule on rear visibility. Passed in 2008, the law had a 2011 deadline. The regulation is now two and a half years overdue. Death toll from backover accidents grows . The NHTSA action ""is an inadequate substitute for issuing a mandatory safety regulation,"" Jackie Gillan, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, said in a statement. ""In fact, safety advocates are concerned that NHTSA's announcement is an attempt to divert attention from their failure to act."" The NHTSA announcement Tuesday came just one day before a group of safety advocates, including two parents who unintentionally hit their children while backing up, was expected to file suit against the U.S. Department of Transportation, which includes NHTSA. The suit is to be filed Wednesday morning by Greg Gulbransen, who reportedly backed over his 2-year-old son, Cameron, in his driveway in 2002, killing him, and by Susan Auriemma, who backed over her 3-year-old daughter, Kate, in her driveway in 2005, injuring her. Also joining in the suit will be the Consumers Union of the United States, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and KidsAndCars.org, those groups said in a statement. The lawsuit asks the court to direct the DOT to issue a mandatory rule within 90 days. Rear-view camera systems are available on seven in 10 new vehicles, as either standard equipment or an option. But the safety groups say the government's inaction has allowed the death toll in so-called ""backover"" accidents to grow. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, more than 200 people are killed and 17,000 injured every year in backover crashes, when drivers back up over unseen objects behind them. Children under the age of 5 account for 44% of the fatalities. In a high percentage of those cases, the motorist is a parent or family member. In December 2010, NHTSA published a proposed rule and set out to meet a February 2011 deadline for enacting it. On-board cameras, NHTSA said at the time, could cut in half deaths and injuries due to backing crashes, at a cost of about $159 to $203 per vehicle, or about $1.9 billion to $2.7 billion a year for the nation's 16.6 million fleet of new vehicles. (The price has since fallen, advocates say.) Fatal wrecks underscore risks for young drivers . But the Department of Transportation twice extended the deadline, first to December 2011, and again to February 2012, a deadline it has missed. The DOT said the extensions were necessary because of the ""large volume of public comments and the complexity of some of the issues."" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement Tuesday that he remains committed to implementing a new rear visibility rule. But adding rear-view systems to its list of recommended features ""will encourage both automakers and consumers to consider more vehicles that offer this important technology."" NHTSA said it would include the video system into its New Car Assessment Program in two phases. Starting immediately, the agency will begin identifying on www.safercar.gov vehicle models that have the video systems. Next, as soon as the agency is able to verify that systems meet basic criteria, the agency will recognize those vehicles as having this recommended advanced technology feature on the website.","U.S. agency recommends rear-view video systems on new cars .

"(CNN) -- If you're good enough at what you do, it is possible to live forever. That's a lesson to be drawn from the news out of Amsterdam last week. A painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, which was previously believed to be a forgery, has been authenticated. ""Sunset at Montmajour,"" a landscape painted by van Gogh in 1888, has been painstakingly studied by experts at the Van Gogh Museum, using sophisticated chemical-and-technological analysis. Their conclusion: It's the real thing. It is said to be the first full-sized canvas by van Gogh to be found in 85 years. In the past, paintings by van Gogh have sold for tens of millions of dollars apiece. He has been dead since 1890, when, in one of many moments of despair, he took his own life. He was only 37. Even before he entered the world, there were omens that his might not be a conventional existence. On March 30, 1852, Vincent van Gogh was stillborn in the Netherlands. That was his older brother. A year later -- to the day -- a second child was born. This child, too, was given the name Vincent. He would be the boy who grew into an artist. He left school at 15. He worked as an art dealer, a clergyman and a bookseller. He never found material success. He battled depression and deep loneliness. His mental health deteriorated. He famously mutilated his left ear; he was confined to an asylum. His attacks of anxiety and bottomless melancholy kept him in his room for months at a time. His brother Theo would write that, very near the end, Vincent said to him: ""The sadness will last forever."" Yet what has lasted forever is his brilliance. Because of his artistry, van Gogh has proved to be immortal. He has been gone for more than a century, and we are talking about him today, studying every detail of his work, trying to decipher what it was he was trying to say on his canvases. Making art, in any of its myriad forms -- music, literature, drama and beyond -- is like sending messages out in bottles. The artists, on the days they drop the bottles into the water, can have no idea where they will end up, or who will find them. You don't have to be an aficionado of fine art to walk into a public gallery, stand before a painting done by someone long dead, and think: One day, many generations ago, whoever created this work decided that this tiny brushstroke here would be preferable to another, subtly different one; that this shade of red in this corner was the ideal one, instead of a shade more vivid or more muted; that the shadows over on this side of the canvas were what was needed to set the proper mood. And now, all these years later, a stranger standing in front of the painting in a town the artist never visited is thinking about the mind behind those choices. Walk into a public library. Pull a book from any shelf. The book can be by an acclaimed author -- F. Scott Fitzgerald, the wonderful writer of Westerns Dorothy M. Johnson, Philip Roth -- or by an author with whose work you are unfamiliar. Flip through the book until you find a paragraph that strikes you as being especially beautifully constructed, a paragraph you immediately esteem. Linger over it, and consider: This writer chose to put this comma here for a reason, for the desired rhythm and cadence; discerned that this particular combination of words would be most pleasing to the eye and ear of a reader; pondered, at least momentarily, whether a semicolon was the right way to break a thought, or whether a period followed by the start of a new sentence would serve a reader more gracefully. The writer, on that day, may not have known whether his or her book would ever be published. Maybe the book has sat on this library shelf for years without anyone coming along to free it from its hardbound neighbors. But on this day, someone -- you -- has, in fact, come along, and is thinking about what the writer may have been thinking, alone at a typewriter or with a fountain pen poised over a clean sheet of paper, so many years ago. That message in a bottle: The writer is alive again -- alive still. The work, suddenly, is new once more. This is artistry's payoff, its greatest reward. During the summer, the singer Phil Everly spoke about an antebellum house that he and his wife had renovated and repaired in Maury County, Tennessee. Everly, 74, told Marc Myers of the Wall Street Journal that ""The house makes me feel kind of solid. I like things that are way older than I am and are going to outlast me."" But he is being too modest. The house is not going to outlast the music of the Everly Brothers; eventually and inevitably the house will fall apart or be torn down. The songs that Phil and Don Everly recorded, though, with their gorgeously blended voices, will never die. The brothers themselves, like all artists, will leave this earth, but the harmonies they created will go on and on. Immortality: Now that van Gogh's ""Sunset at Montmajour"" has been discovered and authenticated for the world to see, his every artistic choice that reveals itself on the canvas will be peered at and discussed for centuries to come, by admirers hoping to glean further insights into the man he was. He painted more than 800 canvases and did more than 1,000 drawings and watercolors. He went to his grave a pauper, knowing that, for all his talent and heart and inspiration, he had been able, in his lifetime, to sell only one painting. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Discovery of Van Gogh painting points up immortality of the artist .
He says Van Gogh struggled with his art--and depression--died young, but art endured .
He says art in all its forms is like message in a bottle, sent from the mind of artist to the ages .

"Palm Springs, California (CNN) -- Even after months of tensions over alleged cyberattacks, the leaders of China and the United States struck positive tones in a two-day summit that ended Saturday in the sweltering heat of the California desert as both talked of forging a ""new model"" for their relations going forward. ""We're meeting here today to chart the future of China-U.S. relations,"" Chinese President Xi Jinping said. ""...We need to think creatively and act energetically so that working together we can build a new model of major country relationship."" The summit at the Annenberg Retreat at Sunnylands, just outside Palm Springs, comes less than three months after Xi rose to his current post. Both he and U.S. President Barack Obama pointed out their meeting is happening sooner than some expected, a testament they said to both men's recognition of the importance of solid relations between the two countries. And both heads of state, who met last year in Washington when Xi was China's vice president, spoke of pursuing policies that furthers their nation's respective interests. From Obama's perspective -- even taking into account ""healthy economic competition"" between the two powers -- that means seeing China continue to grow. ""It is in the United States' interest that China continues on the path of success, because we believe that a peaceful and stable and prosperous china is not only good for Chinese but also good for the world and for the United States,"" he said. The U.S. president did allude to the fact ""areas of tensions"" are inevitable, highlighted his nation's commitment to human rights, and its support for ""an international economic order where nations are playing by the same rules."" ""And ... the United States and China (can) work together to address issues like cybersecurity and the protection of intellectual property,"" he added. That comment -- tucked in the middle of Obama's opening remarks -- was the closest the U.S. president got to referring to the rhetorical skirmishes of late over whether U.S. servers and secrets have been targeted from China. Such allegations were made in a Pentagon report that points to ""the Chinese government and military"" as the likely culprits of cyberintrusions in American institutions, to allegations that even the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama were hacked by Chinese operatives in 2012. Beyond the broad outlines laid out by the two leaders late Friday afternoon, it's not clear exactly what the leaders will discuss over the coming days. But experts on U.S.-China relations told CNN that they don't expect cyberattacks will come up in direct negotiations, which occur as the Obama administration is on the defensive over whether it's wrongly violated citizens' privacy in collecting phone and online data as part of its antiterrorism strategy. ""They both won't want to and won't be able to use this as leverage in a discussion,"" said Chris Johnson, China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""They won't be able to say this is the pot calling the kettle black."" Robert Pastor, founder and director of the Center for North American Studies at American University, said the two nations have different perspectives. While the ""U.S. is focusing on acts of violence and terrorism,"" Pastor said, China is ""utilizing the Internet and other mechanism in order to steal commercial or military secrets."" Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointed to China when he addressed cybersecurity threats, telling an audience of defense professionals in Singapore that the United States was concerned about ""the growing threat of cyber intrusions, some of which appear to be tied to the Chinese government and military."" In an annual support on Chinese military capabilities, the Pentagon echoed Hagel's claim, stating that recent cyber attacks in the United States appeared ""to be attributable directly to Chinese government and military."" Beijing has repeatedly denied the accusations, saying that hacking is a global problem, of which China is also a victim. Despite the fact that most experts believe the United States use of monitoring is unlikely to come up, many acknowledged that if Obama and other White House negotiators push too hard on charging the Chinese with cyberespionage, domestic programs in the United States could be used against them. ""The potential for pushing back is there and that may force the United States to take a more win-win approach,"" echoed Kennedy, stating that if it does come up, it may force the United States to focus on less decisive goals from the two-day summit. The fact is cybersecurity is just one of the many issues the two countries might address. One is what to do about North Korea's nuclear program. Another is how to address climate change. Then there's how to fairly boost the economies of both countries. Meanwhile, the American public sees China as much as an ally or, at least, a ""frenemy."" The latest Gallup poll shows 55% of Americans asked think China is either an ally (11%) or a nation friendly to the United States (44%), while 40% say it is either unfriendly (26%) or an enemy (14%). For the most part, the different experts said, this weekend's meeting will primarily be an opportunity for the two leaders to get to know one another, while also addressing major issues. ""If these guys come out of the meeting saying, I understand this other person and this is someone I can work with"" then the meeting should be considered a success, Johnson said. CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta, Jessica Yellin reported from Palm Springs, and Dan Merica reported from Washington. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","NEW: Xi says meeting could ""chart the future of China-U.S. relations""

"(CNN) -- Call it the ""cheese dip."" A 400-foot section of the Leo Frigo Bridge -- named after a late Wisconsin cheese scion -- suddenly sagged Wednesday, forcing police to close off the span that carries Interstate 43 over the Fox River some 120 feet below. ""There's a part that's sagging,"" a motorist told an incredulous 911 operator, according to recordings posted by CNN affiliate WLUK. ""A part that's sagging?"" the operator asked. ""Instead of a bump, it's a dip,"" the driver said. How safe is that bridge you're driving over? It appears that one of the piers holding up the bridge sank about 2 feet into the ground, Gov. Scott Walker told reporters Wednesday. The bridge, which carries 40,000 cars a day, will be closed indefinitely, state officials said. ""We understand the disruption this is going to cause to traffic,"" Wisconsin Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb told reporters Wednesday. The bridge was built in 1980 and last inspected in August 2012, declared sound and renovated shortly thereafter, said Kim Rudat, regional communications manager for the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. California's Bay Bridge closure starts . The closure comes as an unwelcome addition to the city's traffic headaches, motorist Dennis Kelln of Green Bay told WLUK.

"(CNN) -- The latest violent protests to hit Iran has prompted hundreds of arrests, including some prominent figures, and left at least eight dead, although the Iranian government denied its security forces have killed anyone. Iran's Supreme National Security Council reported the eight deaths in a series of clashes over the weekend -- the deadliest since June protests followed the nation's disputed presidential election. ""For months, the Iranian people have sought nothing more than to exercise their universal rights,"" U.S. President Barack Obama told journalists during a break from his Christmas vacation in Hawaii. ""Each time they have done so, they have been met with the iron fist of brutality, even on solemn occasions and holy days."" ""It's about the Iranian people and their aspirations for justice and a better life for themselves,"" Obama said. ""And the decision of Iran's leaders to govern through fear and tyranny will not succeed in making those aspirations go away."" In many cases, opposition media reported, government security forces prevented observances of Ashura, the major Shiite Muslim holy day marking the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of Prophet Mohammed, as a martyr. Iranian opposition Web sites have kept up a steady stream of reports about the clashes, but official news agencies been largely silent. The Fars news agency ran three pages of photographs of peaceful mourning ceremonies marking Ashura, but there was no mention of protests. The Iranian media blackout has made it difficult to verify accounts that leaked out, but videos that found their way west depicted bloodied and -- in some cases, apparently dead -- protesters. But officials like Iran's Deputy Police Chief Ahmad Reza Radan and Tehran Police Chief Azizollah Rajabzadeh denied their forces had killed anyone. In fact, they told the semi-official Islamic Students News Agency, their forces fired no weapons and weren't even carrying firearms. While the videos are dramatic and the news of deaths chilling, the roll call of arrestees grows longer and deeper into Iranian dissent. As many as 500 people may have been arrested in Isfahan, the opposition JARAS news agency reported, among them Habib Nouri, the 50-year-old brother of Abdollah Nouri, the revolutionary-leader-cum-reformist-politician who served nearly five years in Evin prison for religious and political dissent. Ayatollah Jaleleddin Taheri's son was arrested in Isfahan, another reformist Web site, javan-farda.com, reported. The Iranian government began applying pressure to Taheri, who is married to one of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's grandchildren, after he tried to lead a memorial service for Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the reformist cleric and key figure of the 1979 Iranian Revolution who died last week, the site said. The government denied Taheri permission to hold a mourning ceremony for Imam Hussein at Isfahan's Grand Mosque, the Web site reported. Also arrested were Ibrahim Yazdi, head of the Freedom Movement of Iran and former deputy prime minister after the Revolution, and Emad Baghi, founder of the Association for Defense of Prisoners Rights, the reformist Web site Parlemannews reported. NoroozNews added the names of Ali Reza Beheshti Shirazi, son of the late Dr. Ayatollah Beheshti -- the founder of Iran's post-revolutionary judicial system -- and two advisers to former opposition presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi, Mohamad Bagherian and Behzadian Nejad, to those who have been arrested. Mousavi's nephew, Saeed Ali Mousavi, was reported among the dead Sunday. Norooz also reported that government agents raided the offices of former reform President Mohammed Khatami's Baran Institute, arresting former cabinet minister Morteza Haji and Hassan Rassouli, who is the deputy director of the institute. Another raid nabbed Mousavi Tabrizi, the head of the clerical Association of Teachers and Researchers Qom, NoroozNews said.

"(CNN) -- Mudslides killed at least 13 people after Fernand slammed into the east of coast of Mexico, state media reported Monday. Fernand was a tropical storm when it made landfall late Sunday, bringing heavy rains. The storm quickly fizzled into a tropical depression and had dissipated by Monday afternoon, forecasters said. But even as it weakened, authorities in the state of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico said the storm brought heavy rains that caused deadly mudslide in several locations. All of the deaths were caused by mudslides that buried homes, Veracruz Gov. Javier Duarte said, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. Fernand formed over the western Bay of Campeche on Sunday.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An earthquake in Pakistan, powerful enough to prompt the appearance of a small island off the coast, has killed more than 200 people, Pakistani officials said. The 7.7-magnitude quake struck in a remote area of southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, but it had severe consequences. At least 208 people were killed in the district of Awaran and the city of Turbut in Balochistan province, Asad Gilani, the provincial home secretary, said Wednesday. In addition to the fatalities, around 350 people have been injured, he said, and more people are still trapped in rubble. The quake was strong enough to cause a mass 20 to 30 feet high to emerge from the Arabian Sea like a small mountain island off the coast of Gwadar, local police official Mozzam Jah said. A large number of people gathered to view the newly formed island, he said. Large quakes can cause significant deformation to the earth's crust, particularly visible along coastlines. The island is about 100 feet in diameter and about one mile off the coast, GEO TV reported. Zahid Rafi, principal seismologist for the National Seismic Monitoring Center, confirmed the island had formed. He said it was ""not surprising,"" considering the magnitude of the earthquake. But John Bellini, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said that generally it would be unlikely for such a large island to emerge from a quake like Tuesday's. Many things, such as the tide, could come into play regarding the rise of the island, he said. More than 1,000 troops will be sent to the area to provide aid, including rescue teams and medical teams, Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said. With a depth of about nine miles (about 15 kilometers), the quake struck 43 miles (69 kilometers) northeast of Awaran and 71 miles (114 kilometers) northwest of Bela, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Some mud-walled homes fell in Awaran, said Latif Kakar, director of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority in Balochistan. The tremors lasted two minutes. People flocked out onto the streets of Quetta, the provincial capital. Aftershocks could be felt in Karachi, hundreds of miles to the southeast. CNN's Mari Ramos and Elizabeth Joseph, and journalist Sophia Saifi contributed to this report.","NEW: The death toll rises to 208; about 350 injured .

"(CNN) -- Apple has called it the biggest change to the iPhone since the very first one launched in 2007, but does the latest software, iOS 7, make the iPhone a more compelling buy for travelers than its Android- and Windows-powered competitors? While iOS 7 sports a significant redesign alongside improved battery life and multitasking ability, it's the assortment of new photo functions that iPhone-toting tourists will find most useful in the iOS 7 update. The big deal is a faster, easier way to scroll through that endless stream of photos you've amassed over the years and trips. In previous versions, those photos all existed as part of one, big linear stream. The iOS7 automatically organizes photos into categories called Collections, Moments and Years, what Apple describes as ""smart groupings of your photos and videos based on time and place."" Collections is a grouping of moments -- say, a trip to Canada. Moments are organized according to date and location. Years are obvious -- groupings of photos by year. The cool part of the Years organization is a collage of thumbnails of every picture from a given year that appears on the user screen. This can look a little overwhelming -- the more photos, the more intricate the collage -- but it's actually a handy way to find images quickly. A redesigned photo Share panel adds a number of functions that users should welcome. The most useful is a new Shared Photo Stream that not only allows the user to share photos with others, but allows others to add photos to someone else's photo stream. Just back from a family vacation in Greece? In the past you might have streamed all of your vacation photos to family members -- with the iOS7, those same family members can now add their photos to the same stream. Better Maps app . Another key asset is the new built-in Maps app, which will now include spoken turn-by-turn navigation for pedestrians. Instead of bumbling down Las Ramblas or Lan Kwai Fong, eyes glued to an app and smacking into other people, wandering tourists can pocket their iPhones, stick in an earbud and listen out for the next turn, in the same way drivers use sat-nav apps -- and similar to how Google Maps works on Android smartphones. The App Store on iPhones with iOS 7 will also incorporate GPS location to suggest locally popular apps, which is potentially useful for first-time visits to an area -- for example, firing up the App Store in Hong Kong's Sheung Wan district shows two bus schedule apps and a ""taxi translator"" that gives the names of streets and places in phonetically spelled Chinese. Other minor traveler-friendly refreshes include an enhanced camera with vintage filters and a square viewfinder mode -- all the better to share those holiday snaps on Instagram; and additional security for a lost iPhone that prevents would-be thieves from erasing it in order to sell it. Passbook now a bigger plus . An app that launched with last year's iOS 6 software remains one of the iPhone's biggest travel boons. Passbook is a travel wallet app that holds digital boarding passes, hotel confirmations and other booking tickets, then uses the iPhone's GPS sensor to pop up the required boarding pass around the location of use. Though it launched with relatively few airlines and hotels on-board, the app now supports boarding passes for dozens of airlines and travel companies, including Airbnb and Booking.com. Of course, boarding pass apps, trip organizers and other travel helpers are readily available on Android (and to a lesser extent, BlackBerry and Windows Phones). For now, Passbook is an advantage only for multi-stop trips where travelers are likely to be carrying more than a couple of boarding passes or hotel bookings at a time. Should existing iPhone users upgrade to iOS 7? ""Software updates fix bugs, enhance performance and add new features,"" says Richard Lai, editor in chief of consumer tech blog Engadget China. ""It's up to developers then to take advantage of the new tools in their apps."" Users of the iPhone 5, iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 will be prompted by Apple to update sometime this month, while iOS 7 will be available for the second-, third- and fourth-generation iPads plus the iPad Mini later in the year (rumored to be October). As for whether an iPhone packing iOS 7 is a worthy alternative to the slew of other smartphones, it comes back down to those nice new photo/camera features and the apps. Great travel apps for iPhone such as Skyscanner flight booking and TripAdvisor guides are usually also available for Android, while major apps such as TripIt travel organizer and Skype calling will also support Windows Phone and BlackBerry. For current iPhone owners, iOS 7 will make photo organization simpler, but it won't revolutionize their next trip away -- the next generation of iOS 7 apps could. CNN's Brent Deverman contributed to this report.","New iOS7 offers easier way to sort and scroll through photos -- a big plus .

"(CNN) -- A Miami prosecutor wants detectives to interview a few more witnesses before she decides if singer Chris Brown will be charged for allegedly snatching a woman's cell phone last month. The case has serious implications for Brown, 22, because he is still on probation for assaulting pop star Rihanna in February 2009. Although he's earned glowing probation reports, another arrest in Florida could be considered a probation violation by the Los Angeles judge. A woman filed a complaint against Brown after he allegedly grabbed her iPhone after she used it to take a photo of him in a car on a Miami street on February 19, police said. ""We have taken the statements of our local witnesses and have just finished discussing with the lead Miami Beach detective the additional witness information supplied by Mr. Brown's attorney Mark Geragos,"" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said Thursday. Geragos, a Los Angeles lawyer, represented Brown after his domestic violence arrest. ""We now must interview these individuals, some of whom may be from out of state, just as we do in every criminal investigation in order to uncover the truth in its entirety,"" Rundle said. Brown was sentenced to five years of probation, ending in 2014, and ordered to serve more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" after he pleaded guilt to assaulting Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammy Awards. That incident also involved a cell phone. According to Brown's probation report, an argument began when Rihanna found a text message on Brown's cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with."" Brown punched Rihanna numerous times and put her in a head lock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness, according to a police report. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Detectives will interview out-of-state witnesses suggested by Brown's lawyer .

"(CNN) -- Forget serious discussion about the future of America. On social media -- from the snark-centric world of Twitter to the picture's-worth-1,000-insults pages of Tumblr -- it's an ill-timed slip of the tongue that fires folks' political passions. And Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney served up a doozy Tuesday night with a weird turn of phrase that instantly launched ""binders full of women"" into the Internet's lexicon. First, some context. When Romney and President Barack Obama were asked at Tuesday's town hall debate what they would do to address salary equity issues for women, Romney instead told a story from when he was governor of Massachusetts. He said he was considering applicants for his Cabinet and noticed that almost all of them were men. So, the story goes, he made a point of recruiting women for the posts. ""And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our Cabinet,"" he said. ""I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks,' and they brought us whole binders full of women."" Mere seconds later, commentary on the wording, which conjures up images of little black books or women literally being crammed into notebooks, was lighting up the Web -- and the Trapper Keeper's role in the 2012 election had begun. Funniest tweets on the second presidential debate . ""Binders full of women is what they find in a serial killer's apartment,"" zinged Adam Sternbergh of New York Times magazine. ""Fonzie had binders of women too #debate #littleblackbook,"" added comedian Steve Agee. Among social media's finer binder creations: . Tumblr -- Forget Obama's perceived comeback. The real winner of this debate was the ""Binders Full of Women"" Tumblr account. As a repository for the Web's wit, the quickly crafted page acted as home base for images goofing on the phrase.

Twitter: The first presidential debate gave us Fired Big Bird and Big Bird Romney. The vice presidential tilt spawned Laughing Joe Biden. And this one was no different. Long before Tuesday's debate was over, Romney's Binder was tweeting away. Among its greatest hits: ""No comment on the rumors that Bill Clinton has already asked to borrow me."" Facebook -- It only took minutes for a handful of ""Binders Full of Women"" pages to spring up on the billion-strong site. One had more than 291,000 likes on Wednesday afternoon. A Facebook group with about 4,000 members provided offerings including a riff on ""Dirty Dancing"" (""No one puts baby in a binder""). Website -- BindersFullOfWomen.com is quite a bit more serious than the rest of the field. Registered through GoDaddy on Tuesday night less than two minutes after Romney uttered the words, the site is funded by the liberal American Bridge political action committee. The already well-populated site addresses a host of women's issues, from domestic violence to health care.","Romney's ""binders full of women"" remark delights social media world .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Chris Brown had something to tell the judge overseeing his probation during a hearing Thursday, but his lawyer cut him off when the singer raised his hand. ""I don't dance, you don't talk,"" defense attorney Mark Geragos told Brown, who then laughed. ""I would like to see you dance, Mr. Geragos,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg said. It was a light moment near the end of a routine progress hearing for Brown, the singer who is three years into his five years of probation for the 2009 assault on his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna. Chris Brown: Is there such a thing as loving two people? Brown, who recently revealed he is seeing Rihanna again, has completed his community labor requirements and other probation requirements, according to the latest probation report given the judge. His lawyer revealed that Brown, 23, will travel to Trinidad, an island close to Rihanna's native Barbados, this month. The probation officer must approve all international travel for Brown. Brown's probation supervision has been transferred from his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, to Los Angeles in September, the judge revealed. A positive test for marijuana use by the probation office in Virginia, where the drug is illegal, was not mentioned in court. At the last hearing in September, which Brown did not attend, the judge said she would consider the matter in court this month. Brown's lawyer explained then that the pot was consumed while he was in California, where he can legally smoke it with his a medical marijuana license. Brown must return to court on January 17, 2013, for another probation progress report. Brown was sentenced in August 2009 to serve the probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for the felony assault conviction. He was also ordered to complete a 52-week domestic violence program. Judge Schnegg lifted her ""stay away"" order, that preventing Brown from near Rihanna, in February 2011.

"(CNN) -- If Marco Lavoie had not been rescued when he was, the Quebec man probably would have perished within 48 hours. He was hypothermic, dehydrated and near starvation in the unforgiving cold of northwestern Quebec when police rescued him Wednesday. Lavoie's survival might be called miraculous, as he had been in the wilderness for more than three months. The 44-year-old is an experienced outdoorsman, but an encounter with a bear changed his luck, Quebec police said . At some point during a planned two-month canoe trek in the Lake Matagami area, a bear attacked Lavoie's campsite, eating his food and ruining his equipment, police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe said. The bear did not injure Lavoie but left him without the tools or resources to survive. Police say they have yet to speak with Lavoie to get details. Minnesota hiker falls from cliff to his death near Yosemite waterfall . ""In these parts, there's a subculture of people who go on these long trips into the middle of nowhere, but sometimes we forgot how dangerous it can be,"" Gerald Lemoine, mayor of a small town near Matagami, told the Montreal Gazette. The rescued canoeist began his adventure July 16, Coulombe said. It wasn't until three months later, on October 21, that his family called authorities because too long had passed without Lavoie's return. Police conducted searches for eight days, weather permitting, with no luck. Rescuers in a helicopter finally spotted Lavoie on Wednesday, but they could not safely land at that spot, Coulombe said. So officers had to hike in to pick him up and carry him more than a mile to the chopper. Lavoie's condition was such that he was barely able to speak and at first couldn't even drink water, the Gazette reported. Had he spent another day or two in the elements, he would have starved to death, police spokesman Ronald McInnis said. The man had lost half of his body weight, he said. It was Lavoie's German shepherd who scared the bear away on the day of the attack, but the dog did not survive the ordeal, McInnis said. ""Up there, in the Canadian shield, there's little plant life to live off, so he would have been slowly, painfully dying when they found him. It's an amazing feat that he was able to keep himself alive this long with almost no equipment,"" survival instructor Caleb Musgrave told the Gazette. ""When you start to go hungry, you get mood swings, your mind breaks, and you cramp up all over your body. Eventually, your body will start cannibalizing itself, eating away at the fat in your organs and then in your muscles. It takes someone who won't give up in the face of that,"" he added.

"Paris (CNN) -- France and Germany have just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Elysée Treaty in Berlin. Even British Prime Minister David Cameron had to respect this most symbolic date and wait another 24 hours before delivering his long-awaited speech on Europe. In 2003, for the Elysée Treaty's 40th anniversary, Jacques Chirac had lavishly received Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, and the whole of the Bundestag to Versailles. In his speech, the French president had invoked Goethe, Hugo and of course Charles de Gaulle and Adenauer, the founders of the Franco-German rapprochement in 1963. This year, Berlin was hosting the celebrations with a Bundestag bursting at the seams, having had to add 577 extra seats to accommodate the whole of the French National Assembly. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande gave a common press conference, met with students, answered their questions and went for lunch. Some in the press corps, like Ian Traynor, The Guardian's Brussels correspondent, complained about the food and tweeted a picture of the menu: beetroot, red cabbage and red berries, prompting the all too predictable comment: ""why didn't they let the French do the cooking?"" Opinion: Why Hollande must show clearer leadership . There was pomp, emotion and comedy. As Hollande made its way into a packed Reichstag for his speech, he missed a step. A broken leg would have sent the wrong message. Luckily, the president didn't fall. A few moments later, when the first notes of the Marseillaise started filling the Reichstag for the first time in the building's dramatic history, even French MPs held their breath and eyes got misty. For the Elysée Treaty has no comparison in contemporary history: it still, to this day, offers a unique model of reconciliation between two states. France and Germany enjoy joint cabinet meetings and political partnerships at all levels. Both countries have gone from hereditary hatred, to hereditary friendship. And this is no small accomplishment in light of the three wars France and Germany waged against each other from 1870 to 1945. As Thomas Klau from think-tank ECFR (European Council of Foreign relations) put it: ""The Elysée Treaty is to France and Germany what the Bible is to the church, even if people don't read it every day."" With a combined total of 40% of the eurozone GDP, 33% of the entire EU's population and 31% of its budget, France and Germany are the locomotive of the European Union and remain so even when their respective heads of state are at odds. It always takes a French president and a German chancellor a couple of years to get along well. Mitterrand-Kohl, Chirac-Schröder, Sarkozy-Merkel, even when they both belonged to the same political family, took time to work together. But when there is a spark and personal chemistry between the two leaders, this means progress for the whole continent. During intermediary phases when they are getting to know each other -- like today, with a social democrat Hollande and a conservative Merkel -- progress is slow. Nowhere better than in Brussels is this more obvious. And it is especially damaging in time of a crisis such as the one we're living. This is why France and Germany have no choice but to find a compromise or there could be consequences for the European project. France thinks financial solidarity should precede political integration, Germany suggest the opposite. No doubt the markets and their 25 European partners in the union will soon remind them to come up with a common view. At this time more than ever -- in the week that Cameron has promised Britain a referendum on its EU membership -- Europe's future depends on Franco-German unity of purpose and action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Agnes Poirier.","It is 50 years since the leaders of France and Germany signed the Elysée Treaty .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Congress decided to bury the nation's nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain, Nevada, the federal government moved at the pace of a glacier. But when the political winds changed and the government decided to shut down the project, it acted with unusual speed, according to a report released Tuesday. The Department of Energy reduced its staff and transferred excess property in the blink of an eye, bureaucratically speaking. ""Several DOE officials told us that they had never seen such a large program with so much pressure to close down so quickly,"" the Government Accountability Office said in the report. The shutdown of the Yucca project, in fact, moved with such haste that it could hinder efforts to resurrect the plan if so desired by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the courts, the GAO said. Yucca Mountain -- 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada -- was to be the solution to the nuclear waste problem: a final destination for the tons of hazardous nuclear waste accumulating at commercial reactors in 33 states. In 1987, Congress directed the DOE to dispose of waste in the mountain beginning in 1998. But political opposition to the plan has been relentless, and the DOE was unable to meet the deadline. In 2008, the DOE submitted a license application to the NRC seeking to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, with a goal of opening it in 2017, a date later delayed until 2020. In March of 2009, following the election of President Obama, the secretary of energy announced plans to terminate the Yucca Mountain project and set up a blue-ribbon commission to study alternatives. The commission is scheduled to issue an interim report in July and a final report by January. The DOE's decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain program ""was made for policy reasons, not technical or safety reasons,"" the GAO report says. DOE officials believe ""there are better solutions that can achieve a broader national consensus to the nation's spent fuel and nuclear waste storage needs than Yucca Mountain,"" the GAO said. The GAO said that while it is unclear whether the NRC or the courts will resurrect the project, the DOE ""undertook an ambitious set of steps to dismantle"" the program. Starting in February 2010, the DOE redirected funds to be used on closeout activities, setting a September 30, 2010, deadline that was largely met, the GAO said. According to the DOE General Counsel, the September 30 deadline did not allow time for formal planning, although officials stated they believe necessary plan did occur. The DOE undertook ""extensive efforts to preserve data related to its licensing efforts, as well as other scientific information relevant to the storage and disposal of high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel,"" the GAO said. In contrast, efforts to retain project staff were ""minimal,"" the GAO said. The 180 federal staffers began leaving as soon as they found new jobs, placing increasing stress on the remaining staff to have an orderly shutdown. The Department of Energy used expedited procedures to transfer a large volume of office furniture and equipment, declaring it ""abandoned"" and moving it to other agencies, arguing that it would cost $680 per day to store the equipment more routine procedures were used. ""The loss of staff with experience at Yucca Mountain could hinder the license review if the process is resumed,"" the GAO said. ""Reconstituting this expertise and teamwork could be difficult should the licensing process be resumed."" In a letter to the GAO, the DOE said it ""strongly disagrees"" with many of the reports conclusions. Concerning the shutdown, it said the department ""was committed to closing down the Yucca Mountain Project in a responsible manner, and it successfully did so."" It said the GAO was inaccurate in stating it did not follow federal policy and guidance for planning.","Yucca Mountain, Nevada, was to be the site of nuclear waste storage .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown pleaded not guilty to both charges in the felony assault case against him Monday afternoon. Singer Chris Brown, right, appeared in court Monday on charges of assaulting singer Rihanna. Singer Rihanna, the girlfriend Brown is accused of attacking, wants the case resolved without a trial, her lawyer said. The only words heard from Brown, 19, during his brief appearance before Judge Patricia Schnegg were ""not guilty,"" which he said twice as Schnegg asked for his plea on the two counts. Brown is charged with felony counts of assault and making criminal threats. If he is convicted, the sentence could range from probation to four years and eight months in prison, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has said. The alleged attacked happened during an argument in February that began when 21-year-old Rihanna, who had been dating Brown, found a text message from another woman on his cell phone, according to a sworn police statement.  Watch Chris Brown enter his plea » . Rihanna's lawyer, Donald Etra, told reporters after Monday's hearing that his client ""would prefer that the matter be resolved expeditiously and fairly."" ""She believes that the quicker this case is over, the more quickly she can get back to her life and her career, which is exactly what she'd like to do,"" Etra said. Rihanna, who is in her home country, Barbados, ""is in fine spirits, she's doing fine,"" he said. ""She would be pleased if this were over quickly,"" Etra said. He said there were ""efforts on behalf of all of the parties to try to resolve the case expeditiously and fairly."" The goal is ""to see if it can be resolved prior to the preliminary hearing and prior to trial,"" Etra said. ""I think that would benefit everybody."" When asked if Rihanna would cooperate with prosecutors, Etra gave the same response he's given previously. ""If asked to testify, she will do so,"" he said. He said it was ""premature to speculate"" what Rihanna might consider a fair plea deal for Brown. When Brown appeared for his first hearing a month ago, Rihanna's lawyer asked the judge not to prohibit Brown from having contact with her while he faces felony charges of assaulting her.  Watch Brown at his March court appearance » . The judge granted Rihanna's request, only warning Brown ""not to annoy, harass, molest, threaten or use force or violence against anyone."" Court documents released last month revealed details about the case against Brown, including a police statement that the incident began when Rihanna, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, found a text message on Brown's cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with."" Brown issued a public apology for the incident in February. ""Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,"" he said in a statement released by his spokesman. ""I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person."" Brown has not commented publicly since issuing that statement. The next court hearing in the case is set for April 29. CNN's K.J.

"(CNN) -- Philippine police and armed forces negotiated the release of five hostages on Tuesday as a tense stand-off with rebels from the Muslim Moro National Liberation Front entered its second day in Zamboanga City in the southern Philippines. ""This morning five people, including four children, who were held hostage in Talon-talon were released by the rebels,"" Mayor Isabelle Climaco-Salazar said in a statement, adding that one policeman was wounded in the thigh in an exchange of fire on Tuesday morning. At least six people were killed yesterday in exchanges of gunfire between the rebels and armed forces. Authorities said it was unclear how many hostages were still being held by the estimated 300 armed Muslim rebels in the blockaded areas of Zamboanga City, a mainly Christian city on the southern coast of Mindanao. Philippine Interior and Local Government Secretary Mar Roxas told a press conference that authorities believed as many as 180 people -- which he described as ""human shields"" -- could be being held hostage. ""These are very soft estimates,"" said Roxas, who flew in from Manila to supervise operations. Hundreds of troops have been deployed to Zamboanga in response to the crisis. ""It's hard to determine (whether) they're hostages or just residents of the area, but we are taking these numbers quite seriously and that is why the military and the police have exercised restraint."" Roxas did not say whether the rebels had made any demands . ""There are ongoing talks, formal and informal, in various stages of maturity,"" he said. ""We are also seeking to validate the bonafides of those presenting themselves as mediators so that we are not led astray in these talks."" An MNLF spokesman told the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper that the group was holding 35 hostages. ""We seized them by the roadside so the soldiers won't shoot when they see us,"" he said. According to a statement issued by Climaco-Salazar, the crisis began at around 4.30 a.m. local time Monday when government forces clashed with armed rebels heading for the city by boat. Six people, including a policeman, a navy serviceman and four civilians, were killed during the course of these clashes. She said the rebels had planned to march on the city hall. The MNLF, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in this mainly Catholic country, signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996 -- though some of its members have broken away to continue with a violent campaign. Under the terms of the 1996 agreement, Misuari was named as governor of an expanded Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). He served until 2001. Last month Misuari issued a ""declaration of independence"" for the Moro nation -- referring to Mindanao's indigenous Muslim population -- after complaining that the MNLF had been left out of a recent wealth-sharing agreement with an another insurgent group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state on the resource-rich island of Mindanao. CNN's Kathy Quiano and Tim Schwarz contributed to this story.","MNLF rebels release five hostages, four of them children, as stand-off enters second day .

"(CNN) -- It's time to stop being surprised by Pope Francis. Since he became pontiff, he's made a lot of news. His tweets echo around the world. He embodies principles of humility and piety. He eschews the fancy trappings of office favored by his predecessor, from the Popemobile to the red shoes. He washed the feet of prisoners, including a Muslim woman, on Holy Thursday. He telephones ordinary people who write to him. In Rome, he called for ""revolutionaries"" to leave the comforts of their home and bring the word into the streets. In Rio, he told the gathered youth to ""make a mess"" in the dioceses as they help the church shake off clericalism. He has sought to create a ""culture of encounter"" in which atheists and Catholics might come together. ""Do good,"" he said memorably. ""We will meet each other there."" When he announced that he would canonize Pope John XXIII, the great reformer, on the same day as John Paul II, he emphasized continuity among all Catholics, even those of different factions. When asked about gay priests, he replied, ""Who am I to judge?"" Most recently, he gave a long interview in which he articulated a new vision of the church that does seem revolutionary. In the West, reaction has focused on his statements about hot-button social issues. For example, he said, ""the teaching of the church (on abortion, gay marriage, and contraception), for that matter, is clear ... (but) it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time."" Given the constant drumbeat of the American church hierarchy on exactly those issues, the line comes off as a surprising rebuke. Deeper critiques lie within the interview as well. When he spoke about doubt and dialogue, he said, ""If the Christian is a restorationist, a legalist, if he wants everything clear and safe, then he will find nothing."" At the very least, Francis has found a message that resonates with Catholics and non-Catholics alike. But as repeatedly stated by commentators and church officials, he has not changed anything. He has called for no new doctrines. His reorganization of the Vatican goes slowly. The problems besetting the church before his election remain. Traditionalists, who wish to preserve gains won under the past two popes, and reformers, who are frustrated by the pace of change, agree on this one thing. To this point, Francis' impact emerges from his behavior and his words, not his executive power as pope. And yet, he has this power to surprise. Every time he demonstrates his humility or his empathy, his words resonate with Catholics and non-Catholics alike. They bring both pleasure and surprise that such a seemingly honest, humble and holy person really could be pope. Don't be surprised at what Francis is doing; instead, wonder if the rest of the church hierarchy is going to catch up. Francis' revolution emerges out of the core of Catholicism. He emphasizes humility, poverty, social justice, non-judgment, peace and especially mercy. That he can seem so transformative without changing any theological principles is a testament to the depth and power of his reform, not its limitations. Such a reform has historical precedent. More than 800 years ago, another Francis, the son of a cloth merchant in Assisi, came to Rome to see the pope. The church of the 13th century relied heavily on formula. This reliance distanced the priests from their parishioners and was a growing problem in an era of societal change. Francis and his disciples, who attempted to live in perfect poverty and humility, had dedicated themselves to preaching and outreach to the people. They tried to pattern their lives by the principles of Christ. The pope, Innocent III, gave Francis his approval and supported the new Franciscan order. He hoped that the charismatic humility of Francis might help address some of the problems the church was facing. Eight hundred years later, Archbishop Jorge Bergoglio became the first pope to take Francis' name as his own. St. Francis' revolutionary message focused on a return to first principles, as he saw them. While Pope Francis has ascended to the throne of St. Peter and St. Francis never chose to be ordained, one can locate certain parallels unfolding between the two men and their efforts at reform. This pope is also turning to the first principles as he perceives them. Pope Francis makes the argument that everything he needs to transform the church already exists within the core teachings. And if this is the core, how can anyone choose not to follow? What would it look like for the rest of the hierarchy to go where Francis is leading? For one thing, they might find lots of their lay parishioners and the women and men in holy order already there, working. But while the hierarchy clearly elected Francis to reform the workings of the Vatican, it's not clear that they expected his personal piety to put such pressure on them. Traditionalist response to Francis has concentrated on his personal charisma while emphasizing the orthodoxy of his doctrinal positions. Such responses seem to indicate a resistance to the idea that they might need to change anything. In a recent interview with the New Catholic Reporter, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York talked about the new pope. He said that in the wake of Francis, he found himself ""examining my own conscience ... on style, on simplicity, on lots of things."" The cardinal wondered whether his living arrangements, in the historical residence of the archbishops of New York, were appropriate. But the cardinal wasn't quite sure what to do about it, given that he can't sell the building. St. Francis would have agreed. He carefully never argued for the church to sell of its property or divest itself of income. Of course, he was outside the church hierarchy and relied on papal protection for his safety. Pope Francis, on the other hand, might have a plan for an empty archbishop's residence if Cardinal Dolan wanted to downsize. After all, he did recently suggest that empty church property should be used to house refugees. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Perry.","David Perry: Pope Francis has not called for any new doctrines or changed anything .

"(EW.com) -- Fox chose an auspicious moment to greenlight a Batman prequel show. The same day the network announced ""Gotham,"" eternal rival Marvel saw its multi-punctuated ""Avengers"" spin-off ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" deliver a dominant series-premiere ratings performance. ""S.H.I.E.L.D.'s"" success is proof-of-concept for a new Superhero-Adjacent genre: A show set in a familiar super-universe that focuses on the less-super (and decidedly cheaper) heroes. ""Gotham"" is superficially similar. Like ""S.H.I.E.L.D.,"" it transforms a supporting character into the lead: The show will apparently constitute an origin story for Commissioner Gordon, the chief lawman and Friend-of-Batman played by Gary Oldman in the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy. But it also appears that ""Gotham"" will prominently feature other characters from the comic book mythos. Fox has indicated that iconic villains will also appear, in some kind of fetal prequel form. Expect to learn more about the show in tantalizing tidbits dropped with regular, Internet-imploding news releases over the next few months. In the meantime, here are five talking points about Gotham: . 1. It will probably have a strong narrative foundation from ""Batman: Year One."" Although less famous than Frank Miller's other grim-and-gritty '80s Caped Crusader adventure, The Dark Knight Returns, Miller's four-part origin-story collaboration with artist David Mazzucchelli has arguably been more influential. Year One provided the structural backbone for Batman Begins and strongly influenced the grounded portrayal of Gotham City through Christopher Nolan's trilogy. The new series might be Batman-free, but Year One is just as much an origin story for Jim Gordon. A younger Gordon arrives in Gotham as a Chicago transplant with a pregnant wife and discovers the Gotham police department is filled with corruption. He becomes a kind of Elliot Ness figure, a hero cop who refuses to take money; meanwhile, his personal life falls into shambles. Since Gotham is on network TV, the rampant corruption will probably be toned down, but don't be surprised if Gordon becomes a great-at-his-job/bad-at-his-life procedural protagonist. 2. It will hopefully have characters inspired by/taken directly from Gotham Central. This Greg Rucka/Ed Brubaker/Michael Lark monthly comic was short-lived but absolutely fantastic. Essentially Homicide: Life on the Street where the criminals are all costumed lunatics, Gotham Central focused on the nitty-gritty police work performed by its gigantic cast of detectives. At one point, a Gotham Central TV series was actually in development. (It was a long time ago; the network developing it was the WB.) While Central focused on the whole department, the new Gotham will probably zero in on a squad of badasses — but if we're lucky, some of those badasses will have names like Renee Montoya, Crispus Allen, and Maggie Sawyer. 3. It will almost certainly be a procedural. At least at first. The new hot concept for a broadcast drama is a Mission-of-the-Week drama set in a larger world that might eventually transform into something more ambitious. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Sleepy Hollow both had pilots that simultaneously set up long-running story arcs while promising hour-long monsters-of-the-week. Fox's own upcoming Almost Human could be a model for Gotham: set in a fantastical world, but with weekly cases that mix the fantastical with viewer-grabbing cop work. Gotham executive producer Bruno Heller created The Mentalist, one of the more durable procedural concepts of recent years. I wonder if the first season will gradually build up through a series of cases that point to an ultimate villain, à la Red John. 4. But the show's ambitions could grow, as it explores the history of Gotham. Batman's hometown has probably the most substantive history of any superhero city. Over the years, various writers and projects have used Gotham's dark-side-of-America persona as a chance to explore just about every bleak thing that has ever happened in the history of the American City. Will Gotham feature anything about the history of the Wayne family? Or the tangled families of the Gotham underworld? Could we ever get a trip to Wonder City, a prototype utopia fallen into disarray that appeared in Arkham City? Could season 5 of Gotham just be a long Batman-free retelling of the incredible earthquake-apocalypse story arc of ""No Man's Land""? Remember: Heller also produced Rome, HBO's proto-Game of Thrones, which constantly set its characters' struggles against the history of their society. 5. Clearly, the Riddler should be the Big Bad. Has any Batman villain had a rougher go of it in the modern era? He's the most famous Bat-baddie to not get a Nolanized reinterpretation — which means that his most prominent appearance in the last two decades of pop culture was Jim Carrey's green-tights performance in Batman Forever. But the Riddler could make for a great antagonist in a procedural: His whole existence is based around coming up with ever-more-elaborate mysteries. Also, if the creators of Gotham want to slowly back up into the crazier aspects of the Batman mythology — no Mr. Freeze, no Clayface — the Riddler is a real-ish psychotic. They could even play around with the Riddler's iconography: Maybe, in this retelling, he's Gordon's main nemesis. Or maybe he's initially working with the Gotham PD in some kind of expert capacity, like Hannibal in Hannibal. Come on guys, the Riddler! He makes riddles! What do you want to see from Gotham, fellow Bat-people? And who should play Jim Gordon? Patrick Wilson? Garrett Hedlund? Casey Affleck? See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Two heavyweights dominate the high-capacity commercial aviation industry -- Boeing and Airbus. Now the world's third-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft is touting an apparently lighter and quieter plane that it hopes will cut into the giants' market share for narrow body, medium-range commercial jets. The virgin test flight of the Bombardier CS100 -- from the first new family of commercial passenger jets in decades -- took place at Mirabel Airport, in Quebec, Monday. The 110-seat, single-aisle aircraft (a 135-seat version in the CSeries is also in the works, and a maximum capacity of 149 has been reported) is in the same class as Boeing's 737 series and Airbus 318 and 319 aircraft. Bombardier is a Canadian multinational company headquartered in Montreal. More: Jet sales boost China's rivalry with Boeing, Airbus . Apart from a minor alert going off midair, the two-and-a-half-hour flight was a success, the Age reports.

Expected to enter service in 2015, the Bombardier plane has two advantages over its rivals, its makers says. Made of lightweight composite materials, the CS100 beats Airbus and Boeing for fuel performance, most industry experts reportedly agree. More: U.S. company unveils new, cheap attack jet .

""You could hardly hear the takeoff,"" Martin Gauss, CEO of AirBaltic, said after watching the test flight in Quebec. ""This was one of the reasons we bought it, along with the cost savings from lower fuel burn."" There's a good reason why new commercial jet series come along so rarely -- the astronomical cost involved in developing them. The CS100 had already cost $500 million more than its official estimate of $3.5 billion, Bombardier said.","Test flight for Bombardier CS100 takes place in Quebec .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department is seeking dismissal of a lawsuit by the Tampa, Florida, socialite whose complaints about threatening and anonymous e-mails set off a chain of events resulting in the resignation of CIA director David Petraeus. Jill Kelley and her husband Dr. Scott Kelley filed suit in June against the FBI, Pentagon and unnamed federal agents for allegedly violating her privacy and accessing private e-mails against their wishes. The Kelleys claim government officials wrongfully disclosed Jill Kelley's name to the news media. Late Tuesday, the government asked that the lawsuit be dismissed because it failed to present any facts to show the FBI, Defense Department and others had violated Jill Kelley's rights. Kelley defends reputation after scandal . Former Gen. John Allen, commander of U.S. Central Command, was the first to receive an e-mail in June 2012 from a mysterious sender which referenced Kelley's social activities. The Kelleys later received similiar e-mails, which investigators determined were sent by Petraeus' biographer, Paula Broadwell. Petraeus resigned in November 2012 after having admitted to carrying out an extramarital affair with someone who was later revealed to be Broadwell. During the scandal, it also came to light that Kelley and Allen engaged in e-mail conversations, which anonymous officials suggested were inappropriate. Opinion: Kelley caught in the crossfire . The Kelleys said Jill Kelley and Allen were friends and not romantically involved and claimed such suggestions exposed her to ridicule. A Pentagon investigation cleared Allen of wrongdoing; he retired from the military in February. Alan Raul, an attorney representing the Kelleys, said they will continue to press their case ""so that justice can be done, and that other citizens may feel safe in coming forward to the government with evidence of crimes.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Demeaning, exploitative, degrading. Beauty pageants have been called lots of things. And it's also the line coming from Islamic hardliners, who are protesting this year's Miss World Contest, which is held in the most populous Muslim nation in the world. Protesters in Indonesia denounce the contest where women sashay in swimsuits and form-fitting evening wear, calling it insulting to Muslims and triggering threats of violence. Islamic groups urged the government to shut the contest down. Hardliners burned signs featuring the image of last year's winner Wenxia Yu of China that read ""Reject Miss World."" They also presented what they deemed as appropriate attire for beauty contestants -- long dresses and full head scarves. ""It's only beauty, beauty and beauty, but also body, body and body, so that's why we consider it as a contest that exploits women physically,"" said Ismail Yusanto, spokesman of Indonesia's Hizbut Tahrir, a conservative Islamic group. In an attempt to appease religious concerns, the pageant has scrapped the swimsuit competition and replaced it with less-revealing beachwear attire. Also, the finals were originally to be held on the outskirts of Jakarta, but angry protestors forced the event to relocate to the Hindu resort island of Bali. Members of the group, Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) tried to travel to Bali by sea from East Java, but were stopped by police. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, the CEO of MNC Group who organized the pageant locally, disputed the government's decision to move the contest to Bali. He said no laws have been violated by the pageant and that ""everything has been adjusted to the local culture. We all know that, so no bikini."" Even before the three-week contest began on September 8, protesters slammed it as ""pornography"" and held signs reading: ""Miss World is whore contest."" ""Our demand is still the same,"" Yusanto said. ""Don't continue this contest."" Miss World's 127 contestants competed in beach fashion, fitness, world fashion, talent and ""Beauty with a Purpose"" meant to honor charitable work. The top 10 models -- from Ukraine, South Sudan, Brazil, Philippines, France, Cameroon, Cyprus, England, Italy and the United States -- were announced earlier this week. A winner will be crowned in Bali on Saturday. Security forces will have 700 police officers for the final event. There has been criticism of how the Indonesian government handled the Miss World controversy, that it sent a message of capitulation in favor of a vocal minority. Indonesia is a secular country with moderate Muslims, but ""a small extremist fringe has become more vocal in recent years,"" according to the Jakarta Post. ""We are a complex country, so we have to balance domestic concerns with our ability to host international events,"" said Mari Elka Pangestu, the Tourism and Creative Economy Minister of Indonesia. ""But in general, Indonesia is very open."" But not all such women's contests are so vehemently opposed. A week ago, the World Muslimah 2013 competition was held in Jakarta, to crown a woman who applies ""Islamic values in everyday life,"" which includes the ability to recite from the Quran. Contestants dressed in head scarves and floor-length dresses. Obabiyi Aishah Aijbola from Nigeria was named World Muslimah 2013. Photo gallery: See World Muslimah 2013 . Eka Shanty, founder of World Muslimah says the difference between Miss World and World Muslimah is that the latter is not a pageant. ""This is an international award event to appreciate young and talented Muslim women."" In addition to decrying the Miss World contest, the conservative Islamic group Hizbut Tahrir does not support the World Muslimah competition.

"(CNN) -- Their bodies were missing for decades after they disappeared behind enemy lines.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a pending appeal from Oklahoma officials who were defending a state law limiting abortions performed with medicine instead of surgery. The law would have regulated the ability of doctors to prescribe a medication regime -- using RU-486 pills -- to terminate early pregnancies, and make it a crime to deviate from the federal government-approved dosage and time limits on the drugs. But many physicians -- backed by abortion rights supporters -- say they routinely induce medical abortions through a combination of drugs they determine is simpler, safer, and less expensive than the current federal protocols on the use of abortion drugs. The high court months ago had tentatively added this case to its docket, but put things on hold while it sought detailed answers from Oklahoma Supreme Court. Those state justices again affirmed the law's unconstitutionality, and now the nation's highest court tossed out Oklahoma's appeal ""as improvidently granted."" This was the first of several restrictive abortion laws nationwide to get review by the U.S. justices. A federal appeals court last week allowed a similar law from Texas to go into effect.

"Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- As Western powers try to verify claims that the Syrian government used chemical weapons this week in a northeastern suburb of Damascus, the Syrian government is accusing rebel forces of doing the same. State-run television reported Saturday that Syrian armed forces had surrounded Jobar, the opposition-held district on the edge of Damascus that saw some of the 1,300 reported dead in Wednesday's early morning attack. Several of the soldiers were ""suffocating"" from exposure to gases as they entered the city, according to state TV. ""It is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area,"" Syrian TV reporting, citing anonymous source. The government uses the term ""terrorists"" to describe rebel forces. It showed video of a room containing gas masks and gas canisters that the Army said were discovered in a storage facility in Jobar. CNN could not independently confirm the veracity of the claims or the authenticity of the video. Opposition leaders deny involvement in the attack, which they say killed hundreds near the capital. The competing claims surfaced as a White House official told CNN that President Barack Obama was meeting with his national security team to discuss the alleged chemical weapons attack . ""Once we ascertain the facts, the president will make an informed decision about how to respond,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. ""We have a range of options available, and we are going to act very deliberately so that we're making decisions consistent with our national interest as well as our assessment of what can advance our objectives in Syria."" In an exclusive interview with CNN that aired Friday, Obama said the United States and United Nations inspectors were gathering information on the attack, but that preliminary signs pointed to a ""big event of grave concern."" ""It is very troublesome,"" he said. ""That starts getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region."" The Syrian government has steadfastly denied its forces used chemical weapons outside Damascus or elsewhere. ""We said it from the first moment and, here, we assure again that we have never used chemical weapons (around Jobar) or any other region in any form whatsoever -- ... liquid, gas or whatever,"" Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said Saturday in an interview with a private Lebanese channel. Al-Zoubi went on to say that, on the contrary, his government is ""quite certain that (the rebels) are the ones using chemical weapons."" The opposition, though, has a Rebel different view. Syrian National Coalition Secretary-General Badr Jamous said Friday that rockets -- some with chemical warheads and others conventional weapons -- had been fired into a heavily populated civilian area. Most of the more than 1,300 reported dead were killed by chemical weapons, said Khaled al-Saleh, a spokesman for the umbrella opposition group. Al-Saleh said that medical teams in the affected area had administered 25,000 shots of atropine -- a medication used to treat people exposed to the nerve gas sarin -- after the attack. Video showed rows of bodies without apparent injury, as well as people suffering convulsions or apparently struggling to breathe. CNN could not verify where or when the videos were recorded, and could not confirm the number of casualties. Adding weight to the assertions that chemical weapons were used was a statement Saturday by Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders. Three hospitals -- all supported by the international organization -- in Syria's Damascus governorate reported having received some 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms last Wednesday morning, the statement said. Of them, 355 reportedly died, it said. ""Medical staff working in these facilities provided detailed information to MSF doctors regarding large numbers of patients arriving with symptoms including convulsions, excess saliva, pinpoint pupils, blurred vision and respiratory distress,"" said Dr. Bart Janssens, MSF director of operations. Patients were treated using atropine. ""MSF can neither scientifically confirm the cause of these symptoms nor establish who is responsible for the attack,"" said Janssens. ""However, the reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events --- characterized by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers --strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent."" How will the world respond? On Saturday, world leaders weighed their options. A Downing Street spokesperson said UK Prime Minister David Cameron -- who also talked with his Canadian counterpart Stephen Harper -- spoke Saturday to Obama. ""They reiterated that significant use of chemical weapons would merit a serious response from the international community and both have tasked officials to examine all the options,"" the spokesperson said. The White House issued a statement on the same conversation, saying the two leaders agreed to ""consult closely regarding this incident, as well as possible responses by the international community to the use of chemical weapons."" If the claims that Syria used chemical weapons prove true, a speedy response will be needed to prevent another such attack, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said. Hagel's comments Friday came after a senior Defense Department official told CNN that military planners have updated Syrian target lists. And it was disclosed that a fourth U.S. ship armed with cruise missiles has arrived in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Hagel addressed the issue aboard a military plane headed to Malaysia. ""We will determine at some point here very shortly what did happen,"" he said, according to a transcript posted on the Defense Department's website. ""If, in fact, this was a deliberate use and attack by the Syrian government on its own people using chemical weapons, there may be another attack coming,"" Hagel said. ""A very quick assessment of what happened and whatever appropriate response should be made."" Hagel said the American military provided Obama ""with options for all contingencies, and that requires positioning our forces, positioning our assets to be able to carry out different options, whatever options the president might choose."" He did not specify what those options might include. Hagel predicted other nations would lend their support if the investigation finds that the Syrian government used chemical weapons against its people. ""This is an international community issue; it violates every standard of international behavior,"" he said. ""That said, the United States has never given up its own sovereign right to protect its own interests."" The president has said he does not anticipate using ground forces in Syria. Other military options could include airstrikes by fighter jets or cruise missiles. The Navy destroyer USS Ramage has arrived in the region, a defense official said late Friday. It was intended to replace the USS Mahan, but the Mahan will remain temporarily along with the USS Gravelly and USS Barry. All four are equipped with cruise missiles. The president has authorized a limited amount of military hardware for the rebels in addition to logistical and humanitarian assistance. A senior Defense Department official told CNN that options for direct military action include targeting al-Assad's capability to deliver chemical weapons. Target lists could include government buildings and military installations, the official said, but the military must have flexible plans to target forces and equipment which ""continue to move."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, an advocate for a more forceful U.S. response to the Syrian conflict, has suggested that American air power could take out runways and planes used by al-Assad's forces that he said are ""dominating the battlefields and the towns and the cities."" McCain also has advocated giving rebels anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapons to establish a no fly zone. But administration officials have cautioned that some Syrian rebel factions have ties to al Qaeda terrorists. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said this week in a letter to a member of Congress that arming rebels requires ""choosing one among many sides."" ""It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor,"" Dempsey wrote. ""Today, they are not."" Also Saturday, a top U.N. official arrived in Damascus to press the government to cooperate in the investigation into its alleged use of chemical weapons. Angela Kane, the United Nations high representative for disarmament affairs, has been instructed by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to push the government to cooperate with the U.N. team already on the ground. U.N. inspectors want to reach the site of the alleged chemical weapons attack quickly in order to gather evidence while it is still fresh. Opposition leaders say the reported attack killed more than 1,300 people in a Damascus suburb. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Saturday the inspectors should be granted immediate access to the site ""if the Syrian regime has nothing to hide."" ""All the information available to us converge to say that there has been a chemical massacre in Syria, near Damascus, and to indicate that it is the regime of Bashar al-Assad who is at the origin,"" Fabius told reporters after meeting with Palestinian officials in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Earlier, British Foreign Secretary William Hague suggested the delay in granting access was suspicious. ""This is not something that a humane or civilized world can ignore,"" Hague said. Our priority is to make sure the world knows the facts of what has happened, and that means the U.N. team that is in Damascus, only 20 minutes away, being able to get there and to investigate."" Rapid access is critical, since any evidence would deteriorate ""over a matter of days,"" Hague said. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Damascus, and CNN's David Simpson wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Greg Botelho, Saad Abedine and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this story.","NEW: Syrian minister denies government forces used chemical weapons .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A rare Lincoln manuscript sold for $3.4 million on Thursday at Sotheby's auction house. The 1864 letter in which Abraham Lincoln replies to the abolitionist pleas of 195 young boys and girls was bought by a private American collector over the phone. The sale of the letter, from the Dr. Robert Small Trust, set a record for a Lincoln manuscript, a presidential manuscript and any American manuscript ever auctioned, Sotheby's spokeswoman Susan Ollinick said. The ""Little People's Petition"" had asked Lincoln ""to free all the little slave children of this country."" Lincoln wrote, ""Please tell these little people I am very glad their young hearts are so full of just and generous sympathy and that, while I have not the power to grant all they ask, I trust they will remember that God has, and that, as it seems, He wills to do it."" Although Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation had declared freedom for all slaves held in areas ""in rebellion"" against the United States as of January 1, 1863, full abolition of slavery was not accomplished until adoption of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution late in 1865. The letter had been expected to sell for $3 million to $5 million. About 20 Lincoln documents were among the 111 items for sale from the Small Trust. Also included were other documents from U.S. presidents, including pages from George Washington's diary and correspondence from Thomas Jefferson and John Adams; a rare document signed by both Meriwether Lewis and William Clark; about 10 documents from Robert E. Lee; and documents from John Brown, Samuel Clemens, Orville Wright and others. E-mail to a friend .","Letter is president's reply to children asking him to free slaves .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Inside a gated community in a tranquil Kenyan suburb, a group of builders are putting the final touches to the exterior of a lavish, red-tiled villa nestled in the middle of a landscape garden. Within the spacious property, no luxury is spared: Hardwood floors, Venetian finishes, designer furniture and five en-suite bathrooms ensure that all the modern conveniences are in place for the future tenants. Welcome to Miotoni Ridge, a 14-mansion development in one of the Kenyan capital's most prestigious locations. Houses here are designed for the highest-end of the luxury market. Asking prices are running at more than $1 million but that has not deterred any potential buyers: 60% of these properties are already sold out. In fact, a study earlier this year by estate agents Knight Frank and Citi Private Wealth found that Nairobi was the best performing prime residential market in the world. Values in the city grew up by 25% in 2011, leaving luxury hotspots such as London, Miami and Hong Kong behind. Read more: Africans shun crisis-hit West for jobs back home . Ben Woodhams, managing director of Knight Frank Kenya, says the findings of the survey surprised even the agency's research department. ""We were higher than Miami and it was like 'how dare you,'"" he says. ""So we had to justify our figures and say 'yes, this really is what is happening here.' But it is about growth, it is not about value."" Although this growth comes from a base of relatively low prices, Woodhams says there's a number of factors that has made investing in Kenya's luxury housing market attractive. ""Regionally Kenya is a safe haven,"" he says. ""People are seeing relatively good returns in Kenya specifically, but [also] in Africa as a whole -- particularly with the problems we are seeing in the rest of the world."" Woodhams says it's mostly Kenyan or Kenyan-linked investors that drove the country's prime housing market to the top spot. ""A lot of Kenyans in the diaspora in the [United] States and Europe send a lot of money back to Kenya and a lot of that gets invested in the property market,"" he says. ""So that is another big driver for us."" Yet, Nairobi is not the only location in Kenya experiencing great growth in luxury real estate. Coastal hotspots such as Mombasa, Malindi and Lamu occupied the second spot in The Wealth Report 2012, recording a 20% price growth in luxury residential properties. Lamu, a tiny island located off Kenya's north coast, is the second home for many tycoons, attracting local and international investors who flock in to get a unique combination of sun and culture. Andrew McGhie, a Lamu-based estate agent, says that Kenya's coast tugs at people's heart strings, not just their wallets. ""Lamu attracts a fairly adventurous romantic type person who wants to come to somewhere that is completely different to their everyday lives,"" he says. ""While the old town has changed a little bit in the last five years, it hasn't changed much in the last 500 years."" Read more: Using the web to fight corruption . Although Kenya's prime real estate might be booming, analysts say that international investors have been slow to dive into the country's market, partly due to security reasons. Lawlessness in neighboring Somalia recently spilled over the border while kidnappings of tourists in the area prompted several countries to put out travel warnings. Kenyan forces have moved to occupy southern Somalia and beefed up security on the coast. The warnings were lifted but the chilling effect remains. ""International investors are keen in getting into countries where they know that their property rights are protected. Where the rule of law is respected,"" says James Muratha, regional director at Stanbic Investments. ""And where there is a perception where the justice system is not up to par, then they prefer to stay away. And that is why you see more local investors investing in these markets as opposed to international investors,"" he adds. Analysts also say that uncertainty about upcoming elections and high interest rates may also hamper growth in the market. But agents believe it will only be temporary. Woodhams says the country's market can offer top returns to individual and institutional investors. ""It is not just because of the direct relationship between rent and capital value,"" he says. ""We are talking about year on year growth as well and I think that's the key. ""The levels of growth we have seen in Kenya have made the returns for corporate institutional investors very good indeed."" Ultimately, they hope the deals will just be too good to miss.","Kenya's prime housing market saw the biggest price increase globally last year, a report has found .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Bolshoi Ballet star soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko pleaded not guilty Tuesday to masterminding an acid attack on the theater's artistic director, Sergei Filin, a court spokesman told CNN. Alleged accomplice Yuri Zarutsky pleaded guilty to carrying out the attack, but he said he had acted alone. A third defendant in the case, Andrei Lipatov, denied the charges. He's accused of aiding Zarutsky by acting as his driver. Filin was walking up to his Moscow apartment in January when a masked assailant tossed sulfuric acid onto his face, leaving him severely burned and nearly blinded. Proceedings were adjourned to Thursday after the three men heard and responded to the charges. A fight at the ballet: The power struggle tearing apart the Bolshoi . Filin has spent much of the past year in Germany, where doctors have been working to save his sight. He has undergone multiple surgeries and has regained 80% of his vision in one eye, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency said. His other eye, in which he was completely blind after the attack, has not recovered to the same extent, but he can now pick out large objects, it said. Filin recently returned to Moscow, but he still needs further treatment. There's still a question mark over whether he will be able to return to his role at the Bolshoi Ballet, one of Russia's iconic cultural institutions. The case has sparked great public interest in Russia, where tales of intrigue and bitter rivalries have swirled around the ballet's dancers and management.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Anticipation hung heavier than the sultry air outside the massive court complex Friday afternoon. Here and all across India, people awaited the decision from Courtroom No. 304. Inside the wood-paneled room lighted by the glare of harsh white lights, the four men found guilty of gang-raping a Delhi woman would learn whether they would die for their crime. Three exchanged their t-shirts for collared shirts on this day, one of the most important of their lives. Life or death? The people clamored for the latter. A curious crowd gathered outside the courtroom as the clock neared 2:30 p.m., when Judge Yogesh Khanna was set to convene his court. Some traveled great distances to be present when the sentences were read. It was almost as though this were judgment day for all of India. There are no cameras allowed inside the courthouse, but everyone had a cell phone. One woman stood on a bench, held her dated Samsung high in the air and pressed the video button. She wanted to capture every moment. Opinion: Rape sentence is just the start of India's fight for equality . Mounted police as well as a water cannon truck were the most obvious signs of the combustive atmosphere. Authorities blocked off the road in front of the Saket District Court complex in hopes of preventing angry clashes. Dozens of journalists set up roadside mini studios to file what felt to many like the biggest story of the year. Prosecutors argued that the men -- Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh Singh -- deserved to die for an ""extreme act of brutality."" The woman's family members have said the same. To them and many others gathered here, nothing less could deliver justice. Nothing else could be an appropriate ending to a case that has gripped India. People here had waited for this day for nine long months, since December 16, when the woman, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, went to see ""The Life of Pi"" with a male friend. The movie theater is in an upscale mall just a short walk from this court complex. The woman -- Indian law forbids naming rape victims -- and her friend boarded a private bus to make their way home from South Delhi to the suburbs. The driver and at least five other men, said police, were drunk that night and looking for a joyride. They dragged the woman to the back of the bus and beat up her friend, authorities claim; then they took turns raping her, using an iron rod to violate her as the bus drove around the city for almost an hour. When they had finished, they dumped their victims on the side of the road. The woman's internal injuries were so severe that some organs had to be removed. Two weeks later, at a hospital in Singapore, she died. The horrific nature of the crime got to people. It was like a bomb had exploded inside the collective Indian psyche. Opinion: Where have India's females gone? The nation erupted in outrage. Crowds poured into the streets of major cities and openly questioned the civility of their own society. How could the world's most populous democracy, a nation that had finally made its stand on the global stage, allow such a heinous act to take place? As India waited to hear the fate of the men responsible for casting such a dark shadow over their nation, a national discussion blossomed on the treatment of women. It included a call for tougher punishment for sexual assault. For some at the courthouse, Friday's sentence would be a test, of sorts, of whether the message had been heeded. The trial lasted seven months. This week, the court convicted the four men of murder, rape and kidnapping. The parents of the victim cried as they listened to the judge read the verdict. There were two others accused in the case. The bus driver, Ram Singh, was found dead in his jail cell in March. Authorities said he had hanged himself, though his family says he was murdered. A teenage boy -- he was 17 at the time of the rape -- was convicted August 31 for his part in the gang rape. A juvenile court sentenced him to three years in a special juvenile correctional facility, the maximum allowed under the court's rules. Many Indians, including the victim's family, expressed dissatisfaction with the boy's sentencing. Friday, they hoped the court would not fail them. The crowds began to swell outside the courtroom as the appointed time approached. People lined the balconies along the courtyard, three levels up from the courtroom. ""Oh, God,"" someone remarked. ""They have to get rid of this crowd."" But the police, some attired in riot gear, did little to keep people out. Inside the courtroom, the four men sat teary-eyed. Perhaps they knew of the enormous pressure on Khanna, the judge, to condemn them. As Khanna announced the sentence, one of the men, Sharma, let out loud cries of anguish. He and the other three will be executed. That was the judge's decision. The prosecutors congratulated one another. They had done their job. Court sentences 4 to death in gang rape case . The victim's father said, ""Justice has been delivered."" Few journalists were allowed into the courtroom, but the news traveled fast. Just after 2:30 p.m., cries of ""Fansi! Fansi! (Hang them!)"" rang out through the halls of the court building. ""Death for all four,"" shouted one man. The news was welcomed on the streets. But soon, anger filled the crowd's chants. People turned their ire on the teenager who will be a free man in three years. ""Don't let him reach adulthood!"" some shouted. Smita Sinha, who works for a women's aid organization, said there was no closure for her Friday. ""We are here for justice,"" she said. ""We are happy, but it is a half-happiness. That juvenile should be hanged. Why does he go free? He will rape again. This is only half justice."" Sinha said she's been on the streets protesting for nine months -- and will continue to do so. She said she believed many Indians were hungry for death because capital punishment sends an effective message to would-be rapists. India, she said, needs to send that kind of message. While the laws punishing sexual assault are on the books, they aren't always enforced, Sinha said. ""In India, a fear of death means something,"" she said. Defense lawyers had urged the judge to show leniency and sentence the men to life in prison, saying the death penalty should be the exception, not the rule. ""Yes, it is a basic right for every human being to live,"" Sinha said. ""But why should (the accused) live when they created circumstances that made a woman fight for her life for 15 days?"" Indian courts have issued death sentences, but executions have been rarely carried out in the past decade. In this case, the judge said the harshest penalty was necessary. ""There cannot be any tolerance,"" Khanna said. ""This crime in every way falls within the rarest of rare category warranting a death sentence."" The people called for the boy's death. They called for revolution. One man, Tabrej Alam, sat with his oil paints and a canvas. He'd traveled all the way from the eastern state of Bihar to be at the court Friday. As the afternoon unfolded, a painting emerged. It showed a young man with the likeness of the evil, a hangman's noose around his neck. Friday's judgment, he said, was one way to cleanse India of evil. Holy man castrates self after India guru charged with rape of 16-year-old girl .

"(CNN) -- Classic rockers Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers were thrilled to get back five guitars stolen less than a week before the start of an international tour. ""I am extremely grateful to the Culver City Police Department for a job well done and touched by the outpouring of good wishes and concern from our fans and friends,"" Petty said Tuesday on the band's Facebook page. A 51-year-old private security guard was arrested Monday night in Los Angeles and booked for grand theft, according to Culver City Police Lt. Ron Iizuka. The instruments were stolen late last week from a soundstage where the Heartbreakers were rehearsing for their tour, which is set to start Wednesday in Broomfield, Colorado. A $7,500 reward was offered for the return of the guitars, which included a vintage 1967 Rickenbacker, a 1967 Epiphone and a 1965 Gibson. ""Sometimes people make mistakes, but we'd like these back,"" Petty said on his Twitter account Friday. ""No questions asked."" According to police, one of the guitars was sold at a Hollywood pawn shop. Officers were able to identify the person who pawned it, according to Iizuka. Daryl Washington, a Los Angeles resident, was taken into custody and the other four guitars were recovered, authorities said. Detectives will present the case to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office for filing consideration, police said in a statement. Both as a solo artist and leader of the Heartbreakers, Petty is one of America's top recording artists, selling more than 57 million albums, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Among his hits are ""Refugee,"" ""American Girl,"" ""Free Fallin' "" and ""The Waiting.""

"(CNN) -- For many Vermonters, the devastating floods in Colorado are a stark reminder of the disaster Vermont experienced just two years ago as a result of Tropical Storm Irene. I remember being in shock as I made my way across our battered state, seeing so many of our most treasured features -- our covered bridges, fertile farmland, historic downtowns, and winding rural roads -- destroyed by the tremendous force of floodwater. The storm's 60-mph winds and up to 11 inches of rain damaged 3,500 homes and businesses, 500 miles of state roads and 200 bridges. And tragically, six lives were lost, including those of a father and son, city employees who were checking on the community's wastewater treatment facility. Colorado floods: Stories of grief, generosity and gratitude . In the days, weeks and months that followed Irene, Vermont state government joined together with our local and federal government, nonprofits, and legions of volunteers to get people and communities back on their feet as quickly as possible. At the Agency of Natural Resources, we responded to spills of hazardous waste, gasoline and oil. We helped communities repair drinking water and sewage treatment systems. We supported our transportation agency and our cities and towns as they quickly rebuilt roads and bridges. We responded to calls to address the large accumulations of gravel, tree trunks, cars, refrigerators, propane tanks and endless amounts of debris that threatened to cause further damage to bridges, roads and homes, or presented a risk of harm to public health and safety. How to help . From that emergency response, we learned a few critical lessons that I offer for our counterparts in Colorado: . Sleep and eat. This flood emergency response will continue for many weeks. It is a marathon, not a sprint, and you and your staff can only be helpful if you take care of your own basic needs. Ask for help. Many folks want to help, including experts who are prepared to pitch in at a moment's notice. Take some time to think carefully about where you could use the extra boots on the ground and ask for assistance. Communicate. The first casualty of a crisis is information. Make sure you have the facts before you act. Talk to the folks in the field. Share relevant information with the emergency response directors. Let the public know what you know through updates and guidance from your experts. You cannot communicate too much. Build back with resilience in mind. Two years after Irene, we are still recovering. Communities are still rebuilding roads and bridges. Some destroyed houses can still be seen, too damaged to repair. Perhaps as a consequence of global climate disruption we are seeing significant increases in the frequency and intensity of storms in Vermont so that even as we rebuild, many of our communities have faced additional flooding since Irene. From these facts, we have learned that it is important to look ahead and rebuild with future resilience to flooding in mind. Once the water goes down, everyone will have the same initial instinct to quickly replace everything and restore communities to the way they were before the flood. Sometimes that instinct is correct. Putting a road or bridge back as soon as possible may be critical to a community's ability to ensure that its citizens can get emergency services and food. But other times, the desire to put everything back just the way it was before is misplaced. We discovered in Vermont that much of the damage we experienced after Irene mirrored damage from flooding in 1927 and again in the 1970s, because we rebuilt in the same way and in the same places. We are trying not to repeat that mistake. So when we rebuild our roads, culverts, bridges and wastewater and drinking water systems, we are taking into account the more intense weather events we can expect in the future, and we are building this infrastructure to withstand future flooding. We are also taking advantage of our natural assets to make us more flood-resilient by giving our rivers room to move and by protecting our natural systems such as floodplains, wetlands and vegetation along river corridors. This will provide critical flood protections for our communities. For the moment, however, we in Vermont know well that the first priority in Colorado must be to rescue those whose lives are at risk, to reconnect communities and families that have been cut off by the disaster, and to ensure that every person has a place to stay and food to eat. We also know that this first emergency response will be just the first step on what will be a long and challenging journey. For all of these reasons, our hearts and prayers are with all Coloradans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Deb Markowitz.","Deb Markowitz: Vermonters' hearts and prayers are with flood victims in Colorado .
She says Vermont learned lessons from the epic floods from Tropical Storm Irene .
Markowitz: One lesson is to resist temptation to build back in the same form as before ."
"(CNN) -- The sun may be setting on Mark Webber's Formula One career, but the veteran Australian driver lit up Abu Dhabi on Saturday by snatching pole position from all-conquering Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel. Webber has been outshined by the German for most of this season, but he has given himself a chance of ending the four-time world champion's run of six consecutive victories in Sunday's race. That would be sweet for the 37-year-old, who will drive in endurance racing for Porsche next season after a frustrating time in Vettel's shadow. As light segued to dark in qualifying for F1's only day/night event, Webber posted the fastest time of 1:39:957 at Yas Marina for his second pole this season -- the other was two races ago in Japan, where he finished second to Vettel. He now has three races in which to add to his nine career wins. ""It's not the easiest venue, because of the changing temperatures,"" Webber, who is fifth in the overall standings, told reporters. ""We run in the afternoon and then at night, so you have to be on top of the changing conditions as a driver and also from an engineering perspective. Interactive: Explore 'Fab-u' Dhabi's F1 circuit . ""It wasn't the most electric start to Q1 or Q2, but we made changes to the car as the session went on and I got more comfortable. I knew I had to work on certain sections of the track which Sebastian had already been doing a good job on, so I had to try and match him as well as continuing to keep the areas where I was doing a good job too, so overall I'm happy with the pole. ""We're really looking forward to the race tomorrow."" Vettel, who last weekend became only the third driver in F1 history to win four successive championships, appeared happy to share the limelight with a man who he denied victory in Malaysia after ignoring team orders. ""It was a great result for the team. At the start of qualifying I think Mercedes looked very strong; Mark and myself weren't hanging about, but they were very quick,"" the 26-year-old said. ""In Q3 we seemed to be able to find a little bit of extra time. Mark did a very good lap, so congratulations to him. I should have done a little bit better, but I don't know if it would have been enough, Mark deserves to be on pole today; it was a good lap with no mistakes."" Second-placed Mercedes' bid to stay ahead of Ferrari in the constructors' standings was boosted when Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton locked up the second row of the grid, despite the latter suffering mechanical problems. ""Fourth place feels pretty good this evening considering the time was set on my first Q3 lap,"" said 2008 world champion Hamilton. ""Unfortunately on my second lap it looks like something gave way at the back of the car as I got on the power at the chicane and it just snapped out, which forced me into a spin. ""It was a great lap and might just have been enough to get us onto the front row as I was fourth-tenths up on my first effort, but these things happen. ""The car felt really strong today so we'll hope for a good start and then challenge to make up some positions in the race tomorrow. The good thing is that we are ahead of Ferrari and that's where we need to stay."" Ferrari's focus, despite all statements to the contrary, seems to be on next season already, with Fernando Alonso -- second in the championship -- failing to make Q3 for the first time this year. The Spaniard qualified 11th, though he will have a choice of tires, while teammate Felipe Massa was eighth after sneaking into Q3 in 10th. Kimi Raikkonen, who will replace the Brazilian at Ferrari next year, shrugged off his pay dispute with Lotus by claiming fifth place in qualifying, while teammate Romain Grosjean -- seeking a fourth consecutive podium finish -- was seventh. However, Raikkonen was later excluded after his car failed a technical test, meaning the Finn will start at the back of the grid and every other driver who qualified below him will be bumped up one place. It was a similar problem with the floor of the vehicle that affected Grosjean in Hungary, but this time fourth-placed Lotus' explanation was not accepted by the race stewards. Alonso remained upbeat about Sunday's race, despite his lowly position. ""The problem that we are facing is that we are not very competitive,"" the 2005-06 world champion said. ""But we weren't competitive in July, we were not competitive in August or in September, but we still have five podiums and three consecutive second places. ""So this masks a little bit the problems we were having. Now we are back to reality but it will not stop us fighting. We will score more than the others, I have no doubt."" Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, a contender to join Lotus, was sixth in qualifying to continue his impressive run while McLaren's Sergio Perez was ninth. Daniel Ricciardo, who will replace his compatriot Webber next season, rounded out the top 10 for Toro Rosso. McLaren's 2009 world champion Jenson Button was 13th.","Mark Webber claims his second pole position this season in Abu Dhabi on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- If you crave fries in San Francisco, Jasper's Corner Tap is a natural choice. But your decisions aren't over yet. Will it be thin, thick, or sweet potato? Do you try the smoked-paprika seasoning or a cheese curd-based poutine, or play it safe with sea salt? There's an entire menu devoted to customizable fries at your fingertips. French fries are one of the true crowd-pleasers -- a food that friends agree upon, that turns up at both five-star steakhouses and roadside dives, and that is familiar but can also surprise you. They can be cut thick or curly, cooked with or without skins, served Belgian-style in paper cones or in a parchment-lined basket with malt vinegar on the side. No matter how you slice it, the deep-fried spud is king. Eat Like a Local: Share your favorite local eats -- we want pictures! So, how do you know a good one? ""The best fries are made from fresh-cut potatoes and double-fried, which adds crispness,"" says Glenn Walker, who has been posting reviews at frenchfrydiary.blogspot.com since 2004. ""I've also noticed that more and more restaurants are enhancing the flavor of their fries by frying them in duck fat, seasoning them with truffle oil, and serving them with numerous dipping sauces,"" he says. As for the fry's humble beginnings, some say that, in the U.S., Thomas Jefferson was an early adopter. He was known to entertain guests with ""potatoes served in the French manner,"" according to essayist Charles Ebeling, a member of the Chicago Literary Club. Drive-in restaurants and fast-food joints that began popping up in the 1940s popularized fries by pairing them with burgers. And it's become almost impossible to think of one without the other. Here are some of the best fry variations in the U.S.: . The Breslin Bar & Dining Room, New York City . It's no secret that French fries served crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, are the golden standard. But this Manhattan hipster favorite goes a step beyond others to assure the crunchiness of its spuds: introducing The Breslin's thrice-cooked chips. These long, medium-thick slices of Idaho russet potatoes are first boiled, then fried twice in a sunflower and canola oil blend before receiving a dash of salt, and presented either as a stand-alone dish or alongside a feta-topped, chargrilled lamb burger. Only thing left to request: a side of cumin mayo for dipping. Travel + Leisure: More amazing fries across the U.S. Boise Fry Company, Idaho . With a slogan that reads ""burgers on the side,"" you know this is a place serious about its spuds. The potato reigns supreme in this state, and between the vast selection of sauces, seasonings, and spritzers, it's possible to never try the same thing twice. The ordering goes like this: walk in, choose from six varieties of potato including purple, yam, and sweet, then decide how you'd like it cut. Next up, the dressing. Perhaps you'd like your curly Yukon gold fries topped with malt vinegar and served with a side of blueberry ketchup (that's right: blueberry), or you might be craving a russet fry with rosemary garlic salt and Thai sour cream. Or why choose at all? Enlist some friends, and sample away. The Original Hot Dog Shop, Pittsburgh, PA . At this family-run stalwart, the mountain of fries that comes in even a small order borders on the ridiculous -- so no wonder the college kids keep coming back. Located on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh, ""The Dirty O"" has a reputation for decadent spuds: hand-cut and peeled Idaho potatoes, twice fried in peanut oil, and served golden and crunchy on a cafeteria tray.

Duckfat, Portland, ME . When it comes to delivering the perfect fry, it's all in the name at this Portland sandwich shop. The locally sourced potatoes are twice fried in a healthy coating of duck fat that results in a crunchy exterior but leaves each fry's interior fresh and tender. They're then served in paper cones with a handful of specially made dips like smoked mussel mayo and chopped egg and caper mayo. Being close to Canada, Duckfat also offers its own version of poutine, topping those same crispy fries with a heaping of local cheese curd and house-made duck gravy. Jasper's Corner Tap, San Francisco . Since its 2011 debut, Jasper's has won a following for its bar offerings, including a menu devoted exclusively to fries. Seriously. You get to choose your fry (thin, thick, or sweet potato), your seasoning -- options include smoked paprika and truffle, Parmesan, and herb -- and, for an extra $3, add a cheese curd-based poutine. Word on the street is that the smoked cheese fondue is ""to die for."" Jasper's also obliges with a late-night menu ideal for entertaining the Tenderloin neighborhood's after-hours crowd. The highlight? A helping of thick-cut fries, naturally, topped with buffalo mozzarella curds and hot brown gravy. Travel + Leisure: World's top fast food restaurants . Pike Street Fish Fry, Seattle . Late-night crowds line up at the counter of this tiny Capitol Hill neighborhood eatery for some of Seattle's best fish and chips; after all, the fries alone are worthy of the wait. They're hand-sliced, fried to perfection, and served in paper cups with dipping sauce (the tangy chili mayo is a perennial favorite). And while it's hard to beat a helping of these crispy gems after an evening out boozing, Pike Street Fish Fry outdoes itself every third Friday from 5 to 7 p.m. by serving its fries for free. The Green Room, Greenville, SC . This go-to source for upscale comfort food also has a reputation for creativity (ever heard of a Philly Cheesesteak soup?), and its fries are no exception. Chef Patrick Long specializes in Parmesan truffle fries, shoestring cut and tossed in truffle oil immediately after he takes them out from the fryer. He then tops them with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley. Pair them with a plate of BBQ pork biscuit sliders, and you've got yourself a satisfying southern meal. Travel + Leisure: World's top night markets . Bourbon Steak, Miami . Celebrity chef Michael Mina's dinner-only restaurant offers up generous cuts of beef that are both organic and hormone-free -- and its fries get the same attention to quality and detail. Mid-thick cuts of potato get dunked in duck fat to provide both their rich flavor and crispness, and an order covers three seasoning and sauce combos: rosemary herb accompanied by a side of spicy ketchup; onion-dusted with sour cream sauce; and smoked paprika with smoked barbecue sauce. Jonesy's EatBar, Denver . The fries at this Uptown neighborhood gastropub are consistently voted Denver's best: they're thick-cut, extra crispy, and simply put, phenomenal. They also come in four ""World Famous"" and original varieties, including Buffalo (doused in wing sauce and blue cheese crumbles with a side of dressing), and a Bacon Mac & Cheese that regular costumers swear by. Factor in a dash of nostalgia from the setting within a restored 1950s soda fountain. Thrasher's, Ocean City, MD . It may have something to do with the salty air, but there's a certain je ne sais quoi in a boardwalk fry that just can't be found elsewhere -- and Thrasher's has been preserving and protecting that quality for the last 80-plus years. No wonder there's always a wait. It's hard to beat a bucket of hand-cut spuds that have been fried in peanut oil with skins on, especially when served with nothing more than a little salt and vinegar. Purists believe there's no messing around with the fry's intense potato flavor, so if you really want ketchup you'll have to bring it yourself. And while you're at it, invite a few friends to share: Thrasher's smallest fry order is a 16-ounce bucket, and its largest is a whopping 53.thrashersfrenchfries.com .

"(CNN) -- The United States might be in a tricky economic situation, but it won't stop Americans from buying vampire fangs or princess tiaras. - U.S. consumers spent more than $2.5 billion on costumes this year, according to the National Retailers Federation. - The average household has shelled out $21.05 in Halloween candy alone. - When the economy is down, Halloween spending soars, according to Ellen Davis of the National Retail Federation. ""People love, in an economy like this one, to just get out, let loose, have a little bit of fun,"" Davis said. And if the ghosts and goblins aren't scary enough, the health effects from all that candy might be. - The average child collects an estimated 3,500 and 7,000 calories on Halloween night, according to Dr. Donna Arnett, chair of the Department of Epidemiology in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's School of Public Health. The estimate was based on nutrition facts of popular Halloween candies. - A 100-pound child who eats 7,000 calories worth of candy would have to walk for almost 44 hours or play full-court basketball for 14.5 hours to burn those calories, according to Arnett. But Halloween's not just about costumes and candy, of course. It's also about giant orange fruits with scary faces. - Marc Evan and Chris Soria are professional artists for most of the year -- until September, when they become the Maniac Pumpkin Carvers.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- They are the tales of two very different people. Director Danny Boyle's film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" shines a stark light on poverty in India. One an amoral businessman pouring out his life story to the Chinese Premier, the other a lovelorn teenager appearing on ""Kaun Banega Crorepati,"" the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" But if their protagonists are polar opposites, both stories -- one as told in Aravind Adiga's best-selling novel ""The White Tiger,"" the other in ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" the new movie from ""Trainspotting"" director Danny Boyle -- have much in common. Both are based in modern day India, both feature characters who succeed against all the odds, and both have garnered considerable critical acclaim, with ""Slumdog Millionaire"" recently awarded the three top prizes at the British Independent Film Awards. ""Slumdog,"" which is set in Mumbai, has also assumed a particularly poignant resonance in light of the recent terror attacks that left 174 people dead. Above all, both narratives shine a stark light on poverty -- an aspect of Indian society that has increasingly been pushed into the background by a decade and more of upbeat headlines about the country's dramatic economic growth. ""The growth aspect has tended to receive much more attention than the darker side of the Indian story,"" Professor Babu Mathew, Country Director of Action Aid India, told CNN, ""More and more the poverty goes unnoticed, and there is less and less of a voice for the excluded peoples."" The breadth of the divide between what Aravind Adiga calls the ""India of Light,"" and the ""India of Darkness,"" is both dramatic and shocking. Since 1991 when ""neo-liberal"" market reforms were introduced, India's economy has ballooned. From 1991 to 2004, the world's largest democracy grew at 6.5 percent annually, a figure which increased to over 9 percent between 2005 and 2007. The result has been a massive explosion of wealth creation among the middle and upper echelons of Indian society, with Indian billionaires now occupying four of the top eight slots on the annual Forbes rich list. While growth has benefited one section of society, it has left a vast swathe of the population lagging far behind. ""People in urban areas, the rich, the middle classes, the educated -- all of these have benefited from economic growth,"" Dr Arun Kumar of Development Alternatives Group, a sustainable development organization based in Delhi, told CNN, ""Those who have not benefited are the small farmers, the rural poor, the artisans -- for these their situation has worsened."" Nisha Agrawal, CEO of Oxfam India, agrees. ""Economic growth has been primarily focused on manufacturing and services and largely in urban areas,"" she told CNN, ""Rural agriculture has not received the kind of attention it deserves. And since the bulk of poor people derive their incomes from agriculture, that has left us with two Indias, one rich, one impoverished."" Even a cursory glance at the statistics reveals a problem on a huge scale. According to World Bank estimates, 456 million people -- just over 40 percent of India's population of 1.2 billion -- now live on less than $1.25 per day, a sum recognized as the international poverty line. Almost half of India's children are malnourished; 1000 die every day from diarrhea; hundreds of millions have no access to proper sanitation. These figures provide a grim counterpoint to the glitzy high-rises and designer shopping malls that have sprung up throughout the country's major cities. How to narrow this gulf between the haves and the have-nots is a fiendishly complex issue and one that has no quick or easy solutions. More investment in basic infrastructure is seen as crucial, as is a reform of international trade agreements. ""Import and energy prices have increased for farmers, but global markets are not opening up for Indian agricultural products,"" Agrawal told CNN, ""That needs to change."" Greater access to institutional finance, the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities, and the spread of information technology all have a major role to play. ""We already have small pockets of improvement,"" says Arun Kumar, ""But these involve limited numbers in limited geographies. ""We need to scale everything up. It is a huge challenge."" The global economic problems have not bypassed India. Inflation is now running close to 12 percent and the Mumbai Stock Exchange has almost halved in value from a peak in January 2008. Sensex -- the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index -- has not registered any significant drop as a result of the recent Mumbai attacks, and it remains to be seen what the longer term effect will be on the Indian economy. Nonetheless, these difficult and uncertain times may make the challenge of poverty reduction an even harder one. Will India be able to successfully reduce the gap between rich and poor? Leave your comments in the SoundOff box below . Both Kumar and Agrawal remain hopeful that change is coming to India, albeit slowly. ""We are eternal optimists,"" says Kumar, ""I do believe things are changing."" ""The government recognizes that people don't just want a high level of growth,"" adds Agrawal, ""But also growth that is more equalizing. We need to bring the two Indias together, and I believe we can do it."" Despite their optimism, the problems remain vast, and the darkness intense. For the foreseeable future it seems likely the question most on the minds of India's 456 million poor will be less ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"" than ""Will I be able to feed myself and my family today?""","Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" shines a light on slum-dwellers in India .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Walt Disney Studios has reached a distribution deal with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios, the companies announced Monday. Disney will market at least six DreamWorks live-action movies each year produced through DreamWorks' agreement with India's Reliance BIG Entertainment, a major producer of Bollywood film, they said. The Disney deal replaces an agreement DreamWorks announced last year with Universal that fell apart in recent weeks. The announcement did not reveal terms, but industry media reports said the Universal deal collapsed when DreamWorks asked for cash to help finance the movies to be made under the Reliance contract. DreamWorks found itself short of financing because of the global economic crunch, according to Michael Cerenzie, a film financier and producer. The studio could not borrow the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to produce films, partly because much of its archives and intellectual property -- which would have served as collateral for loans -- was left behind at Paramount Studios, whose parent company bought DreamWorks in 2006. Paramount still distributes DreamWorks' animation features. Reliance will handle distribution of the movies in India. The first movie to be distributed under the deal is expected to reach theaters next year, the companies said. ""Disney is the birthplace of imagination and has always been as close to the worldwide audience as any company ever has,"" Spielberg said. Ironically, DreamWorks was born in 1994 after Disney excutive Jeffrey Katzenberg was passed over for promotion to president of Disney. Katzenberg resigned and then formed DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. The DreamWorks-Reliance-Disney agreement is a major step in bringing India's huge ""Bollywood"" industry together to Hollywood studios. BIG Pictures has development arrangements with several production companies, including those affiliated with performers Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, George Clooney and Tom Hanks.","Disney will distribute DreamWorks live-action films .

"London (CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's daughter was briefly held at gunpoint in central London this week, police and Blair's office said Thursday. Police described the Monday incident as an attempted robbery. Another attempted robbery was reported to police about 30 minutes earlier, also in the Marylebone area of the capital. In both instances, a firearm was seen, but no shots were fired and nothing was taken, Scotland Yard said. Blair's office said his daughter is fine. ""Kathryn was with a group of friends,"" said Rachel Grant, a Blair spokeswoman. ""No one was hurt and nothing was stolen."" Police believe the two incidents are related, and are asking witnesses to come forward. The first robbery attempt was committed by one man wearing dark clothing and a balaclava -- a ski mask covering most of the face -- and the second involved two men, with one described the same way as the man in the first incident, police said.","The attempted robbery took place in central London .

"(CNN) -- I grew up in Florida in wartime -- where the bombs were 7,691 miles away. My childhood was an Afghan-American suburban dream punctuated by weekend sleepovers, Saturday soccer games, fistfights with racist children of the Confederate South and religio-nationalist-driven demonstrations chanting ""Down with Brezhnev!""; ""Long live Islam!""; ""Down with Communism!""; and ""Long Live Afghanistan!"" before I even knew what that meant. It is what I was fed growing up, in between Southern-fried chicken and garlic mashed potatoes, cumin-scented meat and basmati rice. That's why I've referred to myself as ""Afghan by blood, redneck by the grace of God."" Watch Aman Mojadidi's TED Talk . Now as an artist in a world that is simultaneously in the process of globalizing and fracturing, the work I do explores what I have come to call the ""geography of self,"" a concept that revolves around a positioning of oneself in the world -- not just physically, but emotionally, mentally and, perhaps even for those who believe, spiritually. This position is ambiguous, temporary and very often debated. It is constructed by multiple voices and rendered through a prism of different, sometimes even contradictory, perspectives. The body of work I create combines traditional storylines and postmodern narrative strategies to approach themes such as belonging, identity politics and conflict, as well as the push towards -- and resistance against -- modernization. My work travels through mental and physical landscapes. It intentionally blurs and merges the lines between them, as well as those between fact and fiction, documentation and imagination. I looked into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called ""Payback"" and impersonated a police officer, set up a fake checkpoint on the street in Kabul and stopped cars, but instead of asking them for a bribe, offered them money and apologized on behalf of the Kabul Police Department. I spent a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like pop-star bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich. And where else can the jihadi gangster go, but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan: ""Vote for me! I've done jihad, and I'm rich."" TED.com: What I saw in the war . What I engage in through my art is, in fact, storytelling. But through these stories, there is a clear attempt to disrupt and reinterpret historical narratives, both real and imagined, in order to create an entirely new narrative that challenges the dominating histories' stories that shape our experience and understanding of the world we live in. It's not about activism, but about being engaged with our world and humanity in a way that goes beyond the superficial, instead looking deeper into historical constructions of our present state and the basic principles of human responsibility. Art has often been and continues to be considered transcendent. I see this as misguided and, in fact, a way of subverting the powerful voice art can be in global discussions about politics, economics, society, culture, religion and international relations. TED.com: My photographs bear witness . This is not to say that I think my art provides answers. In fact, it may simply produce more questions. But in asking those questions, history and our role in how it constructs the present can be better understood. By using historical facts, documentation, oral history and imagination, I create forms of resistance against the imposition of certain historical interpretations upon us. It provides a way for us to rethink history, disturb identity, challenge authority, dissect politics, shake up society and understand ourselves. In the end, I hope we learn to question what we know of the past, what we understand of the present and what we can imagine for the future. Perhaps this is too ambitious a project; perhaps art should simply be aesthetically appealing and keep itself out of the realm of politics, history and self-awareness. Perhaps this is too arrogant a philosophy, to think that what I have to say about the world and our role in it has any bearing at all on how others should think about their environment and themselves. TED.com: Dreams from endangered cultures . Perhaps this is too futile a goal and art is not enough of an action to be an actual catalyst for change. But this is the burden of creating this kind of work, a burden that perhaps comes from the dualistic life I have lived as an American citizen growing up in the comfort of suburbia while family members in Afghanistan fought, died and, yes, killed in their battle against an invading army. Knowing these opposing experiences could be simultaneously shared within the collective subconscious of my family drove me towards trying to better understand history, politics, perspectives and the human condition. This IS my burden and so I must ask: ""What's yours?"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aman Mojadidi.","Aman Mojadidi, an American of Afghan descent, is an artist who has worked in Kabul .

"(CNN) -- In 1965, a 40-year-old William F. Buckley, Jr. ran for mayor of New York City -- a race he arguably never intended to win. In fact, when asked what he'd do if he won he replied, ""Demand a recount."" But 10 years after founding the National Review and one year after establishing Barry Goldwater as the conservative nominee for president, Buckley saw that the often-times colorful mayoral election was a useful vehicle for him to elevate his brand and promote conservatism on a national platform. Though he won only 13.4% of the vote, he still managed to accomplish his objective. And, many credit him with helping Rep. John V. Lindsay become the first Republican mayor of New York since Fiorello H. LaGuardia. Some suggested early on that Anthony Weiner's bid for mayor was similarly designed -- not to actually win, but toward other ends. Elspeth Reeve in The Atlantic earlier this year suggested this was all an inoculation attempt. Not for Weiner, but for his wife Huma Abedin, who either had designs on her own political career or at least on helping to implement her boss Hillary Clinton's 2016 run. ""If Abedin, and not Weiner, were the first one to hit the campaign trail after his resignation,"" she wrote, ""she would have been the one who was tarnished by his sexts. Or, imagine Clinton trying to focus on eating fried things at the Iowa state fair in 2015, while reporters ask her about new photos on Breitbart.com of her aide's infamous husband."" It's an intriguing idea, but very few could argue that Abedin emerged out of her husband's campaign untarnished. It wasn't just hosting awkward ""Women for Weiner"" events that call into question everything we think we know about feminism. Or advancing arguably false narratives in glossy magazines that her husband's exploits were dealt with and over, when it was clear Weiner continued his online activities well after resigning from Congress. Putting his indiscretions aside, it's hard to reconcile such a smart and successful woman finding admiration in a man who ran such a terrible, pugnacious, ineffective and utterly ridiculous campaign. The man who yelled at his own constituents, called his 69-year-old opponent ""grandpa"" at an AARP event, and poetically flipped off reporters on his final ride out of town is her political and personal inspiration? If helping Huma was the plan all along, I think it's safe to say it has not worked. Others have suggested he might just want his own television show. Fair enough. Plenty of disgraced former politicians have found a forgiving sanctuary on cable television. And he certainly would make for a fascinating, er, something ... on TV. But he didn't need to mount an embarrassing and ultimately ruinous mayoral campaign to get there. One turn of the dial and it's clear that there are countless sociopaths, buffoons, hucksters and charlatans with real political platforms who were never on a ballot. Other than ""Dancing with the Stars"" or ""Celebrity Rehab,"" I doubt Weiner solidified his chances of a major television gig with this last performance. Others still believe Weiner was merely out for revenge. Revenge against the Breitbarts and Drudges and even establishment Democrats who ruined his life, a final ""take that"" to punctuate the scandal. And he didn't need to win to do it. A respectable finish in the primary would have telegraphed that he was run out by gotcha journalists, partisan extremists and spineless bureaucrats, and his real friends -- the voters -- still believed in him. I'm not sure he can make that case, though, after finishing virtually dead last and capturing a paltry 5% of the ultra-liberal Democrats who actually turned out for this thing. Ultimately, unlike Buckley and conservatism, Weiner did nothing good for liberalism. He wanted a campaign of ideas, but instead waged a campaign of idiotic outbursts. He brought nothing but more embarrassment and shame for his wife and her famous boss. And he did nothing to make ""Anthony Weiner the Brand"" any more credible. In fact the only constituency he managed to please were New York Post headline writers. Maybe he really did want to win. And maybe he really thought he could. Where there's power to be had, pathological miscalculations of this sort aren't uncommon. But if he cares about his party, his wife, her career, his brand, and his own future, he will make the courageous decision to go away from politics for a very long time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E. Cupp.","S.E. Cupp: Some speculated that winning wasn't Anthony Weiner's goal .

"(CNN) -- Amid a falling currency, slumping factory output, lackluster investment and weak orders, India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh looked desperately for at least some chinks of light in the economic gloom. Addressing parliament, Singh struck out for the one silver lining left to his battered economy -- the falling rupee will boost exports. ""To some extent, depreciation can be good for the economy as this will help to increase our export competitiveness and discourage imports,"" Singh said last week in a long address to lawmakers on the crisis in the Indian economy. ""Over the next few months, I expect the effects of this to be felt more strongly, both in exports and in the financial position of exporting sectors. This in itself would correct the current account deficit to some extent."" Whether investors will share his confidence is the question economists are asking themselves as the axles come loose on India's economic juggernaut. Slowing growth . The Purchasing Managers Index grew just 4.4% in April-June, it's slowest pace for four and a half years . ""The August reading was grim,"" HSBC chief economist for India Leif Eskesen said in a note. ""Coupled with the July reading it seems clear that the economy is continuing to slow and that last week's April- June GDP number was not the bottom."" He said the recovery in growth would prove to be a drawn-out affair and would be tainted by the lingering balance of payment challenges. ""Politics may get in the way of meaningful progress on structural reform,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we think the slowdown has further to go, which presents greater challenges for policymakers as they try to stabilize the currency."" The threat of a U.S. strike on Syria has put pressure on oil prices and on gold -- two of India's biggest dollar-indexed imports -- in the short-term, but analysts say that India's currency woes can only be stabilized by addressing long-term fundamentals. India, they say, could follow three scenarios, none very attractive. Let the rupee fall . It could allow the currency to fall further, boosting exports and helping close the current-account deficit, as Singh's speech suggested. Nevertheless, with a small manufacturing base mired in red tape, analysts say it does not have the critical mass to respond quickly. With balance of payments taking time to turn around, investors would likely panic in the meantime further depressing business. A weaker currency would also likely stoke inflation, increase the government subsidies on fuel and also its borrowing. Boost interest rates . Indonesia and Brazil last month took measures to protect their currencies by tweaking interest rates -- a response in large measure to improving prospects for the U.S. economy where the Federal Reserve looks likely to begin winding in the purchase of bonds. If India followed suit, Indian industry -- already in bad shape -- would suffer and increase the possibility of bad loans at banks too. Corporate earnings decline would slam equity investors who currently have about $200 billion invested in listed shares. A credit crunch, say analysts, would make things worse. Borrow less money . Government borrowing is running at about 7% of GDP, according government figures, fueling excess demand and widening the current account deficit. With its appetite for lavish and populist government programs, spending cuts are difficult. It's latest ambitious food program -- the $25 billion annually food security bill -- is likely to impact the economy heavily. But economists are saying that once all the provisions of the bill are priced in, it will cost much more. Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan told CNN the cost could easily go up a further half a percentage point of GDP. ""If you look at an incremental cost of 0.5%, the total cost would then be 1.5% of GDP which is large by any standard,"" he said. Raise taxes . Like Pakistan, India may have to look at raising tax revenues. With just 3% of Indian paying income tax, analysts say that tax increases would have to fall on the formal economy which is already taking a big hit in the current economic climate. Rahul Chadha, co-chief investment officer at Mirae Asset Global Investments, told CNN the rupee's immediate fate, however, lies in the hands of the central bank . ""I think this is the dilemma of the central bank,"" he said. ""We've seen this half-hearted attempt to stabilize the currency -- they came at it from different levels. But because it was half-hearted and the currency depreciated after that we have seen panic reaction from corporates and institutional investors. ""Clearly at a certain level the market has to get convinced that the central bank has enough power fire power to stabilize the currency. Once the market gets that kind of conviction, you will see the rupee again appreciating by 7% to 8% very quickly.""","India looks for the upside to the rupee crisis - that it will boost exports .
Analysts say its industrial base is too small and too bound up in red tape to respond quickly .
India still relies heavily on populist, capital-intensive government programs .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military handed over to Iraq the Camp Cropper detention facility Thursday, calling the moment a milestone in Iraq's history and another step in the drawdown of U.S. forces there. Established in 2003 as a holding facility for security detainees near Baghdad International Airport, the prison had the capacity to hold up to 4,000 detainees. With this handover, the U.S. military's oversight on detainee operations significantly diminishes, a cause of concern for Iraqis who largely don't trust their justice system. The United States will continue to have advisers and special teams inspect facilities if there are reports of torture and abuse. Military commanders said that the Iraqis were trained to international standards. ""We will also continue to be involved with advisers and in accordance with the security agreement we have every expectation that we will be able to continue to do checks and balances that are presented to us when there is a problem situation,"" said Maj. Gen. Jerry Cannon, deputy commanding general for detainee operations. U.S. detainee operations have been undermined by the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and reports of abuse and secret detainment facilities. In the Abu Ghraib case, U.S. soldiers were photographed physically and sexually abusing Iraqi prisoners. Eleven U.S. soldiers were convicted of crimes in the case. ""To be perfectly frank here, we have learned from our experiences here in terms of detainee operations,"" said Maj. Gen. Steve Lanza, spokesman for U.S. forces in Iraq. ""Some of our inability to be prepared for what we encountered has significantly changed the way we approached detainee operations here in Iraq. ""What we have learned from executing counter-insurgency operations, the way we have changed our training, the way we have changed our approach to leadership is certainly significant in terms of how we have moved forward here in the last few years with detainee operations,"" said Lanza. He said that the lessons learned have allowed their Iraqi counterparts who are taking over the role to move forward with the rule of law. Iraqi Justice Minister Dara Nur al-Deen said that the era of prison abuse is over and asked that Iraqis respect each other and adhere to a proper code of conduct. At present, there are about 1,500 detainees at Camp Cropper. The U.S. military will continue to maintain physical custody of some 200 detainees in a section of Camp Cropper known as Compound 5 at the request of the Iraqi government. They include former regime elements, senior al Qaeda members, and other detainees classified as being ""very dangerous."" There have been people transferred to other facilities. Tariq Aziz, who at one time served as former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's top diplomat, was handed over on Monday from Camp Cropper and is being held at Kadhimiya prison in Baghdad, Boshu Ibrahim, deputy justice minister, told CNN on Wednesday.","The handover is a milestone in U.S.-Iraqi relations .

"(CNN) -- Zach Johnson took a step nearer the $10 million end of season prize after claiming victory at the rain-delayed BMW Championship in Chicago Monday. The 2007 Masters champion, finished the final day with a six-under 65 to secure a two-shot victory over Nick Watney and leave him needing victory at Thursday's Tour Championship to secure the riches of the FedEx Cup. Johnson, 37, pocketed a cool $1.44 million prize after clinching the 10th title of his career, his first since last year's John Deere Classic. Difficult . ""It's extremely difficult,"" Johnson told reporters after being asked about the challenges of the Tour. ""The parity on the tour and in the world is second to none. I'm just thankful it has been 10 years and hopefully many more."" While there was joy for Johnson, there was yet more frustration for overnight leader Jim Fuyk. Furyk's three-year wait for a title goes on following a final round of 71 which left him in third. After losing out to Jason Dufner at last month's PGA Championship, Furyk missed out on a 16th career title. History . The American had made history Friday by becoming just the sixth man on the PGA Tour to card a 59, but he failed to shine as Johnson and Watney accelerated. While Furyk endured a dismal final day, Watney holed eight birdies to earn a second place finish and move up from 34th to 12th in the FedEx Cup standings. ""I knew I needed to have a good week,"" he told reporters. ""The guys ahead of me were ahead of me for a reason. They've been playing well all year. Luckily for me I kind of pulled everything together."" Woods . Tiger Woods finished with a round of 71 to leave him on nine under for the tournament, while Luke Donald booked his place at the Tour Championship with a 66 to qualify 29th out of 30.

"New York (CNN) -- A forensics team at the Maine State Police lab is analyzing items found in Waterville that could be connected to the case of Maine toddler Ayla Reynolds, who disappeared from her home in December, according to a spokesman for the Maine State Police. ""They were found yesterday (Wednesday) by a worker behind the old Hathaway complex,"" Maine State Police spokesman Stephen McCausland told CNN. The building is now an office complex that formerly housed a Hathaway clothing factory. He refused to describe the items or say how many were recovered. The worker called police to report the items and have them collected on Wednesday morning after making the discovery. ""We have no false expectations out there,"" McCausland said when asked whether the items are linked to Ayla Reynolds. ""We don't know if the items are connected, or what this is,"" he added. McCausland says a worker found the items in a sluiceway, a channel that handles runoff from the Kennebec River that separates Waterville, where the little girl lived, from Winslow to the east. There's a dam nearby the scene. Police divers searched that part of the river before, McCausland said. ""We dived it twice, if not in that specific spot,"" he added. Divers scour frigid waters for missing Maine toddler . He says the discovery is among ""hundreds of other items"" recovered that are also being processed by the state police crime lab in Augusta, Maine. Ayla was 20 months old when she went missing from her grandmother's Waterville home while in the care of her father. Ayla's father, Justin DiPietro, told police he put his daughter to bed at 8 p.m. December 16 in the first-floor bedroom. He called police the next morning, just before 9 a.m. to report her missing. No arrests have been made related to Ayla's disappearance, and no one has been identified as a suspect.","Forensics team in Maine analyzing items found behind office complex in Waterville .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A court in eastern China said it will deliver the much anticipated verdict in the corruption trial of fallen high-flying politician Bo Xilai on Sunday. The Jinan Intermediate People's Court in the province of Shandong said Wednesday on its official microblog account that the verdict would be pronounced at 10 a.m. local time on Sunday. During the hearings of the politically sensitive trial that took place last month, Bo strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the court. The closely watched trial was considered to be much more transparent than most cases in China. But international and independent journalists weren't allowed inside the courtroom, and doubts were raised about the fullness of the court's version of events. Bo, 64, is charged with bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. High conviction rate . His trial brought to light a wealth of eye-opening details about the apparently lavish and emotionally fraught life of his family and inner circle, giving Chinese people insights into how some of the ruling elite live. Bo's glittering career, during which he drew both admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery. Based on the track record of Chinese courts, Bo appears likely to be convicted. The conviction rate at criminal trials and their appeals in China -- where the ruling Communist Party controls police, prosecution and courts -- stood at 99.9% in 2010, a U.S. State Department report cited the Supreme People's Court as saying. If he is found guilty, he will also probably find out his punishment. Chinese courts usually announce sentencing straight after guilty verdicts. Prosecutors have asked for a heavy sentence for the former senior official. Dramatic downfall . The son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policymaking body of the Communist Party. He had been tipped to ascend farther up the party hierarchy. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing, a metropolis in southwestern China. But when his deputy, Wang Lijun, walked into the U.S. Consulate in the city of Chengdu in February of last year and told American diplomats that Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was an accomplice in a murder case, Bo's career began to unravel. Wang's move precipitated Bo's political demise. Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts. A court found Gu guilty last year of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in 2011. A family employee, Zhang Xiaojun, was also convicted in the killing and sentenced to nine years in prison. The following month, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Wang and Gu both appeared as witnesses at Bo's trial last month. Bo attacked their testimony and even claimed that Wang and Gu had been romantically involved. CNN'sSteven Jiang reported from Beijing and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","The verdict will be announced Sunday morning, the court says .

"(CNN) -- Sandy churned up a tragic deluge for millions of East Coast residents, but in mountainous West Virginia, the hurricane morphed into an unforgettable killer snow storm. The state sits hundreds of miles southwest of where the brunt of Sandy hit. Nonetheless, it shut off electricity to more than 200,000 customers, officials said, and claimed the lives of at least five people. ""When they describe it in terms of it being a once-in-a-lifetime storm it sounds cliche, but it is exactly that,"" said CNN iReporter Allison Vencel from her home in Morgantown. She should know. She used to live in Alaska. It was very much like an Alaskan blizzard, Vencel said, describing it as ""absolutely the most unique storm situation I have ever seen. Just a monster."" Because it slammed into the region at night, Vencel said the storm was largely invisible. ""You couldn't see it, as much as you could feel and hear the swaying of the trees,"" she said, remembering the howling wind and glimpses of snow flying sideways. Related: Read Vencel's iReport . When it was all over, Morgantown and much of the rest of the state found itself buried in heavy snow and fallen trees. Officials said 28 of the state's 55 counties were hit by snowfall. ""It was a triple punch to West Virginia,"" Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin told CNN. ""Lots of heavy rain that turned into blizzard conditions, and high winds."" On Wednesday, conditions remained dangerous. Officials offered examples of the randomness of Sandy's wrath across the state. One 60-year-old man was killed by a falling tree. Elswhere, a 65-year-old man died from a heart attack while shoveling snow. In a third instance, a woman lost her life in a weather-related traffic accident. As Sandy weakened, residents and utility workers focused on the widespread power outages. Roads were being cleared to allow electric companies to repair damaged power lines. One company alone, Tomblin said, had lost 50. CNN iReporter Richard Kuhn, 61, was hunkered down in Elkins, where ""snow is very heavy on tree limbs and wires."" Breaking branches and falling trees are not uncommon, he reported via a small electric generator and a DSL Internet connection. ""Almost everything is closed,"" including gas stations, reported Kuhn. Some stores, he said, were selling goods cash only. Related: Read Kuhn's iReport . ""Restoring power is the the thing we are working hardest on,"" said the governor. West Virginia is no stranger to storms -- just three months ago, a storm knocked out power in all but two counties. What made Sandy worse was the combination of no power and freezing temperatures. ""The problem is the wet snow,"" said Greg Philips, a state highway manager in charge of snow plows. ""It's really hard to get [it] off the road and it's really heavy."" The snow gets so bad, he told CNN affiliate WDTV, that after clearing one section of highway, ""you look behind you and it's covered again. It's a non-ending project to get the roads opened up."" In some areas, the heavy snow threatened building roofs. In one of the state's hardest hit areas, Nicholas County, Sandy dumped three to five inches of snow, triggering roofs on seven buildings to collapse, reported CNN affiliate WCHS. Amazingly, no injuries were reported. In nearby Randolph County, resident Carolyn Houk told WDTV she called authorities when she feared her snowy roof would collapse. ""I don't like asking for help,"" Houk said. ""But my goodness, if I don't get something done -- I'm going to wind up getting hurt.""","Five deaths have been confirmed in West Virginia .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray thrilled his home crowd in July when he became the first British man in 77 years to win the Wimbledon singles title. But Murray will most likely miss the second highest profile tennis event in Britain -- the year-end championships in November -- after choosing to undergo surgery for a lingering back injury. The 26-year-old Scot has had back issues in spurts throughout his career and was forced to pull out of the French Open in May prior to his historic fortnight at the All England Club. His withdrawal in Paris marked the first time since the 2007 clay-court tournament in France that Murray had skipped one of tennis' four majors. That year, he hurt his wrist. Murray exited earlier than expected at two U.S. Open warm-up tournaments and was then upset by Stanislas Wawrinka in straight sets in the quarterfinals in New York this month as the defending champion. ""Next week, Andy is set to undergo minor back surgery in an effort to clear up a longstanding back problem,"" Murray's management team said in a statement sent to CNN. ""The issue flared up again during the Rome Masters this year when Andy was forced to retire and he sought advice from a range of specialists in May. ""After a successful return on the more forgiving grass courts, Andy enjoyed success at Queen's and Wimbledon, but after recently playing on hard courts and clay, Andy once again sought medical advice about solving the issue once and for all. ""The aim is to be fully fit for the new season."" Murray thus becomes the second member of the so-called 'Big Four' to miss a chunk of the 2013 schedule -- Rafael Nadal didn't play at the Australian Open in January as he continued to recover from his knee troubles. And 17-time grand slam winner Roger Federer has dealt with his own back problems, not playing at the Rogers Cup in Montreal during the U.S. Open Series. Murray can take heart from Nadal's performances after the Spaniard returned to the tour. Nadal claimed the French Open and captured his 13th major at the U.S. Open by downing Novak Djokovic.","Andy Murray will undergo minor back surgery and most likely miss the rest of 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Startup. The term, near ubiquitous in our app-consuming, fully Facebooked world, is one that didn't truly enter the lexicon until the 1990s, when Wall Street took a bow to Silicon Valley and the palate of professional possibility became wired and well-connected. Much has changed since then. Gone are the days when any 20-something with a computer science degree could dream of a bidding war for their talents, followed by a six-figure salary and free lattes in offices where chair massages and nap rooms are the norm. No longer do investors throw millions at anything with dotcom at the end of its name, and many of those early pioneers -- who gambled that we were ready to buy pet supplies or order our groceries from an awkward adolescent called the internet -- are no more. But the spirit lives on, in dorm rooms and garages, shared offices and coffee shops with WiFi. It's a fragmented, competitive and constantly changing world. But in 2013, the state of the startup is strong. Today, CNN Tech highlights that world with CNN 10: Startups. Our inaugural list looks at 10 emerging companies we think are poised to make a splash in the coming months with new and innovative ideas in fields such as medicine, computing, transportation and video games. Now more than ever, computing and technology move fast, and the best technology startups are the ones that get in on a trend before it blows up. There are a few hot categories on the horizon for consumer technology, including collaborative consumption and the sharing economy, the so-called Internet of Things, crowdsourcing, 3-D printing and the maker movement. Older institutions like education, finance and health care are also undergoing big changes, with online courses, BitCoin and peer-to-peer lending. The biggest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley are busy putting money into promising startups making their mark in these fields. Services that tap into the sharing economy are closest to being mainstream. Ride-sharing service Lyft, home-rental site Airbnb and labor marketplace TaskRabbit, are taking off around the world, catching on one city at a time. These startups are focused on using resources more efficiently -- filling empty car seats, bedrooms and hours of the day in exchange for money. ""Most people on all of the services are both hosts and users, so it's a two-way market, which makes this very exciting,"" said Brian Singerman of the Founders Fund, a San Francisco venture capital firm. ""This is for the masses; it's not just for rich people who want to use a service."" Some of the startup world's cooler emerging gadgets fall under the umbrella of the Internet of Things. Smaller sensors mean that everyday objects will soon be collecting data about your life and habits. This category already has some big successes, like the Nest smart thermostat and wearable fitness devices. The field is still young, but it will grow exponentially as more objects get connected. ""The value of a fax machine is more valuable when another fax machine gets on the network,"" said Navin Chaddha of the Mayfield Fund. ""Massive opportunities are going to be created."" The way we use and interact with our computers is also changing, with devices that use gestures and movement to control what's on a screen, like the MYO wristband and the Leap Motion controller. ""What Leap Motion is trying to do is make the interface between man and machine disappear,"" said Singerman, whose company is an investor in Leap. In 2013, though, a successful startup might be one you'll never hear about. Chris Dixon, of Andreessen Horowitz, says historically 80% of venture capital investments are in enterprise technology -- the companies that build the behind-the-scenes technology like networks and storage. You don't hear about these companies as much because they can be technically complicated, but without them the consumer apps, services and gadgets wouldn't exist. For these companies, a happy ending may be when the Oracles, Googles, Facebooks and Microsofts of the world come calling, offering a big-dollar buyout. But nothing is certain in startups. For every Mark Zuckerberg in a dorm room or pair of Steves (Wozniak and Jobs) in a garage, there are many ventures that, despite good ideas and hard work, never take hold. And it could be a while before even the best products being developed today show up in a Best Buy or the hottest tech trends have any meaningful impact on the lives of the average consumer. ""One of the hardest things in technology,"" said Dixon, ""is predicting when these things are going to happen.""","In 2013, the startup world is competitive, fragmented and fast moving .
Internet-enabled devices, wearable tech are hot trends .
Motion control and other new ways of interacting with computers also emerging .

"(CNN) -- When Siri, the voice ""assistant"" on the iPhone, made its debut in 2011, it was welcomed as futuristic way to interact with our gadgets. You could ask it simple questions, banter and flirt, or launch applications with one push of a button and without slogging through touchscreen menus. Two years later, Apple is giving Siri a major overhaul as part of Wednesday's upgrade to its iOS 7 mobile operating system, and it's marking the occasion by finally dropping Siri's ""beta"" label. (Calling software beta usually means it is still a work in progress and that the company is ironing out any bugs.) What else has changed in the full-fledged, non-beta Siri? The most obvious update is that it has added an option for a male voice. iPhone owners in the UK already had a male Siri voice, but this is the first time it will be available in American English and German, with more languages expected to get their own male versions in the near future. Hands-on impressions of the new iPhones . The voice gender can be swapped on the phone by going to Settings > General > Siri. The female voice has also been improved to sound a little more natural. Though Siri's new male voice is a few octaves lower, the words and answers seem to stay the same. Guy Siri still has the same canned responses to joke questions like ""What are you wearing?"" (""Aluminosilicate glass and aluminum. Nice, huh?"") and the phrasing of its answers to real questions doesn't seem to change between the male and female settings. Visually, Siri has been overhauled so its design on the phone's screen is more in line with iOS 7's flattened look. Instead of a dark gray background sliding up from the bottom, it throws a translucent blurred background over whatever screen is on your phone when you launch Siri. It shows a single wavy line that moves as it registers your voice. Siri has added Twitter and Wikipedia integration, so you can ask to see recent tweets about a hot news story or see the Wikipedia entry for something specific without leaving the Siri interface. You can ask to see what's trending on Twitter, tweets for a specific hashtag, or simply, ""What's going on?"" New iPhone hardware, software a boon for gamers . Siri has also expanded its powers to include control of common iPhone settings, something that was noticeably missing in beta Siri. You can now turn settings like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on and off, change your screen brightness, turn on Do Not Disturb or view a specific app's settings. If you use the new iTunes Radio feature, you can vocally express your enthusiasm or displeasure with specific songs to customize music stations. One of the biggest challenges facing new Siri is some serious competition from Google. Slowly and with less fanfare, Google has been building up its own powerful natural-language voice search in recent years. Although it lacks a catchy anthropomorphic name, Google Voice Search takes on many of the same tasks as Siri. In addition to typical Google search results, it pulls answers from Gmail, Google Calendar and other Google accounts the way Siri does from the e-mail, contacts and calendar apps on the iPhone. Google Voice Search is less chatty, but by cutting out extra words it is sometimes faster to return an answer. It cannot be used to control phone settings or launch applications on an iPhone, but if you are a Google Account user it is a legitimate alternative for tasks like calendaring. The competition between the two companies helps explain the new Siri's most unfortunate change. Siri has dropped Google as its default search engine of choice and switched to Microsoft's Bing. When a question can't be answered by Siri itself or a Wikipedia entry, it will pull up web results from Bing directly in Siri. Unlike in Safari, there's no way to switch the default search engine to Google. Keeping answers in Siri does save time, however. Previously a Siri Web search would launch Google in Safari, requiring you to unlock the phone. But don't dismay, Google fans. You can still ask Siri to ""Google"" something, and it will launch Safari and do a regular Google search. Opinion: Give Apple your fingerprint? It's your call .","Apple is updating its Siri voice assistant feature on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A 6-year-old boy was recovering in hospital in China's Shanxi province on Wednesday after his eyes were gouged out in an attack that has left him permanently blind, according to state media reports. Local police said a female suspect had gouged out the boy's eyes on Saturday evening, but ruled out the possibility that organ traffickers had carried out the attack. Earlier state media reports said the boy, named as Xiao Binbin from Fenxi County in Shanxi Province, was found four hours after he went missing in a drugged state and missing his eyeballs, China Central Television said on its Sina Weibo account. The reports claimed the boy's eyes were found nearby with the corneas missing, which local police have since denied, according to state media. State media pictures on CCTV news Weibo showed pictures of a boy with bandages over his eyes recovering in hospital while his stricken relatives cried at his bedside. China has traditionally relied on executed criminals to harvest transplant organs in a country where few people donate organs. In 2008, just 36 people donated organs out of a population of 1.3 billion people. A government donation program run by the Red Cross Society has had just under 3,000 donations the past three years, according to Xinhua. In 2007, China introduced new regulations that banned organ trading and trafficking, and cracked down on ""transplant tourism"" by non-Chinese nationals. China's Supreme Court also introduced new rules the same year to reduce the number of executions, making the present transplant system unsustainable. China plans to phase out involuntary organ donations of executed prisoner by 2014, state media reported. About 300,000 patients have organ failure each year, but only about 10,000 transplants are done each year due to donor shortages, Xinhua reported. On September 1, national health officials will launch a computerized system to match organs to patients among the 165 hospitals permitted to carry out transplants.","Six-year-old boy blinded after eye-gouging attack .

"(CNN) -- With the presidential race heading into its final stretch, both candidates vow to protect the sacred promises made to military families. But neither is offering any details on how they might support military families if we hit a fiscal cliff with budget cuts that could wipe out services for military and veterans' families. Month after month, in the midst of a heated presidential and congressional pre-election cycle, we see no organized blueprint to integrate millions of military family members into civilian society. Since 2001, more than 2 million troops have returned from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have spent less time at home than service members in the past because of frequent deployments, making readjustment and life at home for families harder than ever. Today, as the military drawdown in Afghanistan proceeds, tens of thousands of military members are returning to uncertainty about their and their families' future. What services will be cut? Will it be medical care, mental health services or school supports for children? The Republican National Convention barely mentioned military and veteran families. The Democratic National Convention was a great homage to our vets but didn't revealed specific plans for programs that President Barack Obama would support. After more than 10 years of war in Iraq and men and women in uniform continuing to die in Afghanistan, this silence on a national plan or funding for services only increases the stress and uncertainty that military families feel every day. With all the public celebration of military families on the campaign trail, this lack of proposals for new resources or a detailed plan of how federal agencies will coordinate the integration of returning troops seems like a violation of our nation's promise and its social contract with the millions of brave warriors and their families. No one doubts Republicans and Democrats honor and care about military families. But words and public recognition are not enough. ""Joining Forces,"" led by Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, is the Obama administration's broad initiative involving the public and private sectors to help provide services and opportunities for military members and their families. Last year, this campaign waged by large corporations, nonprofit organizations and universities raised the visibility of the needs of military families and veterans. This national leadership is exactly what we need as a nation. But it is not enough. It must be on a much larger scale, backed up with federal resources. Obama's directive last year that all federal agencies cooperate and use existing resources to help military families was also a huge step in the right direction. But keeping that sacred vow to military and veteran families will require a federally led partnership with civilian society that provides full spectrum of programs designed to make the transition from military member to civilian a smooth one. Both parties seem to be waiting for the elections to be over and are accepting the possibility of deep, across-the-board cuts in the Department of Defense if Congress doesn't reach a budget compromise during the post-election period. But before the election, both candidates should provide detailed plans or at least debate their stance on federally supported programs for military and veteran families. Our political leaders should be striving to expand Veterans Administration services to meet the growing demand. At minimum, those leaving the military need the education, employment, health and mental health services they were promised. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ron Astor.","Ron Astor: We need plans to provide services for returning vets if defense is deeply cut .
Astor: Candidates laud military members but provide no detailed plans for re-integration .
Tens of thousands back from wars wonder what services will survive, he says .

"(CNN) -- The next stop in a legal battle over a controversial new abortion law in Texas could be the U.S. Supreme Court. On Monday abortion-rights groups filed an emergency motion asking the Supreme Court to block Texas from enforcing part of the law, which is considered among the most restrictive in the country. Justice Antonin Scalia has given the state until November 12 to respond, according to court documents. The motion comes four days after a federal appeals court reinstated a key part of the law -- a provision that requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. The appeals court's decision allowed that provision to remain in place, but Monday's motion asks the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling. Since the decision, more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in Texas have stopped providing abortions, Louise Melling, a deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, told reporters in a conference call Monday. ""A dozen abortion providers were forced to cancel appointments immediately,"" said Kenneth Lambrecht, director and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. ""Our patients are scared, some are angry, some have said they don't know how they're going to make the long trip to the next closest provider."" Marni Evans, 37, a freelance consultant, told reporters she is now considering flying to Seattle for an abortion after her appointment in Austin, Texas, was canceled. She said she and her fiance decided to pursue an abortion for financial reasons. ""We can barely afford our own health care, let alone a child, she said. ""After a lot of soul searching, we decided we want to start a family someday, but we just can't do it right now. Because of last Thursday's ruling, that decision has been taken out of our hands."" A Planned Parenthood lawsuit against the state over the law is still pending. The suit -- filed in U.S. District Court in Austin on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas -- alleges that the abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions. The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Gov. Rick Perry then called the Legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill. Perry cheered last week's appeals court ruling. ""Today's decision affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of Texas,"" he said in a statement last week. ""We will continue doing everything we can to protect a culture of life in our state."" CNN's Dana Ford and Cristy Lenz contributed to this report.","Abortion-rights groups ask the Supreme Court to block part of Texas law .

"(CNN) -- Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak will remain hospitalized for at least one more day after collapsing as he walked off the field for halftime of the team's Sunday night game against the Indianapolis Colts, the team said Monday. ""Gary is alert, coherent and in good spirits,"" the team said in a statement. ""He is continuing to be evaluated and monitored."" The Texans didn't elaborate on what might be wrong with Kubiak, who ""experienced dizziness and a light-headed feeling"" before sinking to the ground, according to the team. On Sunday, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said the coach ""did not have a heart attack, but they're still checking on everything with him."" The 52-year-old coach was walking near the 20-yard line just after halftime started when he slowly bent over and then collapsed, shocking the audience and members of Kubiak's own team and staff. In a post-game news conference, Phillips recalled his confusion in the moments after Kubiak's collapse, describing it as ""a shock to everybody."" ""I was traveling in, and I saw him on the ground, and I kept asking, 'What happened?' "" he said. ""And that's kind of what happened with everybody."" 'It looked serious' One Texans player, defensive end Antonio Smith, said he saw Kubiak collapse. ""He went down to his knee and couldn't get back up and looked like he was having trouble breathing,"" he said after the game. ""It looked serious because he couldn't get back up and everyone was surrounding him."" Kubiak was tended to by a flock of medical staff as he lay on the field. He was eventually wheeled out on a stretcher. ""We finally got word that they took him to the hospital, but we were unsure of everything,"" Phillips said. Concern from both teams . The Colts went on to win the game 27-24, even though the Texans led 21-3 at halftime. But Phillips refused to use Kubiak's collapse as an excuse for the defeat, saying Houston had opportunities in the second half. ""When the game was on the line, we didn't play well enough,"" he said. ""We were very concerned at halftime,"" Texans tackle Duane Brown said. ""We actually were more motivated if anything to try to go out and get the win. But once we were out there and started playing again, it didn't stick around in our minds too much."" Houston's opponents also voiced their concern about Kubiak. Colts owner Jim Irsay offered his support to the Texans coach. ""Big time prayers for Coach Kubiak,"" Irsay tweeted. ""God bless his healthy return and ease his family's worry and concern."" Star defensive player J.J. Watt said after Monday's practice that players had yet to talk with the coach.

"(CNN) -- It seems difficult to open a paper, turn on TV or visit a website these days without hearing some awful new ""discovery"" about Obamacare and how it's going to end the world. More often than not, these claims are overblown, designed to get attention and score political points. This week, the New York Times published an article explaining that the savings many people hope to see in lower-cost insurance could come at the cost of fewer choices with respect to health care providers. This is very true. If we want to be realistic about health care reform, we have to acknowledge that everything comes with a tradeoff. In order to make insurance cost less, private insurance companies have to make use of the tools available to them. In the past, they could have tried preferentially to cover healthier people and refuse coverage to those with chronic conditions. That leaves a cheaper risk pool, which results in lower premiums. But Obamacare no longer allows that. If we want guaranteed issue and community ratings (so that no one can be denied insurance and no one can be charged more for being sick), then insurance companies must use other strategies to save money. In the past, insurance companies could have tried to issue policies that didn't cover as much. Policies with skimpier benefits are cheaper, too. But Obamacare sets minimums with respect to what qualifies as comprehensive coverage. So that tool was taken away as well. In the past, insurance companies could have set lower annual or lifetime limits, which confines their risk and allows them to sell insurance at a lower price. Or, they could have set really high deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums. These, too, are now more tightly regulated. So what's left? How can insurance companies make health care cheaper so that they can deliver lower premiums to people and attract more business? Well, one thing they could do is limit their administrative costs. But if you ask insurance companies, they tell you that they are already running pretty lean. They also like to make a nice profit, and they like to pay their executives well. So they are left with one really good option: Pay less for care. How do they do this? One way they've been doing it for years is to contract with certain doctors and hospitals to provide care for their beneficiaries for less money. Providers will agree to this because it guarantees them a certain amount of business. Insurance companies like it because it means they can pay less, charge lower premiums and sell more policies. And that is how many plans in the health care exchanges will compete for your business. Please understand that this is nothing new with respect to health insurance. At my job, there are a number of different plans offered to employees. The most expensive plan allows us to see the widest range of physicians. There's a cheaper plan available, but my kids' pediatrician (whom we revere) isn't in that network. So we pay for the more expensive plan. That's a choice we make as informed consumers. Problems will arise if people don't understand what they are getting into. There's no such thing as a free lunch. If you buy the cheapest plan, it may not include the doctor you want. If choice is your No. 1 goal, then you will probably have to pay for it. What makes this a problem for Obamacare, though, is that some health exchanges aren't offering a choice. For instance, in New Hampshire, only one insurance company is offering exchange plans, and it has a rather limited network. If you were previously uninsured, then the most straightforward argument is that the plan you're getting, probably with subsidies to make it cheaper, is better than nothing. But some people, who might have had individually issued policies before Obamacare with larger networks, will not be happy with their new plans. They may be cheaper, but they may have preferred to pay more for choice, and now they won't be able to. No policy is perfect. On the whole, I believe far more people will benefit from Obamacare than will be hurt by it. Any change will inevitably make someone unhappy. This is one of those situations. We shouldn't ignore this deficiency. We should fix it. One way might be to have a public option, run by the government, which might have a larger network. Medicare has perhaps the largest national network in the country, as more doctors accept it than just about any other form of insurance. So it's totally possible to offer more choice. But that will require politicians to work together to amend the law to make it better. It will be instructive to watch how people react to news like this. If they are truly concerned about fixing this problem, then they will seek solutions to do so. If they use this issue only to demagogue against the entire law, though, it's likely that they care more about politics than policy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Lower-cost insurance could come at the cost of fewer choices of health care providers .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Clashes between Egyptian security forces and armed men on the outskirts of Cairo Thursday left at least one police official dead, authorities said. At least 65 men were arrested during the security forces' operation in the district of Kerdasa, the Interior Ministry said. Images broadcast by Egyptian state TV showed security forces raiding buildings after a gun battle in the streets of neighboring Nahiya. Last month, 11 police officers were killed in Kerdasa in an attack following a crackdown by security forces on supporters of former President Mohamed Morsy, which left hundreds of people dead. Security forces have blamed Islamist supporters of Morsy, who was ousted by the military in July, for the killings of the police officers in Kerdasa. They had been unable to regain control of the area before Thursday. The Interior Ministry said three of the people arrested Thursday are main suspects in the killings of the police officers in Kerdasa and that the others were wanted in relation to the attack. Also Thursday, the Cairo subway resumed service after being temporarily suspended following the discovery of suspicious objects on the track, Egyptian state TV reported. The Interior Ministry described the items on the track as ""homemade foreign objects."" There were no explosive charges found in the objects, the official news outlet Egynews reported. CNN's Ian Lee reported from Cairo and Samira Said from Atlanta. Ali Younes contributed to this report.","Security forces arrest 65 men in connection with a deadly attack last month .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy commander, a Naval Criminal Investigative Service agent and a Singapore-based defense contractor face federal charges in two bribery schemes involving hundreds of millions of dollars in Navy contracts with payoffs that included prostitutes and luxury travel, according to the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego. The three men -- Navy Cmdr. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz; NCIS Supervisory Special Agent John Bertrand Beliveau II and contractor Leonard Glenn Francis, the CEO of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd., -- were all arrested earlier this week. According to a news release from the U.S. attorney's office, Misiewicz, 46, used a position as deputy operations officer of the U.S. Seventh Fleet to help schedule visits of U.S. Navy ships to ports where Francis' company provided services including tugboats, security, transportation, supplies, fuel and waste removal. ""In return, Francis provided Misiewicz with paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. The information Misiewicz passed on to Francis, a citizen of Malaysia who lives in Singapore, was ""confidential,"" meaning its disclosure could cause serious harm to U.S. national security, the U.S. attorney's office said. It detailed Navy ship movements months in advance, according to the U.S. attorney. A separate complaint alleges Beliveau, 44, provided Francis with information about an NCIS fraud investigation into his company's dealings with the Navy. ""In exchange, Francis provided Beliveau with, among other things, paid travel, luxury hotel stays and prostitution services,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. The complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of California, states that Beliveau made arrangements to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, through the same travel agent Francis used. Read the complaint . No evidence was found that Beliveau paid for his hotel or travel, or that he reimbursed Francis for the trip. Francis also arranged for a female escort to entertain Beliveau while there, according to the complaint. In e-mail correspondence between the two as detailed in the complaint, Francis attached a picture of the escort saying: ""Joyce your kinda Babe?"" Beliveau responded: ""Nice. You bet. Hopefuly I'm her kinda guy, hehe."" Francis allegedly paid for three days of the escort's time, including her airfare, according to the complaint. In all, the complaint alleges that Francis received the three-day trip to Thailand, escort included; a laptop for a female acquaintance; and went on a three-week, five-country trip through Asia. In return, Francis allegedly saved 125 NCIS investigative reports to his government computer. The affidavit states the reports were in connection with the NCIS investigation into Glenn Defense Marine Asia -- Francis' company. According to the complaint, after many of the downloads the CD burner was activated, but it's unclear what, if anything, was burned. The affidavit alleges that Francis burned the documents to a CD so that he could transport them out of the NCIS office. The special agent who wrote the affidavit wrote that there is no ""direct proof"" that Beliveau gave Francis the downloaded documents. The three men are charged with conspiring to commit bribery and could face up to five years in prison if convicted. Francis is being held without bond in San Diego, where he was arrested. Navy SEAL video game scandal . Beliveau was arrested in Virginia and Misiewicz in Colorado, where he was serving with the U.S. Northern Command at Peterson Air Force Base. Both men are expected to be sent to San Diego to face the charges against them. If true, the allegations against Misiewicz will tarnish what has been an inspiring immigrant success story. Born in Cambodia and adopted by an American woman serving in the U.S. Army in Phnom Penh, Misiewicz came to the U.S. in 1973, a few years before the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia. Millions died during the group's brutal reign in what became known as the ""Killing Fields."" Misiewicz went on to earn his commission from the U.S. Naval Academy and in 2010 was in command of the destroyer USS Mustin when it made a port call in Cambodia. ""It is important for me to be strong and to remember and honor the sacrifices that were made for me,"" Misiewicz said at the time, according to a Navy News Service report. ""Both Cambodians and Americans in my young life sacrificed life and happiness so I could have a better life."" ""Anything is possible. You can start anywhere, any place, if you've got freedom and you have opportunity like we have in the U.S., the sky is the limit,"" he said in the report.

"(CNN) -- Germans have learned a lot about Chancellor Merkel in this election cycle: we now know she has a drivers' license, but feels too insecure to drive herself. She has confessed that in her youth she sometimes drank too much cherry wine and that she has been married once before and divorced. Her current husband, Joachim Sauer, a quantum chemist, often criticizes her for putting too few sprinkles on the cakes she bakes. He should know, since he is the son of a pastry chef. Read more: Could euroskeptics spoil Merkel's plan? Merkel knows how to cook potato soup, but her signature dish is hearty roulades. She believes in eternal love, and doesn't like to Skype. In recent months, Merkel has shown the German voter that she is a real person, down-to-earth and approachable. But while some newspaper editorials have criticized the exposure of politicians' personal lives as part of the ""Americanization"" of German politics, others have applauded the trend for these more homely views. Peer Steinbrueck: The man who stirred up German politics . German politics certainly needs more sparkle and a little less seriousness to get the voters more interested -- but at the same time personalities must not be allowed to trump politics, as often happens in the U.S. when a candidate stumbles over old love affairs or adolescent drug experiences. Germans have always oscillated between fascination with and scepticism of American politics, but they have still emulated the most successful U.S. tactics over the years. Read more: Is Germany playing beggar-my-neighbor with the eurozone? Post-war political giants like Konrad Adenauer and Willy Brandt greatly admired the strategies of their American counterparts. Adenauer, the first post-war chancellor of West Germany, had photographs taken while playing boccia at his vacation home in Italy, taking care of his beloved rose garden, and baking pancakes. A decade later, Brandt, then the candidate for the Social Democratic Party (SPD), sent his campaign manager to the U.S. to learn from the Nixon and Kennedy campaigns. Brandt adored Kennedy and followed his lead when he drove around Germany in a Mercedes convertible, giving marathon speeches in swing regions. Angela Merkel: Europe's Mrs. Nein . Last year, representatives of Germany's major parties made pilgrimages across the Atlantic again, going to key states like Florida and Ohio, to observe and learn from the Obama campaign's massive digital operation. Some ideas did make it into the German campaigns this year, but a lot of strategies just don't work for the German electorate. Cultural differences, the political system, and financial resources make it impossible to adapt many U.S. tactics. Those who criticize the ""Americanization"" of German politics are not seeing the obvious differences. Read more: It's the economy, Dummkopf: CNN debate ahead of vote . Micro-targeting, for example, does not occur in Germany because the laws are more restrictive than in the U.S. -- political parties are not allowed to collect data from voters without their consent. In addition, the German public highly distrusts official use of personal information. This could be one reason why social media is not yet as successful at turning people out to vote in Germany as in the U.S. -- or it could simply be that a lot of young Germans just don't care about hashtags and retweets. The Social Democrats tried to emulate Obama's extensive ground operation this year, launching their first door-to-door field operation. It is unclear if they will reach their target of knocking on five million doors by election day, but what is clear is that canvassing in Germany will never be as effective as it is in the U.S., because without a data operation, you never know quite who to expect on the other side of the door. While Obama and Romney ran billion dollar campaigns in 2012, the major German parties will each spend around $25 to $30 million on their election fight, the smaller parties less than $10 million. Romney and Obama spent $160 million dollars on ads in the swing state of Florida alone -- that's more than all the major German parties combined will spend on the whole 2013 election campaign.

In the U.S., the typical voter is bombarded incessantly by political advertising -- Romney's and Obama's campaigns even called me because their data system had obviously mistaken me for an American voter. In Germany, most parties release just one minute-and-a-half ad for the entire election. U.S. politicians are constantly campaigning; by contrast the ""heisse Phase,"" the hot phase of the German election, did not begin until late August, less than a month before polling day. German campaigns are far from Americanized, but they are using the best strategies from the U.S. to make politics more exciting. Personal exposure still comes in the right doses and flaws are accepted. Social Democrat candidate Peer Steinbrueck, the only candidate offering a strong challenge to Merkel's position as chancellor was on the cover of a nationwide magazine gesturing with his middle finger just two weeks before the election. The magazine features an ""interview"" in which people answer questions with actions, rather than words; this was Steinbrueck's answer to those who have taunted the gaffe-prone politician with nicknames during the campaign. The picture caused uproar for a couple of days, but the fuss soon died away, without becoming a major issue. If either Romney or Obama had given someone the finger, it would have been the end of their respective campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charlotte Potts.","German campaigns are using strategies from the U.S. to make politics more exciting, Potts says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate focused Wednesday on an energy efficiency bill while House Republicans argued among themselves over funding Obamacare as Congress shifted its focus from the Syria crisis in order to give new diplomatic efforts a chance to succeed. In his nationally televised address Tuesday night, President Barack Obama said he asked legislators to hold off on voting on his requested authorization to attack Syria over chemical weapons while his administration negotiates with Russia on putting Syrian stockpiles under international control. ""Congress will be watching these negotiations very closely,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, warned Wednesday. ""If there is any indication they're not serious or they're being used as a ploy to delay, then Congress stands ready to return to that Syria resolution"" that would authorize a military strike on Syria. Obama accuses Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of a major sarin gas attack last month on suburban Damascus that killed more than 1,400 people. The president tried to generate an international coalition to attack Syria for violating chemical weapons bans, but Russia blocked any U.N. action and the British Parliament voted against taking part to deny the president a normally reliable NATO ally. He then went to Congress for authorization, but appeared in danger of rejection by legislators reflecting public opposition to military strikes. Analysis: Is Obama a winner or loser on Syria? However, the sudden emergence Monday of a diplomatic opening by Russia, which proposed having Syria give up control of its chemical weapons, caused Obama to ask Congress for time to pursue negotiations before any vote on military action. So instead of taking up a resolution authorizing a military response to Syria, the Senate considered a bipartisan bill to improve energy efficiency in the United States. Senators agreed to bar any Syria-related amendments to the energy bill, assuring that heated political rhetoric in Washington won't corrode the negotiations Secretary of State John Kerry will conduct on Thursday and Friday in Geneva with his Russian counterpart. U.N. blames both sides in civil war . Off the Senate floor, however, talks continued behind the scenes among a group of bipartisan senators on changes to the resolution that Reid said would be taken up if the negotiations with Russia fail. New language yet to be finalized takes into account Syria's recent acknowledgment that it possesses chemical weapons. It would authorize the president to attack Syria for failing to fully comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention and turn its stockpiles over to the international community. ""I think we've all settled into the fact that until we know what agreement is made with another nation ... it's kind of hard to craft something,"" said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. Corker also criticized Obama's speech to the nation, saying the president failed to effectively make the case that U.S. credibility was on the line in Syria. ""The president just seems to be very uncomfortable being commander in chief of this nation,"" he told CNN. On the House side, Republican leaders say they'll wait for the Senate to act on a Syria resolution before taking up the matter. Meanwhile, Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said he and colleagues are working on revisions to a resolution that they will propose ""if and when the president determines that it would be necessary to proceed with that kind of legislation."" ""So we agree that we should take a pause,"" Van Hollen said. Instead, House Republican leaders dealt with an internal revolt. They postponed a vote scheduled for Thursday on government funding legislation until next week after many conservatives made it clear they would reject the measure because it includes money for Obamacare. The politically charged health care law was approved with no Republican support in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Now conservatives are targeting bureaucratic and funding steps required to get new programs under the legislation running this fall. CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","A resolution authorizing military strikes on Syria is put on hold .
