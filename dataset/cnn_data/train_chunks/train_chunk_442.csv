"It was with some difficulty that Hamas agreed to extend the ceasefire with Israel for another five days Wednesday. The movement sees a second truce extension as a sign of weakness after 35 days of fighting with Israel. Hamas has used this war to achieve some tactical and strategic objectives and considers itself the winner in the conflict. As such, it believes it can dictate terms. Hamas has seen this war as an opportunity not only to end the blockade of Gaza, but also to end its political isolation and allow itself to present itself as the face of Palestinians -- on and off the battlefield. Hamas' public image has suffered since it came to rule in Gaza in 2007. It chose to keep its focus on resistance, rather than governance, leaving that instead to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Seven years on, the blockade by Israel and Egypt had left the group in dire financial straits. Reuters reports Hamas has struggled to pay some 40,000 civil servants and security personnel. The United Nations Office for Humanitarian Affairs said last month ""former de facto government employees, including the security forces, have not been paid salaries regularly since August 2013 and no salaries at all since April 2014."" Hamas had hoped that an April agreement to form a ""consensus government"" with Fatah -- which runs the government in the West Bank -- would resolve the issue. When it did not, Hamas tried to achieve its goals through the conflict with Israel. The already miserable situation in Gaza meant that its fighters had nothing to lose and mass Palestinian casualties, as well damage to property and infrastructure, hardened their resolve. A battle that was launched for humble goals has ended with increased Arab and Palestinian sympathy -- and an expansion of Hamas' objectives. Indeed, some Palestinians believe that Hamas' aims are more factional than national. Some members of Fatah have told me that Hamas prevented their military wing -- the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades -- fighting during the conflict with Israel, placing around 60 members under house arrest. Hamas also hoped that its war with Israel would indirectly increase public support for its ally in Egypt, the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. However, Hamas is unlikely to quell Egyptian anger at the Brotherhood -- the movement of ousted President Mohamed Morsy. Cairo may have received a high-level delegation from Hamas for peace talks, but it remains hostile to the movement. Hamas' insistence in the peace negotiations on having an independent seaport and airport is aimed at avoiding pressure from Egypt, ruled as it now is by a regime that regards Hamas as an enemy. Hamas has also been at loggerheads with countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan, which -- like Egypt -- are looking unfavorably at political Islam. Meanwhile, the group's decision to back Syrian rebels against Bashar al-Assad's regime saw it fighting Israel without the support of Tehran, Hezbollah and Damascus for the first time. The conflict has severely depleted Hamas' arsenal, and it will now be compelled to return to Iran's orbit to rebuild. After two cease-fires and 10 days of negotiations in Cairo Hamas still does not seem to have achieved its objectives. There has been no breakthrough with Israel regarding the re-opening of the border crossings, or ending the blockade. And whatever the agreement with Israel, the Palestinian Authority will be tasked to control Rafah and other Gaza ground crossings with Israel. Any money for the reconstruction of Gaza will also be channeled through the PA, with the conflict thus ensuring the authority takes partial control of Gaza. Despite this erosion of power, Hamas has used the conflict to reestablish itself as an important player in the Middle East, after two years that saw the Muslim Brotherhood and its allies pushed to the margins.

"Never underestimate the capacity of the Eurozone to shoot itself in both feet. ""Breath-taking,"" ""Staggering,"" ""Bewildering."" Just some of the adjectives we could use to describe the latest Eurozone fiasco where the troika -- made up of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- has managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The decision to ""bail-in"" depositors in Cyprus -- to make ordinary people pay for the mistakes of the banks -- is extraordinary. Nothing like this was done in Greece, Portugal or Ireland. Why, oh why, it should be up to the Cypriots to test drive this dangerous and maverick policy remains unknown. To be sure, the presence of large Russian and offshore funds in Cypriot banks is cause for a different format than those used in other peripheral countries. For example, you could not realistically have the money of German housewives bailing out Russian oligarchs. There were more sophisticated and rapier like ways to achieve the same goal, taxing deposits under €100,000 at over 6% is effectively punishing the Cypriot people. Cypriots are already going to feel the ferocity from the effects of a recession caused by lower wages and high unemployment,  they do not need the additional confiscatory measures of their deposits being taken. Once again the Eurozone has shown it is better at creating crises than confronting them. In the past few hours, I've spoken to bank CEOs and top economists. Words like ""great mistake"" and ""disastrous"" are being used. So far I have not spoken to anyone who thinks this is a good idea. At all levels, for depositors, future foreign investors and Eurozone policy, the decision on tiny Cyprus is going to have huge ramifications.","The money of German housewives should not bail out Russian oligarchs, writes Quest .

"Timothy Tracy went to Venezuela to make a documentary about the political division gripping the country. Now he's in the spotlight after being arrested on allegations of funding opponents of newly elected President Nicolas Maduro, successor to the late Hugo Chavez. In a televised address on Thursday, Maduro said he ordered the arrest of Tracy, who he accused of ""financing violent groups."" Tracy, 35, of Los Angeles, was arrested Wednesday at the Caracas airport as he was preparing to leave the country, Reporters Without Borders said. ""Tracy was just acting as an observer when he was filming,"" the journalism rights group said. ""Shooting video is not evidence of participation in what the government calls an 'act of destabilization.' It is for the police and judicial authorities to investigate and establish from the facts, not for the government to designate Tracy as guilty from the outset."" The U.S. State Department said Friday it was aware an American was arrested in the Venezuelan capital, but declined to comment on the specifics of the case because of privacy considerations. But Patrick Ventrell, a State Department spokesman, said the accusations are the latest in a series of allegations in recent weeks made by the Venezuelan government that ""foreign actors"" are attempting to influence political developments in the country. ""These allegations have not been substantiated,"" Ventrell said. ""The U.S. continues to categorically reject any allegations of U.S. government efforts to destabilize the Venezuelan government or to harm anyone in Venezuela.""","Timothy Tracy, 35, was arrested Wednesday at the Caracas airport, a rights group says .

"(CNN) -- Strong support from young and minority voters propelled Barack Obama on the road to the White House, exit polls showed Tuesday. Students wait in a long line to vote Tuesday on the campus of the University of Central Florida. Voters in the 18 to 24 age group broke 68 percent for Obama to 30 percent for John McCain, according to the exit polling. Those in the 25 to 29 age bracket went 69 percent to 29 percent in Obama's favor. The only age group where McCain prevailed was 65 and over, and that by just a 10-percentage-point margin, 54 percent to 44 percent, the exit polls showed. And minorities went heavily into the Obama camp. Blacks, 96 percent Obama to 3 percent McCain; Latinos, 67 percent Obama to 30 percent McCain; and Asians, 63 percent Obama to 34 percent McCain. Obama did well with Latinos because they appear to disapprove of President Bush's job performance more than the rest of the country, CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider explain the Latino impact » . About 80 percent of Latinos give Bush negative marks, while 72 percent of all Americans do, exit polling showed. Race played less of a role in the election than age, exit polls showed. While Obama is projected to be the nation's first black president, John McCain would have been the oldest person ever elected to the nation's highest office. Twice as many of those polled Tuesday said age was an important factor in their vote as those who said race was. Among those factoring age into their vote, 78 percent went for Obama to 21 percent for McCain, exit polls showed. Those who said race was an important factor voted 55 percent to 44 percent in favor of Obama. But Obama also was the winner by a similar margin among those who said race was not important, ""which suggests that race was not a decisive factor in this election,"" Schneider said. The economy was the top issue in the election among 62 percent of voters questioned in exit polls on Tuesday. It was far ahead of the second-place issue, the Iraq war, which was named as the top concern of 10 percent of voters polled. Those who picked the Iraq war as their top issue mostly voted for  Obama in all but two states, according to the early exit polling results. Health care and terrorism were tied at 9 percent as the issue voters were most concerned about, according to the exit polling. Those who picked terrorism as their top concern overwhelmingly choose  McCain, according to exit polling. In early exit polling, first-time voters were breaking overwhelmingly for Obama over McCain by a 72 percent to 27 percent margin.  Watch what first-time voters had to say in Florida » . High income voters -- those who said they make at least $100,000 a year -- went in Obama's favor, 52 percent to 47 percent. Many of those polled said they expect a post-election tax increase, with 49 percent predicting their taxes will rise no matter who is elected president. Another 22 percent said taxes will go up only if Obama wins, and 12 percent said taxes will go up only if McCain wins. Only 15 percent said their taxes will stay the same or go down. A bare majority of those surveyed -- 51 percent -- think the government should do more to solve problems. Forty-three percent believe the government is doing too much. At the same time, early exit polling shows only a minority of voters -- 40 percent -- support the $700 billion government plan to assist failing financial companies. Fifty-six percent are opposed.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider explain how the economy dominated voter concerns » . GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin didn't do well in exit polls. Sixty percent of those polled said the Alaska governor is not qualified to be president if necessary; 38 percent said she is. That compares with the two-thirds of those polled who said Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden is qualified to be president and the 31 percent who said he isn't.  Watch CNN's Jack Cafferty ask what issue is most important » . Many voters told the pollsters that they made up their minds early in the campaign season, with 61 percent saying they made up their minds before September, another 13 percent saying they decided in September and 17 percent saying they made their selection last month. Only 7 percent of those polled decided whom to support within the last three days. Exit polling also showed that Democrats who supported Sen. Hillary Clinton during the primaries overwhelming voted for Obama in the general election, 84 percent to 15 percent for McCain. For the poll, more than 16,000 people who had just voted were selected at random to fill out questionnaires.

"(CNN)Why stop now? This must be the question Vladimir Putin is asking himself as he considers the latest European pleas for peace in Ukraine, to be discussed at a crisis summit in Minsk on Wednesday. Since invading and annexing Crimea almost one year ago, the Russian president has been running rings around the European Union, NATO and the Obama administration. It is not that Putin is particularly clever -- on the contrary, his behavior suggests he is paranoid, impulsive and insecure. But he has benefited from the greater weaknesses of his opponents. So as he considers his response to Europe's ideas for a new cease-fire and a ""comprehensive settlement"" in eastern Ukraine, what will Putin be thinking? What does he know? Putin knows, for a start, that the Europeans are divided and running scared. Only two EU countries -- Britain and France -- are military powers of any consequence -- but they have zero appetite for conflict, direct or indirect, with Russia. Francois Hollande, France's weak and unpopular president, seems to be waving a white flag before hostilities have even commenced. ""If we don't manage to find not just a compromise but a lasting peace agreement, we know perfectly well what the scenario will be. It has a name, it's called war,"" Hollande said after meeting Putin on Friday. For its part, the British government splutters impotently on the sidelines. As usual, it is waiting for Washington to tell it what to do. But with a difficult national election due in May, Prime Minister David Cameron figures there are no votes in Ukraine. Eastern European countries, with bitter memories of Soviet hegemony and long, porous borders to protect, want a tougher line. Poland feels particularly vulnerable (just look at the map). So, too, do the much-bullied Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But these countries know there is little point relying on help from Brussels, home of the EU's bureaucracy. Limited economic and financial sanctions on Russia will expire this summer unless all 28 EU governments agree to extend them. Greece, maneuvering for debt relief, is flirting treacherously with Moscow. Recession-hit economies such as Italy seem to believe business as normal with Russia trumps calls for solidarity over Ukraine. All of which leaves Germany, the EU's paymaster, largest economy, and Russia's biggest European trade partner. Angela Merkel, German chancellor, has taken the lead since the Ukraine crisis erupted. Somebody had to. And she has been widely praised for her role. This is puzzling because, despite numerous one-on-one conversations with Putin, Merkel has achieved nothing. Seen one way, her diplomacy has provided cover for ongoing Russian depredations. Last September's Minsk cease-fire agreement was ignored from day one. Merkel's day-trip to Moscow last Friday, with lightweight Hollande in tow, was no bold bid for peace. It was an act of desperation -- and Putin undoubtedly knew it. Speaking at the Munich security conference, Merkel criticized Russia for failing to honor Minsk. But, she claimed, it was still worth trying to press Putin to do so. The main ""new"" idea on the table seems to be a demilitarized zone embracing September's cease-fire positions and the current front line. If implemented, it would require the Kiev government to concede control of yet more territory. By freezing the conflict in place, it would increase the chances of a permanent eastern secession. Here is a cautionary precedent: After the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, the island was split in two and a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone created. More than 40 years later, that ""temporary"" dividing line still exists, as does the unrecognized ""state"" calling itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. But Merkel, like the leaders of most western and southern European countries, opposes tougher alternatives such arming President Petro Poroshenko's out-gunned forces. Her tone in Munich, a location forever associated with appeasement, was flatly defeatist. ""I cannot imagine any situation in which improved equipment for the Ukrainian army leads to President Putin being so impressed that he believes he will lose militarily,"" she said. This seems to be the broad European view. Arming the Ukrainians would mean war with Russia, a war that Putin would win. And it is plain the Europeans will do just about anything to avoid that dread outcome. All this Putin knows, or has been told by his canny foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who greatly amused the Munich conference by insisting, absurdly, that there were no Russian troops or armor in eastern Ukraine. But what else does Putin know as he ponders Merkel's plan to halt the hostilities? Putin knows that the deep divisions within the EU over Ukraine are also present within NATO, an alliance with a roughly similar membership. Putin knows that NATO's leading power, the United States, did not react militarily when Russia sent its tanks into Georgia in 2008 and subsequently encouraged breakaway separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia to declare independence from Tbilisi. Putin knows NATO was similarly passive when he took over Crimea by stealth one year ago this month. While Ukraine is not in NATO, this startling violation of international law raised a bigger, potentially embarrassing question: what would NATO do if one of its member states was next? NATO answers that in such circumstances it would invoke Article 5 of its founding treaty, which states: ""The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all."" But this valiant concept of collective defense has never really been tested. Article 5 has only been invoked once, after the 9/11 attacks. And al Qaeda, luckily, did not have thermonuclear weapons. Would the U.S. really go to war with Russia to rescue, say, Estonia or Norway? Putin does not know the answer to this question, but neither, if they are truthful, do NATO's political masters. What Putin does know, or thinks he knows, is that, given Barack Obama's attempts to wind up overseas conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan and his reluctance to get involved in new ones such as Syria, the U.S. President will be loath to confront Russia militarily in Ukraine in what could quickly become an uncontrollable, escalating proxy war. Pressure is growing from John McCain and others in Congress, egged on by jittery east Europeans, to supply arms to Kiev. Last week the administration deliberately leaked news that it was discussing this option to the New York Times. It was a classic pressure tactic. But so far, the only people who feel scared and pressured are the European allies. Putin has not blinked, while Kremlin spokesmen and propagandists say supplying U.S. arms would confirm their view that Russia is under attack by the West. Maybe a new peace pact will be agreed later this week in Minsk. Maybe it will even be made to stick, assuming Moscow can be trusted. Putin may decide to bank his winnings. On the other hand, if he does not like the deal, he can walk away. Putin knows he has the upper hand. So why stop now?","Vladimir Putin considers his response to Europe's ideas for a new cease-fire in Ukraine .

"London (CNN)When you can't build up there's only one solution -- build down. At least that's the theory in some of London's wealthiest neighborhoods. The UK capital is in the midst of a luxury basement boom, with well-heeled residents and developers excavating large areas underneath their homes and gardens. Some have used the extra space gained to install the likes of cinemas, gyms, wine cellars, golf simulators, bowling alleys and even swimming pools. In the stylish borough of Chelsea and Kensington alone, there were 450 basement applications in 2013, according to figures provided to CNN by the local council. That's a 46% increase on 2012 and more than 500% increase on 2003 figures. Reports indicate a similar story in nearby Westminster as well as Hammersmith and Fulham. ""People have been piling into the basement sector"" in recent years, explained Stephen Merritt, managing director of specialist dig-down firm, London Basement. ""We're probably doing around 30 to 40 projects a year now. (Clients) are definitely pushing the envelope more and more ... to create new basement space."" See also: Where are the world's most expensive luxury properties? A lack of room and strict planning laws dictate that the facade of many of London's picturesque Victorian, Edwardian and Georgian-era neighborhoods must maintain their original character and outward appearance. This annuls the possibility of large extensions upwards and outwards. The simplest alternative therefore is to go down, Merritt explained. ""The price per square foot (of basement extension) in areas we work in is probably £400 to £500 per square foot (between $660 and $830 per sq ft). The extra space this brings is probably worth double that,"" he added. As the UK property market heats up again, the extra value a kitted-out basement can provide is clearly an appealing option for investors and homeowners. But while underground digs are an increasingly common sight, the general concept of extending down is not new to London. Merritt says his company alone has been excavating in plush areas like Kensington since the mid to late 90s. The difference today, however, is that the projects are becoming increasingly luxurious and ambitious. They have also spread to more modest, although still attractive neighborhoods, such as West Kensington, Wandsworth, Clapham and Fulham. See also: Shipping containers offer housing solution . In some famous cases the operations extend as many as five stories underground. Property mogul Leonard Blavatnik as well as composer Andrew Lloyd Webber have both reportedly excavated large areas beneath their palatial London properties in recent years. Billionaire mobile phone mogul John Caudwell, meanwhile, has applied to dig beneath two mansions in the city's Mayfair district, replacing an existing basement pool and sauna area while extending further down. These so called ""iceberg basements"" are the exception rather than the rule, however. Most extensions drop just one or two floors beneath the ground. ""I think for any property with a value over £2 million ($3.2 million) a basement extension is certainly a consideration for the owners,"" explained Rob Atkins of London estate agency, Domus Nova. ""If you've lived in a house for 15 and 20 years and you cannot get a move for the right value then it is an option that can suit that growing family. ""You are now expected to pay 7% stamp duty (a tax on land and property transactions) on a move of over £2 million. All in, then, it might cost you 10% of your sell or your purchase to move house so people are looking inwardly instead of moving,"" he added. These trends are similarly noted by developer Blaze Stojanovski. He believes the investment in a basement extension can be a smart one if made in the right location. Stojanovski currently owns 28 properties around west London and has added 11 basement extensions in recent years. ""On a price per square foot basements are hugely expensive, which is why 10 years ago people weren't really building them,"" he said. ""As Fulham and other areas have come up price wise we have got to a stage where it is cost effective to dig basements."" See also: India's luxury property starlet . But while keen to stress his experience of the positives, Stojanovski is also quick to point out that adding a basement in just any old house won't work. ""If you get the wrong property you could easily break even or lose money,"" he continued.  ""You have to make sure that the property is on the right street and it can justify a big investment like a basement."" Neighbours and those nearby, however, aren't always as keen. Horror stories abound in London's local papers of skips falling through streets as the earth beneath is hollowed out while complaints about the inconvenience of noise and dust from dig sites is common. ""Our members have become increasingly worried by the nastiness of having great big holes dug next door to them,"" said Terence Bendixson, honorary secretary of planning at the Chelsea Society. Randa Hanna of the Belgravia Residents Association meanwhile described ""a multitude of problems"" for residents in her area. ""There were cases of serial fraud (with builders). There have also been instances of flooding and problems for neighbors living next door to the work,"" she added. For the likes of Stojanovski and Merritt, these negative experiences are a genuine concern. Merritt believes there are few bad apples in the industry guilty of cutting corners but points to his own company's award-winning reputation as a considerate constructor. As it stands, however, these complaints have done little to halt the attraction or number of applications for luxury basement digs. There have been rumors regarding a changing of the rules to limit underground extensions but these have yet to to be implemented in any London borough. See also: Iraq's unlikely property hotspot . Given the international diversity of London's wealthiest residents and property investors, Stojanovski can even see the trend for subterranean extensions spreading to cities in other countries where space is tight and demand high. Many of his current tenants are from outside the UK, while the majority of his recent sales have been to wealthy foreign investors. ""These people will be living and getting used to living in houses with basements,"" he said. ""They will consider that and probably talk about that when they go back home. ""Therefore I wouldn't be surprised if you see that kind of basement living incorporated in houses for example in Paris, Rome, Vienna or Moscow in the future,"" he added.","Wealthy London residents are extending many floors beneath their homes .
The aim is to increase their value and provide extra room .
Tight space and strict planning laws make extending upwards or outwards difficult .
Some have installed swimming pools, gyms and cinemas in their extended basements ."
"(CNN)Legendary University of North Carolina head basketball coach Dean Smith -- a man who left his mark on young men both on and off the court -- died Saturday evening at the age of 83, according to the University of North Carolina's official athletics website. He had battled dementia for years, and according to a family statement provided to UNC, he ""passed away peacefully"" in his Chapel Hill home with his wife and five children by his side. ""It's a blessing in some ways,"" UNC coach Roy Williams, a longtime protege of Smith's, said at a news conference Sunday, ""but it is also really hard."" Williams called Smith ""the perfect picture of what a college basketball coach should have been."" The 64-year-old Williams, who played for UNC's junior varsity squad in the 1960s and attended Smith's practices during college before serving as his assistant for a decade, further said everything he does in administering the school's basketball program ""is driven by my desire to make Coach Smith proud."" ""He set the standard for loyalty and concern for every one of his players, not just the games won or lost,"" Williams said in his statement. ""He was the greatest there ever was on the court but far, far better off the court with people. His concern for people will be the legacy I will remember most."" Smith coached the Tar Heels from 1961 to 1997, tallying a record of 879-254 in those 36 seasons. The school named its basketball arena for Smith in 1986, and it's still popularly referred to as ""the Dean Dome."" On Sunday, fans left flowers outside the arena in his memory. He also won two national championships, in 1982 and 1993, and many of his young charges went on to become some of the greatest players in pro basketball history, including Michael Jordan, Billy Cunningham, James Worthy and Vince Carter. Echoing the sentiments of many who played under Smith, Jordan issued a statement, saying, ""Other than my parents, no one had a bigger influence on my life than Coach Smith. He was more than a coach -- he was my mentor, my teacher, my second father. Coach was always there for me whenever I needed him and I loved him for it. In teaching me the game of basketball, he taught me about life."" Did you have a coach who inspired you? Share your story on iReport. Smith is often mentioned in the same breath as former Indiana and Texas Tech coach Bobby Knight, Syracuse's Jim Boeheim and longtime rival Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University, all of whom are considered among the greatest men's college basketball coaches of all time. Krzyzewski said he was saddened by the news of Smith's passing and applauded him not only as a ""magnificent teacher and tactician"" but also as a compassionate mentor who believed instilling dignity in his players was as important as honing their basketball skills. ""His greatest gift was his unique ability to teach what it takes to become a good man. That was easy for him to do because he was a great man himself. All of his players benefited greatly from his basketball teaching, but even more from his ability to help mold men of integrity, honor and purpose. Those teachings, specifically, will live forever in those he touched,"" the coach said in a statement. As further testimony to how Smith's legacy transcended sports, the Twitter feed for Duke's basketball team also included several messages honoring the man who beat the Blue Devils 59 times. Sports Illustrated named Smith its Sportsman of the Year in 1997, and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1983. He was also one of the founding members in the inaugural class inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. ""He designed Carolina's 'Four Corners' offense, devised the foul-line huddle, created the 'fatigue signal' and implemented the 'run-and-jump' defense,"" according to his Hall of Fame biography. The Emporia, Kansas-born son of two teachers was also a hoopster in his own right and, with his 1952 championship as a Kansas Jayhawk, is one of only two men to win college basketball championships as a coach and player. Knight is the other. A four-time National Coach of the Year, Smith is one of only three coaches to win the National Invitation Tournament, the NCAA Tournament and Olympic Gold. He led the U.S. men's team to victory in the 1976 Montreal games. In 2013, Smith joined former President Bill Clinton and entertainer Oprah Winfrey as Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients. President Obama said during the ceremony, ""While Coach Smith couldn't join us today due to an illness that he's facing with extraordinary courage, we also honor his courage in helping to change our country -- he recruited the first black scholarship athlete to North Carolina and helped to integrate a restaurant and a neighborhood in Chapel Hill. That's the kind of character that he represented on and off the court."" On Sunday, Obama issued a statement praising Smith's basketball acumen as well as his leadership skills, saying he ""reared a generation of players who went on to even better things elsewhere, including a young man named Michael Jordan -- and all of us from Chicago are thankful for that. ""But more importantly, Coach Smith showed us something that I've seen again and again on the court -- that basketball can tell us a lot more about who you are than a jumpshot alone ever could. He graduated more than 96 percent of his players and taught his teams to point to the teammate who passed them the ball after a basket,"" the statement said. Smith broke UNC's color barrier for scholarship athletes in 1967 with his recruitment of Charles Scott, a would-be two-time All-American who would help skipper the Tar Heels to consecutive NCAA Final Four appearances in 1968 and 1969. Despite averaging 22 points and seven rebounds a game throughout his college career, Scott was passed over for Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year honors. It's telling that he once told a Greensboro, North Carolina, newspaper that the snub was the one time in college ""that I felt things were done in a prejudicial manner. ""And what concerned me more was how the media handled it. Nobody ever said anything about it, never challenged what took place. To me, that's just another form of hypocrisy,"" he told the News & Record. Smith left such an indelible mark on Scott's life that when Scott spoke at an awards ceremony for Smith many years later, he said, ""When they introduce Coach Smith's family, why don't they mention my name? My father died when I was 12 years old, and Dean Smith is the only father I ever had."" Recruiting Scott wasn't Smith's first foray into integration. In the 1950s, when Smith was an assistant coach at UNC, a pastor at an inclusive Baptist church asked Smith to dine with him and a black student at a then-popular Chapel Hill restaurant that, like most eateries in the city, had a policy of not serving African-Americans. Smith agreed, and the three were allowed to dine. ""We're human beings first, coaches and players second, and in the '60s we had to strike an extremely delicate balance between the two,"" Smith once wrote. The longtime Democrat would go on to strike that balance often, speaking out against the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, nuclear proliferation and the death penalty, among other causes. ""America lost not just a coaching legend, but a gentleman and a citizen,"" Obama said in his Sunday statement. Smith's wife, Linnea, accepted the 2013 Presidential Medal of Freedom on behalf of her husband, who had been fighting dementia for years. Sportswriter John Feinstein, who reportedly abandoned a biography on Smith because of his memory lapses, wrote a column for Smith's 83rd birthday last year, outlining how Smith refused to engage in self-pity because he'd led such a great life and knew there were people suffering more than he was. Dementia was a particularly cruel fate to befall a man who ""remembered every name, every game, every play in every game. He also remembered every call that went against him and anything written or said about one of his players or friends that he thought was a slight -- real or perceived. He never asked me how my kids were. He asked how Danny and Brigid were,"" wrote Feinstein, who says he first noticed Smith's flagging memory in 2005. Even Krzyzewski, his longtime rival -- and some might say archrival, given the fierce history of competition between UNC and Duke -- concurred. ""You're talking about the person who had the sharpest mind and the most remarkable memory of anyone I've ever met. It's just not fair,"" Feinstein quoted Krzyzewski as saying.

"(CNN) -- Organizers of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have responded to criticism over the plight of migrant workers on stadia and infrastructure projects by saying Tuesday that ""tangible progress"" had been made in addressing widespread concerns over their welfare. They published an updated 50-page ""workers' charter"" -- developed in consultation with the International Labor Organization -- detailing measures to improve wages, accommodation as well as promising regular inspections. FIFA had set the Qatari authorities a deadline of February 12 to give an update on measures to improve conditions for workers. Theo Zwanziger, a senior member of the world governing body's executive committee, is to report its findings to the European parliament Thursday. Zahir Belounis, a French Algerian striker who was trapped in Qatar after a dispute with his club, is also to due to appear to give his perspective. FIFA acted after its president Sepp Blatter condemned working conditions in the Gulf state as ""unacceptable"" as he responded to damning reports last year from Amnesty International and the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC). They detailed systematic abuse and the ITUC claimed that fatal construction injuries were eight times higher in Qatar than other developed nations, with migrant workers from India and Nepal the worst affected. 'We have always believed that Qatar's hosting of the World Cup would be a catalyst to accelerate positive initiatives, already being undertaken by Qatar, which will leave a legacy of enhanced, sustainable and meaningful progress in regards to worker welfare across the country,"" said Hassan Al Thawadi, the secretary general of Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy. ""We already see this progress taking place across Qatar on a daily basis, and will continue to work hard to make our vision become the ever-present reality on the ground.' Nicholas McGeehan, the Gulf researcher of Human Rights Watch, one of the most trenchant critics of the Qatari government, told CNN that its authorities ""deserve credit for its efforts to improve standards on the projects within its control"" -- but he urged caution. ""They not guaranteeing workers' rights to change employer, or their right to leave the country or their right to bargain collectively for decent pay and conditions if things go wrong. ""If the Qatari government is serious about reform it should apply these standards to the whole migrant worker population, back them up with sanctions, and get to work on reform of the kafala system."" McGeehan's call echoes that of other human rights groups for an end to practices under the kafala system, which ties workers to their employer and stops them leaving the country without their permission. It has been compared with modern-day slavery and was highlighted by the Belounis affair, the footballer who was unable to leave Qatar following a pay dispute with his club side El Jaish and was left stranded in the country with his family for two years. Despite threatening a hunger strike and suicide, Belounis, who eventually flew home to France last November, has told CNN that the Gulf state still deserves the right to stage the World Cup. Qatar is spending a reported $200 billion on infrastucture and building projects associated with its staging of football's global showpiece, but work has only just started on one of the stadiums to be used. Only 38 workers are currently employed at the Al Wakrah Stadium, where a ""successful inspection"" was held January 13, according to the organizers. They said that they would be meeting representatives from other building projects in the ""coming months"" to achieve a ""unified standard"" across the whole of Qatar for migrant workers. 'We will continue to work closely with our partners to achieve practical solutions which will leave a sustainable legacy for Qatar long after 2022,' said Farah Al-Muftah, who chairs the Supreme Committee's Workers' Welfare Committee. But critics pointed out it is unclear what projects are covered by the new charter and which are under the control of the Supreme Committee. ""It's not the state-led, cross-sector regulation that Qatar's migrant workers desperately need,"" said McGeehan. FIFA has also still to decide the actual dates for the 2022 World Cup after fears that the searing heat in Qatar in the summer will be dangerous for players and spectators. There have been widespread calls for a ""Winter World Cup"" and FIFA says it's consulting stakeholders, including the major European leagues, before making a final decision.","Qatar's World Cup 2022 organizers adopt a 'workers' charter'

"The operator of a Japanese nuclear power plant where a catastrophic accident was set off last year by a massive earthquake and tsunami acknowledged Friday that it had played down safety risks at the facility out of fear that they would lead to a plant shutdown. The Tokyo Electric Power Company, known as TEPCO, said in a report that ""severe accident measures"" were taken in 2002, which included ""containment venting and power supply cross-ties between units,"" but additional measures were never put in place. Read more: Japan's nuclear fight intensifies . Part of the reason, the report said, was a concern that implementing the new safety measures ""could spread concern in the sitting community that there is a problem with the safety of current plants."" TEPCO added that taking such measures could also add to ""public anxiety and add momentum to anti-nuclear movements."" Friday's report represents some of the operator's most definitive language to date about its lack of preparation in protecting the Fukushima Daiichi power plant, which ultimately spewed radiation and displaced tens of thousands of residents from the surrounding area in the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine. Read more: Japan restarts first nuclear plant since Fukushima shutdown . ""There was a latent fear that plant shutdown would be required until severe accident measures were put in place,"" the report said. ""It was possible to diversify safety systems by referencing severe accident measures taken in other countries."" In the past year, TEPCO has come under intense scrutiny for not aggressively seeking answers to the underlining causes of what prompted the disaster. The Japanese government said in an earlier report that the operator's and the nuclear regulator's actions to prepare for disasters were ""insufficient,"" and called the response to the crisis ""inadequate.""","TEPCO says ""severe accident measures"" were taken in 2002, but nothing further was done .

"As a journalist hailing from the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, the epicenter of a violent Maoist insurgency, Shubhranshu Choudhary was regularly confronted with the shortcomings of his profession. The uprising, described by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2006 as India's ""single biggest internal security challenge ever,"" drew much of its strength from the disenfranchised indigenous communities who are a majority in Chhattisgarh. Numbering perhaps as many as 100 million across India, the ""tribals"" live in impoverished rural conditions comparable to or lower than those prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the United Nations. Yet despite their centrality to the conflict, the voice of the tribal people was almost completely absent from the national media conversation. ""There's not a single tribal journalist,"" said Choudhary. ""There's a complete disconnect: reader, writer, (media) owners all on one side, this 100 million population on the other. The journalism is completely one-sided."" Not only were the tribal people absent as voices in the media -- they had no access as consumers either, said Choudhary. There were any number of barriers. They spoke different languages to those used in the mainstream press. Many did not read or write. They lived in remote, inaccessible villages, without electricity. ""To reach one village you typically need to cross five rivers and five hills -- and there are no roads,"" said Choudhary. ""The only communication they have is with their wife or husband or people from neighboring villages if they go to market, because there is no radio, TV, magazines -- nothing in those languages."" Choudhary, a former BBC journalist, saw a link between the rural poor's exclusion and the violence wracking the region. ""It is natural when your concerns are not heard you find another avenue -- that avenue has happened to be a violent ideology called Maoism."" And so with support from the International Center for Journalists, with whom he is a Knight International Journalism Fellow, Choudhary began an experiment in citizen journalism. ""We understood it would have to be cheap and that voice would be key -- because people are not comfortable with reading and writing,"" he said. The initial phase of the experiment, which revolved around the internet and community radio stations, ""failed completely,"" he admitted. But then he took a different tack, focusing on mobile phones, which have a 74% penetration rate in India. ""Mobile is the most democratic tool in India today,"" said Choudhary. Although the mobile penetration rate in rural areas was about half the national level (36%), phones were still a common sight even in the most remote villages. ""When we started working in 2004-5 in the villages, we did not see mobile phones. But there has been a sea-change. Mobile phone use has exploded."" Read more: Indian phone features 29 Quran translations . The result, CGNet Swara (roughly, the ""voice of Chhattisgarh"") is a voice portal that allows anyone with a mobile phone to record or listen to news and items of interest. The operation is simple: on dialing the service's number, users press ""1"" to record a report, or ""2"" to listen to one. Once a report is recorded, it is verified and edited by a team of moderators before being made accessible on the service. The service ""did better than we ever expected,"" said Choudhary. He added that in the two years since it began, Swara has had 9,000 users, logged more than 30,000 phone calls and published 750 news stories, including a number which have had a big impact. For example, in January last year, Swara published a citizen journalist interview with Pitbasu Bhoi, a disabled man who said he had not been paid wages for 100 days of work on the government's flagship rural job guarantee scheme. Bhoi's infant son had died as he could not afford to bring him to a hospital for treatment. National dailies picked up the story and a light was shone on what activists say is a common complaint of unpaid wages. Bhoi now contributes reports to the service himself. Other stories have shared allegations including villages being razed in raids by security forces, police brutality, food programs for poor children going months without receiving supplies, and resistance to land being taken over for mining. ""It is the first communication platform of any type for these people,"" Choudhary said. ""When they raise their concerns in their own language, some journalist or lawyer picks it up or authorities hear about it and solve their problem then the circle is completed."" The service has also played a role in preserving the tribal languages, he said. Read more: India's telecoms king looks to Africa . Elisa Tinsley, director of the ICJ's Knight International Journalism Fellowships, and a former world editor at USA Today, said the initiative was a prime example of the type of journalism the program sought to encourage. ""Swara uses an innovative mobile phone system to help isolated communities for the first time have access to local news. And it provides an outlet that allows the people in these communities to be heard, hold governments accountable and create transparency."" Swara works because of the low cost and prevalence of the mobile phone, said Choudhary, and its success has seen it replicated in other parts of the world. In Indonesia, RuaiSwara provides a similar service in Bahasa, while an affiliated service, RuaiSMS, uses text messages to facilitate citizen reporting in West Kalimantan and West Borneo. Other projects modeled on Swara are being developed in Egypt and Afghanistan. Choudhary is continuing to tinker with the model, with aspirations to overcome legal hurdles and incorporate a shortwave radio component into Swara's operations. For that reason, he said, Swara needs to be especially careful about the accuracy of its reports. ""We are extra cautious not to give the authorities any reason to close us down, because we are the ones bringing out unpleasant stories for them,"" Choudhary said. ""There are people in power who would be very happy to shut us down.""","Citizen journalism project using mobile phone technology to reach India's tribal communities .

"Three students at the University of California Santa Barbara were being treated Thursday for meningococcal disease, a bacterial infection that causes bloodstream infections and meningitis, health officials said. The students -- two males and a female -- became ill between November 11 and November 18, according to the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. Two cases are confirmed to be the same strain, said department spokeswoman Susan Klein-Rothschild. The three were in contact ""directly or secondarily,"" she said. All the cases were caused by meningococcal bacteria known as type B, the same strain found in seven cases of meningitis, an infection of the lining of the brain, at Princeton University since March. However, no link has been found between the California cases and those at Princeton, the health department said. ""This is not expected, as cases of meningococcal disease can occur sporadically in college settings since this population has an increased risk,"" the department said in a statement. Generally, college-aged youth, particularly those in their first year who live in residence halls, are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. Kissing, sharing eating utensils or food, and drinks or cigarettes can increase risk. Public health officials and the university are looking into the cases. Some 300 students who have had close contact with the ill students were being given antibiotics, the statement said. Princeton is preparing to provide a vaccine, unlicensed in the United States, which targets meningitis B, pending final approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Santa Barbara County, UCSB, California Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control have already had preliminary discussions about the vaccine,"" the statement said. ""Santa Barbara County and UCSB will be monitoring the situation closely and continuing to explore the possibility of vaccination."" There are two forms of meningitis: bacterial and viral. The bacterial form is rare in the United States, and the group B bacterial strains are even more rare. Symptoms can include stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death.","Meningococcal disease causes bloodstream infections and meningitis .

"(CNN) -- A Yemeni rights activist, whose arrest sparked an international outcry and domestic protests, was released from prison Monday and said there is a revolution taking place in her country. Authorities arrested Tawakkol Karman over the weekend, accusing her of organizing anti-government protests in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. They let her go after more than 5,000 protesters gathered in her support. She had initially refused to leave prison until officials also agreed to free other activists detained over the weekend, she said. Karman is a leader of the protest movement in Yemen that is calling for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to step down. ""This revolution going on in Yemen was inspired by Tunisia's 'Jasmine Revolution' and we are now having a 'Jasmine Revolution' in Yemen,"" Karman told CNN soon after her release. ""The huge amount of pressure coming from the people here will force President Saleh to leave office."" Protests in Tunisia ended 23 years of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's rule. They have ignited unrest elsewhere in the region, including Algeria and Egypt. Karman, who heads the Women Journalists Without Chains organization in Yemen, said she was arrested Saturday night near her home. ""The police asked me to get out of the car but I refused. I asked to see if they had a warrant for my arrest and if there were charges against me. I was removed from the car by force,"" she said. Karman was arrested under a warrant for leading unlicensed student protests in Sanaa last week, according to a statement from the interior ministry. Known as one of the most-prominent rights activists in Yemen, she has helped to organize several protests that have drawn hundreds of demonstrators. People in Yemen are upset because the parliament is considering loosening the rules on presidential term limits. That has sparked concerns among the opposition that Saleh might try to appoint himself president for life. Saleh has been in office for some 32 years and was last re-elected in 2006. Yemeni authorities ordered Karman's release after she spent more than 30 hours in jail. ""My message is that we, the protesters who have been out there in the streets, are actually looking out for the welfare of our republic -- that we are making sure our leaders are accountable. They have taken our republic as a kingdom for themselves and we are holding our corrupt leaders accountable,"" she said. Journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this story.","NEW: Tawakkol Karman is calling for Yemen's president to step down .

"You probably think your tweets aren't of any interest to the government. After all, most 140-character posts are public, often detailing nothing more interesting than snarky jokes or links to adorable cat videos on YouTube. However, courts are increasingly subpoenaing Twitter for data on its users that can be used in criminal and civil cases. That's what happened to editor Malcolm Harris. On Monday, New York Criminal Court Judge Matthew A. Sciarrino ordered Twitter to turn over Harris' tweets and data from a three-and-a-half-month period, striking down the company's request to quash a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney. Twitter claimed that complying with the request would violate United States privacy laws. The case itself is over a minor charge that normally wouldn't draw much attention. Brooklyn resident Harris was arrested along with 700 other people during an Occupy Wall Street march on the Brooklyn Bridge's roadway on October 1, 2011, and charged with disorderly conduct. If Twitter complies with the request, prosecutors wouldn't just gain access to Harris' tweets (which were public but have since been deleted), they would get a host of other information stored by Twitter that could be used as evidence in the case, such as Harris' IP address, e-mail address and location information at the time of the incident. Monday's decision could have far-reaching implications for the many other requests for tweets and other data Twitter receives on a regular basis, as well as users' rights to challenge such requests themselves. ""We are disappointed in the judge's decision and are considering our options,"" a Twitter representative said in a statement released to news organizations. ""Twitter's Terms of Service have long made it absolutely clear that its users *own* their content. We continue to have a steadfast commitment to our users and their rights."" The ruling also dismayed online privacy advocates. ""The court continued to fail to grapple with one of the key issues underlying this case: do individuals give up their ability to go to court to try to protect their free speech and privacy rights when they use the Internet? As we explained in our friend-of-the-court brief last month, the answer has to be no,"" Aden Fine, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, wrote in a blog post. Fine later added: ""The government shouldn't be able to get this sensitive and constitutionally protected information without a warrant and without first satisfying First Amendment scrutiny."" In his ruling, Sciarrino speculated that the founding fathers would have quite enjoyed expressing themselves on today's social networks. But while freedom of speech applies to Twitter, ""that is not the same as arguing that those public tweets are protected."" ""There can be no reasonable expectation of privacy in a tweet sent around the world,"" wrote the judge, who went on to compare information posted on a public network to an eyewitness's account of a crime on the street. In a smart bit of timing, Twitter on Monday released its first Twitter Transparency Report, detailing requests from governments around the world to get user information or suppress tweets during the first half of 2012. There have been 849 requests for information so far this year (for 1,181 individual Twitter accounts) -- more than during all of 2011, the report said. The United States leads the charge, with 679 requests for information, and Twitter says it provided at least some of the requested data 75% of the time. Japan comes in second place with 98 information requests, and the UK and Canada tied for third with 11 requests each. Twitter is still banned in a number of countries, including China, Iran and Pakistan. When Twitter receives one of these requests, it automatically informs the user before taking any steps, unless prohibited by law, which is what it did with Harris. However, this is more of an admirable courtesy than a set-in-stone policy, since all users have already been informed that Twitter reserves the right to ""access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request."" A key issue in the Harris case that could affect similar subpoenas is determining who really owns a tweet. Harris originally filed a motion to quash the DA's subpoena himself, but Judge Sciarrino dismissed it in April because he said Harris didn't own the information being requested -- Twitter did. According to Twitter's terms of service, the user gives Twitter a ""worldwide, nonexclusive, royalty-free license"" to distribute tweets in any medium, even those that don't exist yet. In May, Twitter added a line to its terms of service clarifying that users retain their rights to their content.","A New York judge rules that tweets are public information .

"(CNN) -- ""Who do you want to see?"" asked the Salafi Jihadists holding their AK-47s at the gate. ""Hamas leaders,"" I replied. ""Why Hamas? Why not our Jihadi brothers?"" the guard asked. ""Well, Hamas are in government in Gaza."" ""They won't be in future,"" he responded. ""They have sold out and become agents of the Israelis, and in years to come we will govern Gaza. Be sure to meet our brothers here in the camp, too."" The guard then gave me directions to a safe house where someone could take me to Hamas. This was last summer. I was visiting a Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut for book research. It took me two more days to locate Hamas leadership. Inside the camp, just as in Gaza, Hamas had a wide network of schools, financiers, mosques, makeshift hospitals, readily available doctors, banking services, and support for orphans and widows. We in the West deem Hamas a terrorist organization. Yes, one part of it is committed to terrorism, killing innocent civilians in the pursuit of political aims, but we are mistaken if we continue to limit our definition by one aspect of Hamas. Unless we better understand Hamas, we cannot help halt the killings of Israelis and Arabs in the Middle East. Hamas is not a monolith, nor is it only a terrorist group: It is a social movement, with a mass membership, a popular message of resistance that resonates across the Muslim world, and a political party with which we must negotiate. ""When the Israelis were fighting Yasser Arafat and the PLO, the Arabs were losing,"" the Hamas leader -- whose name I must withhold -- told me. ""We saw them abandon anti-aircraft missiles here in Beirut in the 1980s. But now, with Hezbollah and Hamas, we fight to die, to kill. We believe in martyrdom. We don't flee from the battlefield."" To my Hamas hosts, Israel's operation in Lebanon in 2006, or its attack on Gaza in 2009, were huge victories. ""We are now winning. We fight Israel and want to fight again and again."" This strong belief that they are victorious is in itself a loss for Israel: It has failed to weaken Hamas. Fighting and killing have been a curse to Israel's existence over the last six decades. The trajectory has been to make Israel weaker and more hated around the world; to popularize the ideology of radicalism amid Muslims and fuel anti-Americanism in the Middle East. Israel cannot kill itself into security or survival. It must learn the language of peace and co-existence. For how much longer will we in the West continue to damage our own standing in the nearly 2 billion-strong Muslim world as our ally Israel delivers dead children and destroyed schools to Muslim television screens? Israel killed Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004, along with several bodyguards, and then his successors, promising us that this would help reduce violence and terror. Almost a decade later, Hamas is not only strong and vibrant, in government since 2007, but lobbing rockets at Jerusalem and kidnapping Israeli soldiers. In short, Hamas is strong and growing psychologically stronger, while Israel has failed to achieve its peace and security. Worse, contrary to what many believed, Hamas was not weakened when Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy, a supporter, was toppled in July 2013. Morsy made many mistakes, but President Obama's telephone calls to him helped bring Hamas to the table and secure a cease-fire in 2012 much sooner. Israel does not deserve all the blame. Arab political and religious leaders, despite historic grievances, have a duty to recognize that Israel is their neighbor. Israel is part of the mosaic of the modern Middle East. A change in tone and tenor and a public embrace of Israel by religious leaders will calm the nerves of an anxious Israeli population. In the end, Israel has limited options. Peace is not possible without Hamas, and Hamas is not a simple terrorist outfit. Its political arm, its leadership inside and outside Gaza, despite their tensions, are open to indirect talks with Israel. Just as the British and American governments negotiated peace in Northern Ireland by reaching out to IRA terrorists through their political wing of Sinn Fein, we must tame Hamas through politics, not the failed strategy of war. Hamas and Islamic Jihad were among the Palestinian groups that met in Cairo Sunday and reached a 72-hour humanitarian cease-fire agreement brokered by Egyptian officials. Here, the European Union and the United States can work through Fatah, Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and negotiate along the 2002 Arab peace plan suggested by Saudi Arabia. Hamas must be brought in. Almost 2 million people in Gaza need our support. If we fail to bring in Hamas and create a sustained peace that leads to prosperity for Palestinians and Israelis, then we must prepare for an enemy who is worse: Salafi Jihadis. And with Gaza, the popularity of the Salafi Jihadi message will spread far and wide. My guard at the refugee camp insisted I speak with his brothers-in-arms. I did not, but I fear he might be right. Will Israel help itself and us, or hinder?","Ed Husain: Hamas is not just terror group: It has schools, banks, mosques, doctors .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Monday nominated Gen. Martin Dempsey, the relatively new Army chief of staff, to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The term of the current chairman, Adm. Michael Mullen, ends in September. Obama also nominated Adm. James Winnefeld, the current head of the U.S. Northern Command, to serve as vice chairman. He tapped Gen. Ray Odierno to replace Dempsey as the Army's chief of staff. The president, speaking at the White House, urged the Senate to confirm the three men ""as swiftly as possible"" in order to help ensure a ""seamless"" Pentagon transition. Who is Gen. Martin Dempsey? Obama praised Dempsey as one of the country's most ""respected and combat-tested generals."" ""I expect him to push all our forces to keep adapting and innovating,"" Obama said. ""We will provide what it takes to achieve our objectives in the current fight."" Outgoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates released a statement praising Dempsey, Winnefeld, and Odierno for having ""excelled in key command and staff roles"" and possessing ""the right mix of intellectual heft, moral courage, and strategic vision."" If confirmed by the Senate, Dempsey would be in the key position of being Obama's senior military adviser overseeing the drawdown of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He would also work with incoming Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who still needs to be confirmed by the Senate, in establishing priorities for cutting defense spending. Dempsey has extensive combat experience. He served as the commander of the 1st Armored Division in Baghdad in 2003, and then helped train Iraqi security forces in a subsequent tour of duty in Iraq. He also has served as acting commander of the U.S. Central Command overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East, Persian Gulf and Central Asia. The selection of Dempsey is unusual partly because he took over as head of the Army only on April 11. In that brief period of time, Dempsey has earned strong praise for what is considered to be his outgoing personality. Among other things, the general receives a list of soldiers both in the United States and overseas every week and calls them to get their direct opinions on life in the Army. He spent last Friday in Washington meeting with children who have lost parents and other relatives in war-time military service. He has also gained attention for his long-standing habit of beginning some of his public speaking events by singing songs such as ""New York, New York."" On his Facebook page he recently asked troops to offer their suggestions for music he could play at events where he is speaking. Dempsey's sense of humor has opened him up for some ribbing as well, like at the ceremony when he took command of the Army. ""His rise to this great height is yet another one of those classic American immigrant success stories,"" said Army Secretary John McHugh during official remarks. ""One can only imagine how different his life might have been had his family not decided to leave New Jersey and move across the river to New York state."" Gen. James Cartwright, a four-star Marine who currently is vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, had been the perceived front runner to replace Mullen. But in a 30-minute meeting with Obama before the president left for his recent trip to Europe, Cartwright was told he would not get the job, according to a Defense Department official with direct knowledge of the meeting. The official declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of discussing White House personnel meetings involving the president. Cartwright is now expected to submit his retirement papers and conclude his term as vice chairman as scheduled in early August. Cartwright had long been considered a White House favorite, but had run afoul of other senior officers inside the Pentagon who felt he more than once went behind their backs in offering the president military recommendations and advice on a range of issues, including lower troop levels in Afghanistan. The Defense Department official who is familiar with Cartwright's thinking says the general was aware of these criticisms, and only offered recommendations when asked by the president. ""There was an impression created he wasn't a team player,"" said the official, who was offering a defense of Cartwright's actions . ""Gen. Cartwright never believed he was a deputy. He believed he had a legal and moral obligation to give the president his best military advice,"" the source said. ""He is not obligated to provide the same advice as everybody else."" The official acknowledged the widespread view many had, however, that Cartwright plays his cards close to the vest inside the Pentagon and often shared little with colleagues about his real thinking. The official also noted that neither Gates nor Mullen had recommended Cartwright for the job as chairman, which meant his nomination by the White House would have been difficult to justify to Congress. Spokesmen for both declined to publicly comment on any aspect of the chairmanship issue. Cartwright had also been the subject of an investigation by the department's inspector general over whistleblower allegations of improper conduct with a junior female officer who fell asleep intoxicated in his hotel room during a business trip. He was cleared of wrongdoing by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, but the official said Cartwright felt he was the still the subject of a ""whispering campaign"" after that. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Obama nominates Gen. Martin Dempsey as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .

"(CNN) -- Millions of people are suffering in the drought-ravaged Horn of Africa, but help is on the way thanks to relief groups from around the world. One of them, Mary's Meals, is focused on the youngest victims of the crisis.

How have you seen the situation evolve? Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow: We've been working in northern Kenya for about four years now. We've been feeding several thousand children in nursery schools. Over the last two or three years, we've seen the situation ... worsen steadily because of the lack of rains. It's become harder and harder for parents there to feed their children. Most of their animals, which they depend completely on, have now died. We have a real crisis, a real situation of life and death facing those people and children. Because of that, we are trying desperately to expand our program to reach more children at risk, and we will do that as funds allow us to. We've already grown the program to reach a further 6,000 children every day during this period. And we will stay committed to feeding those children as long as this current crisis remains. We are all hoping desperately the rains will come in October, but there is no guarantee of that. Berger: How has the drought impacted people there, beyond the need for food and water? MacFarlane-Barrow: The plight of the people is just desperate. Some of the mothers of the children we fed in Turkana, recently ... crossed over the border into Ethiopia to barter the beautiful necklaces that they make. ... On their way back from doing that, having got food for their children, they were ambushed by a neighboring tribe with which they'd been in conflict for many years. Around 40 or 50 women lost their lives. Berger: As someone who works every day to save impoverished children, how does a situation like this make you feel? MacFarlane-Barrow: The pictures that we see on television of the suffering in the Horn of Africa, it just fills you with horror and shame really that that's happening today: in our world of plenty, our children are still starving to death. And, I'm sure like so many people, my desire is just to do something about that -- to do whatever we can do to save the lives of those children. And, at the same time, to build something better and help those communities escape from reliance on aid and escape from these situations in the future. Berger: What changes have you seen for Mary's Meals since you were recognized at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" last year? MacFarlane-Barrow: Many new people have made contact with us from all over the world, wanting to be part of Mary's Meals, wanting to help us provide daily meals for children in schools. That's resulted in lots more support and ultimately allowed us to feed many more of the world's hungriest children. I think at the time of the show last year, we were feeding around 460,000 every day. That figure now has risen to around 560,000 ... (in) places like Malawi and Liberia and Haiti. We are now providing meals in West Africa also. The whole focus and mission of Mary's Meals is about meeting the immediate needs of the hungry child by providing them a meal in a place of education -- so that we draw them into our schools or nurseries in the belief that education can be their ladder out of poverty. On average, we can feed a child for an entire school year for $15. In (Malawi and Liberia), we are rolling out a program in primary schools to reach hundreds of thousands more children. And it's wonderful to watch in both those countries how many children are coming to school for the first time because of those daily meals.

"Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o became the new Hollywood ""It Girl"" after she played the object of cruel affection in the movie, ""12 Years a Slave."" Since her role as Patsey in the movie released last year, she's made rounds in fashion magazines, hobnobbed with celebrities and is considered a breakout star. As the awards season begins, here are 10 things to know about the statuesque actress with a flashy smile and almost flawless fashion sense. She straddles many worlds: Nyong'o was born in Mexico when her Kenyan parents were in political exile. Her family later returned to Kenya, where she spent most of her childhood. Her first name, she says, is  the short version of the word ""Guadalupe."" She later went to the United States, where she got her undergraduate degree from Hampshire College in  Massachusetts, and later graduated from Yale School of Drama in 2012. She has a connection to Obama: Nyong'o is a Luo, the same tribe as President Barack Obama's father. She's multilingual: In addition to English and her native Luo, the actress speaks Spanish, Swahili and conversational Italian. She's been a star-crossed lover: Her first big acting break came when she was 14 and played Juliet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" at a Kenyan theater. ""That was amazing ... since before that I had been a village girl at a school show,"" she tells Arise Entertainment 360. ""I just came to life on stage, I just loved it so much."" She's also a TV star:  Before her big movie debut, Nyong'o was a regular on the Kenyan television series ""Shuga."" The series, produced by MTV, was a hip portrayal of contemporary Kenyan youth aimed at spreading HIV awareness. It was so popular, it later aired in various African nations. This is not her first brush with an international movie: As an undergraduate, Nyong'o worked on the production crew of ""The Constant Gardener,"" starring  Ralph Fiennes. The movie, filmed in Kenya, became a turning point for her. Fiennes made her realize her passion when he told her to only get into acting if she feels that she can't live without it. ""It's not what I wanted to hear, but it's what I needed to hear,"" she says. She's had her signature crop for years: Before settling for her trademark short hair, Nyong'o went through the usual hustles of finding a hairstyle that works for her. ""I got fed up of going to the hair salon. I just wanted less time grooming so that I could get more stuff done."" At age 19, she shaved off her hair. ""It was so liberating,"" she says. She had to go deep for her role:  Nyong'o gives an emotional, raw performance in ""12 Years a Slave,"" a movie set in the pre-Civil War United States. It's a story about Solomon Northup, a free black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery. Their tyrannical master has an unhealthy obsession with Patsey, her character. Suicidal, she copes by working harder than everyone else in the cotton fields and  forming a close relationship with Solomon. She's an awards darling: Her intense role as Patsey has earned her rave reviews and a slew of nominations. They include best supporting actress for the Oscars and Golden Globes and Critics' Choice movie awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a supporting role. You've not seen the last of her:  Her next movie, ""Non-Stop,"" features Liam Neeson and comes out on February 28.","Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o is in the movie, '12 Years a Slave'

"The most persistent holiday health myths are based on kernels of truth. Here are often-repeated adages and why they're off the mark. Myth 1: You gain massive weight during holidays. Between Thanksgiving's turkey, heaps of holiday cookies and weeks of parties, you're bound to gain some extra padding over the holidays, right? People tend to gain weight -- about one to two pounds on average, according to several studies. So holiday weight gain may not be as dramatic as it sounds. Before giving yourself license to eat whatever you want this week, do the math: One or two pounds a year can add up quickly. And that one to two pounds is likely only if you're a person with a normal body mass index. If you're overweight or obese, the weight gained is more likely to increase  -- up to five pounds. -- Children gain about 1.2 pounds during the holiday break, according to a 2010 study published in Clinical Medicine & Research. But they also grew about 0.32 inches, which decreased their body mass index by 0.04%. When researchers analyzed their findings among the 90 kids, they found that the overweight and obese kids gained significantly more weight and BMI units than children with normal BMIs. -- During the six weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's, adults gained about 0.8 pounds, according to a 2000 study published in Nutrition Review. In the study, 14% of overweight and obese individuals gained more than five pounds during the holiday.  In the abstract, the researchers wrote, ""holiday weight gain may be an important contributor to the rising prevalence of obesity, even though absolute values for weight gain in this study were less than anticipated."" Tyler Graham, co-author of  ""The Happiness Diet"" said non-holidays are more important. ""The big problem is what people are eating day in and day out,"" he said.  ""People are getting obese and it's from that day-to-day diet. There are some estimates that Americans drink 600 sodas a year."" What you eat when it isn't Thanksgiving or Christmas ""plays a much bigger role than your holiday eating,"" Graham said. Essentially, holiday weight gain occurs, but in small increments that can add up over the years. Myth 2: Suicides increase during the holidays. The notion that suicides increase during the holidays is widespread.  Maybe we've watched too much ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Dr. Rachel Vreeman, assistant professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, regularly examines widely held notions about health. She and colleague Aaron Carroll have written books about common medical myths -- ""Don't Swallow Your Gum! Myths, Half-Truths, and Outright Lies about your Body and Health"" and ""Don't Cross Your Eyes ... They'll Get Stuck That Way!"" Back in medical school, Vreeman and Carroll had heard about suicides increasing during the holidays. ""It's often what we heard,"" she said. ""Many of our holidays are in the cold, dark winter months. It made sense that people commit suicide. The holidays might be depressing if you lost a loved one, you're disappointed, and things aren't matching up to expectation. ""Although it's a popular assumption, it's not true."" Vreeman and Carroll have published two articles on medical myths in BMJ. They looked through studies that examined suicide trends throughout the years. One study from Japan during the 1970s to 1990s found lower rates of suicide before the holidays. A U.S. study examining 35 years of data showed no increase in suicides before, during or after the holidays. ""It's interesting to realize that's a myth,"" Vreeman said. ""I always want to say we take very seriously people who are having suicidal thoughts. It doesn't mean it's possible that someone commits suicide. We should take it seriously."" At the same time, the statistics show that people aren't committing suicide on the holidays as much as the perception. ""It completely goes against what we would predict,"" she said. ""There are peaks of suicide in the warmer months, and they are fewer in the winter. It's true around the world, which is an interesting thing to think about."" -- For suicide prevention and help contact the 24-hour telephone line by the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. Myth 3: The most dangerous day to drive in the U.S. is New Year's Eve. Lots of people will toast the new year, drink and then drive. But New Year's Eve is not the most dangerous day for traffic fatalities. According to a report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a nonprofit funded by auto insurers, the most dangerous day for drivers is July 4. The group looked at deaths in auto crashes from 2005 to 2009. July 4 topped the list with 144 average deaths. It was followed by September 2 -- around Labor Day -- August 13, July 15, May 20 and November 11. New Year's ranked No. 7, with 130 average deaths. The AAA Foundation also reached similar conclusions. In its analysis of 2000 and 2009 data, more people died in motor vehicle crashes on July 4 than any other day of the year, according to its press release. But there is a grain of truth in drunken-driving dangers on New Year's. While the IIHS tallied total auto-related deaths, AAA looked at a subset of deaths -- specifically drunk driving-related deaths.  In that category, New Year's Day had the highest number of deaths in one day for deaths related to driving under the influence, according to AAA. It's also the most deadly day to be a pedestrian. According to a 2005 article in the journal Injury Prevention, New Year's Day had more pedestrian deaths than Halloween -- largely due to alcohol.  In a study examining data from 1986 to 2002, 58% of pedestrians who died had high alcohol levels in their blood. January 1 might not be the most dangerous day to drive, but it could be the most dangerous day to walk.","Holiday weight gain is usually 1-2 pounds; more for overweight people .

"Claiming that even the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is air conditioned, prisoners in Texas have filed a federal lawsuit over soaring temperatures in state prisons that they say have killed at least 12 prisoners in the last three years. The suit, filed by the Texas Civil Rights Project and the University of Texas School of Law Civil Rights clinic on behalf of the prisoners, isn't seeking monetary damages. It seeks cooler temperatures for the prisoners. Eighty-eight degrees to be exact. The lawsuit, broadly concerned about the lack of air conditioning across state facilities, centers on a facility in Navasota, Texas, known as the Wallace Pack Unit. Located about 70 miles northwest of Houston, the facility houses about 1,400 men. As of January, the compliant said, 114 men over the age of 70 were housed there. They have no air conditioning, and the windows which do open provide little relief, the suit claims, leading to temperatures inside that often exceed those outside. And outside it's hot. The suit cites internal data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice which found that over the past three years the mercury topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit. ""Stainless steel tables in the inmate dormitories become hot to the touch"" the complaint reads and ""prisoners have to lay towels down on the table to rest their elbows while sitting."" In addition to the older inmates, the complaint said a number of men have various underlying medical conditions that make them especially vulnerable to heat stroke, like 69-year-old Marvin Yates, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. ""I don't know if I will make it this summer. The heat and humidity are so bad inside I have trouble breathing,"" said Yates, one of three named plaintiffs, in a press release announcing the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges some 20 deaths since 1998 and details names, ages and internal body temperatures of the victims, including cases where the body temperature recorded was well over 100 degrees. One man, 45-year-old Rodney Adams, died one day after his arrival. His internal temperature registered 109.9. There is air conditioning in some parts of the facility. The law library, education building and visitation center all are equipped with air conditioning, according to the complaint, but the inmates are ""rarely allowed"" in these areas. The complaint also said that the warden's office and other administrative buildings have air conditioning. County prisons also have air conditioning. Texas statute mandates those jails keep temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees inside, but the state system, according to the complaint, has no such requirement. The lawsuit alleges the conditions violate federal law and the inmate's constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment. Men treated worse than pigs? The lawsuit alleges that hogs on Texas Department of Criminal Justice property receive better treatment than the prisoners. ""TDCJ policy requires temperatures be kept no higher than 85 degrees to ensure 'pig comfort,'"" the suit said, adding that the department begins ""to cool the pigs when the temperature goes above 74 degrees to keep the pigs 'comfortable.'"" Jason Clark, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said the department couldn't comment on pending legislation. But he did spell out what the agency does to ""mitigate temperature extremes."" The agency provides water and allows for additional showers ""when feasible."" Clark also said the staff is trained to identify ""offenders susceptible to heat-related issues."" Guards not immune . But according to the complaint the staff may also need to identify heat-related issues for one another, since they also have to go into the hot rooms of the prison. ""The correctional officer's union has made numerous public requests for the prison housing areas to be air conditioned,"" the complaint said, detailing one female guard who suffered heat exhaustion and dehydration. The plaintiffs said the situation has led to the correctional officer's union lending public support to the suit. Clark said the department doesn't have the money to make changes, conceding ""a detailed cost analysis has not been done.""","Prisoners don't want monetary damages; they want prisons cooled to 88 degrees .

"U.S. law enforcement views the case of three teenage Colorado girls who wanted to join ISIS as a good opportunity to study how the militant group recruits young people in the West, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN. Investigators have studied Twitter and other social media activities of the Colorado girls, particularly the eldest, who was active online discussing her gradual turn to conservative Islam. The case has yielded a trove of evidence that shows how ISIS is using Westerners already among its fold to directly communicate with new recruits via social media, the officials said. The FBI is homing in on specific online recruiters, including some believed to be in Turkey, and others in Syria and Iraq. These recruiters help provide how-to guides for Westerners who are inclined to travel and join the ISIS fight, the officials said. A law enforcement official said the recruiters were giving the teenage girls a road map of how to make it from Denver to Syria. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? ""It's alarming that American youths are being radicalized to such a degree they're willing to jump into the great unknown,"" one official said. Even after identifying those recruiters, however, the next step remains difficult: trying to find a way to arrest them. Most are thought to be out of reach of U.S. law enforcement. Last month, a girl of Sudanese descent and two girls of Somali descent skipped school in the Denver area and flew to Germany with plans to continue to Turkey,  authorities said. The girls, 17, 15 and 15, wanted to join ISIS, the militant Islamist group, authorities said. One of their parents noticed his daughter's passport missing and contacted authorities, who stopped the three girls in Germany and sent them back to the United States. About 2,000 Westerners have gone to fight in Syria, though not all for ISIS, a CIA source told CNN last month. ISIS recruitment efforts have posed a challenge to the FBI and other agencies trying to find a way to stop such recruitment. Unlike past radicalization cases, the FBI hasn't found a U.S. recruitment network connecting ISIS to recruits. Instead they're finding, as in the Colorado case, more diffuse connections. Was arrested teen on his way to join ISIS? U.S. officials said friends of the Colorado teens noticed them change from seemingly carefree westernized high-schoolers to devout Muslims who rejected old friends and the regular cares of girls their age. But no one called attention to it until after the girls disappeared and became the subject of news stories. Officials said that while these teens decided to travel ""on their own,"" and were not forced into anything, this case reflects the larger phenomenon of American teens being lured to fight with ISIS through social media. UK spy chief Robert Hannigan has said ISIS and other extremist groups use such platforms as Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to reach their target audience in a language they understand, . Their methods include making use of popular hashtags for other stories in the news, such as Ebola or the World Cup, to disseminate their message, he said. They create slick videos and have learned that showing the full extent of their brutality turns people off, he said, hence their posting of videos of beheadings that stop short of showing the moment of death.

"Same-sex couples can marry in Arkansas, but can't yet do the same in Idaho, thanks to a pair of court rulings Thursday. The Arkansas case is an entirely in-state matter, involving a local county court and the state's Supreme Court. But it's similar to a spate of federal rulings in recent months because the initial ruling that kicked off the process knocked down Arkansas law barring same-sex marriages. Twenty-one gay and lesbian couples were part of a group of plaintiffs challenging Amendment 83 to the Arkansas Constitution, saying it violated their federal and state rights of equal protection and privacy. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza ruled last Friday in those couples' favor. But after his decision, it wasn't clear whether some same-sex couples could begin getting married immediately. The state Supreme Court weighed in Wednesday, ruling ""the court's order is not final, and we have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal."" The same court denied the state's motion for an emergency stay of Piazza's ruling. Piazza issued what he called a ""final order"" on Thursday, in lieu of the Arkansas Supreme Court ruling. On the same day, he issued another document saying ""this court ... cannot in good conscience grant"" the state's request for an immediate stay of his decision. ""Constitutional violations are routinely recognized as triggering irreparable harm unless they are promptly remedied,"" Piazza wrote, adding that ""there is no evidence"" those pushing to continue the state's same-sex marriage ban ""will be harmed,"" but those trying to overturn the prohibition will suffer. The Pulaski Circuit/County Clerk posted links to Piazza's orders on its website. The same office tweeted Thursday afternoon, soon after the latest rulings: ""The Pulaski Circuit and County Clerk's Office is open for business and we are issuing marriage licenses to all qualified applicants."" CNN affiliate KARK reported the clerk was then issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. It was not clear what was occurring in other Arkansas counties. A federal judge moved Idaho in that same direction on Tuesday, ruling that state's laws violated the U.S. Constitution because they ""deny its gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental right to marry and relegate their families to a stigmatized, second-class status without sufficient reason for doing so."" While U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Wagahoff Dale's decision striking down Idaho's same-sex marriage ban was clear, it didn't take effect right away. She stated it would become law at 9 a.m. Friday. That's where the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came in, with three judges signing onto a one-line ruling putting off Dale's decision from going into effect -- at least for now. The appeals judges ruled that Dale's ruling ""is temporarily stayed pending this court's disposition of appellants' emergency motions for a stay pending appeal."" Thursday's decision from the 9th Circuit appeals court prevents a repeat of what happened in Utah and Michigan, where federal judges similarly struck down those states' same-sex marriage bans effectively immediately.  Higher courts later stayed those decisions on appeal, but not before some same-sex couples married. Same-sex couples marry in Michigan before court halts licenses . In recent months, federal judges have found restrictions limiting marriage to one man and one woman to be unconstitutional in several other states. But those rulings didn't take effect immediately, having been stayed as appeals courts and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court weigh in.

"Homicide rates in Central America and the Caribbean are nearing a ""crisis point,"" according to a United Nations report. Across Central America, homicide rates have increased in five out of eight countries over the past five years, with Honduras seeing homicide rates more than double between 2005 and 2010. Mexico saw a 65% increase over the same period. Homicide rates have also surged  in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Dominican Republic. ""Organized crime -- especially drug trafficking -- accounted for a quarter of deaths caused by firearms in the Americas, compared to only 5% of homicides in Asia and Europe,"" the report says.  ""That does not mean, however, that organized crime groups are not active in those two regions, but rather that they may be operating in ways that do not employ lethal violence to the same extent."" More than four in 10 homicides were committed with firearms, according to the report.  Gun crime is driving violence in Central America and the Caribbean. The U.N. report estimates the total number of homicides globally at 468,000 people in 2010 -- 36% took place in Africa, 31% in the Americas and 27% in Asia.  Europe and Oceania combined account for less than 6% of all homicides. ""Globally, some 80% of homicide victims and perpetrators are men,"" the report says. ""But, whereas men are more likely to be killed in a public places, women are mainly murdered at home,"" according to the report.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid returned to the top of the table in Spain after edging past Racing Santander 1-0 on Saturday, while previous leaders Barcelona could only draw 1-1 at Athletic Bilbao. Real, still missing the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and with veteran talisman Raul starting on the bench, dominated struggling Santander but had only a solitary first-half strike from Gonzalo Higuain to show for it. The visitors should have snatched a point, but Sergio Canales saw his 77th minute effort wrongly ruled out for an offside by a teammate who was not in the line of play. Real, whose last home outing ended in an embarrassing exit from the Copa Del Rey against lower-league opposition, saw midfielder Xabi Alonso hit the post in the 13th minute and then defender Alvaro Arbeloa also hit the woodwork with a floated cross. Argentina forward Higuain, who started in place of Raul, kept up his good goalscoring form in the 22nd minute when he pounced from close range after Kaka's right-wing cross was not cleared. Karim Benzema thought he had doubled the lead in the 55th minute, but the France forward's effort was correctly ruled out for a marginal offside before he made way for Raul. The result lifted some of the pressure piling up on Real coach Manuel Pellegrini, who has a big week ahead with Wednesday's Champions league clash against FC Zurich and then the ""El Clasico"" battle with Barcelona on Sunday. Real will go into that match at the Nou Camp with a one-point lead over Barca, who were missing the swine flu-stricken Rafael Marquez, Yaya Toure and Eric Abidal and the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the trip to Bilbao. Lionel Messi inspired the Spanish and European champions' best moments in the first half, with Thierry Henry left on the bench following his controversial handball incident in France's World Cup playoff win against the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday. But it was the Basque side who should have taken the lead on the stroke of halftime when Javier Martinez headed a golden chance wide when it seemed easier to score. Barcelona took the lead in the 54th minute when Xavi threaded a superb pass to Dani Alves and the Brazilian fullback coolly slotted in the opening goal. However, that lead lasted only nine minutes as substitute Gaizka Toquero ghosted in behind Alves to collect his teammate's headed flick-on and calmly sidefoot high into the net. Henry was finally brought on by coach Pep Guardiola in the 84th minute, but Barcelona could not penetrate the stubborn Bilbao defense, with the home side left in seventh place after a hard-earned point. Barcelona next take on Italian champions Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday, needing a result to keep alive their hopes of reaching the knockout stages. Sevilla consolidated third place after holding on to win 2-1 at Tenerife. Diego Perotti put the visitors ahead in the 32nd minute with a close-range finish from a cross by new Spain cap Jesus Navas, who almost gave away a penalty three minutes into the second half when Marc Valiente went down. Sevilla immediately counter-attacked and midfielder Renato crashed in a shot from the edge of the area after being set up by fellow Brazilian Luis Fabiano. Striker Nino gave Tenerife hope with a superb volley 15 minutes from the end, but Sevilla defended well to earn the three points. Atletico Madrid crashed to a third straight defeat under new coach Quique Sanchez Flores, losing 2-1 at Deportivo La Coruna after Andres Guardado's dramatic last-minute penalty. Argentina striker Sergio Aguero put Atletico ahead after just three minutes, but Diego Colotto leveled the score on 20 and Guardado kept his cool at the death after Pablo brought down Alberto Lopo. Sanchez Flores raced onto the pitch as Atletico protested furiously, resulting in Cleber Santana being sent off.","Real Madrid return to top of table in Spain after beating Racing Santander 1-0 .

"The Facebook page ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" has existed since 2010 with a modest audience of some 2,000 people who follow it for news and conversations along with the occasional encouraging image of a breast-feeding mother. Over the weekend, the page shared a picture of a woman breast-feeding at her graduation, prompting a chorus of social media cheers and jeers. While much of the reaction has focused on whether the picture is appropriate, the women behind ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" say its message is lost in the social media chatter. ""It's important for black women to see other black women breast-feeding,"" said Nicole Sandiford, who started ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" in 2010 as a blog and Facebook group. ""Seeing other black women breast-feeding provides a sense of broad community and support for those who are trying to do it."" If that sounds weird to you, look no further than a recent post on the Facebook page asking, ""If someone tried to talk you out of breast-feeding, what were their reasons?"" Comments vary from, ""My mom said that's what poor people did in the old days"" to ""You won't make enough milk"" or ""It's something that white people do."" That wasn't Sandiford's experience growing up in a black family outside of the United States, where it wasn't unusual to see women breast-feed openly in public. She remembers seeing her mother breast-feed her sister and knew that one day she, too, would breast-feed her children. When she turned to the Internet in 2009 for support after her son's birth, she noticed that most images and personal stories did not include black women. Or, when conversations included black women, they focused on how they breast-feed at lower rates than other racial groups. ""I said to myself, 'Hmm, we seem to be missing from this broader conversation,' "" said Sandiford, a married mother of two in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""But, as I went through my life, I knew black women who were breast-feeding, including me. I thought one thing I can do to broaden the conversation is collect stories of black women who are breast-feeding."" Georgia mother Shlonda Smith also breast-fed her five children, but somewhere along the way, a friend said to her ""you're the only black women I know who breast-feeds,"" remember Smith, who joined ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" as a co-administrator in late 2013. ""It became important to me to see other black women breast-feed and make it visible that yes, black women do breast-feed,"" Smith said. On the Facebook page, links to news articles and studies garnered a few likes here and there, but things took a turn a few weeks ago when Smith posted an image of a woman breast-feeding. More women sent pictures for Smith to post and engagement increased, hitting a high with a split image of a woman breast-feeding alongside a picture of pop star Rihanna in a see-through dress. It included the caption, ""Why is it OK for a star to wear this but for me to breastfeed it's a problem."" Karlesha Thurman decided to post the photo of herself breast-feeding her child while wearing her graduation cap and gown in the comments of that photo. It immediately got more attention than any other post ever on the page, Smith said, who could relate to being a young mom finishing college. ""It was just beautiful; it just spoke volumes,"" Smith said. ""Breast-feeding is tough at the beginning, so to see a young mom who balanced breast-feeding and school, that's amazing."" But on social media and in other areas, Thurman saw some backlash. Smith offered to take the photo down, but Thurman refused. ""I found out I was pregnant my last year of college, had my daughter one week into my last semester, she was my motivation to keep going, so me receiving my BA was OUR moment,"" Thurman said, according to a post on the page. ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" also received negative comments about its name and its focus on black women. It also received new support -- the audience climbed to more than 7,000 by Wednesday afternoon. Sandiford spoke with CNN about breast-feeding, race and how ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" has grown to accommodate a diverse audience. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . CNN: Why is the group named ""Black Women Do Breastfeed""? Sandiford: I named it ""Black Women Do Breastfeed"" so that people could be aware that there is community of black women who do breast-feed and who are interested in breast-feeding and want to share their experiences. One of the things I used to do when I was looking online for information about breast-feeding is put in search ""black women breast-feed,"" and I figured if I named it something like that, it would come up in searches. The name is not there to exclude anyone because from the very start, we've had women and men of varying races express interest in being on the page, but black women need advocacy in this area as well. That doesn't exclude women from joining the advocacy, it just recenters the conversation. In addition to making black women breast-feeding more visible, we've made women who felt like they were the only ones doing it realize they're not alone. We made women who may not have previously breast-fed their children see this community of women. There are women in this country who may be the first generation in their family to breast-feed. They may be the only women in their community who breast-feed, and that makes it difficult to find support. CNN: How does sharing pictures of women breast-feeding contribute to this goal? Sandiford: In the U.S., even though we do have breast-feeding, it's not seen as a common thing. It's not really something you necessarily see walking down the street. For black women who don't know other women who breast-feed in their community, it is important to see that is happening. CNN: Why do you think this image went viral? Sandiford: I think people were impressed that this young woman was able to graduate while taking care of a young infant. Because people are not used to seeing breast-feeding in public in this country, we tend to get really nervous or scared or unsure or outright offended because many of us are not used to seeing breasts in that context. But, I think it's important that photos like this are out there because women need to be able to breast-feed their babies and sometimes it needs to happen in public. Babies need to eat, and they can't control other people's feelings. I think it's important that people remember this is about feeding a baby, and we as nation need to figure out how to manage our own personal feelings and allow women and babies to breast-feed as they need to. CNN: How have you handled the reaction on your page? Sandiford: When it comes to social media, you will always see detractors, you will always see people who disagree. But I think it's good to remember that for each of those detractors, there are more people saying 'We support her, and we don't see anything wrong with this.' We've been very heartened by the positive comments we've seen, and we've definitely seen a lot more positive than negative ones. For us, we've tried not to fan the flames because we don't want to contribute to any harm that might come, and we certainly hope there isn't any so we're trying to be a little bit more low-key. We are assessing how we want to manage pictures in the future. We don't want to discourage anyone who has pictures they want to share from doing so, but right now, our main concern is that women featured in pictures won't fear any harm from sharing them. CNN: Do you think the reaction would've been different if a white woman had appeared in the picture? Sandiford: It's really hard for me to say, but I think that maybe certain assumptions might not have been made if the person in the picture was not black because we've had people questioning her devotion to her studies, questioning her lifestyle and just making slanderous comments. It's really difficult to say, but I do think the reaction might have been a little different. As a new parent, did you feel encouraged to breastfeed -- or discouraged?

"Why it's so difficult to solve America's gun problem can somewhat be explained within 20 seconds of the 17th episode of ""The Family Guy's"" eighth season. Brian and Stewie are trapped in a bank vault and after some silly banter, which leads to a ridiculous scuffle, Stewie ends up grabbing a gun and pointing it at Brian: . Brian: Look, Stewie, c'mon you don't know how to use that thing. Stewie: Oh really? What if I hold it sideways like a black guy. Brian: Whoa whoa, c'mon man, take it easy, all right? I don't want any trouble. It's the typical, racially charged bit of satire that defines the animated series, with the added irony being that holding a gun sideways is actually more of a sign of not knowing ""how to use that thing"" than holding it correctly. That's because aiming and thus hitting your target is harder with a side grip. Nonetheless, since the mid-1990s pantomiming holding a gun sideways has been the default pose struck by the misinformed who want to appear intimidating and/or cool. Each time a gun rights advocate talks about the Second Amendment and hunting, I think about the sheep holding their guns to the side. When it comes to the conversation on guns, we must remember one size does not fit all. There are at least two Americas, and one of them is likely populated with folks imitating fictional characters in gangster movies -- unaware that, reportedly, film directors instructed actors to hold the prop that way so they could capture the face and the gun in the same frame. It's all Hollywood. Pretend. Except for the tens of thousands who are wounded or killed each year in our city streets. Sadly, that's all too real. And by city streets I mean where predominantly blacks and Latinos live. Pretending the weekly gun violence that grips places such as Chicago and Baltimore doesn't run along racial lines is counterproductive. Just as grouping mass school shootings perpetrated by the mentally ill with gang violence is counterproductive. Each time we link an Adam Lanza with FBI statistics about Detroit, we move further from addressing either problem. Those who are truly concerned about the regularly underreported bloodshed in urban America must resist piggybacking the media coverage that swirls around the camera-ready anomalies like Columbine. Stewie making a joke about holding a handgun sideways has very little if anything to do with background checks or mental health care. But it does highlight the shortfalls of public education and the war on drugs. It shines a light on whom the National Rifle Association is not advocating for, as no licensed instructor would tell a student to hold the weapon that way. Instead of constantly searching for sweeping laws that approach all gun violence as one in the same, we need to recognize that the comedic bit in episode 17 of the eighth season of ""The Family Guy"" has nothing to do with Newtown. Until we get there in our talks, all we will ever have is talk.","The CNN Guns Project explores the role of guns in the United States .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A U.S. soldier is in custody in connection with the shooting deaths of two fellow soldiers and the wounding of a third in Iraq, the U.S. military said Tuesday. Spc. Neftaly Platero is in pretrial confinement, a U.S. military statement said. Platero is suspected in the deaths of Spc. John Carrillo Jr., 20, of Stockton, California, and Pfc. Gebrah P. Noonan, 26, of Watertown, Connecticut, the military said. Carrillo and Noonan died Friday of injuries sustained in a ""non-combat"" incident that occurred a day earlier, the U.S. Department of Defense said. They were assigned to 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia. The incident remains under investigation. ""Our condolences go out to the families of those service members whose lives were lost,"" Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Buchanan said in a statement. ""We are saddened by this tragic incident."" Carrillo's mother, Desiree Carrillo, told CNN that her son was a good son and a good father to a 3-year-old and a 3-month-old. ""He was a very young father and he was in school, but he joined the military to provide more for his family,"" she said. Desiree Carrillo said the military notified them of Spc. Carrillo's death on Friday after family members learned through the media their son may have been killed by another soldier. Dane Street, Noonan's former track coach, told WFSB that Noonan was loved by nearly everyone. ""His big hair matched his big personality,"" Street said. ""He loved experiencing life, and it was great."" Several people posted rest-in-peace messages on what appears to be Noonan's Facebook page. The page of ""Gebrah Noonan"" also lists ""Neftaly Platero"" -- the same name as the suspect -- as a Facebook friend. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Spc.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The son of the leader of an al Qaeda-linked militant group was killed Thursday night in a suspected U.S. drone strike in Pakistan, officials said. Muhammad Haqqani, son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, was one of the four people killed in the drone strike on a militant compound in Pakistan's tribal region in North Waziristan, according to two Pakistani intelligence sources. A Taliban source also confirmed the death. The sources asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. Muhammad Haqqani was a commander in the Haqqani network, the sources said. The Haqqani network is an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Pakistan's tribal region and is accused of targeting U.S. and international forces across the Afghanistan border. It is closely allied with the Taliban, sources say. U.S. intelligence officials have said they consider the Haqqani network one of the greatest threats to U.S. forces in Afghanistan. U.S. officials normally do not comment on suspected drone strikes, which have caused tension between Pakistan and the United States in the past. The United States is the only country in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from drones, which are controlled remotely. Journalist Nasir Dawar contributed to this report.","Muhammad Haqqani, son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, killed in Pakistan, sources say .

"Rapper Gucci Mane will serve 39 months in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to a federal firearms charge. The plea agreement worked out with prosecutors saves Gucci Mane, 33, whose real name is Radric Davis, considerable time behind bars. He was facing up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000 on two counts of possessing a firearm as a felon after a pair of September incidents in which he reportedly showed a gun and threatened police. Both came on the same week that Atlantic Records reportedly dropped his recording contract. ""On September 12, 2013, Davis, who was a felon at the time, was found in possession of a firearm,"" a federal prosecutor's news release said. ""Then, just two days later, on September 14th, he again possessed a firearm different from the earlier gun. On both occasions, Davis displayed the loaded firearm, acted erratically, and made threats to individuals, including police and his attorney."" Davis has had numerous brushes with the law. In 2012, Davis was arrested for hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta nightclub. The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper. In 2010, he was arrested in Atlanta for violating a number of traffic laws, but the charges were dismissed. In 2005, Davis was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man, but the charge was dropped because of insufficient evidence. ""The criminal history of the defendant, Radric Davis shows a complete and utter disregard for the lives of others as well as for their personal pursuits,"" Aladino Ortiz with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday. Sentencing is scheduled for July 28.","Rapper pleads guilty to a federal firearms charge .

"President Barack Obama said he has ""no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities,"" urging protesters in Ferguson to avoid a second night of violence and fight instead for longer-lasting political changes. Obama's comments Tuesday in Chicago came as the sun set in Missouri and law enforcement officers -- including 1,500 additional National Guard troops -- prepared to stop the looting and fires that followed a grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown in August. ""The frustrations that we've seen are not just about a particular incident,"" he said. ""They have deep roots in many communities of color who have a sense that our laws are not always being enforced uniformly or fairly. That may not be true everywhere and it's certainly not true for the vast majority of law enforcement officials, but that's an impression that folks have and it's not just made up -- it's rooted in realities that have existed in this country for a long time."" RELATED: King to Obama: Invite Wilson to White House . He said Monday night's protests were ""overwhelmingly peaceful,"" but said some of the images from Ferguson -- including police cars being destroyed and businesses looted -- shouldn't be tolerated. ""There are productive ways of responding and expressing those frustrations, and there are destructive ways of responding,"" Obama said. ""Burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk -- that's destructive and there's no excuse for it. Those are criminal acts. And people should be prosecuted if they engage in criminal acts."" The President's comments came at the beginning of a speech that was focused on immigration. He said he wouldn't comment on the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who shot and killed Brown. But Obama said better police training, law enforcement forces that are representative of the communities they serve and more ""makes a difference."" He promised regional meetings focused on ""building trust in our communities"" between police and residents, and vowed to work with protesters who want to make political changes. ""For the overwhelming majority of people who just feel frustrated and pained because they get a sense that maybe some communities aren't treated fairly or some individuals aren't seen as as worthy as others, I understand that and I want to work with you,"" he said. Obama tackles immigration, Ferguson at hometown rally . Obama echoed Attorney General Eric Holder, who said Tuesday afternoon that peaceful and non-violent protests have a history of forcing change in the United States, and called it ""heartening"" that some leaders of the protests tried to stop the violence that broke out Monday night. ""I really embrace those who have been proactively intervening to stop acts of violence within their midst and I encourage them to continue exercising this important leadership. I know this is not an easy thing to do,"" Holder said. The Justice Department has launched civil rights investigations into both the Brown shooting and the Ferguson Police Department's relations with minorities. Officials from the department have been in the area since August working to ease tensions between protesters and police and offering training to local law enforcement. Amid concerns about a second night of violence, Holder said the Justice Department remains in contact with leaders of the protests. He also said the department will conduct a review in the wake of Monday night ""so that we can develop strategies for identifying and isolating the criminal elements from peaceful protestors."" RELATED: 9 moments that capture the chaos in Ferguson . Before departing the White House for Chicago, Obama was briefed by Holder on both the situation in Ferguson and longer-term efforts to improve relations between citizens and police, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. Top Obama aide Valerie Jarrett spoke twice -- Monday night and Tuesday morning -- with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, and has also briefed Obama. Jarrett and Holder also held a conference call with civil rights leaders. Cabinet Secretary Broderick Johnson, meanwhile, held a call with Missouri officials to coordinate their response in Ferguson, while White House staffers discussed other cities' responses with mayors across the country. After a St. Louis County prosecutor announced that the grand jury had decided against indicting Officer Darren Wilson on Monday night, Obama said protesters' anger is ""understandable"" but urged them to remain peaceful. As he spoke, though, some of the hundreds in the streets of Ferguson had looted local stores, destroyed police cruisers and set fires -- and police responded by firing tear gas into crowds. ""I think the images that were captured last night were all the more reason the President felt compelled to go out and speak and urge calm,"" Schultz said. Obama deflected a question about whether he would visit Ferguson. Asked on Tuesday about travel to the area, Schultz said Obama would decide once ""things calm down a little bit.""

"Since 1848, Fort Bliss has been where U.S. soldiers toil, train and sweat under the strong Southwest sun before departing for battlegrounds around the world. It has also been where their loved ones grieve upon hearing the worst possible news from the war front -- including in 52 cases over eight years of fighting in Iraq. Such heart-wrenching returns from that Middle Eastern nation will soon become history. President Barack Obama announced Friday that the vast majority of the more than 39,000 U.S. troops now stationed in Iraq, including about 3,500 from Fort Bliss, ""will definitely be home for the holidays."" The decision set off shrieks and tears of joy among family members of the deployed troops. ""Everybody was yelling and screaming and clapping and crying,"" recalled Denise Young, whose husband, John, deployed in July. ""It was very emotional."" Extreme highs and lows are nothing new for military spouses like Young, who is the daughter of a 28-year Marine. Her husband -- a medic for the 4th Brigade of the 1st Armored Division, which is based at Fort Bliss -- has been in the military for five years. Young said there are plenty of headaches and heartache for her and the couple's children every time her husband sets off for such countries as Iraq and Afghanistan. Some of it stems from suddenly becoming a single parent, and then there's the looming nightmare of possibly never seeing her husband alive again. ""It's always a worry,"" Young said. ""You just have to take it one day at a time."" Like Young, Brooke Trapnell expected the day she could finally breathe -- when her husband, Tyrone, was finally back in her arms -- would come in July. That would have marked 12 months after the husband was first deployed to Iraq. Trapnell said the separation has been difficult. The rest of her family is 2,000 miles away in Pennsylvania, and she found herself forced to become ""the man and the woman of the house"" when problems, like a broken toilet, arose. She believes Obama's decision is the right one. The decision came after talks with the Iraqis about extending the U.S. troop presence broke down over the key issue of legal immunity for American military personnel.  The campaign has claimed more than 4,400 American lives and has cost upwards of $700 billion, according to the Department of Defense. ""It's been too long,"" Trapnell said. Morgan Herrera doesn't think her husband, Leonardo, should return to Iraq, either. He is a petroleum specialist who deployed for the first time in August, less than a month after arriving at Fort Bliss, which covers roughly 1.1 million acres of land in southern Texas and New Mexico. ""It's been eight years, so I feel like it's about time,"" she said of the Iraq war. Herrera added she is ""ecstatic"" that her husband should be home in time to celebrate his 21st birthday, and she is eager to cook him his favorite meal of pork chops. But she and other Fort Bliss families know, too, that while their loved ones may not head back to Iraq, that does not mean they won't face more danger. While thousands of personnel from the army base are now in Iraq, more -- about 5,000 -- are in Afghanistan. Even as her mind races at ""a million miles an hour"" in anticipation of her husband's imminent return, Young said she's trying not to lose the perspective that comes with life as a military spouse. ""It's the army,"" Young said. ""You don't know what tomorrow is going to hold. You just do the best you can."" Trapnell said that she's heard some Fort Bliss troops might go from Iraq to Kuwait and eventually end up in Afghanistan. But she said that, for now, she is trying to enjoy the fact that her husband will be home, and cannot bring herself to consider yet that he may be in harm's way again, this time in Afghanistan. ""That's not an option in my mind,"" she said.","Fort Bliss is home to the Army's 1st Armored Division and has 3,500 personnel in Iraq .

"More than three decades after the arrest of serial killer John Wayne Gacy, authorities in Chicago have launched a new effort to identify eight of his 33 victims. The Cook County Sheriff's Office says new technology has allowed it to obtain DNA profiles for the eight victims, whose remains were recovered from Gacy's house in late 1978 and early 1979 but were never identified. ""These were eight young men who had futures, and one of the most evil people to ever be on this planet destroyed their lives,"" Sheriff Thomas Dart said Wednesday. Gacy was convicted in 1980 of raping and killing 33 boys and young men he had lured into his home over a period of six years, promising them construction jobs, drugs and alcohol, or by posing as a police officer or offering money for sex. Twenty-eight of the bodies were discovered under and around Gacy's home, with most found in the 40-foot crawl space beneath the house and garage. Gacy said there were four others he had thrown into the Des Plaines River. Gacy was put to death in 1994. The latest effort to identify the eight victims began this year when the sheriff's office decided to clear dozens of the department's cold case investigations. The eight unknown Gacy victims make up the department's largest cold case, so Dart approved their exhumations in order to obtain new DNA evidence and, if possible, identify them. Authorities used the DNA samples to compile profiles of each of the eight victims. It shows that they are white males between 14 and 32 years old, and authorities have even listed the approximate dates of their disappearances. The department is now seeking family members who had a male relative go missing in the 1970s and are willing to donate a DNA sample for comparison. ""The public coming forward will allow us to do DNA matches that were not available 30 years ago,"" Dart said Wednesday. ""It's not intrusive. It's something that is very straightforward. We have hot lines, websites set up for people to contact us, and in short order, we can conduct any of the matches that need to be done."" After Gacy's arrest, authorities learned that some of his identified victims had never been reported missing, the sheriff's office said. One reason was that the victims had been estranged from their families. Another possible reason is that the relevant missing persons reports never made it to Chicago. Gacy was known to have targeted bus stations, the sheriff's office said, seeking victims who were traveling. Those interested in giving a DNA sample can contact the Cook County Sheriff's Office at 1-800-942-1950 or www.cookcountysheriff.com.","Authorities want to identify eight of John Wayne Gacy's victims .

"The production is slick. The imagery: ominous. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is out with a new video from its Al Hayat Media Center. ISIS also produced the videos of the beheadings of two American journalists and a British aid worker. It took nearly a week, but this appears to be the terror group's response to President Barack Obama's speech in which he said the U.S. objective in expanded airstrikes would be to ""degrade, and ultimately destroy"" ISIS. The President is expected to speak Wednesday about the U.S. strategy for combating ISIS, which also calls itself the ""Islamic State."" The 52-second video plays much like a trailer for an action-adventure movie. There are plenty of slow-motion explosions, and flames are shown engulfing American troops. There are cameos from President George W. Bush and his ""Mission Accomplished"" banner, along with plenty of menacing fighters with masks over their faces, ready to execute civilians. The producers even toss in a clip from Obama at the White House: ""American combat troops will not be returning to fight in Iraq,"" he says. A lingering explosion puts an exclamation point on the whole thing. And then the logo, fit for a Hollywood blockbuster: ""Flames of War -- fighting has just begun ... Coming soon."" The video fades to black. An ISIS magazine . Named after a town in northern Syria, Dabiq magazine publishes stories portending a battle between Islam and the West. It has portrayed Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona as ""crusaders"" who will ""bring about the complete collapse of the modern American empire."" It also carries images evoking apocalyptic battles between the Sunni extremist group's fighters and the rest of the world, including American soldiers enveloped in flames. ISIS is taking a page from the playbook of al Qaeda, a former ally that has praised and advocated terrorist attacks in its glossy magazine, Inspire. But experts say the terrorist groups don't appear have the same propaganda goals. Inspire focuses more on practical advice for terrorists planning attacks, publishing guides on how to make bombs and get them onto planes. Dabiq is a vehicle intended to spark desire in its readers to join and fight with ISIS, said Seth Jones, a security analyst at the RAND Corporation. Read more about ""Inspire"" Kurds say they killed an ISIS commander . The Kurdish fighting force known as the Peshmerga killed an ISIS commander during battle Tuesday, according to a senior Peshmerga official who took part in the operation. The Peshmerga killed ISIS commander Abu Abdullah during a Kurdish operation to push ISIS farther from Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region, the official said on condition of anonymity Wednesday. In the battle, the Peshmerga reclaimed five Iraqi villages as well as a bridge along the main highway linking Irbil to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, according to a senior Peshmerga official taking part in the operations. The Peshmerga said the battle was meant to push ISIS fighters back toward Mosul, to the west of Irbil -- and part of the Peshmerga's larger plan to reclaim areas that ISIS claimed this year. ISIS destroyed the bridge linking the two cities a month ago, hoping to prevent any opposing force from advancing on Mosul, but the Peshmerga said its forces went around the bridge for Tuesday's attack. U.S. air power appeared to play a role in the offensive. Two U.S. airstrikes targeted an armored vehicle and ISIS fighting position northwest of Irbil, according to the U.S. military. That's the same area where the Peshmerga operation was under way. ISIS has seized large swaths of land as part of its effort to create a caliphate -- an Islamic state -- that stretches from western Syria to eastern Iraq.","Peshmerga forces have killed an ISIS commander, a senior Peshmerga official says .

"The chances you will get sicker or even die just because you went to the hospital have gone down dramatically. This has been a huge problem. For many years hospital mistakes and hospital acquired infections have been one of the biggest killers of Americans.  Yet a new report shows that patient safety efforts at U.S. hospitals seem to be paying off. An estimated 50,000 more patients are alive today that wouldn't be if hospitals kept making the same number of mistakes they did in 2010, according to this new report from the Health and Human Services Department (HHS). It released the new numbers Tuesday and called the improvement -- particularly the improvements in 2013 -- ""remarkable."" ""Hospital-acquired conditions,"" as they are called in the industry, include falls, pressure ulcers, infections at surgical sites, pneumonia caused by a patient's ventilator, catheter problems, and problems with a patient's drugs. Preliminary estimates show that in total, hospital patients experienced 1.3 million fewer instances of harm from 2010 to 2013.  This translates to a 17% decrease over the three-year period. This is good news since a 2010 report from HHS's Office of the Inspector General had found that 27% of Medicare patients had come to some kind of harm because of the care they received at the hospital.  And these weren't simple incidents.  Half of those patients experienced a significant problem that ended in serious or permanent injury or even death. Hospital-acquired infections and mistakes have cost the industry and taxpayers billions. And at any given time about 1 in every 25 inpatients has an infection related to hospital care according to data from the CDC.  The most common health care-associated infections were pneumonia, surgical site infections, gastrointestinal infections, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. This latest report found the most improvement was in the mistakes hospitals make with a patient's drugs. Too often patients get hurt because they've been given too much medicine or a hospital has given them a drug they are allergic to or they are even giving the wrong drug.  There was a 40% reduction in these kind of mistakes. The report also found there were fewer patients that developed bed sores  and fewer patients who experienced infections from catheters. Fixing this problem has been a big priority for the industry and for the government that has spent years working on ways to compel hospitals to better protect their patients. It's unclear from the report what made the most difference. New financial incentives from Medicare to make fewer mistakes may have played a role.  Technological advances could also be key. All of this is good news for patients and it is great news for the health care system itself.  Fewer mistakes saved $12 billion over the past three years according to the report. While she said there is still more work to do, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell seemed happy about the progress. She called the results ""welcome news for patients and their families."" ""These data represent significant progress in improving the quality of care that patients receive while spending our health care dollars more wisely.  HHS will work with partners across the country to continue to build on this progress.""","An estimated 50,000 more patients are alive today that wouldn't be if hospitals kept making the same number of mistakes they did in 2010 .

"A rookie police officer shot and killed an unarmed 28-year-old man in an unlit stairwell of a housing project in what New York's top cop said Friday was ""a very unfortunate tragedy ... involving an accidental discharge."" The victim, identified as Akai Gurley, was ""a total innocent who just happened"" to run into Officer Peter Liang in a ""pitch black"" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn late Thursday, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters. Shot once in the chest, Gurley died at a hospital later. Liang, with less than 18 months on the job and on probationary status, has been placed on modified assignment and stripped of his gun and badge pending an investigation. ""A life was lost and my heart goes out to the family of the young man,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""It does appear to have been an accident."" The shooting comes amid strained police/community relations after the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police on Staten Island. The chokehold death of the unarmed 43-year-old man sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. A grand jury will decide whether to bring charges against the officer. A few weeks later, the police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, of unarmed teenager Michael Brown thrust into the forefront the issue of law enforcement's use of deadly force. A grand jury decision on whether to charge Officer Darren Wilson is expected soon. ""What happened in Ferguson is different than what happened on Staten Island is different than what happened in Brooklyn,"" de Blasio said. ""Each of them has their own dynamic."" Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, in a statement, said the shooting was ""deeply troubling and warrants an immediate, fair and thorough investigation."" ""Many questions must be answered, including whether, as reported, the lights in the hallway were out for a number of days, and how this tragedy actually occurred,"" Thompson said. Liang and his partner were part of a ""violence reduction overtime detail"" at the Pink Houses, where a spate of serious crimes have been reported in recent months, including two robberies and four assaults, Bratton said. The officers had taken an elevator to the building's top floor to check on the roof and were taking the stairs down from the 8th floor, Bratton said, when the officer discharged the weapon. There were no lights in the stairwell leading up to the roof. Liang drew a flashlight and his weapon ""for safety reasons,"" the police commissioner said. The other officer did not draw his gun. In the darkened stairwell, Liang's gun discharged about the same time that Gurley, the father of a 2-year-old child, and his girlfriend were entering the seventh-floor landing, Bratton said. The lights on the seventh and eighth floors were not working, Bratton said. The police commissioner said the decision on when to draw a weapon is the discretion of officers ""based on what they are encountering or believe they may encounter. So there is not a specific prohibition against taking a firearm out. But again, as in all cases, an officer would have to justify the circumstances that required him to or resulted in unholstering his firearm."" The shooting also is being investigated by police internal affairs. ""This is a tragic situation,"" de Blasio said. ""It does appear to have been a very tragic accident.""","Akai Gurley, 28, was shot after entering a stairwell in Brooklyn with girlfriend .

"Editor's Note: Gail Cunningham is senior director of public relations for the nonprofit National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC), Inc. based in Silver Spring, Maryland, and has been in the credit counseling sector since 1987. The NFCC says it serves more than 2 million customers through nearly 850 offices around the country. Gail Cunningham says foreclosure is more than a financial failure, it's an emotional ordeal. (CNN) -- When you sit across the desk from someone with overwhelming debt, you can sense their fear before a word is spoken. And when their home is in jeopardy, the fear fills the room. I was a credit counselor for 16 years, and quickly discovered that people in debt are very ashamed of their situation. In all my years, I never counseled anyone who was cavalier about their circumstances, or intentionally sought to dig a deep financial hole. But the shame that accompanies foreclosure tops anything I've ever experienced. There's something about people losing their homes that is disturbing beyond measure. Failure has become a part of their demeanor. After all, foreclosure is about more than the house, and more than the money. It's about losing the dream, taking your children out of their school and moving your family away from their neighborhood friends. Pulling up roots is never easy, particularly when you're forced to do so. The job of the counselor is to put the financial pieces back together, provide hope, and help move people toward a more financially stable life. Each day housing counselors pick up the phone and advocate for their client, often going to the mat with a lender to achieve the resolution option that is best suited for that individual. For example, I'm reminded of the 46-year-old single mom's foreclosure problem that started with a heart attack. Out of work for three months with no income and medical bills compounding her existing debt, she was headed for foreclosure. She and an NFCC certified housing counselor were able to work out a loan modification that not only kept her in her home, but also reduced her monthly mortgage payment. Housing issues are complicated, with the terms short sale, forbearance agreement, deed-in-lieu and loan modification foreign to the consumer. But such resolution options are all part of a day's work for the housing counselor, whose goal is to determine the best long-term solution for the consumer. Their experience allows them to ""talk the talk"" with the lender and often achieve the happy ending that everyone is after. Each case is individual, with outcomes as varied as the problems, but avoiding foreclosure, where appropriate, is the goal of all parties. Foreclosures happen for many reasons, some of which are beyond the borrower's control: . • Economic hardship related to job loss, reduced hours at work, medical issues or divorce; . • Unaffordable payments when a loan resets to a higher annual percentage rate; . • Buying a house that was more costly than the borrower's income could reasonably support long-term, and . • Increased cost of living, which places more demands on consumers' budgets, forcing them to make hard choices about which debts to pay. Of course, the best foreclosure prevention tool is making an educated and informed decision when buying a home. Pre-purchase counseling is particularly useful for first-time buyers, helping them understand the full responsibility of homeownership. However, once it becomes apparent that buyers can no longer keep up with their loans, it is critical for them to reach out for help right away. Postponing dealing with the mortgage delinquency is one of the main impediments to solving the problem. Delinquent homeowners likely will receive a Notice to Cure Default that lists HUD housing counselors they can contact, as well as hardship program options. They should seek help at once. Many resolution options such as a short sale -- in which the home is sold for less than the remaining mortgage amount and the lender accepts at least part of the loss -- are only open to those who have not dug a deep financial hole. These solutions do not preserve homeownership, but they are less damaging to the consumer's credit history, and depending on their structure, could possibly allow the consumer to leave the home owing little or nothing at all. When homeowners in trouble reach out to lenders, few know that they need to speak to the loss mitigation department, and not the collection area. Once contact is made, buyers should be sure to keep records. Keep a log of the date and time of each call, the person with whom you speak, and the content of the conversation. Ask questions and restate to make sure you are understanding information. Without accurate documentation, any dispute could turn into a ""he-said/she-said"" with the homeowner being the loser. Don't expect a quick answer. Follow up with your mortgage company to make sure any paperwork you sent was received and logged. In many cases, getting a yes or a no can take weeks, and weeks can feel like years when saving your home is involved. As I write this, it seems as though new proposals to help consumers avoid foreclosure appear daily. Whether it is actions by Fannie Mae, the FDIC or the lenders themselves, solving the mortgage crisis is recognized as an essential component to getting the economy back on track. Any resolution is likely to be as complex as the problem itself. Exotic loan products, combined with making them secure, are far different from yesteryear when we went to our community bank and took out a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage that it held the full term. Homeownership can still be the American dream, but only under the right circumstances. Lenders are returning to more traditional lending standards, and with good reason. Buyers are realizing that what seems too good to be true is often exactly that. America will find solid footing, but until then, many feel as though their home was built on shifting sands. Let's redefine financial success, and this time have it represent living within your means, being able to pay bills in full when the statement arrives, understanding the terms of a loan or credit card, knowing that there are things more important than hocking your financial peace of mind for a larger house or shinier car. In other words, let's begin living the true American dream, one of financial responsibility that is celebrated by all. It's a dream we can make come true, one household at a time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gail Cunningham.","Gail Cunningham: Foreclosure is an emotional process for families .

"Women who want the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to lift a de facto ban that prohibits them from driving have launched an online campaign urging Saudi females to stage a demonstration by driving cars on October 26. ""There is no justification for the Saudi government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so,"" reads part of an online petition on the Oct26driving.com website. Since Saturday, it has garnered close to 11,000 signatures. No traffic law specifically prohibits females from driving in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle. One of the first to sign the petition was Mai al-Swayan, an economic researcher who told CNN she definitely plans to drive that day. ""I will simply use my car to drive to my normal destination ... driving the kids to the mall or family visits, or even grocery shopping."" Al-Swayan, a Saudi woman who drove a car when she lived in the United States, said she sees no reason why she shouldn't be able to drive in her home country as well. ""I am a capable woman,"" she explained, ""and this ban is a clear violation of my rights."" The issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been a contentious one. And while such demonstrations are extremely rare, they have been staged at least twice before. In May 2011, prominent Saudi women's rights activist Manal al-Sharif was arrested after uploading a video to YouTube that showed her driving in Saudi Arabia. She spent more than a week in jail and quickly became a hero to numerous women in her country and across the Middle East. It was a sign of just how influential she had grown that on June 17, 2011, dozens of women across Saudi Arabia, emboldened and inspired by al-Sharif's ordeal, participated in the ""Women2Drive"" campaign by getting behind the wheel, defying the ban, and driving throughout the streets of their cities. In 1991, a group of 47 women protested the prohibition by driving through the country's capital city, Riyadh. After being arrested, many were further punished by being banned from travel and suspended from their workplaces. A video posted on the October 26 Movement website shows Lujaina al-Hathloul, a Saudi student in Canada, referencing the two previous incidents as she implores her countrywomen to take to the streets. ""If you didn't get the chance to participate in 1991 or 2011, here's your new chance -- on October 26, 2013,"" al-Hathloul said in her video. ""I hope that a huge number of girls take part this time."" In addition to prohibiting driving, the country's strict and compulsory guardianship system also prevents women from opening bank accounts, working, traveling and going to school without the express permission of their male guardian. Saudi Arabia has been moving toward change under its current ruler, King Abdullah, who is considered a cautious reformer and proponent of women's rights. In January, he appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, the first time women had been chosen for the country's top consultative body. In 2011, he announced that women can run for office and vote in local elections in 2015, and in 2009, he appointed Saudi Arabia's first female deputy minister. All the steps were hailed as significant, but many female rights activists say progress still hasn't come fast enough. The new petition asks the Saudi government to present ""to the citizens a valid and legal justification"" for the ban, demanding authorities should not simply blame it on ""societal consensus."" Al-Swayan hopes the demonstration will works this time and that Saudi women will finally gain the right to drive. If it doesn't, she said, she won't give up. ""I won't stop demanding that right over and over again,"" she said.","Saudi women reassert their demand for the right to drive .
Women are being urged to drive cars on October 26 to support that demand .
Demonstrations in 1991 and 2011 resulted in arrests ."
"How bad has it gotten for embattled San Diego Mayor Bob Filner? Even Hooters -- the restaurant chain sometimes criticized for its scantily clad waitresses -- says he's no longer welcome. The chain's downtown location has joined a campaign by a local radio talk-show host, who's urging businesses to post signs in their window that declare Filner persona non grata. The signs note that the mayor ""will not be served in this establishment"" and ""We believe women should be treated with respect."" In a statement posted on Twitter, the company said restaurant acted on its own. ""Our Hooters Girls in San Diego have spoken. Not a corporate gig, but we support our girls,"" it read. San Diego Mayor not welcome: Photos of the Hooters sign . Refusing to resign in the face of mounting allegations that he groped and made lewd comments toward numerous women, Filner is facing an effort to recall him from office. And now a city councilman wants him to answer questions about more than $500 in charges on his official city credit card from a downtown hotel. ""When you see statements like this, it raises the question of is city business being done or not,"" Councilman Kevin Faulconer said Tuesday. CNN obtained Filner's municipal credit-card statements from January to May. The taxpayer-paid card included charges ranging from less than $30 to about $111 at the Westgate Hotel, including one incurred on a Sunday. The Westgate is across the street from the mayor's office. Regulars at the bar who did not want to speak on-camera told CNN that Filner was often here, usually with a different woman. Faulconer, a Republican who sits on the council's audit committee, raised questions about other charges as well -- $3,000 to an online reputation-management firm, $128 for a juicer and a $30,000 trip to Paris. He said Filner has promised to reimburse the city for that trip, but there has been no proof of a refund. Secrets that women of San Diego no longer keep about its mayor . The 70-year-old Filner was elected mayor of the eighth-largest American city in 2012, after 10 terms in Congress. His accusers range from a singer at a campaign fundraiser to his former communications director, who called him unfit for office. He's rebuffed calls to resign from all nine City Council members and from his fellow Democrats, including California's two U.S. senators. He now faces a recall effort that is trying to gather more than 100,000 signatures needed to put his future up to a new vote, though some political observers doubt organizers can succeed. Filner issued a required response to the notice of a petition drive Tuesday, arguing that voters should weigh his administration's push for new parks, high-tech jobs, better roads and a 2024 Olympic bid before they decide to whether they want to turn him out of office. ""Now is not the time to go backwards -- back to the time when middle-class jobs and neighborhood infrastructure were sacrificed to downtown special interests,"" Filner said in a written response to a proposed recall petition. ""We need to continue to move forward!"" Did mayor target victims of military sexual assault? But Michael Pallamary, the head of the recall effort, said Filner ""obviously believes his policy initiatives excuse his being a sexual predator."" ""His reply is unacceptable,"" Pallamary said. ""San Diegans want a mayor that doesn't grope and demean women, who doesn't abuse his office to satisfy a perverted quest for a sense of power, and who has the ability to lead our great city -- an ability Filner can never, ever reclaim."" Filner has brought ""great shame"" on the city, Pallamary said, vowing, ""We will recall him from office."" In July, Filner acknowledged that he ""failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me"" and that he was ""embarrassed"" by his actions. But he also said he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts"" and he will not resign. ""We have moved toward the vision of producing thousands of middle-class jobs in our port; creating a solar-based city to enhance our environment and create jobs; building an efficient international border to bring billions of dollars into our economy; keeping our military and hi-tech sectors strong and vibrant,"" Filner said in response to the recall petition notice. He touted new support for the arts, a five-year labor agreement with city workers and work toward bringing the summer Olympics to the city. Out of rehab, but also locked out of office . The mayor entered a two-week intensive behavior therapy program on July 29, but his attorney, James Payne, said Filner was able to complete that phase of treatment by Saturday. He'll continue with outpatient treatment, Payne said -- but he might not be back at work in his office anytime soon. His chief of staff changed the locks, according to numerous reports, including one by CNN affiliate KFMB. And after weeks of complaints, some observers are questioning whether more should have been said about Filner's behavior before last year's election. ""I think there was a lot of whispering,"" former state Assemblywoman Lori Saldana told CNN. ""It was a lot of things under the surface. A lot of 'boys will be boys.' "" Saldana said she brought complaints about Filner to San Diego County's Democratic Party leader two years ago after hearing accounts of harassing behavior from six women. Nothing happened, she said. ""It was considered abusive. It was insulting at times. And I think people need to pay attention to those reports, and it didn't happen two years ago,"" said Saldana, also a Democrat. Filner's 2012 opponent, City Councilman Carl DeMaio, hinted at the issue during a mayoral debate. Video of the event shows DeMaio telling voters, ""You need a mayor who's going to insist on zero tolerance of sexual harassment in the workplace"" -- turning to look at Filner while he makes the comment. DeMaio is now running for Congress and had no comment. But his mayoral campaign featured a television spot in which an Washington airport worker who had a run-in with Filner described his actions as ""scary and hostile."" ""I deal with frustrated travelers every day, but I never came across anyone like Bob Filner,"" she said.

"Same-sex couples in Chicago and surrounding Cook County can marry immediately and won't have to wait until June 1 for a state law legalizing gay marriage to take effect, a federal judge ruled Friday. ""There is no reason to delay further when no opposition has been presented to this Court and committed gay and lesbian couples have already suffered from the denial of their fundamental right to marry,"" U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman wrote in a lawsuit. ""Although this Court finds that the marriage ban for same-sex couples violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause on its face, this finding can only apply to Cook County based upon the posture of the lawsuit,"" the judge wrote. Cook County Clerk David Orr said his downtown Chicago office would be open until 7 p.m. Friday issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. ""I'm thrilled same-sex couples who want to get married won't have to wait any longer"" Orr said in a statement. ""We are very excited to celebrate this historic milestone with every loving couple from today onward."" In November, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Religious Freedom and Marriage Fairness Act, making Illinois the 16th state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage. The measure goes into effect June 1 . Last month, the gay rights group Lambda Legal and the ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit in Illinois on behalf of same-sex couples who wanted to immediately obtain marriage licenses in Cook County. Christopher Clark, counsel for Lambda Legal, said the case originally arose after a couple facing life-threatening illness came forward saying they didn't feel they could wait until June to be married. Clark called Friday's ruling an ""absolute ringing affirmation of the principles of liberty and equality that are at the foundations of our constitution."" Clark said the ruling sets a precedent for same-sex marriage in other states and called it ""another step in resolving the issue across the country.""","Same-sex couples in Cook County don't have to wait until June 1 .

"Arkansas became the latest state to have its ban on same-sex marriage overturned, after a state judge Friday declared the voter-approved measure to be unconstitutional. Twenty-one gay and lesbian couples were part of a group of plaintiffs challenging Amendment 83 to the Arkansas constitution, saying it violated their federal and state rights of equal protection and privacy. There was no indication from the court the decision would be temporarily put on hold pending appeal, leaving unclear whether some same-sex couples could begin getting married immediately. The state has the option of asking for a stay on enforcement, and the legal fight is now likely headed to the state supreme court. ""Our freedoms are often acquired slowly, but our country has evolved as a beacon of liberty in what is sometimes a dark world. These freedoms include a right to privacy,"" said Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza. ""It is time to let that beacon of freedom shine brighter on all our brothers and sisters. We will be stronger for it."" The ruling continues a near-unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year, giving marriage-equality supporters unbridled encouragement that their ultimate goal will be achieved: eliminating all laws limiting the rights of homosexuals to wed. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage within its borders: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Just a decade ago, there were none. Friday also marks the two-year anniversary of President Barack Obama voicing his public support for the first time of same-sex marriage, citing his own ""evolution"" on the issue.  ""At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" said Obama at the time. Groups supporting same-sex marriage applauded the Arkansas ruling. ""Judge Piazza held that there is no good reason for discriminating against couples and their loved ones just because they are gay,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry. ""With nearly 70 marriage cases now making their way through the courts, and five federal appellate courts now hearing arguments and soon to rule, today's decision out of Arkansas underscores that all of America is ready for the freedom to marry."" A federal appeals court last month heard challenges to same-sex marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma. Appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar challenges over current bans in Nevada, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan, including Virginia next Tuesday. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after it ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. More importantly, the high court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 ""Windsor"" decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits such as tax breaks. Judge Piazza cited the Windsor case in tossing out the Arkansas statute. ""The strength of our nation is in our freedom which includes, among others, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, the right to marry, the right to bear arms, the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures, the right of privacy, the right of due process and equal protection, and the right to vote regardless of race or sex,"" he wrote. The state's attorney general, Dustin McDaniel, earlier this week said he personally backs the same-sex marriage right, but that his duties require him to defend the current ban in all court challenges. The case is Wright v. State of Arkansas (60CV-13-2662).","""Our country has evolved as a beacon of liberty,"" judge writes .

"Republicans have once again blocked an extension of benefits intended to aid the long-term unemployed. Thursday's vote in the Senate was third time Democrats have attempted unsuccessfully to pass legislation intended to help some 1.7 million people who have had their benefits cut off since the recession-era program expired on December 28. It has been extended 11 times since 2008 and doing so again is popular with 60% of Americans behind it, according to national polls. But the Republican-led House has yet to take any action and the majority of GOP members in the Senate don't want it renewed. It doesn't seem like good politics but it is a position Republicans are sticking to. Why? The deficit . They commonly point to the deficit. ""The better way to go is to not add to the deficit in an irresponsible way,"" GOP Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois said. ""I obviously have people in my state who would benefit."" Kirk supports an extension, but says he wants it paid for. In the Senate proposal, which would cost about $6 billion for three months, Democrats offered a way to pay for the program that involved increased employee contribution to pension programs. ""We compromised on how to pay for it. We compromised on the offset that we would use, that is acceptable, I think, to both sides now,"" Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said. But Republicans have moved the goal post. Now they have another demand. They want an increase to military retiree cost-of-living payments, which would add more to the deficit, requiring additional cuts to the federal budget. ""If Senate Democrats allow a vote on my amendment, we'd have a solution that could immediately deliver temporary help to those looking for work, prevent military retirement benefit cuts, and reduce the deficit,"" New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte said. 2.3 million children have a long-term unemployed parent . Amendments . It's wonky. But it's common parlance in the Senate. Republicans and Democrats are constantly fighting over amendments. In short, the Republicans want to offer them to alter bills but complain that Democrats won't allow them. Unfortunately, this one is hard to referee because it all comes down to perspective. Democrats say they are offering Republicans plenty of opportunity to amend the unemployment bill and Republicans disagree. ""We said, 'Fine. Let both sides offer amendments -- a whole lot of amendments. Then bring up the bill for a vote.' So throughout this process, we've moved toward our colleagues across the aisle, time and time again,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer of New York. But According to Politico, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said ""the unemployment insurance bill has been blocked, again, because we're not allowed amendments."" Unemployment benefits breeds unemployment . The conservative group, Club for Growth, says unemployment benefits simply offer an incentive to remain unemployed. Opinion: Jobless benefits don't cause unemployment . ""The policy is bad,"" a spokesman for the group, Barney Keller, said. In December, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said that extended unemployment benefits result in people becoming ""part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy. And it really - while it seems good, it actually does a disservice to the people you're trying to help."" Democrats have a bit of a different perspective, believing that people don't chose to be unemployed. ""What (Republicans) want is to know what the 57-year-old woman in Nevada is going to do to stop couch surfing,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said. Ineffective . Ineffective is another word used in Republican circles. Alex Brill, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said unemployment insurance doesn't help workers gain new skills or move to areas with jobs. He said it has ""failed to deliver demonstrable results."" ""Congress should recognize the inherent ineffectiveness of trying to help people find work through a program that has evolved into a poorly operating welfare program,"" Brill said in a recent column for Real Clear Markets. Brooke Hougesen, spokesman for the Senate Republican campaign arm, said unemployment insurance isn't working as millions of frustrated long-term jobless have stopped looking for work. ""Here's the dirty little secret: It isn't working because people aren't finding jobs,"" Hougesen said. ""We need to focus on solutions to end long-term unemployment and focus on jobs - and President Obama and Senate Democrats simply aren't up to the task."" Democrats argue that this is not meant to be a job placement program but a critical safety net.","Republicans have once again blocked an extension of unemployment benefits .

"Adam Lanza stayed at home mostly, a witness said, playing video games such as ""Call of Duty."" But on December 14, 2012, he went out -- armed with 10 30-round magazines for his semiautomatic Bushmaster .223 caliber model XM15 rifle and bullets for his two handguns and a shotgun. Lanza didn't make it home alive. Nor did the 26 people -- 20 of them schoolchildren ages 6 and 7 -- he shot dead in less than five minutes, firing one bullet roughly every two seconds he was at Sandy Hook Elementary School. These were among the details spelled out Thursday in five search warrants and other material tied to the grisly shooting at the Newtown, Connecticut, school, as well as in a statement from a local top prosecutor.  Together, the newly released documents help paint a clearer picture of what happened. What they don't explain is why Lanza did it. Read the documents . The quest for answers, including the one about motive, continues. State's Attorney Stephen J. Sedensky III of the judicial district of Danbury, which includes Newtown, stressed in his statement Thursday: ""This is an active, ongoing investigation. No conclusions have been reached, and no final determinations have been made."" At the same time, he acknowledged that the public -- including those intent on preventing other such massacres -- has an understandable, sincere desire to have information now. That's the mindset of Tim Makris, co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, which supports ""common sense solutions that make ... our country safer."" Even with its limited scope, he called Thursday's document release a step forward. ""The information revealed today underscores the need to turn this tragedy into transformation,"" Makris said. Fresh insights into Lanza, his home . Although the new documents don't provide a motive, they offer fresh glimpses into the life of 20-year-old Adam Lanza, in part by revealing what was inside the Newtown home he shared with his mother, Nancy. One person, whose name was redacted in a search warrant, described Adam Lanza as a shut-in who rarely left home and played military-style video games. That house included a gun locker that investigators found open and without signs of a break-in, Sedensky said. All the guns tied to Adam Lanza appeared to have been purchased by his mother, he added. Police also found more than 1,600 rounds of unspent ammunition inside the home, according to the documents. Gov. Dannel Malloy pointed out Thursday the mass killer left lower-capacity magazines behind, a fact that, he said, speaks to the need to significantly restrict the number of bullets that can be in each magazine. He also said assault weapons should be banned. The Newtown house also had three Samurai swords and several books -- one titled ""NRA Guide to the Basics of Pistol Shooting,"" another about Asperger's syndrome and a third on autism -- the newly released documents show. Connecticut's chief medical examiner has said he had been told that Lanza had Asperger's syndrome. Research has not shown a link between violence and that condition, a high-functioning form of autism marked by social awkwardness. Opinion: Did we learn nothing from Newtown? Investigators also found a 2008 New York Times article about a shooting at Northern Illinois University that left six dead, including the gunman. They also took three photographs ""of what appears to be a deceased human covered with plastic and what appears to be blood,"" a receipt for a shooting range in Oklahoma and National Rifle Association certificates for Nancy and Adam Lanza. The NRA, a gun rights advocacy group, has issued a statement saying neither Lanza nor his mother were members. Retracing what happened December 14 . The carnage began in that house. Before embarking on his rampage at Sandy Hook, Adam Lanza killed his 52-year-old mother by shooting her in the forehead as she lay in bed, a search warrant states. ""There was no indication of a struggle"" between mother and son, Sedensky said. Timeline of Sandy Hook shooting . From there, he drove to the elementary school -- leaving a 12-gauge shotgun in the car, police would discover -- and shot through the front entrance. The information detailed Thursday dispelled some earlier reports on what happened, Sedensky noted. Lanza wasn't wearing a bulletproof vest, for one. And besides the hallway, he fatally shot students and teachers in two classrooms, not three. When police found Lanza's body -- killed by a single, self-inflicted shot from a Glock 10 mm handgun -- they also discovered that the Bushmaster rifle was loaded with 14 bullets in its 30-round capacity magazine, plus one round in a chamber. This was one of 10 of this firearm's 30-round capacity magazines at the scene, Sedensky explained. More ammunition for the Glock and a Sig Sauer P226 9 mm handgun was also found. Three such magazines still contained 30 rounds. There were six more magazines nearby -- three of them were empty, while the others had  10, 11 or 13 live rounds in them. ""One-hundred-and-fifty-four spent .223 casings were recovered from the scene,"" the state's attorney wrote, indicating that Lanza had fired at least that many bullets from what Connecticut authorities had described as an ""assault-type rifle."" A lot of bullets fired in not a lot of time. Sedensky said, ""It is currently estimated that the time from when the shooter shot his way into the school until he took his own life was less than five minutes."" Gun control push continues despite dwindling support . The full investigation into the Sandy Hook shooting, Sedensky said, likely will be completed this summer. After that happens, the state's attorney said he will write a report evaluating the crimes committed and whether or not anyone will be prosecuted as a result. Until then, the debate over gun control stoked by the Sandy Hook massacre continues in earnest. Obama: 'Shame on us' if Newtown doesn't bring new gun laws . Recent polling shows public support for gun restrictions has declined since the shooting. Shortly after it, 52% of Americans favored major restrictions on guns, according to a CNN/ORC International poll. That number has dwindled to 43%, a version of the same poll conducted between March 15 and 17 found. No legislation on the matter has passed yet in Washington, though gun control advocates are pushing. Mayors Against Illegal Guns on Thursday released its first television ad  featuring relatives of Newtown victims urging politicians to pass tougher gun laws. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the group's co-founder, said in a statement: ""We cannot afford to wait for another tragedy. It's long past time for elected officials to listen to their constituents and pass reforms like comprehensive background checks that we know will save lives."" Newtown families featured in first political ad . President Barack Obama voiced a similar sentiment in remarks Thursday as part of a ""national day of action"" to galvanize supporters pushing for tougher gun laws. ""This is our best chance in more than a decade to take common sense steps that will save lives,"" he said at a White House event. ""If there is a step we can take that will save just one child, just one parent, just another town from experiencing the same grief that some of the moms and dads who are here have endured, then we should be doing it. We have an obligation to try.""","Adam Lanza fired roughly one bullet every two seconds, a local prosecutor says .

"Max Broderick remembers exactly what he did a year ago Tuesday. He ran down fences, drove through fields and over curbs to get his family out of the way of the historic tornado that tattered Moore, Oklahoma. The dark gray monster that killed 24, including 9 children, was in his rear-view mirror, lathing a 17-mile wound into the landscape that was more than a mile wide in places. Once it was gone, the Brodericks returned to their hometown just south of Oklahoma City. The whirlwind -- an EF5 tornado, the most destructive on the Fujita scale -- had sheared houses, schools, businesses into sticks, bricks and shards that lay jumbled and jagged in the straight-line rows of their subdivision streets. The Brodericks' home and everything in it was gone, but something else was on Max's mind -- his neighbors who were missing. He and other survivors ran up and down the street. ""If you can hear me, call out,"" he cried to anyone who might have been stuck under rubble and still alive. The damage was so complete that when rescuers moved in, city officials raced to print new street signs to help guide them through the apocalyptic landscape. A key home improvement . A year later, it's tornado season again, and Broderick's wife Sheridan seems happy about the new addition to their new home, which is still under construction. ""We're gonna build our storm shelter right here kind of between the second and third cars so we can still get in even if there's cars here,"" she said, as a contractor worked inside the incomplete house. Storm cellars are all the rage in the neighborhood now. Other homes-in-progress dot the subdivision, where new houses stand surrounded by threadbare lots. One bald slab sports a rusty storm cellar door -- apparently the only thing the tornado left standing there. Nothing else has been added to that empty foundation. The terror was too much for some residents, and they aren't rebuilding, because they're not coming back. Last year's cyclone injured 353 of them, and Moore is as prime target for twisters, right in the middle of ""tornado alley.' Tornado cat and mouse . Some of them may have recalled the May 1999 tornado that killed dozens in Moore. Lt. Gov. Todd Lamb has said it had the strongest wind speeds of any twister in history. It was part of a spate of dozens of twisters in tornado alley in just a few days that year. Or they may remember the 2003 tornado that was less deadly but ripped up buildings. Or fright may still be in their bones from the tornado that ripped apart another Oklahoma City outlier last year one day before death visited Moore from above. And trauma might still be fresh on their minds from the perhaps even bigger monster that missed Moore by a hair 11 days after its ravishing -- the so-called El Reno tornado on May 31, 2013, that razed mostly sparsely populated countryside. El Reno was ""one of the most powerful tornadoes sampled by mobile radar and also the widest known tornado on record,"" the National Weather Service said. It seems that to live in Moore is to play cat and mouse with deadly storms with heart-rending consequences. Seven of the nine children killed in last year's tornado died when it flattened one single school building. More than 70 students and teachers hunkered down at Plaza Towers Elementary, when the torquing winds pushed walls and ceilings down on top of them. Plaza Towers had no storm shelter a year ago. That will change when the school is rebuilt. Commemorations and a new start . Remaining Moore residents will celebrate their resilience on Tuesday with commemorations that start at 10 a.m. local time (9 a.m. Eastern). Gov. Mary Fallin and Moore Mayor Glenn Lewis will commemorate the dead, as the local fire department tolls a bell in their honor. A chaplain will hold a prayer. Then a shovel will plunge into the dirt for the groundbreaking of the new Moore Medical Center. A year ago, the tornado tore the old one to pieces and tousled automobiles onto its ruins. Rescuers were forced to take Moore's injured to other hospitals in the region. In its place stands a barren empty lot of red earth. Something new will start to take form there on Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- During his professional tennis career that began in 1998, Roger Federer has done a whole lot of traveling. He has played in exactly 30 countries, a figure that doesn't include exhibition tours or matches in nations such as Brazil, Argentina and South Korea. Starting this weekend the seven-time Wimbledon champion and 17-time grand slam winner breaks new ground by competing in India in the exhibition International Premier Tennis League, and his fans in the world's second most populated country can hardly wait. A first batch of tickets for his matches in the capital, New Delhi, sold out in 20 minutes. Federer is expected to play on two days. ""For Indians, Wimbledon is one of the biggest sporting events -- not just tennis events -- of the year,"" IPTL founder and former doubles standout Mahesh Bhupathi said in an interview with CNN.com. ""With Roger being as successful as he has at Wimbledon just makes him that iconic figure in India. ""Everybody is waiting for him to show up."" Federer is excited, too. He'll be visiting India for a second time, having surveyed Unicef's recovery programs in southern India in 2006 in the wake of the tsunami in Asia two years earlier. Federer sat down with CNN.com during the World Tour Finals last month to discuss his upcoming Indian trip and all things India. He can't wait to land at the airport, for one. He likes Indian food -- not shying away from the spicy stuff once in a while -- recalls his time on India's chaotic roads and of course reflects on his Twitter request in September that led to an array of colorful replies. Q: Roger, three months ago you asked your Indian supporters on Twitter to recreate some Indian experiences or take you to some popular sights via Photoshop. The results were pretty memorable. What did you make of it? A: I thought it was hilarious, actually. I wanted to explain to people that unfortunately I had limited time because I really need to practice and I need to get back to the family, but I'm so happy to be coming to India, and it's very exciting, so I was like, 'Well how?' I know I can't see much or hardly anything rather than actually experience just the people, Delhi, all that stuff. So I was like, 'You guys Photoshop me and I think that's like a good idea and then I'll pick you guys and retweet.' The feedback that came was just [he giggles] hilarious. It was crazy, it was cool. There were many, many ones that were simply epic. I can't wait to go to India. Q: You won't have much time in India, but what are you looking forward to doing? A: To me arriving at the airport is very exciting. I remember when I went to Brazil for the first time a couple of years ago [in 2012] in Sao Paulo. I came out and I was like, 'This is it. I'm in Brazil. I made it.' It's so rare for me to go to a new country, new place, new city. It won't be my first time in India, but it'll be my first time to play tennis, and that moment you walk onto the court or into the stadium -- that's why I play tennis. I'm going to India for that feeling -- playing tennis, showing what I can do, bringing over my personality, sharing the fun and all that with the people, and how are the people going to react? And obviously I'm going to meet a ton of people, get a sense for how it is locally there. It's going to be crazy, but I'm prepared for that. Q: You mention that it's going to be crazy. It could be quite crazy at the airport when you land. A: Maybe. Those are the things I don't know. That's why I don't want to think about it much and just like go with the flow. When it happens, handle it. People know I'm happy to come and if there are happy people that I'm coming, that's great. I've had some experiences at hotels, airports, stadiums, but that's why I think the South American trip was huge or sometimes playing exhibitions is what I really enjoy doing because it allows me to play in places I've never been to. I went to Seoul, I went to Macao, Kuala Lumpur, Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires and Bogota, and now I can go to India. I'm sure I've forgot a few. For me it was special to play in Japan for the first time in 2006. I've been on tour for a long time so sometimes you would think that it takes more to get me excited, which I guess is true to a degree. And this is definitely going to get me excited. Q: In a broader perspective, what do you think of when you think of India? A: I think of a warm place. I see a lot of people walking around barefoot because it is so warm. I remember I was not able to watch the road anymore because I was seeing guys like coming [he makes a swerving motion with his hand then laughs] ...I was like, 'Oh my God, I can't watch this anymore because we're going to get hit at one point.' I was on the road for six straight hours to Puducherry and back from Chennai. It was unbelievable, but it was a great experience. I think of that. I think of a lot of people. I think of people that are quickly excited, a cricket loving country. Obviously that comes to mind as an athlete. So that's what I think of and just how different the north is from the south, how different the dress is as well, how inland is different to the coast, fisherman to inside with the crops. Q: Have you seen a Bollywood movie? A: Maybe a few minutes here and there. I went to see one of these musicals in London years ago [he suspects it was Bombay Dreams]. It was so much fun. Q: How much do you like Indian food? A: I like it a lot. Sometimes I like to face the challenge of spice because I rarely have it. Good Indian food is great. Here this week already I went twice to Indian food [note: the interview took place on the Thursday]. I had chicken biryani, and I like vegetarian as well. I had one of these vegetarian degustation menus, which is great. I ate all the naan breads, you name it. I really like Indian food.","He's 33 but it's a new experience for Roger Federer when he plays in India .

"Venice, Louisiana (CNN) -- Frustrated Louisiana officials Sunday demanded the federal government approve their plans to dredge up walls of sand to protect delicate inland estuaries from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. ""Either the Coast Guard has to side with its American citizens and protect its communities, or it has to side with a major world corporation named BP and betray American citizens in that process,"" St. Bernard Parish President Craig Taffaro told reporters. With oil sloshing ashore along the state's barrier islands and seeping into marshes around the mouth of the Mississippi River, state and parish leaders want to use dredges to close channels between the Gulf and the coastal estuaries. They said those plans have been held up by the Army Corps of Engineers and the agencies in charge of the spill response, including the Coast Guard and BP, the company responsible for the spill. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry, the federal on-scene coordinator for the response effort, told reporters the barrier island project was still under review. Environmental and wildlife officials ""are weighing in on the impact to endangered and threatened species and other impacts this large-scale project could have,"" she said. But Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser pointed to pictures of an oil-covered pelican nesting ground and asked reporters, ""Is it affected now?"" Thousands of barrels of oil a day have been spewing into the Gulf since late April, when the BP-contracted drilling rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 45 miles off Louisiana. Beyond the state's barrier islands lie a filigree of marshlands, bayous and islands that are rich in wildlife and fisheries that represent the source of about a third of the U.S. seafood industry. Tim Kerner, mayor of the town of Jean Lafitte, said the dredging plan is ""the only plan that'll possibly work"" to save those estuaries. ""It's the plan that will save the wildlife, save the marine life and also the way of life for the town of Jean Lafitte and all the coastal communities,"" Kerner said. Nungesser, Taffaro and other representatives of the state's coastal parishes toured the threatened region with Gov. Bobby Jindal on Sunday. Jindal said his state needs ""a greater sense of urgency"" from those in charge of the cleanup, or for them to delegate authority to regional officials. He said the state is already doing preparatory work for dredging and could begin operations immediately on receiving approval. ""Ten days later, you'll see land being built. You'll literally see sand being built along these critical passes,"" he said. Mayors and parish presidents were critical of both the government and BP's handling of the cleanup, recounting stories of misdirected protective booms or skimmers that sat on trucks ashore. And a visibly angry Taffaro said the delays threatened his parish's ecosystem and the livelihoods of his people. ""I don't have a crystal ball,"" he said. ""But if I were a betting man, I would be betting that the plan is to let us die, then come back and do $75 million worth of cleanup and close the book."" He said some officials had even suggested setting oil-soaked marshes ablaze, a step he called ""not an option for us."" ""That kills our hurricane protection. It wipes out our species, our ecosystem and everything we've been fighting to protect,"" he said.","State and parish officials want to close channels between Gulf, coastal estuaries .

"(CNN) -- The United States is ""disappointed"" by the expulsion by Qatar of Eman al-Obeidy to Libya, a decision that it said is a ""breach of humanitarian norms."" Al-Obeidy grabbed the world's attention this spring when she accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's security forces of gang-raping her. ""We've not spoken with Ms. al-Obeidy since she left Qatar, but we have been in contact with senior officials in the Transitional National Council in Benghazi, and we've made clear U.S. interests in her case,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in reference to the rebel government in control of eastern Libya. ""I believe she is safe where she is at right now."" The U.S. criticism comes on the heels of reports that al-Obeidy was beaten in Qatar before being deported back to Libya. Nasha Dawaji, a U.S.-based Libyan pro-freedom activist, said she was with three key members of the Transitional National Council when they first learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi on Thursday. Al-Obeidy had a black eye, like she had been punched, Dawaji said. She also had bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms. The council members were upset upon seeing al-Obeidy's condition and vowed to open an investigation, Dawaji said. Al-Obeidy had fled Libya following the alleged rape and was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported early Thursday. In the hours leading to her deportation, armed guards had been posted outside her hotel room, preventing a representative from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, from helping her, al-Obeidy told CNN. The U.N. agency had prepared papers for her departure from Qatar to begin a new life. Al-Obeidy said Qatari authorities then took her and her parents by force from the Kempinski Residences & Suites in the Qatari capital. She said she was beaten and handcuffed, then forced onto a military plane to Libya. She also said the Qataris had taken everything from her and her parents -- including cell phones, her laptop, and money. On Friday, she offered CNN more detail on what happened in Qatar. When confronted by the Qatari agents, the UNHCR said that al-Obeidy was protected under refugee status, she said. ""We don't have an agreement with the U.N.,"" the Qataris responded. She was beaten in the parking lot by a group of men and women, she said. Her father and sister were also hit, she said. Once at the airport, they were hit some more, she said. Amnesty International called al-Obeidy's deportation ""outrageous,"" saying the action taken by the Qatari government ""is a serious breach by Qatar of its international obligations."" ""Nothing can justify what the authorities of Qatar have done: They have compromised this woman's safety notwithstanding the danger she clearly faces,"" the New York-based human rights group said in a statement. An official at the Qatari Embassy in Washington asked CNN to e-mail questions about the deportation, but did not respond to them. The embassy in London also asked for written questions and CNN is waiting to hear back. CNN also placed numerous calls to various ministries in Qatar but could not reach anyone for comment. Friday is not a workday in the country. The hotel in Doha said it did not have anyone available for comment. Kempinski's corporate office in Geneva, Switzerland, was unaware of the incident. An official there said the office may offer a response later. The UNHCR on Friday called the forced return a violation of international law. ""Ms. al-Obeidy has been recognized as a refugee by UNHCR. UNHCR was present at the hotel where Ms. al-Obeidy was staying in Qatar, ready to accompany her to the airport to travel to an emergency transit center in Romania. She was prevented from leaving for this flight in the early hours of Thursday morning,"" UNHCR said. Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her. But, according to Dawaji, she did not blame the rebel group for the beating itself. She told CNN that when she asked her attackers why they were beating her, they said that Mahmoud Shammam and Mahmoud Jibril, both leaders in the Libyan rebel movement, had sent the Qataris an ""urgent letter"" saying that she had to be deported immediately. ""We tried all night to prevent her deportation,"" said Vincent Cochetel of the UNHCR office in Washington. He said the Qatari authorities had informed UNHCR that they had a court order that al-Obeidy's visa had expired; and they ignored UNHCR's arguments that she already had refugee status. UNHCR representatives have spoken with al-Obeidy since she and her family arrived in Benghazi, though the details of those conversations were not disclosed to CNN. Benghazi, in eastern Libya, is the hub of the rebel movement that is battling to oust Gadhafi, Libya's longtime leader. ""Forcibly returning a refugee who survived gang rape not only violates international law, but is cruel and could trigger further trauma,"" said Bill Frelick, refugee program director at Human Rights Watch. ""All eyes are now on the authorities in eastern Libya, who should allow al-Obeidy to leave the country."" Human Rights Watch called on the Transitional National Council to allow al-Obeidy to leave the rebel-controlled area of Libya immediately. The New York-based activist group added that a rebel group spokesman had told the group that she was free to travel domestically and abroad. Al-Obeidy said that the council has warned her not to do any more television interviews or it would hurt her chances of leaving Libya. Al-Obeidy received worldwide attention on March 26 when she burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli while international journalists staying there were having breakfast. She told reporters she had been taken from a checkpoint east of Tripoli and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 men. She was forcibly taken out of the hotel by security forces in a scuffle that was captured by television cameras. She was not heard from again for more than a week as Gadhafi's representatives said they were investigating her claim. Then on April 4, she spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper by phone about the alleged rapes. ""They had my hands tied behind me and they had my legs tied and they would hit me while I was tied and bite me in my body. And they would pour alcohol in my eyes so that I would not be able to see and they would sodomize me with their rifles and they would not let us go to the bathroom. We were not allowed to eat or drink,"" she said, speaking through a translator. ""One man would leave and another would enter. He would finish and then another man would come in,"" al-Obeidy said. She later fled Libya to Tunisia with the help of two defecting Gadhafi army officers and their families. French diplomats drove her from the border and handed her off to rebel officials -- members of the Transitional National Council -- who organized her flight to Qatar. After arriving in Qatar, al-Obeidy made public statements saying the Transitional National Council was using her. The council denied that, but her presence in Qatar appears to have become an embarrassment to the organization. Qatar's government is allied with the rebels. CNN's Khalil Abdallah and Tim Lister and Journalist Sherif Elhelwa contributed to this report.","NEW: Al-Obeidy says she is warned from doing TV interviews .

"The words that spill out of Elian Gonzalez's mouth now make his great uncle shrug his shoulders. But Delfin Gonzalez says he's not surprised by pro-Cuba comments his nephew made in an interview with CNN this week. ""He understands and says what they have taught him,"" Delfin Gonzalez told CNN en Español from his Miami home on Wednesday. ""He cannot understand anything else."" Fourteen years after Elian Gonzalez made headlines as the subject of a bitter international custody battle, he spoke to CNN this week from a youth conference in Ecuador. It's his first trip abroad since the U.S. government removed him at gunpoint from his relatives' home in Miami and, after a legal battle, sent him back to Cuba to live with his father. When asked by CNN en Español to describe what his life has been like since he left Miami, Elian Gonzalez said ""magnificent."" ""I have experienced unprecedented, great growth, as a Cuban revolutionary, joining the cause,"" he said. Delfin Gonzalez says he remembers when his young nephew had quite a different perception of the island. ""One time he asked me, 'How do the cats meow in Cuba?' I told him, 'Well, just like they do everywhere.' He said, 'No, there they say, 'Miami, Miami.'"" Elian Gonzalez, who turned 20 last week, was just 6 years old when he was found clinging to an inner tube after the tiny boat he was traveling in from Cuba sank on the way to the United States. His mother and nine other people in the boat drowned. After his rescue, he was placed with relatives in Miami, who wanted to keep him in the United States. But Gonzalez's father fought to bring him back to Cuba. Then-Cuban leader Fidel Castro led massive protests in Cuba demanding Gonzalez's return. The case of the telegenic boy became a flashpoint between supporters and opponents of Castro's revolution. Eventually, a U.S. federal court ruling sent him back to Cuba. It's a day Delfin Gonzalez says he'll never forget. ""Here, we remember everything, because it was a historic moment,"" he said. ""A boy who came miraculously to the United States, and circumstances made them return him."" In the Miami neighborhood where the boy lived, one neighbor says he still remembers that day and asks himself what would have happened if he hadn't been sent back to Cuba. ""I imagine that it would be a bit better, at least more freedom,"" Ramon Garcia said. Delfin Gonzalez said he has no doubt about that. ""Of course it would be better. This is a free and democratic country where you can study what you want and you have free movement,"" he said. Elian Gonzalez now studies engineering at a military school in Cuba and appears to be emerging as a new spokesman for the Cuban government. ""I haven't suffered any consequences because of what happened. It has not affected me psychologically, but it has been hard for my family,"" he told CNN en Español this week. ""Those were tough times."" Delfin Gonzalez said family in Miami has only one consolation. ""For us,"" he said, ""the only satisfaction that we are left with is that he is alive.""","Elian Gonzalez's great uncle says he'd be better off in the United States .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Monday for Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and two of his relatives. ICC Judge Sanji Mmasenono Monageng read aloud the decision to issue warrants for Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi. Saif Al-Islam Gadhafi is a close adviser to his father. His arrest warrant came two days after his 39th birthday. Al-Sanussi serves as Gadhafi's head of intelligence. The warrants are ""for crimes against humanity,"" including murder and persecution, ""allegedly committed across Libya"" from February 15 through ""at least"" February 28, ""through the state apparatus and security forces,"" the court said in a news release. In Misrata, where fighting has raged, a crowd cheered Monday following the news from the court. The announcement at The Hague came as fighting inside Libya inched closer to the capital. A rebel fighter, Hassan al-Jiwali, told CNN that rebel forces were 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Tripoli on Monday. Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the international court's authority, and the court does not have the power to enter Libya and arrest the leaders. Many of those cheering in Misrata saw the news as a sign that the world recognizes the conduct that rebels say Gadhafi's regime has been engaged in. The three-judge Pre-Trial Chamber I at The Hague found ""reasonable grounds to believe that the three suspects committed the alleged crimes and that their arrests appear necessary in order to ensure their appearances before the court,"" the announcement said. The court also believes the warrants are needed to ensure that the three men ""do not continue to obstruct and endanger the court's investigations; and to prevent them from using their powers to continue the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of the court."" The U.N. Security Council referred the matter to the ICC through a resolution February 26, following widespread complaints about Gadhafi's efforts to crush a rebellion. The resolution said that, while ""states not party to the Rome Statute have no obligations under the statute, the Security Council urged all states and concerned regional and other international organisations to cooperate fully with the court and the prosecutor."" Gadhafi's backers rejected the court's authority. ""This court is nothing but a cover to the military operations of NATO,"" said Libyan Justice Minister Mohammed Al Qamod. ""It is merely a political tool for exerting pressure and political blackmail against sovereign countries."" Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Ka'eem offered a similar view: ""Both the international criminal court and the chief prosecutor have neither the legal competence nor the moral compass in any way to pass judgment on anyone, let alone the Libyan people,"" he said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the warrant for Gadhafi is another indication that the Libyan leader ""has lost his validity."" ""it's another step in the process of holding him accountable,"" Carney told reporters. The United Nations issued a statement Monday about the arrest warrants, noting that ""hundreds of people are confirmed to have been killed since opposition forces rose up against the regime of Mr. Gadhafi in February as part of a wider pro-democracy movement across North Africa and the Middle East."" The European Union said it ""fully supports"" the court and underscores that the court's Libya investigation ""is an independent judicial process which must be fully respected."" Not everyone was cheering the news. Michael Rubin, an analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the court's move could damage efforts to get Gadhafi to end his 42-year reign, because he would not seek refuge in a country that is a party or signatory to the Rome Statute. ""The ICC's arrest warrant symbolizes the dirty underside of international law,"" Rubin said. ""While the ICC makes itself feel good and diplomats can chatter about their commitment to international law, the fact of the matter is their action takes off the table any possibility that Gadhafi could flee to a retirement haven outside Libya. In effect, the ICC arrest warrant tells Gadhafi to fight to the death."" Most African countries are parties or signatories to the Rome statute. The ICC website lists a total of 47 non-signatories in the world, 13 of them in Africa and the Middle East. Ali Ahmida, an analyst at the University of New England who was born in Libya, said the ICC decision ""complicates"" the matter. ""Since last week, things were heating up toward an exit strategy for Gadhafi and his sons, either inside or outside Libya in another African country,"" Ahmida said. Some rebel leaders in the Transitional National Council said they would consider allowing Gadhafi to stay inside Libya, and both sides were starting to indicate a compromise was possible, Ahmida said. But now, the regime ""may circle the wagons a little more,"" and Gadhafi will think, ""'I'm a hunted criminal and should pursue civil war to the end,'"" Ahmida said. While the ICC decision is justified, Ahmida said, cynics in the region will ask why Gadhafi was selected and not others. ""Why not (former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak? Why not (former Tunisian President Zine El-Abidine Ben) Ali?"" Mubarak and Ali both gave up power following protests in their countries. ""The court is selecting some dictators to indict, and being silent about others. That may be the biggest issue for the court,"" Ahmida said. When asked about those suggestions, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States ""believes that the decision to refer the case to the ICC was the right decision; that the ICC has spoken now about the need for justice and accountability. With regard to whether this hurts or helps, it doesn't change the fact that Gadhafi's got to take the message that it's time to go."" The issue of Libyan casualties led the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary, with the exception of a ground invasion, to protect civilians. NATO began bombing military targets a short time later. The International Criminal Court action comes a day after the African Union announced Gadhafi will not be part of its next attempt to map out a peace deal in Libya. It was unclear who would represent the Libyan government in negotiations, or when negotiations might occur. Journalists were not allowed to ask questions following Sunday's meeting of the African Union's special committee on Libya in Pretoria, South Africa.

"(CNN) -- In a move that drew fire from medical marijuana advocates, federal authorities raided 26 medical marijuana dispensaries in 13 Montana cities, saying they have probable cause to believe that the businesses are involved in large-scale trafficking. The search warrants executed Monday are the culmination of an ""18-month, multiagency investigation into the drug trafficking activities of criminal enterprises,"" Michael Cotter, U.S. attorney for the District of Montana, said in a statement Tuesday. In addition, he said, civil seizure warrants for financial institutions in Bozeman, Helena and Kalispell were executed, seeking up to $4 million. Authorities did not disclose items that were seized pending the filing of search warrant returns in federal court. Probable cause exists to believe that the shops were involved in conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana and evade financial reporting requirements, authorities said. No criminal charges have been filed. ""When criminal networks violate federal laws, those involved will be prosecuted,"" Cotter said in the statement. Individuals who are in compliance with state law are not the focus of the investigation, authorities said. Items seized included marijuana plants, computers and cell phones, CNN affiliate KULR reported. In some instances, the station said, bank accounts were frozen. Medical marijuana advocates cried foul. ""Not only are these raids very harmful and unnecessary, they are aimed at undermining the democratic process by preventing the people and legislators of Montana from addressing their own public health concerns,"" Steph Sherer, executive director of Americans for Safe Access, said in a statement. The organization describes itself on its website as ""the largest national member-based organization of patients, medical professionals, scientists and concerned citizens promoting safe and legal access to cannabis for therapeutic use and research."" Sherer said, ""there is no doubt the raids were times to take advantage of a vulnerable political time for Montana patients."" Shere testified last week at a state Senate hearing on a bill to repeal the state's medical marijuana initiative. The measure, which passed the Montana House last month, died in committee, the organization said. ""The public has been hoodwinked into believing the feds have changed their policy with respect to medical marijuana, but the evidence points to the same aggressive tactics under President Obama that we saw for years under the Bush administration,"" Sherer said in the statement. Tom Daubert, who authored the 2004 medical marijuana initiative, told the Great Falls Tribune newspaper that the raids had a ""chilling effect"" on the state's medical marijuana community. Mort Reid, the owner of one dispensary, Canni-RX in Billings, told KULR he closed his doors briefly Monday after hearing of raids elsewhere because he didn't want his patients or staff to be alarmed if he was raided. He reopened later in the day but said he is still concerned a search warrant might be executed there. Reid said he has written Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer and said the issue is now one of states' rights. ""We still have patients to serve and I think we as a company have to put their needs above whatever motives are behind the federal authorities,"" Reid told KULR.","Authorities allege the 26 dispensaries are involved in trafficking .

"The United States said Thursday it flew stealth bombers over South Korea to participate in annual military exercises amid spiking tensions with North Korea. The B-2 Spirit bombers flew more than 6,500 miles from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to South Korea, dropping inert munitions there as part of the exercises, before returning to the U.S. mainland, the U.S Forces in Korea said in a statement. The mission by the planes, which can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons, ""demonstrates the United States' ability to conduct long range, precision strikes quickly and at will,"" the statement said. The U.S. military's announcement earlier this month that it was flying B-52 bombers over South Korea to participate in the routine exercises prompted an angry reaction from the regime of Kim Jong Un, which has unleashed a torrent of threats in the past few weeks. Analysis: What's Kim Jong Un up to? There was no immediate reaction to the U.S. statement Thursday from the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""The United States is steadfast in its alliance commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea, to deterring aggression, and to ensuring peace and stability in the region,"" the statement said, using South Korea's official name. ""The B-2 bomber is an important element of America's enduring and robust extended deterrence capability in the Asia-Pacific region."" The disclosure of the B-2 flights comes a day after North Korea said it was cutting a key military hotline with South Korea, provoking fresh expressions of concern from U.S. officials about Pyongyang's recent rhetoric.  There are several hotlines between North and South Korea. ""North Korea is not a paper tiger so it wouldn't be smart to dismiss its provocative behavior as pure bluster,"" a U.S. official said Wednesday. North Korea's threat: Five things to know . U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke by phone to his South Korean counterpart, Kim Kwan-jin, on Wednesday evening, Pentagon Press Secretary George Little said, noting the ""heightened tension on the Korean Peninsula."" U.S. officials concerned over North Korea's 'ratcheting up of rhetoric' The recent saber-rattling from Pyongyang has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea, as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is null and void. On Tuesday, the North said it planned to place military units tasked with targeting U.S. bases under combat-ready status. Most observers say North Korea is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile, but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. Tensions escalated on the Korean Peninsula after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive regime. Pyongyang has expressed fury over the sanctions and the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises, which are due to continue until the end of April. The North has claimed that the exercises are tantamount to threats of nuclear war against it. Sharp increases in tensions on the Korean Peninsula have taken place during the drills in previous years. The last time the North cut off military communications with the South was during similar exercises in March 2009.

"The news that a Spanish woman has contracted the Ebola virus has raised questions about what went wrong in the treatment of two patients evacuated from West Africa to Madrid, allowing the potentially deadly disease to spread from person-to-person outside Africa for the first time in this outbreak. How did the patient contract Ebola? The woman is a nursing assistant at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid; it is thought she was exposed to the virus while trying to help one of the two Spanish people flown there for treatment after they contracted Ebola in West Africa. Spanish health authorities insist all health protocols and procedures were followed in the care of missionaries Manuel Garcia Viejo, who became sick while working in Sierra Leone, and Miguel Pajares, who was taken ill in Liberia. Both men eventually died of the disease. An investigation is under way into how the woman, who is in her 40s and married, was infected. It is thought there was no obvious problem, such as a torn glove, which would have raised the alarm; concerns only emerged when she became ill on September 30, four days after the death of the second patient. Dr. William Schaffner, from the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said the woman's infection was likely due to ""gaps in the safety protocol, the infection control precautions"" at the hospital. ""Healthcare workers are at really great risk when they take care of patients with Ebola, and we anticipate that from time to time there may be one or perhaps even a few cases of transmission from patients with Ebola, during healthcare, to their healthcare providers,"" Schaffner told CNN. However, some Spanish unions are blaming the government, saying they warned that personal protective equipment used by the medical team did not meet the highest standard; authorities say proper procedures were followed. Epidemiologist Professor David Heymann, who worked on the world's first Ebola outbreak and now heads Public Health England, said the precise cause of the infection may never be known. ""The barrier was let down somehow,"" he said. ""It could be something as simple as a defect in a rubber glove, or a momentary lapse, or it could be something major that the nurse does not want to report. These things do happen; it's not clear and may never be."" How can hospitals protect medical staff from Ebola? The Ebola virus is transmitted by contact with the body fluids of an infected person, so hospitals must take steps to ensure their workers are protected from them. ""There are protocols that if you follow carefully, you diminish greatly the likelihood that you're going to get infected,"" explained immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci, of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that medical personnel treating those with Ebola wear protective clothing including gloves, an impermeable gown and eye protection. It says extra precautions should be taken when the patient's condition means they are likely to come into contact with ""copious amounts of blood, body fluids, vomit or feces."" Fauci says that to keep medical staff safe ""it's more than just goggles and gloves. It's a hood, it's a gown, it's a rubber apron, it's coverings for your shoes. It's everything that can keep a splash of body fluid away from you."" And he says that as well as having the right equipment, workers must know how to use it effectively, and to dispose of it properly. ""It's important to wear it, but it's important also that when you take it off, you take it off properly,"" he insists. ""It is conceivable that you could be protected while you're doing everything you need to do with the patient and then as you remove the protective material that could be a point of vulnerability."" Is the hospital equipped to handle Ebola cases? The medical facility where the nurse's assistant worked, Madrid's Carlos III, is a specialist hospital for infectious diseases. In addition to Spain, patients suffering from Ebola have been evacuated to Germany (two), France (one), the UK (one) and Norway (one); this is the first time a medical worker treating one of them has been infected. ""The hospitals where the patients are being taken are supposed to be equipped and ready to deal with Ebola patients,"" European Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent told CNN. All members of the medical team which treated Garcia Viejo are now under observation, as are the woman's husband and the ambulance crew which took her to hospital. READ MORE: Scientists race to develop Ebola drugs . Is Ebola likely to spread in Europe? Following news of their colleague's illness, medical staff in Spain have taken to the streets complaining at the way the government has handled the Ebola cases. ""We were kind of expecting this,"" said Paloma, a nursing assistant at Madrid's La Paz Hospital. ""At least I was expecting it, because this is not a game to be played in the way that they've done it. It's a very worrying matter, and they have not handled it correctly."" Some argue that the two missionaries were so ill they should not have been brought to Spain for treatment, exposing many others to the disease. But experts insist the risk of an Ebola outbreak outside Africa are still very slim. ""If protocols are being followed, it's highly unlikely that an outbreak could happen in the EU,"" said Vincent. ""But zero risk doesn't exist, particularly in a hospital where staff are dealing with sick people. ""We need to find out as soon as possible what happened and if we need to revise procedures."" READ MORE: How the Ebola virus spreads . What lessons can be learned from the Spanish case? Experts say the news from Madrid should act as a wake-up call to healthcare authorities around the world of the risks their frontline staff face, of the precautions that need to be taken when dealing with Ebola, and of the need for everyone to be prepared. ""If you're running a hospital or if you're a public health administrator in a big city, you should definitely be concerned by this,"" said Dr. Alexander van Tulleken of Fordham University in New York. ""This should be a disease you can prevent by really rigorously adhering to protocols, and what we're seeing [with this case] is that even if teams notionally know what they're doing -- there's a protocol in the drawer, they've ordered the right kind of suits - that people have to be really well-versed in putting them on, in taking them off, in practicing. ""This is about drill, practice and preparedness,"" he said. ""Every hospital everywhere needs to be aware that this could come to them,"" insisted Professor Heymann. ""They need protocols in place, and they need to be ready to deal with it.""

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors on Thursday questioned George Anthony, the father of murder suspect Casey Anthony, about gas cans he reported missing around the time his 2-year-old granddaughter disappeared. Casey Anthony's former boyfriend Anthony Lazzaro testified the day before that he had helped her break into the shed at her parents' home on June 23, 2008 -- one week after her little girl, Caylee Anthony, was last seen. According to testimony, however, neither Anthony's parents nor Lazzaro knew that the child was missing, as Anthony insisted that she was in the care of a nanny at the time. Lazzaro said Casey Anthony called him and told him she had run out of gas. They got the gas cans, and Anthony put the gas in her car herself, he testified. On June 24, George Anthony called police to report the break-in and report the gas cans missing. He testified that he saw his daughter later in the day and argued with her about the missing cans, because he had a hunch she had them, as she had taken the cans before. Anthony said that when he went to get them out of his daughter's car, she bristled, brushed past him, quickly opened the trunk and retrieved the gas cans, throwing them down and telling him, ""Here's your f---ing gas cans."" The gas cans are significant to the case because a piece of duct tape on them appears to be the same as that found on the mouth of Caylee's skeletal remains, which were found six months after the child went missing. The type of tape, prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick told jurors in her opening statement this week, is relatively rare. ""I'm probably the one who put that on"" the gas can, George Anthony said, adding that at the time, after Caylee was reported missing, he and his wife were ""running on fumes. ... I'm trying to do the best I can."" He said that when his daughter returned the gas cans to him, there was no tape on them. But he said a vent cap on one was gone, and he put the tape on ""because I didn't want a gas smell in the shed or house."" George Anthony had several testy exchanges with defense attorney Jose Baez during his testimony, at one point telling him, ""You're badgering me. You're trying to get me upset."" In addition to capital murder in Caylee's death, Casey Anthony, now 25, faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and providing false information to authorities. If she is convicted by the jurors -- seven women and five men -- she could face the death penalty. Anthony has pleaded not guilty and denies harming her daughter or having anything to do with her disappearance. Baez has said that once all the facts are known, it will become clear that his client is not guilty. The Orlando trial, which comes after nearly three years of legal twists, turns and delays, has garnered interest nationwide. George Anthony testified Tuesday and was re-called to the stand Thursday for part of the morning session. Also testifying Thursday was Ricardo Morales, who dated Anthony briefly in early 2008 before she met Lazzaro. Morales testified that the two continued their friendship after breaking up, to the point that Anthony stayed overnight at his house June 9 and 10, 2008. She brought Caylee with her, he said, and the three slept in his bed, with Anthony in the middle. He denied any sexual contact with Anthony while Caylee was in the bed. He said that after June 10, he never saw Caylee again, but he saw Anthony on July 1 and again on July 15, when she picked him up at the airport after he had vacationed in Puerto Rico. At no time did she mention that her daughter was missing or had been kidnapped, he testified, and he saw no change in her demeanor. She was ""happy, smiling. She was asking us how our trip was,"" Morales said. ""Just normal Casey."" Morales was one of numerous people, including Lazzaro, his roommates and other acquaintances, who said Anthony did not mention Caylee's disappearance between June 16, 2008, the day the little girl was last seen, until the evening of July 15, when Anthony's mother, Cindy, reported her missing to authorities. Each witness testified they saw nothing different in Anthony's demeanor and that she did not tell them her child was missing or had been kidnapped. However, under cross-examination by Baez, those who saw Anthony and her daughter together testified that Caylee was well taken care of and that Anthony, at least to their knowledge, appeared to be a good mother. Dante Salati, who testified that he went to high school with Anthony, testified that he saw genuine affection between her and Caylee. Asked by Baez whether he found it shocking that he wouldn't notice a change in her behavior after the little girl disappeared, Salati said yes. Melissa England, an acquaintance who shopped and had dinner with Anthony on July 3, recalled her saying that she was thinking of leaving Orlando for a place with a better school system so Caylee ""could get a better education."" England also testified that Anthony received a call and told some other friends that she had car trouble and couldn't go out with them. As she hung up, Anthony remarked, ""Oh, my God, I'm such a good liar,"" England said. Anthony, listening to her testimony, shook her head. England did recall that as she and Anthony were out with others that night, Anthony received several calls and became upset and cried, eventually saying she wanted to leave. England said her boyfriend told her Anthony was arguing with her brother, but Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. ordered the jurors not to consider that statement after Baez objected. Anthony repeatedly visited at least two nightclubs during the month Caylee was missing and participated in a ""hot body"" contest at the Fusion Ultra Lounge. Two women who worked as ""shot girls"" selling alcoholic shots to club patrons there testified Wednesday that Anthony was a sort of overseer, telling them where to be and making sure they weren't harmed. Lazzaro and his roommates said that when they asked where Caylee was, Anthony told them she was with her nanny, mentioning that the nanny was taking her to Universal Studios and to the beach. In the early days of the investigation, Anthony said the nanny, who she said was named Zenaida Gonzalez and nicknamed ""Zanny,"" had kidnapped Caylee. Authorities were never able to find the nanny but did track down a woman with that name who denied ever meeting Anthony and later sued her for defamation. One friend of Anthony's, Matthew Crisp, testified that he met her for lunch on July 7 and asked about Caylee. Anthony told him ""she was in Sanford on a playdate with one of her girlfriends who also had a child."" Sanford is about 25 miles north of Orlando. The Anthony's next-door neighbor, Brian Burner, testified Wednesday that he was doing yard work outside his house on June 18 when Casey Anthony approached him and asked to borrow a shovel ""to dig up a bamboo root."" She returned it about an hour later, he said. George Anthony testified Thursday that he owns several shovels. Prosecutors allege that Casey Anthony, after conducting searches regarding chloroform on her computer, used chloroform on her daughter, then put duct tape over her nose and mouth, suffocating her. Baez, in his opening statement Tuesday, dropped bombshell allegations, telling jurors that Caylee was not murdered at all, but drowned in the Anthonys' pool on June 16. He said Anthony and her father panicked upon finding the child and kept it secret. He explained Casey Anthony's behavior in the month Caylee was missing by alleging that she was sexually abused starting at age 8 by her father and that she had been schooled from a young age to ""hide her pain."" In his earlier testimony, George Anthony denied ever sexually abusing his daughter or that he found Caylee dead in his pool.

"(CNN)No more pre-mixed drinks. Security at the doors. And sober brothers at every event, guarding the stairs and with key access to each room. Those are some of the rules that fraternities will have to abide by if they want to throw a party, the University of Virginia says. UVA shut down Greek social life on November 21, two days after the publication of a now-discredited Rolling Stone magazine article about an alleged gang rape in a fraternity house on the Charlottesville campus. The article's credibility aside, the university acknowledged this week that it needs to evaluate a broader problem, and said the Greek life ""pause"" was intended to allow leadership to work on improving safety at fraternity and sorority events. Reinstatement comes with a stipulation that each Greek organization agree by January 16 to new rules -- devised by UVA's Greek leadership councils -- for university social events. Among them are requirements that at least three members of a fraternity be ""sober and lucid"" at each fraternity function, and at least one of the ""sober brothers"" have key access to every room in the fraternity house during the party, according to the document. Also, pre-mixed drinks or punches are prohibited from fraternity parties. Beer and wine must be opened and ""poured visibly at the bar by a sober brother.""  And security officers must be hired to monitor the entrance at parties where there are fewer fraternity members than nonmembers. ""I believe the new safety measures recommended by the student leaders in the Greek community will help provide a safer environment for their members and guests,"" UVA President Teresa Sullivan said in a press release. Accusations and contradictions . ""A Rape On Campus,"" the 9,000-word article by Sabrina Erdely in the November 19 issue of Rolling Stone, initially garnered widespread, mostly sympathetic media attention. In the article, a woman identified only as Jackie, claims that she was brutally raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house, while two more gave encouragement, during a party on September 28, 2012, while she was a freshman. Within days, critics began to question some of the story's details, as well as Rolling Stone's decision not to contact the alleged attackers. The Washington Post, CNN and other news outlets followed up, identifying a number of contradictions and discrepancies. Two of Jackie's friends told CNN that numerous details of the alleged attack as related by Rolling Stone were entirely different from what Jackie told them that night. And they said that, while it seemed clear that she had been traumatized, they saw no injuries consistent with an attack as vicious as the article describes. Nonetheless, one of the two friends said, he ""didn't have any doubts"" that the version she told him at the time was true. Phi Kappa Psi said that the man Jackie claimed had lured her to a dark room was never a member. It also cited records showing it did not have a party on the night in question, and said its house doesn't have a side staircase -- important because Jackie described descending such a staircase as she left, bloodied and broken. ""It's not part of our culture. It's just not true,"" said the fraternity's attorney, Ben Warthen. On December 5, the magazine published an editor's note that said ""we apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening"" in late 2012 when the alleged attack occurred. The magazine admitted that Erdely had not contacted the man who Jackie claimed orchestrated the alleged attack, nor did she contact any of the men she said were participants, fearing that they would retaliate against her. In an article detailing the key contradictions, the Washington Post reported that it had interviewed Jackie and that she stood by her story. The Post article came out the same day as the Rolling Stone editor's note. Police are continuing to investigate the allegations, and a state investigation of UVA's treatment of sexual assault allegations is ongoing. Students return from winter break this week, and classes begin Monday for the spring semester. CNN's Brian Stelter contributed to this report.","New safety measures have been imposed on fraternities and sororities at the University of Virginia .

"Jay Carney, who stepped down as White House press secretary in June, is stepping back into the political fray as a commentator for CNN. Carney will make his first appearance on the news network Wednesday night during CNN's coverage of President Barack Obama's prime time address about the extremist group ISIS. ""I'm thrilled to be joining CNN at a time when there is so much happening in the nation and the world,"" Carney said in a statement. Carney is intimately familiar with the media world, having worked at Time magazine for 20 years, three of those as Washington bureau chief. He moved from media to government shortly after Obama's election. Carney was Vice President Joe Biden's communications director in 2009 and 2010, and then became Obama's press secretary in early 2011. Along with television appearances, Carney will regularly contribute to CNN's politics website, which is being revamped this fall. Jay Carney give last White House briefing . Sam Feist, CNN's Washington bureau chief, announced Carney's hiring on Wednesday. ""Jay's unique experience as both a journalist and a White House press secretary make him an invaluable voice for the network as we cover the final two years of the Obama administration and look ahead to the coming campaigns,"" Feist said in a statement. ""We're fortunate to have Jay on our air tonight to provide analysis and insight surrounding the President's address to the nation."" Carney was rumored to be in talks with television networks over the summer. CNN and other networks pay high-profile political types such as Carney with the expectation that the exclusive appearances and ""insider"" commentary will attract viewers and attention. Carney's press secretary predecessor, Robert Gibbs, is also affiliated with a cable news channel: Two years after stepping down from the podium, he joined MSNBC as a paid contributor. Several press secretaries under President George W. Bush also signed up with television networks afterward: Ari Fleischer and Tony Snow were contributors to CNN at different times, and Dana Perino is now a co-host of the Fox News program ""The Five.""","Former Obama spokesman debuts on CNN for President's ISIS speech .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin says neo-fascist far-right groups are firmly behind the putsch -- coup d'etat -- in Kiev and questions the democratic credentials of ""men with black masks and Kalashnikovs"" who became  the poster children of the Maidan for Russians. Does this assessment have any truth to it? In the fast-moving and chronically complex course of events in Ukraine, the issue has been debated from the beginning: the role of the far right in the events that led to the toppling of the Viktor Yanukovych government and in the present and future disposition of political power in the country. There are some known facts: First, far-right, anti-Semitic, anti-Russian and openly fascist groups have existed and do exist as a blight on modern Ukraine. A 2012 European Parliament resolution condemned the main -- but by no means most extreme -- ultra-right party, Svoboda, as ""racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic."" This extraordinary EU resolution contains 18 points of concern over policies embedded in laws of the Ukrainian Rada, or Parliament. A key paragraph reads that the EU  ""is concerned about the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine."" The Parliament stresses that ""racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic views go against the EU's fundamental values and principles."" The resolution also appeals to pro-democratic parties in the Rada ""not to associate with, endorse or form coalitions with this party."" As if to endorse the sentiments of the EU resolution, the leader of Svoboda (or ""Freedom""), Oleh Tyahnybok, is on record saying that Kiev is governed by ""a Jewish-Russian mafia""  and has said Ukrainians bravely fought Muscovites, Germans, Jews ""and other scum"" in World War II. This unsavory constituency, including the ""ultra"" Right Sector movement, manned the barricades in the Kiev uprising, providing ""security"" to the mainstream political opposition leaders and matching the pro-government forces in violent tactics that led to the dozens of dead in and around the Maidan. These rightist-nationalist forces  were in large part responsible for the collapse of the agreement signed in February that called for early parliamentary and presidential elections and a return to the 2004 Ukrainian constitution, which harks back to the ""Orange Revolution"" that brought a pro-West government to power in Ukraine. In backing away from this face-saving compromise, one that was negotiated with the approval of the French, German and Polish governments, and which surely would have resulted in the removal of Yanukovych, moderate opposition leaders essentially capitulated to the far right. The Russian position is also somewhat bolstered by the fact that Svoboda holds key posts in the interim government in Kiev, including that of deputy prime minister. Andriy Parubiy, the commander of the ""Maidan self-defense,"" has been appointed the head of the National Security and Defense Council, and the leader of the Right Sector ultras, Dmitro Yarosh,  is expected to become his deputy chairman.  Svoboda controls the prosecutor general office and the ministries of ecology and agriculture. At very least, the interim government has made bedfellows of some highly suspect and divisive forces. But it is also true to say that many of the specific details of far-right activity and influence are anecdotal and perhaps contradictory. On the one hand, there are reports of Jewish homes in Lviv and the western part of Ukraine being daubed with anti-Semitic slogans; on the other, Ukraine's head rabbi has weighed in with the opinion that anti-Semitism is ""not on the rise."" A group of Jewish groups sent an open  letter to Putin that said, in part, ""Your certainty of the growth of anti-Semitism in Ukraine also does not correspond to the actual facts."" It is also true that far-right forces are on the rise across Europe, including in the ""respectable"" democracies of the West, and that their targets range from Jews to Roma to gays to any ""out"" group, including the miscellany of new immigrants who are encouraged under European Union laws of free movement. Finally, it is true that the long reach of memory evokes images from 70  years ago, those of robust support in western Ukraine for the fascist side during World War II. This is especially true in the east and south of a divided country, those regions that look to Moscow rather than to Washington or Brussels. But these various points do not alter the fact that the European Parliament undertook the extraordinary measure of singling out Ukrainian ultra-nationalism, nor do they gainsay the role of its most influential exponent, Svoboda, in the new interim government. In this context, and even as they may disagree on specific measures to be taken the path toward a prosperous, peaceful, united, democratic Ukraine, sober observers agree that this can be achieved only with the marginalization of the far right. Unfortunately, the appointments of ultra-rightists to the interim government place this in serious question. Looking ahead, we must hope that the meeting in Brussels of the European foreign ministers, including Russia -- the first, we assume, of several -- may create a blueprint for Ukraine based on cooperative solutions rather than confrontation.","Russian President Putin says violent far-right groups are behind coup d'etat in Kiev .

""The Government will not tolerate the existence of online terrorist and extremist propaganda,"" the office said. The U.S. response was more muted. ""We're not going to respond publicly to every new piece of ISIL propaganda,"" the National Security Council said.  The Islamist terrorist group calling itself the ""Islamic State"" is also known as ISIS and ISIL. ""It just shows they are a threat,"" a senior defense official said. ""The United States remains vigilant about threats to U.S. citizens at home and abroad.  Ensuring the safety of our citizens is a top priority.  Our security posture will continue to respond appropriately to protect the American people,"" a senior State Department official said. ""These latest comments from ISIL demonstrate once again that it remains more interested in pursuing its own violent and nihilistic goals rather than advancing any productive agenda for the people of Iraq or Syria.  Beyond that, we don't intend to get in a back and forth with ISIL, or any other terrorist group, regarding its propaganda."" These countries, part of the coalition taking on ISIS, were responding to a new audio recording in which a senior ISIS leader, for the first time, explicitly called for attacks in the United States and on the home soil of Western allies. ISIS leader: Behead Westerners . The leader specifically called for lone-wolf attacks in the United States and France -- two countries that have been conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. The U.S. State Department had no comment to CNN when asked about the message Sunday night. ""Hinder those who want to harm your brothers,"" the ISIS spokesman said. ""The best thing you can do is to strive to your best and kill any disbeliever, whether he be French, American or from any of their allies."" Civilians should not be exempt from brutality, he said.  ""Do not ask for anyone's advice and do not seek anyone's verdict. Kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military, for they have the same ruling. Both of them are disbelievers. Both of them are considered to be waging war."" ""Oh Americans, and oh Europeans, the Islamic State did not initiate a war against you, as your governments and media try to make you believe,"" the ISIS spokesman added. ""It is you who started the transgression against us, and thus you deserve blame and you will pay a great price."" He gave specifics on how to attack Westerners: ""Rig the roads with explosives for them. Attack their bases. Raid their homes. Cut off their heads. Do not let them feel secure. Hunt them wherever they may be. Turn their worldly life into fear and fire. Remove their families from their homes and thereafter blow up their homes."" Al Qaeda has called for similar attacks in the past.  But given ISIS' radical support base, which believes ISIS leaders are the rightful sovereign leaders of all Muslims worldwide, the ISIS pronouncement carries more weight. France: We are not afraid . ""Their threats will not deter our determination to end their acts of violence and rescue persecuted populations,"" Cazeneuve said. ""France is not afraid"" because it is ""not the first time we have been threatened by terrorist groups that attack our values of tolerance, humanism, respect for human rights and democracy,"" he added. ""France is not afraid because it does not intend to give in to terrorist traps. It knows that unity, serenity and citizens' vigilance is the best answer that can be enforced against them.  France is not afraid because it is prepared to respond to its threats."" Separately on Monday, the French government said one of its citizens was abducted in a mountainous region of Algeria. A video claim of responsibility was later released by the Islamist militant group, Jund al-Khilafa fi Ard al-Jazaair, or Soldiers of the Caliphate in Algeria, whose leader recently pledged allegiance to ISIS. The group threatens to kill the hostage in the video, which shows the captive on camera. ""We hereby warn (French President Francois) Hollande, the head of the criminal French State, to stop attacking the Islamic State within 24 hours from this statement, otherwise your citizen will be slaughtered. If you want his life, you must make an official announcement to end your aggression on the Islamic State. You are here being warned,"" says a masked man. Australia: 'Be confident' The Australian Prime Minister's office released a statement Monday saying it is treating the ISIS statement as genuine. ""We are giving our law enforcement and security agencies the resources and legislative powers they need to keep Australia and Australians as safe as possible,"" the office said. But it also fired back at the radical militant group. ISIS ""will claim that our involvement in this international effort is the reason they are targeting us, but these people do not attack us for what we do, but for who we are and how we live,"" the statement said. ""Australians should continue to be confident to go about their daily lives as normal.""","A new video is released of a French hostage, taken in Algeria .

"Here is an unofficial list of potential nominees for the Supreme Court if President Barack Obama is reelected. This list was compiled from a number of legal and political sources, including government officials deeply involved in the selections of Justices Sonia Sotomayor (2009) and Elena Kagan (2010). The Obama administration, like those before, keeps an informal list of possible high court nominees to consider in the event of a sudden vacancy. But serious vetting only begins when such a vacancy occurs or is announced in advance by the retiring justice. Election raises stakes for possible high court vacancies . Kamala Harris, California attorney general . Born 1964. She was elected to her current job in 2010. She is part African-American, part Asian-American. Her father is a Jamaican-born Stanford University economics professor and her mother is an Indian-born (native Tamil) physician who works as a breast cancer specialist. Harris is a former San Francisco district attorney and author of ""Smart on Crime."" Her political savvy, ethnic background, telegenic personality, law enforcement credentials, and early support of President Obama's 2008 candidacy make her a favorite for any high court vacancy in any second-term, and possibly for U.S. Attorney General. Complications: Harris may seek re-election in 2014 and then may run for governor the following year. Judge Paul Watford, 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, San Francisco . Born 1967. His age and race (African-American) have made him a favorite among some liberal court watchers. Named to the appeals court in 2012. Clerked for conservative Judge Alex Kozinski on the 9th Circuit, and later for liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. A former federal prosecutor and law firm partner. Supporters call him an ideological moderate, which may not sit well with progressives seeking a stronger left-leaning voice. Supreme Court possibilities if Romney is elected . Judge Jacqueline Hong-Ngoc Nguyen, 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, San Francisco . Born 1965 in Dalat, Vietnam (as Hong-Ngoc Thi Nguyen). Named to the court in 2012 after two years as a federal district court judge. She could make history as the high court's first Asian-American justice. Nguyen is already the first Asian-American woman to sit on a federal appeals court. A former state judge, federal prosecutor, and private attorney. She moved with her family to the United States when she was 10, just after the fall of South Vietnam to the Communists, and her parents eventually set up a doughnut shop in North Hollywood, California. Kathryn Ruemmler, White House counsel . Born 1971. Has enjoyed a meteoric rise in private practice and government circles. She most famously helped lead the prosecution in the Enron fraud case in 2006. She earned high praise in the White House for helping spearhead legal defense of the health care overhaul bill championed by  President Obama, whose constitutionality was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court. She also supervised the vetting, and shepherded the Kagan and Sotomayor high court nominations through the Senate. No judicial experience, but recall President George W. Bush tapped his White House counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court, before she withdrew from consideration. Toobin: Why are candidates silent on Supreme Court? Mary Murguia, 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, San Francisco . Born 1960. Named to her current job by President Obama in 2010, after service as a federal district court judge in Arizona. The Kansas native is the daughter of Mexican immigrants. Her twin sister is noted civil rights leader Janet Murguia, and her older brother, Carlos Murguia is also a federal judge. Lisa Madigan, Illinois attorney general . Born 1966. Elected as the state's highest law enforcement official in 2002. She is the adopted daughter of longtime Illinois House Speaker Mike Madigan. A former state senator, she worked down the hall from fellow lawmaker Barack Obama. She gained national prominence after seeking a motion to have former Gov. Rod Blagojevich temporarily removed from office in 2008. She also argued a search and seizure case before the justices in 2004. Her long friendship with the president, political skills, and law enforcement background have made her a favorite. Judge Diane Wood, 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Chicago . Born 1950. Has sat on the bench since 1995. Twice a finalist for the high court vacancies in 2009-10. Considered a mainstream liberal, well-regarded by many legal analysts as a strong, articulate progressive voice. Former clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun, and served in both the Reagan and Clinton Justice departments. Like fellow 7th Circuit judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook -- both conservative heavyweights considered for the Supreme Court by President George W. Bush -- Wood teaches part-time at the University of Chicago. Her age may dampen her chances. Judge Merrick Garland, U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit . Born 1952. Finalist for the high court seats that went to Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. A possible compromise choice, considered a relative judicial moderate on the high-profile appeals court. Four current justices came directly from the D.C. circuit. Garland was a former associate deputy attorney general and supervised the criminal prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which could play well in the post 9/11 environment. His perceived ""moderate"" views may not sit well with some liberals.","The Obama administration keeps an informal list of possible Supreme Court nominees .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Officials from the United Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council were in Sanaa, Yemen, on Monday, hoping to help organize a peaceful transfer of power as witnesses reported violence in the streets. Thirty-one people were killed Monday in clashes in Yemen -- 28 in Sanaa and three in Taiz, according to medical officials. On Sunday, at least 26 protesters were killed and more than 550 were wounded -- hundreds of them by gunshots -- when security forces fired live bullets and tear gas at a massive demonstration in the city, a medic said. The death toll was expected to rise because some were in critical condition, witnesses said. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen issued a statement saying the United States ""regrets the deaths and injuries of many people"" in the protests Sunday. ""In this tense situation, we call upon all parties to exercise restraint. In particular, we call on the parties to refrain from actions that provoke further violence."" The U.S. government remains hopeful for a peaceful transition, the statement said. ""Yemen is on a knife edge,"" Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement issued Monday. ""Those who have been protesting peacefully for change are increasingly frustrated by the political deadlock. Meanwhile, eruptions of violence point to a growing risk of civil war. The Yemeni authorities must stop the use of excessive force before the violence spirals out of control."" The Yemeni government has repeatedly denied accusations of excessive use of force, and said the government is committed to establishing a peaceful transfer of power. Yemeni officials have said forces cracked down on those committing acts of violence during protests. State-run news agency said Monday that ""militias, armed gangs of the Muslim brotherhood, and the Al Ahamar gang and al Qaeda snipers"" had attacked parts of the capital, even hospitals. ""The attack on security personnel and civilians continued Monday, resulting in casualties,"" state-run Saba News Agency reported. Amnesty said that since February, 200 people have been killed and more than 1,000 have been injured in protests in Yemen ""as security forces have repeatedly used excessive force, including by firing live ammunition at peacefully gathered protesters."" U.N. envoy to Yemen Jamal Benomar and Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General Abdul Latif al-Zayyani arrived in Yemen on Monday, Saba reported. They will be discussing a GCC proposal for transferring power, the agency said. The proposal, led by the six Arab nations that make up the council, was put forward in May. It would allow Yemen's embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer his executive powers to Vice President Abd Rabo Mansou Hadi within 30 days. According to the proposal, Saleh would then formally resign. Saleh initially indicated he would go along with it, but then refused to sign. The ongoing violence is stepping up pressure for a transition. On Monday, troops were seen shooting randomly at protesters as demonstrations continued throughout the capital on almost every street, witnesses said. All roads leading to Change Square, where thousands have been conducting a seven-month sit-in to call for the resignation of Saleh, remained closed Monday. Saleh, who is recuperating in Saudi Arabia from a June attack on his palace, has vowed to return to Yemen to finish his term. The state-run Saudi Press Agency said King Abdallah bin Abdelaziz Al Saud met Monday with Saleh, who expressed gratitude for the medical care. The king wished ""all our brothers in Yemen will overcome the current crisis,"" SPA reported. A video on YouTube Monday purports to show the body of a 10-month-old child killed by gunmen in Sanaa. According to a medical team in Change Square, the baby was inside his father's vehicle when a stray bullet hit him in the middle of the forehead. The uprising in Yemen is part of the so-called ""Arab Spring,"" in which protesters seeking political reforms have taken to the streets in many countries throughout the Middle East and North Africa.","NEW: Monday's death toll up to 31, including 28 in Sanaa, medical officials say .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Pro-democracy activists took their fight Thursday to the doorstep of Hong Kong's chief executive, sitting down outside his office gates to express their dissatisfaction with him and the central government in Beijing. Some demonstrators say the next step could be occupying the inside of government buildings. It would be a drastic move, but one protest leader says it might be necessary to get officials' attention and bring change. ""We still can't get a normal, acceptable response,"" student leader Joshua Wong, 17, told CNN's Andrew Stevens. ""This is the final action for us."" In some minds, this confrontation has been brewing ever since Hong Kong transitioned in 1997 from British to Chinese control. But tensions have risen after a late August decision giving Beijing control over the slate of Hong Kong chief executive candidates in 2017. Current Chief Executive C.Y. Leung says that year's election is good for citizens, because it will let the city's 5 million eligible voters pick a winner, rather than a 1,200-member committee stacked with Beijing loyalists that chose past leaders. Strong sentiments on the other side have spilled in recent days into large-scale, peaceful civil disobedience on the streets of the Asian financial hub. It's all been dubbed the ""Umbrella Revolution,"" after umbrellas became symbols of the movement when they were used to shield against police tear gas and pepper spray on Sunday. Huge crowds have called for true ""universal suffrage"" -- which is not just one vote per person, but no restrictions on candidates -- and more generally called out Beijing for what they claim is its encroaching control on Hong Kong. And they've also demanded Leung's resignation, accusing of him of siding with China's central government rather than the people of Hong Kong. That's why a few hundred students have moved from the main protest location to the Leung's office. As protester Cyrus Koo, 25, explained: ""We want to disturb the daily life of the chief executive."" 'The students will be put to the test' The activists are open to talks with Chinese or other Hong Kong leaders, but not with Leung, one of the movement's figureheads, Lester Shum, said Wednesday. He demanded the chief executive step down by Thursday night, or else protesters will ""occupy different important government buildings."" This marks a shift, in location and strategy, in the movement that's had a large, constant presence in downtown Hong Kong. Letting up is not an option, according to Kelvin Cheung, a 21-year-old student who was helping sort recyclable trash near the main protest site. ""More pressure must be put on the government,"" Cheung said. ""Otherwise they'll turn a blind eye to our actions."" There's no clear end in sight. The demonstrators haven't budged from their demands; if anything, they've ratcheted them up a few notches in their calls for Leung to step down. Yet both Hong Kong and Chinese officials have been adamant, refusing to move off their positions and calling the protests ""illegal."" Suraj Katra, a CNN iReporter who works for a non-profit in the city, said late Wednesday that demonstrators ""seemed exhausted"" but still high-spirited, whether they were singing songs or applauding speeches. Katra added, ""The future seems uncertain, and the students will be put to the test."" All sides call for calm, amid debate over next steps . To date 83 people -- 53 males and 30 females -- have been injured in the protests, according to a government media officer. The official would not comment on the nature or extent of the injuries. The biggest clashes came Sunday. Aside from that day, things have been relatively calm and peaceful and, outwardly, it seems like leaders on both sides want to keep it that way. Sophie Richardson, from the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, said that Hong Kong authorities have shown restraint, aside from Sunday, isn't surprising. This is the biggest protest in the past two decades, but it's not the only one they've dealt with. ""Hong Kong has a long history of managing large protests reasonably well,"" Richardson said. ""I think the leadership in Hong Kong realized very quickly that, by virtue of sending police out in riot gear on Sunday, they were sending the wrong message and provoking exactly the response they didn't want -- which was more people coming out onto the streets."" Hui Chun-tak, the chief superintendent of the police public relations branch, said at a joint police and emergency services news conference that although the protests remained calm, police would continue to monitor them to ensure public order and safety. ""Police appeal again to the protesters to continue to stay calm, and to leave the locations orderly and peacefully as soon as possible, so that the inconvenience caused to the general public could be minimized,"" he said. He also urged protesters to give way to emergency vehicles. Wong, the student protest leader, stressed that ""peace and nonviolence"" are fundamental to his movement's approach. He acknowledged that not everyone who supports his cause is ready to take over government buildings. Cheung is among those wary of resorting to ""very controversial"" tactics like that one, expressing concern it may cause ""conflicts"" with the police and government. His classmate Cathy Wong, also 21, was even more cautious. ""We have to keep it peaceful,"" she said. ""We can't destroy the city."" Families, friendships torn apart . But that doesn't mean they can't make a point. That was clear Wednesday, which was National Day -- a holiday dedicated to celebrating the People's Republic of China. At a ceremony in Golden Bauhinia Square, in Wan Chai, Wong and others silently turned their backs and raised their arms in crosses as the Chinese and Hong Kong flags were raised. Others expressed their dissatisfaction in other ways, like local district councilor Paul Zimmerman symbolically carrying a yellow umbrella and calling for Leung and the police commissioner to apologize ""for what they have done."" Benny Tai, co-founder of one of the major protest movements, Occupy Central, told CNN that protesters were ""not pushing or challenging the sovereign status of China over Hong Kong."" ""We want a right that we should enjoy, no more and no less,"" he said. ""We hope that leaders in Beijing should be able to listen and ... respond to the demands of Hong Kong people."" Despite the huge turnout on the streets, not everyone in Hong Kong is behind the protest movement. Leung has backing from pro-Beijing groups like the Silent Majority for Hong Kong, which have had their own rallies. They argue that pro-democracy activists will ""endanger Hong Kong"" and create chaos. Andy Chan, a 57-year-old in Causeway Bay, told CNN he thought democracy should come ""step by step."" ""Hong Kong should be stable, everything should be stable. I don't want the stock market or the property market to be down to a horrible level."" It's not just Hong Kong's economy that could be disrupted or torn apart due to what CNN's Ivan Watson calls this ""polarizing"" debate. ""The longer it goes on, the longer that these disputes -- that, in some cases, are splitting apart family members and friends -- the worst those relations are going to get,"" Watson said. ""And it's going to be a true test."" CNN's Euan McKirdy, Wilfred Chan, Richard Roth, Pamela Boykoff and Chieu Luu contributed to this report.","NEW: CNN iReporter in Hong Kong: ""The students will be put to the test""

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- One person was killed in an anti-government protest in the Yemeni city of Aden on Wednesday, eyewitnesses reported, while human rights activists accused pro-government demonstrators of beating students after a similar protest in the capital, Sanaa. Witnesses in Aden said the victim was an 18-year-old who had been shot by security forces trying to disperse the crowd. Video distributed by student activists appeared to show the youth being carried away, bleeding heavily from his left side. But CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video, and there was no immediate confirmation of the fatality from hospital officials. The Aden protest drew thousands of demonstrators, mostly students, to the city's Al Mansoora district for a sixth straight day. And in Sanaa, students at Sanaa University rallied inside the gates of the campus in a demonstration organized by the head of the university's student union, said Omar Al-Nihmi, a third-year media student at the school. The three students injured in Sanaa were attacked while on their way home from the university demonstration, human rights activist Abdul Rahman Barman said. Barman said he took one of the students to the hospital with head injuries from being hit with sticks, but the other two had only minor injuries. The students started out calling for an improved curriculum, for removal of the university dean and for security forces to remain off-campus. But about 90 minutes into the event, the mood turned anti-government, said third-year student Salah Al-Janadi. More students showed up, both Al-Nihmi and Al-Janadi said, and the protesters began chanting anti-government slogans such as ""The people want the fall of the regime"" and ""Oh Ali, son of Saleh, your regime is no good."" They also chanted, ""Our protests are peaceful and we don't have weapons."" Shortly afterward, hundreds of pro-government demonstrators turned up -- but they were outside the university gates, while the students were inside. The pro-government demonstrators began throwing rocks, Al-Janadi said. Al-Janadi said he was told by the protest organizers ""that because today's protest was a student union protest at the university, security forces at the scene would not interfere."" Hundreds of police were on the scene as well. They did not interfere with protesters, Al-Janadi said, but fired bullets into the air, successfully dispersing the crowds. It was at least the sixth day that scuffles had broken out between pro- and anti-government protesters in Yemen, amid unrest and anti-government demonstrations in other Middle Eastern countries. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh has been in power for 32 years and has pledged not to run for re-election when his current term ends in 2013. Journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report for CNN.","NEW: Hospital officials give no immediate confirmation that a demonstrator is killed in Aden .

"A 17-year-old was hit by a truck and killed during a protest in Carupano, Venezuela, a government official said. Authorities are investigating the death of Jose Ernesto Mendez, elected official Cesar Rincones said Monday. For weeks, Venezuela has been mired by deadly protests. Young Venezuelans unhappy with the ravaged economy and rising crime have clashed with security forces, who have fired tear gas and water cannons. Last week, three anti-government protesters died in confrontations in Caracas. The country is grappling with an inflation rate of 56.2%, the highest in the world. Many basic goods are missing from the shelves. Adding to the tension, authorities have issued an arrest warrant for opposition leader Leopold Lopez on charges including conspiracy and murder in connection with the violence. And on Monday, the government said three U.S. diplomats have 48 hours to leave the South American country, accusing them of conspiring against its government. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua accused the U.S. officials of using a visa program as a cover to meet with youth organizers at private universities ""for training, financing and creating youth organizations through which violence is promoted in Venezuela."" The State Department fired back, calling that claim ""baseless and false"" and saying the United States had not yet received any formal notification of the officials' expulsion.","17-year-old hit by a truck and killed during a protest .

"[Breaking news update, posted at 5:48 a.m. ET] . A gang task force arrested a man in connection with a Friday shooting near a high school in Portland, Oregon, police said in a statement Saturday. [Previous story, posted at 3:20 a.m. ET] . Portland police search for shooter after 4 wounded near high school . (CNN) -- Police searched Friday for a man suspected of shooting four young people near a high school in Portland, Oregon, authorities said. All of the wounded were conscious when medical technicians arrived at Rosemary Anderson High School, police said in a statement. Three of the victims were taken to a local hospital. One victim, Taylor Zimmers, 16, is in critical condition. Two more, David Jackson-Liday, 20, and Labraye Franklin, 17, are in fair condition. A 17-year-old girl suffered a grazing wound in the shooting and was treated on the scene. ""All four gunshot victims are affiliated with the school,"" police said. The shooting happened around 12:15 p.m. local time not far from the campus in north Portland, police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said. After being shot, at least three victims ran inside a school building, a caller told authorities. ""I saw him stumble into the school holding his stomach, he said my brother's name and then he fell on the ground,"" one student told CNN affiliate KATU. The suspect may be affiliated with a gang but it's not known if the shooting was gang-related or ""a personal beef,"" Simpson said. An argument may have preceded the shooting. The suspect was described as a male in his late teens or early 20s and he was accompanied by two other males in the same age range. They left the area quickly on foot, Simpson said. He said the police department's gang task force was investigating.  Agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also arrived to assist, he said. The school system website says Rosemary Anderson High enrolls about 200 at-risk students who ""have either been expelled or dropped out of public high school and many are homeless."" All the shooting victims were students at the school or had taken job training or been enrolled in other programs there, Simpson said. The victims were breathing, conscious and talking as they were transported to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Simpson said. The campus was locked down for a while but classes later resumed, Simpson said. Nearby Jefferson High School and Portland Community College were locked down as police sought the shooter, authorities said, but the lockdown was lifted after a few hours. A man who said he's the pastor of one of the shooting victims told KOIN that the shooting was ""heartbreaking."" ""The young man I know attends our church frequently who is, according to my understanding, not involved in any criminal activity, he is a bright young man,"" said Jason Nelson of Cornerstone Community Church of God in Christ.  ""You hear about shootings every day and when it comes close to your school it's heartbreaking."" Another school shooting occurred about six months ago in the Portland area. One person was killed June 10 at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, about 12 miles east of Portland. One person was killed.","Portland police say gang task force is investigating .

"(CNN) -- Western powers slapped sanctions on more than two dozen Russian officials and their allies in Ukraine's Crimea region on Monday, while Ukrainian officials vowed they would never accept the territory's annexation by Russia. In a televised address Monday night, interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said his government would do ""everything possible"" to solve the crisis diplomatically, and he praised his citizens for refusing to respond to Russian provocations with violence. ""The Kremlin is afraid of the democratic future which we are building, and this is the reason for their aggression,"" Turchynov said. ""But this will not be an obstacle to the building of a democratic country."" But he announced a partial mobilization of his country's armed forces and said Ukrainians ""have to unite in one big family, which is ready to protect its home."" Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was ""a strong possibility"" of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. ""I still believe that there is only one solution of this crisis, a peaceful one,"" Yatsenyuk said. ""But we offer peace, and Russia offers war."" The Russian-backed breakaway government in Crimea applied to join with Moscow on Monday after a weekend referendum that Ukraine, the United States and the European Union called illegal. U.S. and EU officials announced sanctions on more than two dozen Russian officials and their allies in the region, which Russian-backed forces seized three weeks ago. In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that recognizes the independence and sovereignty of the Republic of Crimea, says a statement on Russia's Kremlin website. The Russian parliament is expected to vote on whether to annex the breakaway territory in the coming days. Turchynov said Ukraine was willing to hold talks with Russia, ""but we will never accept the annexing of our territory."" The EU sanctions include the top pro-Russian Crimean secessionist leaders, 10 leading Russian lawmakers who have endorsed the annexation of Crimea and three top Russian military commanders. The U.S. sanctions list also includes two top advisers to Russian President Vladimir Putin and ex-Ukrainian President Yanukovych, whose February ouster in the face of widespread anti-government protests sparked the current crisis. In Washington, President Barack Obama warned Moscow: ""Further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world."" ""The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continued Russia military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russia economy,"" he said. Russian official: Proud to be sanctioned . Washington said its sanctions targeted Russian officials and lawmakers, as well as Crimea-based separatist leaders, with financial sanctions for undermining ""democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine."" Obama's order freezes any assets in the United States and bans travel for the 11 people named. Among those sanctioned were ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and aides to Putin. But one of the Putin aides named in the U.S. sanctions called it ""a great honor"" to be singled out for American punishment. ""I consider the decision of the Washington administration as a recognition of my service to Russia,"" Vladislav Surkov told Russian news outlet MK. And in Brussels, Belgium, European Union international policy chief Catherine Ashton announced sanctions against 21 people ""responsible for actions which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine."" She called the weekend vote ""illegal"" and ""a clear breach of the Ukrainian Constitution,"" and she urged Russia not to follow up by annexing the territory. ""We want to underline very clearly that there is still time to avoid a negative spiral and to reverse current developments,"" she said. More measures are expected to follow in a few days, when EU leaders meet for a summit in Brussels, Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister Linas Linkevicius wrote in a message on Twitter. Diplomatically, Sunday's referendum has put the United States and Russia on the kind of collision course not seen since the Cold War. Economically, it's unclear how much such a coupling will cost Russia. ""These are pinpricks,"" Russian journalist and CNN analyst Vladimir Pozner said of Monday's sanctions. Some officials won't be able to travel to the United States, but they ""probably won't lose a lot of sleep over it,"" he told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" But Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, said the sanctions will show Putin that if Russia annexes Crimea, ""This is just the beginning of sanctions, not the end."" Crimea is home to 2 million people, most of them ethnic Russian. Moscow strongly backed Sunday's referendum, which the region's leaders declared won with an overwhelming 96.7% vote in favor of leaving Ukraine. Russian lawmakers have said they will welcome Crimea with open arms, but members of the ethnic Ukrainian and Muslim Tatar minorities had said they would boycott the vote. Yatsenyuk said Moscow appeared ready to attempt a similar play in other Russian-speaking areas of Ukraine, starting with demonstrations by what he called ""political tourists"" with foreign passports. ""Look (at) the last rallies that happened in Donetsk and in Kharkiv and in Lugansk,"" he said. ""They gathered from 500 people up to 4,000 people. But they expected to have 50,000 people. So we talked to the people. We tried to address this issue in the right manner, trying to convince Ukrainians that the biggest asset we have is our country."" Earlier, Yatsenyuk threatened dire consequences for the Crimean politicians who had called the vote, threatening to try them in Ukrainian and international courts. Andrii Parubii, the secretary of the Ukrainian parliament's National Security and Defense Council, told lawmakers the protesters included ""elite special units that are trying to arrive to Ukraine with weapons, and that are trying to implement a joint plan of the same scenario that was conducted in Crimea."" Defense Minister Ihor Tenyukh reported Sunday that Ukrainian troops and equipment are being moved to the east and south after a weekend Russian incursion into the town of Strilkove, northeast of Crimea. About 60 Russian troops took part in the operation, which the Russians said was needed to prevent a possible terrorist attack on oil assets, according to Ukrainian border guards. The area supplies electricity, fresh water and natural gas to the Crimean Peninsula. MAP: Why the EU and U.S. are out of step on Russia sanctions .

"Phoenix police were searching Wednesday for a 70-year-old man suspected in the shooting of three people, one of whom died, in an office building. Arthur Douglas Harmon had gone to the building to discuss ""some type of litigation,"" Phoenix Police Public Information Officer Tommy Thompson told CNN affiliate KTVK. After the meeting, at about 10:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET), Harmon shot Steven Singer, 48; a 43-year-old man who was in critical condition, and a 32-year-old woman, Thompson said. The law firm of Osborn Maledon identified one of its attorneys, Mark Hummels, as one of the victims. He was involved in a client mediation when he was shot, the Phoenix firm said. ""We believe the two men were his targets,"" Thompson said. The woman, whose injury was not life-threatening, ""just happened to be in the way when the shooting occurred."" Harmon then fled in a 2013 Kia Optima, Arizona license plate AVS-2052, he said. Harmon shot at a  witness who was following him, Thompson said. ""Anybody who contacts him needs to be aware that he is armed and dangerous,"" he said. Two other people who were not shot were also taken to a hospital, one for ""some other type of injury not related to gunfire,"" and the other ""may have been related to stress,"" Thompson said. Former astronaut Mark Kelly referred to the shooting during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington on gun violence. ""There's 50 or so police cars on the scene,"" he said. Kelly and his wife, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, this month launched Americans for Responsible Solutions, which seeks to raise money to counter the influence of the gun lobby. Two years ago, Giffords was shot in the head by a gunman in a parking lot in Tucson.","One of three shooting victims dies of injuries, Phoenix police say .

"(CNN) -- After a day of progress against a huge wildfire, crews in Arizona were bracing for Saturday's predicted higher winds and low humidity -- conditions that will make underbrush a tinderbox. ""The weather conditions will be going back to less favorable conditions,"" said John Helmich, spokesman for the Southwest Interagency Incident Management team. Wind gusts of up to 30 miles per hour were possible in some areas of the massive fire, forecasters said. Thousands of firefighters were able to concentrate Friday on ""burnout fires,"" intended to burn ground fuel that feed the large fire, officials said. Crews were able to keep the fire from crossing into New Mexico. And, Helmich said, they continued their ""absolutely fantastic"" effort to build containment lines and save thousands of residences and structures. The flames have consumed 29 homes, 22 of them in the evacuated city of Greer. More than 5,200 homes are threatened, according to officials. Jim Whittington, another spokesman, said Saturday will be a challenge. ""High winds, low humidity are all of the conditions necessary for large fire growth,"" Whittington said. ""We know that the winds are going to come up on Saturday, so we have until then to get as much work done and to get to the point where we feel comfortable to where we can sit there and deal with what the winds throw at us."" Only 5% of the wildfire was contained by Friday evening, officials said. The Wallow Fire has scorched more than 408,876 acres, leaving a giant bear-paw-like burn mark on the map of eastern Arizona. Air and ground crews concentrated on protecting residences and structures in and near the evacuated cities of Springerville and Eagar. More than 3,000 people are working to douse the fire, from the ground and air. About 221 fire engines and 14 helicopters were in use. Power companies said Friday that they are still watching the huge fire and its potential impact on crucial transmission lines that supply power to hundreds of thousands. El Paso Electric said the fire is about 15 miles from lines that serve nearly 400,000 people. The utility is working with partners and other companies on other sources of power if the lines are closed, company spokeswoman Teresa Souza told CNN. If that occurs, customers in southeastern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas, could see rolling blackouts. Tucson Electric Power has two lines about 8 miles from the fire. Those lines carry electricity through the region to Tucson. ""We're watching it carefully,"" spokesman Joe Salkowski said. If the lines are closed or damaged, the company will be able to prevent outages by using other power sources, Salkowski said. Tucson Electric Power has a coal-powered plant about 12 miles northeast of Springerville, which is evacuated. Officials are safeguarding the plant, but its distance from the fire and the grassy terrain make it ""reasonably protected,"" the spokesman said. Meanwhile, authorities were discussing damage caused by the fire with residents in particularly hard-hit communities. Authorities were notifying residents in the community of Greer, where the wildfire destroyed 22 homes and damaged five others, according to information from the Apache County Sheriff's Office posted on the InciWeb incident information site. Officials were also notifying residents in Alpine and Nutrioso, where five homes had been destroyed, the site said. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer declared a state of emergency earlier in the week to mobilize funds for the wildfires in Apache and Greenlee counties. The blaze -- about the size of Houston -- has caused authorities to evacuate thousands of people since the wildfire began sweeping through the Apache National Forest on May 29.

"(CNN)Know who's to blame for this nasty, bone-chilling cold? Elsa! That no-good Queen of Arrendale, with her ""cold never bothered me anyway"" mantra. Well, it bothers the cops in Harlan City, Kentucky. And they've put out an all points bulletin to arrest the Snow Queen from ""Frozen."" ""Suspect is a blonde female last seen wearing a long blue dress and is known to burst into song 'Let it Go!'"" the suspect description read. To be sure, the cops had their tongues firmly planted in their cheek. It's a way, they say, to draw attention to something that's no laughing matter. This miserable cold has turned downright deadly in some cases. Ten people have died in this cold snap in Tennessee -- five of them of hypothermia. ""As a reminder, do take the precautions you need to keep you, your friends, family, neighbors and pets safe during the snow queen's mad spell,"" the department posted in a followup message on Facebook. Frozen sums up the misery in the country's eastern half from Illinois to mid-Florida. The bitter cold has turned Niagara Falls into a static ice-capade and nipped at orange crops in the Sunshine state. Thirty states have wind chill warnings and advisories posted through Friday, and 185 million people are feeling the deep freeze. The Harlan City cops aren't the first, nor will they be the last, law enforcement agency to (jokingly) ID a scapegoat for the cold. Last week, cops in Merrimack, New Hampshire -- fed up with the snow their region has gotten this winter -- put out an arrest warrant for the prognosticating groundhog Punxsutawney Phil. ""We have received several complaints from the public that this little varmint is held up in a hole, warm and toasty,"" the department posted on its Facebook page. ""He told several people that Winter would last 6 more weeks, however he failed to disclose that it would consist of mountains of snow!"" Two years ago, Phil was indicted for lying when winter continued longer than he predicted.","Police in Kentucky put out an APB for the Snow Queen on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- A group representing police in St. Louis says it's infuriated after five St. Louis Rams players raised their hands Sunday in solidarity with protesters upset at Michael Brown's death. The St. Louis Police Officers Association says it's ""profoundly disappointed"" with those football players who sent a silent but strong message before playing Sunday against the Oakland Raiders. Stedman Bailey, Tavon Austin, Jared Cook, Chris Givens and Kenny Britt walked onto the field and raised their palms in the air, demonstrating the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture that protesters in Ferguson have been using for months. Some say that Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, had his arms up when a white police officer, Darren Wilson, shot him to death August 9 in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. Wilson and others say Brown was not trying to surrender and in fact was attacking Wilson. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . A grand jury decided last week not to indict Wilson, leading to protests nationwide. The football players' action sparked widespread reaction across social media. Some drew parallels between what the Rams players did and the black power salute by two black Olympians from the United States at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Reaction to the Rams players' move came as President Barack Obama met Monday with about 50 activists, law enforcement personnel and elected officials as well as members of his Cabinet to discuss what has transpired in Ferguson. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . The football players told CNN affiliate KSDK-TV in St. Louis that they came up with the idea just before the game and wanted their action to represent a solidarity with the people of St. Louis and surrounding areas. ""We wanted to do something. ... This is our community,"" Cook said. Cook hasn't had time to go to Ferguson because he's been busy with the season and also because the area is dangerous and he doesn't want to get caught up in the violence, he said. But his family members spoke to him about what's been happening, he said. ""Definitely I will be making my trip to Ferguson,"" Cook said. Bailey stressed that the players' move was just a way to show support for their community. ""The violence should stop,"" he told KSDK. ""We just want it to stop."" ""What happened was a tragedy, period,"" Austin said, referring to Brown's killing and the ensuing violence. ""There are things out there bigger than football and we notice that."" Coach: Players were exercising free-speech rights . The police association called for the Rams and the NFL to apologize and discipline the players involved. ""We respect and understand the concerns of all individuals who have expressed views on this tragic situation,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. He said that the NFL had nothing further to add and that the players would not be disciplined. Rams Coach Jeff Fisher also told reporters that the players would not be disciplined. ""They are exercising their right to free speech,"" he said. Fisher said he planned to talk to the five players, but hasn't done so yet. ""Those conversations will most likely remain confidential,"" he said. He declined to answer questions about his own feelings about the move, saying he'd prefer to talk to reporters about his team's 52-0 win against the Oakland Raiders Sunday. ""It's my personal opinion, and I firmly believe, that it's important that I keep sports and politics separate. I'm a head coach. I'm not a politician, an activist or an expert on societal issues,"" he said. ""So I'm going to answer questions about the game."" Ferguson fallout: Protests go national . Police leaders meet with team officials . The players ""chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury this week,"" the police association said in a statement. ""The gesture has become synonymous with assertions that Michael Brown was innocent of any wrongdoing and attempting to surrender peacefully when Wilson, according to some now-discredited witnesses, gunned him down in cold blood,"" the police association wrote. The statement quoted the association's business manager, Jeff Roorda, as saying that ""it is unthinkable that homegrown athletes would so publicly perpetuate a narrative that has been disproven over and over again."" ""I'd remind the NFL and their players that it is not the violent thugs burning down buildings that buy their advertisers' products. It's cops and the good people of St. Louis and other NFL towns that do."" Leaders from the St. Louis Police Officers Association and the St. Louis County Police association met with Rams officials Monday, the police groups said in a statement. The talks were ""productive but very preliminary,"" police said. They are expected to continue later in the week. ""We made some progress today and we had a healthy interaction with the Rams,"" Roorda said in a statement after the meeting. ""We feel strongly that they better understand our perspective and the perspective of the law-abiding citizens that support law enforcement."" Austin responded to the police feeling that the players' actions suggested they were taking a side. That wasn't their intention, he said. ""We just want to let the community know that we support them."" Apology vs. no apology . St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar sent an e-mail to his staff saying the Rams' chief operating officer called Monday to apologize. ""I received a very nice call this morning from Mr. Kevin Demoff of the St. Louis Rams who wanted to take the opportunity to apologize to our department on behalf of the Rams for the ""Hands Up"" gesture that some players took the field with yesterday,"" Belmar wrote in the e-mail, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. But the Rams characterized the conversation differently. ""We did not apologize,"" Rams spokesman Artis Twyman told CNN. The team issued a statement saying the organization had ""positive discussions"" Monday with Belmar and other police officials ""during which we expressed our respect for their concerns surrounding yesterday's game.""

"(CNN) -- Nisreen lies listless curled under a blanket, an armed rebel guard at her door. She looks vulnerable, and younger than her age - 19. She has soft features, a heart-shaped face, large brown eyes and full lips. She speaks haltingly, often falling into a tortured silence, unable to verbalize her thoughts and emotions as haunting images of what she did play out like a curse in her mind. ""One of them had facial hair, like this."" She gestures in the shape of a goatee around her mouth, recalling the face of one of the young men she shot dead. Nisreen became an executioner for Moammar Gadhafi's forces. She admits she murdered 11 rebels, all prisoners of the Gadhafi regime. (CNN is not identifying Nisreen with her full name because of her experiences in Gadhafi's all-female brigade.) ""They brought one person in at a time and they said shoot him,"" she tells us, her voice quiet, her words chilling. ""There was someone on either side of me and one behind and they said if you don't shoot we will shoot you."" She pauses, sliding back into that horrific moment. ""I would turn my head away and shoot. I saw the blood dripping, it just kept flowing."" She says she was told the rebels wanted to rape women and pillage the capital. Nisreen was a member of the female unit of Gadhafi's popular militia. She says she was forcibly taken from her mother - who is battling cancer - by the head of the unit, a family friend. She says the two argued, about what she doesn't know. That was around a year ago. She was trained to handle weapons and then kept by her commander at the headquarters of the 77th Brigade, right next to Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound. She and the hundreds of other women who made up her unit were kept isolated, cut off from their families. Some of the women with her were ardent supporters of the regime. She says she wasn't, but she couldn't leave. ""My brother came and tried to get me out,"" she says, but he was threatened and told to leave. When the uprising began in February, she says her female leader summoned her to see the 77th Brigade commander. He raped her. ""I screamed,"" she tells us. It made no difference. She was summoned twice again and raped by two other commanders. Her leader told her she had to bear it. She says all the women in her unit were raped, but they were forbidden to speak about it. As the rebels closed in on Tripoli, she and two other young women were assigned to the Bousalim neighborhood, where some of the heaviest fighting was taking place. It was there that she was forced to be an executioner. ""They were all so young,"" she says of her victims before sliding into yet another heavy, burdened silence. She escaped by jumping out of a second-story window as a firefight erupted behind her. She was captured by rebel fighters and brought to the hospital. Although the rebels plan to put her on trial, many of them seem to pity her, as do the hospital staff. One of her doctors, Nadia Benyounis, says she was speechless when she first heard about her case. ""When I saw her, I thought that she looked like a kid. Her face is so young, innocent, totally innocent,"" she says. ""She lost her life."" ""She was manipulated by Gadhafi forces, unfortunately. Gadhafi manipulated us all."" Benyounis says Nisreen was robbed of everything -- her dignity, her self-worth, her family -- and turned into a killer. ""She is silent all the time."" Benyounis tells us. ""I watch her closely, she tries to sleep all the time to escape from this reality."" But there is no escape. Nisreen's mother is in Tunisia getting cancer treatment. Nisreen says they spoke on the phone and she told her everthing. ""My mother was very upset,"" she says. Her father doesn't know. The family fears he is too ill to bear the news. Her eyes well with tears. ""All I want is to go home,"" she says. ""I want my mother.""","19-year-old says she was told to kill rebels or be killed by Gadhafi's men .

"Batesville, Mississippi (CNN)Investigators ""are looking at the strong possibility"" someone was in the car with a 19-year-old Mississippi woman moments before a fire engulfed the vehicle, a prosecuting attorney said Friday. But District Attorney John Champion would not say what led investigators to believe Jessica Chambers wasn't alone just before the fire burned her and the car Saturday night near a rural road near Courtland, Mississippi. Chambers died Sunday. Since then, investigators have released very few details about the crime. Chambers' funeral will be Saturday in Batesville, a small town in northwest Mississippi. The rewards for information about her case have grown to a total of $11,000. Champion said investigators have talked to the person who called 911 and have cleared them from involvement in the crime. Investigators said they talked to Chambers' relatives and ""there were no family issues,"" the prosecutor said. Champion already has said investigators are treating the case as an arson, and an accelerant was used in the blaze. Three special agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Atlanta were in Courtland on Friday morning looking for clues at the crime scene. The crime scene, next to an asphalt road with no dividing line, is nondescript except for the yellow police tape and the scorch marks on nearby trees and grass. Questions abound about how the former high school cheerleader and her car ended up severely burned in this wooded area. After obtaining warrants and cracking a password, police were able to access Chambers' phone records and are following up on leads, a prosecutor said Thursday. Police are searching her data and text records after obtaining warrants Wednesday that compelled Google and her cell phone provider to give police access to her phone's content, Champion said. Investigators believe her phone will be ""the key to everything,"" the prosecutor said. She received a call before she left her house, he said. On Thursday, Champion spoke at a news conference, pleading for public help with the case and asking anyone with information, even if they think it's insignificant, to talk to police. He said he didn't expect an arrest in the immediate future. Champion said Wednesday that when firefighters arrived at the scene, Chambers approached one of them and spoke. Champion didn't divulge the teen's words but said, ""It has certainly given us a lead we're following up on."" Chambers' older sister, Amanda Prince, said Jessica called their mother from a gas station and told her she would be home right after she cleaned her car. The business, which Champion characterized as a rural mom-and-pop store, is about 2 miles from Chambers' home. It sells fried chicken, pizza and deli sandwiches, and there is a constant stream of people sharing rumors and random chatter about the killing that has rocked their area. The gas station owner who helped her said nothing seemed out of sorts. ""She seemed normal,"" Ali Alsanai told CNN affiliate WREG. ""She didn't seem like something was going wrong, you know? She just seemed normal. She just pumped some gas, we had a talk and she left."" He said Thursday that one thing struck him as odd: Chambers pumped $14 worth of gas. She was a regular in the store, popping in every day or two, and she rarely pumped more than $5 in gas, he said. ""I asked her about it, and she said she was going somewhere,"" he said. ""She was quiet that day, real quiet."" Employee Renna Tucker said Chambers was a fixture at the store. Everyone knew her, and she was ""real friendly,"" the attendant said. ""Not one time have I ever heard her get loud, have a smart mouth. She was always smiling,"" she said. A Facebook page titled Justice for Jessica has drawn more than 97,000 likes, and that number was climbing rapidly Thursday.

"Washington (CNN) -- The risk of counterfeit electronics being used in military equipment has prompted a congressional investigation, the top senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee announced Wednesday. ""The presence of counterfeit electronic parts in the Defense Department's supply chain is a growing problem that government and industry share a common interest in solving,"" committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, the ranking member, said in a statement. The investigation follows a Commerce Department study that found counterfeit parts pose a serious problem for the U.S. military. The committee hopes the investigation will help ""determine the source and extent of this problem and identify possible remedies for it."" The 2010 study by the Commerce Department found the problem of counterfeit parts touched nearly 40% of the DoD's parts supply chain, and was getting worse ""rising from 3,868 incidents in 2005 to 9,356 incidents in 2008,"" the study said. It also found that part of the problem is the way the government buys parts. ""The rise of counterfeit parts in the supply chain is exacerbated by demonstrated weaknesses in inventory management, procurement procedures, record-keeping, reporting practices, inspection and testing protocols, and communication within and across all industry and government organizations."" One example of the problem mentioned in the Commerce study was microcircuits. Over the span of the four years studied, the most common abuse was selling used microcircuits that were relabeled as higher-grade products. ""China was most frequently identified by original component manufacturers as a source of counterfeits, with Asia as the most predominant regional source,"" the study said. China was blamed four times more than any other nation for selling counterfeit parts to the DoD. Two DoD spokespersons, asked for comment, said they were examining the Senate Armed Service's committee announcement and gave no other response. There was no word on how long the committee's investigation will take.","Armed Services Committee to look into counterfeit electronics in military equipment .

"They've faced gunfire, tear gas and water cannons. And now a man who led them in days of anti-government demonstrations is behind bars after turning himself in to authorities. But Venezuelan protesters were still in the streets after opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez's arrest Tuesday, demanding better security, an end to scarcities and protected freedom of speech. President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters also rallied, blaming the opposition for causing the very problems it protests. Clashes during days of demonstrations have already left three anti-government protesters and one government supporter dead. And the simmering tensions show no signs of letting up. The confrontation took a dramatic turn Tuesday, when Lopez, accused by the government of conspiracy and murder in connection with the recent violence, marched with a crowd of thousands of protesters before surrendering to national guard troops. ""The options I had were leave the country, and I will never leave Venezuela!"" Lopez told the massive crowd. ""The other option was to remain in hiding, but that option could have left doubt among some, including some who are here, and we don't have anything to hide."" Hours later at a rally with throngs of supporters, Maduro said the head of Venezuela's National Assembly had helped negotiate Lopez's surrender and was taking him to a prison outside Caracas. Maduro: Opposition leaders are 'fascists' Maduro described opposition leaders as right-wing fascists who plant seeds of fear and violence. He claimed they have U.S. backing and repeatedly tried to assassinate him and overthrow his democratically elected government. And he compared the opposition to an illness plaguing the South American country. ""The only way to fight fascism in a society is like when you have a very bad infection ... you need to take penicillin, or rather the strongest antibiotic, and undergo treatment,"" he said. ""Fascism is an infection in Venezuela and in the world. And the only treatment that exists is justice."" Footage from Tuesday's demonstration shows Lopez being led by national guard troops to a military vehicle, waving to the crowd as he is placed inside and even continuing to speak on a megaphone until the door is closed. Charges against him include murder, terrorism and arson in connection with the protests, according to his party, Popular Will. Lopez denies the accusations, the party said in a statement calling for witnesses of the protests to send their own accounts of what happened to be used in his defense. A message on Lopez's Twitter account Tuesday night said he was on the way to a military prison, where party officials said he would be held at least until a court appearance scheduled for Wednesday. The post included a link to an apparently pre-recorded video message, showing the opposition leader seated on a couch next to his wife, calling on Venezuelans to keep pushing for change. ""If you are watching this video, it is because the government has carried out one more abuse, full of lies, of falsehoods, of twisting facts and trying to manipulate the reality that we Venezuelans are living,"" he said. ""I want to tell all Venezuelans that I do not regret what we have done up to this moment, in convoking the protests ... The people came out. The people woke up."" 'Yankee, go home' Major social and economic problems in Venezuela have fueled the protests. But as the demonstrations gained steam, officials have pointed fingers at other factors, accusing the United States of plotting to destabilize the government. On Monday, Venezuela gave three U.S. diplomats 48 hours to leave the country, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government. At Tuesday's rally, Maduro shouted, ""Yankee, go home"" from the stage, drawing cheers from the crowd. 17-year-old dies during Venezuelan protests . The opposition has been defeated over and over again at the polls, and despite this decision by the people, it continues to call for marches and protests, Julio Rafael Chavez, a ruling party lawmaker, told CNN en Español on Tuesday. ""The peace-loving Venezuelans feel very, very worried by the irrational, fascist-leaning attitude and actions of a sector of the Venezuelan opposition,"" he said. This isn't the first time that bitter protests and counter-protests by supporters and opponents of the government have threatened political stability in Venezuela over the past decade. Many of Maduro's claims -- of U.S. intervention, of assassination plots -- were also lobbed by the late President Hugo Chavez. Chavez was briefly ousted in a coup in 2002, but otherwise outlasted the protests and repeatedly won re-election and ruled for 14 years until his death last year after a long battle with cancer. Venezuela: Expelled U.S. diplomats have 48 hours to leave . The U.S. State Department has repeatedly denied Venezuela's accusations. Asked whether the United States backs Lopez, Sen. John McCain told CNN Tuesday that his country ""backs the people's right to express their will, to object to corruption, the repression of the media and the arrest of political dissidents."" Opposition leader: Government wants confrontation . The current protests are the biggest that the Maduro government has faced in its 11 months in power. The latest death came Monday, when a 17-year-old was hit by a truck and killed at a protest in the northeastern city of Carupano, a government official said. Lopez's party, Popular Will, has accused the government of being responsible for violence during the protests. At Tuesday's rally, Maduro stressed that the socialist revolution he now leads is peaceful and democratic. ""What I want is peace, dialogue, understanding, coexistence,"" Maduro said. ""It is what I want and what I am doing."" But another opposition leader said that the government's actions paint a different picture. ""The latest actions we've seen from the government indicate that far from fomenting a climate of peace, (it) is trying to fortify the climate of confrontation and violence that the world has seen in images,"" former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles told CNN en Español. Capriles has backed away from calling for massive protests, saying they are ineffective and play into the government's narrative, but he said Lopez has his support. ""The protest will continue as long as the government gives no sign of resolving the problems of the Venezuelans,"" Capriles said. At least seven people were injured when gunfire erupted during a protest Tuesday in the northern city of Valencia on Tuesday, CNN affiliate Globovision reported.  One of them, according to two officials who did not wish to be identified, was a local beauty queen.

For the first time in years he's back at the South by Southwest Interactive conference, where Twitter first and famously blew up in 2007. Stone's got a book coming out next month, ""Things a Little Bird Told Me,"" which he describes as ""packed with aspirational lessons that were learned through embarrassing mistakes.""

Part social app, part visual search engine, Jelly lets users mine their social networks for answers to such questions as, ""What kind of plant is this?"" or ""How do I hook up this TV?"" Jelly is unusual in that instead of computer algorithms like Google's, it relies on human knowledge to help users find the answers they seek. And each question must be accompanied with an image, creating a sort of visual shorthand. Users can even draw over the images with their finger.

But Stone, who also helped launch Blogger, remains optimistic that Jelly will catch on.

Here's a condensed version of our conversation: . On bringing Twitter to SXSW: . ""Twitter exploded here. It was a watershed moment for Twitter, and it was an eye-opening moment for me. So for the most part after that year I never came back, because I didn't want to jinx it. ""When we came to SXSW in 2007 it was the first time we could really see Twitter being used in the wild. There was a concentration of people, and most of them were using it. And I saw that Twitter was far more powerful than I realized. ""The one example that comes to mind is ... there was this guy in a pub. And he said (on Twitter), 'This place is too loud for us to talk. Let's go to this other place.' And he named it in his tweet. And in the eight minutes it took him to walk over there, it had filled to capacity and there was a line out the door. Twitter took a bunch of loose individuals, and suddenly they became one organism, like a flock of birds. ""And I couldn't think of another technology that allowed human beings to flock in real time. We went back (to San Francisco), and a few days later we formed the company."" On the idea behind Jelly: . ""We've become the most connected humanity that's ever existed. We're now connected to anyone else on the planet within four degrees of separation because of social networks and mobile phones. It's an amazing era of connectedness. And yet not a lot of people stop to think, 'Why? What's the true promise of a connected society?' ""I've been asking myself that question ever since I left Twitter. And it occurred to me the true promise of a connected society is people helping one other. Or at least it should be. ""So Jelly is a search engine, as audacious as it sounds. Everyone figures we've got search all wrapped up. There's the Internet -- it's vast and growing, and we can search it in a fraction of second to find anything we want. But the Internet is only the Internet ... it's only a collection of documents. There's way more to life than the Internet. So Jelly is like a search engine for everything else. And the reason it works is that we're all connected. ""People talk about artificial intelligence. Well, how about (human) intelligence? We have 7 billion people on this planet."" On why Jelly requires images: . ""We're carrying around 8-megapixel cameras (on our phones). In a world where 140 characters is considered a maximum length, a photo really is worth 1,000 words. For almost any question, a photo can deepen the context. Also, it allows you to type less: 'Should I buy a Tesla?' How about just, 'Should I buy this (with a picture of a Tesla)?"" ""A lot of people ask, 'Why not just ask my social network?' But what Jelly does is blend Twitter and Facebook together. Jelly gives you far more reach. Your friend's wife's lawyer is all of a sudden answering your question. On how people have been using Jelly: . ""Whenever you build something, the creativity in humanity comes out. I love it when I'm seeing answers to questions where people are only drawing on the photo. They're not even using language. Somebody asked, 'How do you do a screenshot on a Mac?' and all the person (answering) did was circle the three keys you touch. It was wonderful. ""I have this theory that if something isn't fun and goofy, then you won't use it on a regular basis. And then you won't think to use it when you need it. The same thing happened with Twitter."" On the future of social networking: . ""Social networking is still brand new. We're still figuring it out -- how much we should share, and how much we should self-edit. ""But I think the bigger thing here is that it's growing so huge. You can now measure the number of people on planet Earth who use social networking ... (as a large percentage) of the planet. And that opens up intense possibilities of cooperation among humankind. ""In the future, what do I think will happen? I think we'll be able to accomplish in one year what used to take 100 years. Because when people get together and coordinate, they can do amazing things. On his early days at SXSW: . ""I used to come to South by Southwest in the early 2000s every year, and we'd put on a party for Blogger. It (SXSW) always falls on my birthday. So I used to pretend it was my birthday party, because we got Google money to throw around and give everyone free whiskey and beer. And we'd give out Blogger T-shirts, which of course had a B logo, like for Biz. And I'd say, 'Welcome to my birthday party! Free whiskey for everyone!' "" On the success of Twitter, which he left in 2011: . ""It's incredibly weird to see, everywhere I look, the little birdie that I drew. Or hashtags on my favorite TV shows. For me personally ... that's surreal. Most importantly, it means that people are finding value in the service. ""And that's the most important thing you can do in this world before you die -- to build something of value.""","Twitter co-founder Biz Stone has launched a new social search engine, Jelly .

"(CNN) -- Eman al-Obeidy, the woman who caught the world's attention when she accused members of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces of gang-raping her, arrived Monday at a refugee facility in Romania. Al-Obeidy had fled Libya and was awaiting resettlement as a refugee in Qatar when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Benghazi in Libya. On Sunday, a high-level U.S. State Department source told CNN that al-Obeidy was on her way to Malta with her father, and would head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination. It may take weeks before she gets to that destination. Another U.S. State Department source said Sunday the United States was deeply concerned about her well-being, and worked closely with officials in Europe and Libya to get her safely out of the country. The same source said the U.S. is ""prepared to provide whatever help and support Eman may need."" Al-Obeidy has told CNN on repeated occasions that she wants to go to the United States. One of the State Department sources told CNN that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""has been deeply interested in the case and has followed it throughout."" Al-Obeidy was reportedly beaten before being deported from Qatar. Najah Dawaji, a U.S.-based Libyan freedom activist, said she was with three key members of Libya's opposition Transitional National Council when they learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi on Thursday. She said al-Obeidy had a black eye, bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms. Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her. After arriving in Qatar, al-Obeidy had made public statements saying the Transitional National Council was using her. The council denied that. Council members were upset upon seeing al-Obeidy's condition and vowed to open an investigation, Dawaji said. The United States said it was ""disappointed"" by al-Obeidy's expulsion, which it said was ""a breach of humanitarian norms."" Amnesty International called the deportation ""outrageous,"" saying the action by the Qatari government ""is a serious breach by Qatar of its international obligations.""

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's Constitutional Court Tuesday fired the country's prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, for violating the constitution by hosting a TV cooking show while in office. Thai Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej talks with a market vendor on Monday in Udon Thani province. Tuesday's ruling against Sundaravej, who has faced weeks of violent street protests, also forces the resignation of his cabinet. Ministers are barred from working for private companies, and Samak's opponents filed the case hoping that a conviction will compel him to step down. In theory, analysts say, Samak can return as prime minister in days -- if the ruling coalition nominates him again and a parliament vote is taken. Samak appeared in court Monday, and argued that he had not violated any rules. His work for the television company, he said, was as a freelancer and not an employee. Further, he said, the show was not on the air any more and that he received just $2,300 for his appearances. The 73-year-old Samak continued to appear sporadically on the show ""Tasting while Grumbling"" after he became prime minister in February. On the show, he served up personal favorites and dished on topics that struck his fancy.  Watch CNN's Dan Rivers on latest crisis for Thai PM » . Soon after taking office, he told CNN that he was no reason to halt his participation. ""Somebody says as a prime minister, I have time, but I should not do such a thing like that. I said, 'No, I checked the constitution already. There's no obstruction with that,'"" he said. Professor Suchit Bunbongkarn, an expert on the constitution, said the document clearly bans prime ministers from being employed by a private entity. ""It depends on the constitutional court to decide whether receiving money to appear in the programs on the television could be considered an employee of any employer or not,"" he said. The court case is another attempt by Samak's opponents who have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at him. Samak was already facing charges of corruption, appealing a three-year prison sentence for defaming a deputy governor and dealing with an election commission decision last week that his party committed electoral fraud in the December elections and should be dissolved. In addition, thousands of protesters have camped outside the Government House, the government's headquarters -- blocking Samak from entering since August 26. The protesters are demanding that Samak step down. They accuse him of being a proxy for his ousted predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra. Samak has strongly denied the allegation and has refused to resign. On Tuesday, he declared a state of emergency in the capital city of Bangkok after overnight clashes between his supporters and anti-government demonstrators that wounded 40 and left one person dead. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) -- which is heading the protests -- contends Samak is trying to amend the constitution so Thaksin does not have to face charges. Thaksin, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, returned to England last month just as he was to appear in court in a corruption case.

"After months of twists and turns in a dramatic trial rife with sex, lies and digital images, an Arizona jury Wednesday found Jodi Arias guilty of first-degree murder in the slaying of ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander. Jurors will return to court Thursday for the aggravation phase of the trial -- an important step in the next key decision they face: determining whether Arias lives or dies. ""Now the odds, I think, shift somewhat in her favor, because it's a very different thing to sentence someone to die than to convict them,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffery Toobin said. In a television interview minutes after the verdict was announced, Arias said she'd prefer a death sentence. ""I said years ago that I'd rather get death than life, and that still is true today,"" she told Phoenix television station KSAZ. ""I believe death is the ultimate freedom, so I'd rather just have my freedom as soon as I can get it."" The comments prompted authorities to place Arias on suicide watch in an Arizona jail, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. ""Until she is released from suicide protocol by Sheriff's officials no further media interviews of inmate Arias will be permitted,"" the office said in a statement. Arias was stoic in court Wednesday. Her eyes briefly welled up with tears as a clerk announced that the jury found her guilty of first-degree murder for killing Alexander in June 2008. What's next for Arias . Friend: ""We have waited five years through the circus"" Alexander's sisters cried and consoled each other after the verdict was read in the packed courtroom. Crowds outside the courthouse erupted in cheers as news of the jury's decision spread. Several of Alexander's friends told HLN they were relieved. ""It just feels so good ... to finally have the truth and be vindicated,"" said Dave Hall, choking back tears. But that relief isn't enough, Elisha Schabel said. ""It's not going bring Travis back. He was such a light to this world,"" she said. ""And it's important that we forgive Jodi, so she doesn't have that power to destroy our lives."" Another friend, Clancy Talbot, said she was grateful for the verdict. ""Looking at Jodi's face, I think this is probably the first time in her life she has ever been held responsible for what she's done, ever, and I think she's in shock,"" she said. ""We have waited five years through the circus that Jodi has created."" Trial moves into next phase . But the trial isn't over yet, and Arias -- who testified for 18 days during the trial -- could speak to jurors again in court. In the next step of the case, known as the aggravation phase, prosecutors will have a chance to present additional evidence and jurors will decide whether Alexander's death was caused in a cruel manner. If they decide that was the case, the trial would move to the penalty phase, where jurors would decide whether Arias should receive a death sentence. If the jury decides on a death sentence, the judge is bound by that decision. But if the jury decides against the death penalty, the judge would have two options: sentencing Arias to life in prison without the possibility of parole, or sentencing her to life in prison with the possibility of parole after at least 25 years. There are currently 127 people on death row in Arizona. If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state. As jurors prepare for the sentencing phase of the criminal trial, family members of Alexander are preparing to file a civil wrongful death lawsuit, attorney Jay Beckstead told reporters outside the courthouse. Alexander's siblings won't speak publicly about the case until Arias is sentenced, Beckstead said, adding that the family is grateful to prosecutors and detectives for their work. Massive crowd surrounds courthouse . Since Friday, jurors had been deliberating evidence surrounding a key question: Did Arias kill ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander in self-defense? Or did she commit murder? Alexander was stabbed repeatedly, shot and nearly decapitated five years ago. Arias says she killed him in self-defense after he attacked her, but the grisly slaying  caused even some anti-domestic violence advocates to doubt her case. Twists and turns of the trial . The jury, which has been in court since January 2, heard closing arguments on Friday. Jurors deliberated for 15 hours and five minutes. As they took a lunch break after revealing they had reached a verdict Wednesday, some jurors were seen smiling and breathing sighs of relief. One juror returning from lunch wiped her eyes. A massive crowd swarmed around the Maricopa County Courthouse Wednesday afternoon. Some onlookers said they had been following the trial for months. The case has drawn worldwide attention and followers lined up daily for courtroom seats. ""We are here every day to support Travis' family 100%,"" said Kathy Brown, who got a cane she uses autographed by prosecutor Juan Martinez and cried outside the courthouse after the verdict was announced Wednesday. ""I am so thankful,"" she said. ""I knew the Lord would do the right thing."" Catch up quickly on the Arias trial . Case marked by dramatic arguments . In the trial, both sides dramatically presented their arguments with details about Arias' love affair with Alexander. ""She rewarded that love from Travis Alexander by sticking a knife in his chest,"" Martinez said in his opening statement. ""And you know he was a good man, according to her. And with regard to being a good man, well, she slit his throat as a reward for being a good man. And in terms of these blessings, well, she knocked the blessings out of him by putting a bullet in his head."" Photos: Alexander and his girlfriend . But defense attorney Jennifer Willmott countered: ""Jodi Arias killed Travis Alexander. There is no question about it. The million-dollar question is what would have forced her to do it?"" Willmott said Arias was the victim of a controlling, psychologically abusive relationship, and Alexander considered Arias ""his dirty little secret."" Martinez accused Arias of playing the victim. He alleged she staged the crime scene to make it look like self-defense. He also accused her of actively seeking to profit from her media attention. That's something Alexander's family hopes to stop with its civil lawsuit, Beckstead said Wednesday. ""The law in Arizona states that people should not be benefiting from their wrongdoing in a criminal case, and my law firm is going to do the best it can to make sure that she does not benefit from her wrongdoing or her notoriety,"" he said. Arias: ""I would much rather die sooner than later"" In her interview with KSAZ Wednesday, Arias said she was surprised by the jury's verdict. ""It was unexpected, for me, yes, because there was no premeditation on my part,"" she said. ""I can see how things look that way."" Arias told KSAZ that longevity runs in her family, and that the worst possible outcome in the case would be a life sentence without parole. ""I would much rather die sooner than later,"" she said. Several members' of the Arias family were at the jail where Arias was being held Wednesday night, waiting for a chance to meet with her. Mother Sandra Arias said she had heard about her daughter's post-verdict TV interview, but hadn't watched it. She appeared to be very emotional and concerned about her daughter. While serving time, Sandra Arias said, her daughter ""can do a lot of good for others.""

"(CNN) -- Former first lady Betty Ford was laid to rest Thursday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, alongside her late husband, capping a day of remembrance and reflection. Bagpipers played ""Amazing Grace"" as her casket was carried to the burial site on the grounds of the presidential museum named for her husband. A handful of family members walked behind the casket. The burial service itself was private. Earlier in the day, Ford's friends and family gathered at Grace Episcopal Church for the former first lady's final farewell. Packed in among the pews were former President Bill Clinton, former first lady Barbara Bush and former vice president Dick Cheney. Lynne Cheney, whose husband was former President Gerald Ford's chief of staff in the White House and years later became vice president, spoke at the service, which wrapped up shortly after 3:30 p.m. ET. She said that during the last few years of Ford's life, the former first lady largely kept out of the public view. Still, ""she remained among the most-admired women in the world,"" said Cheney. ""Just the mention of her name brings good and hopeful things to mind."" One of Ford's sons, Steve, also spoke at the service. He praised her ability to love and said that she helped him cope -- as she had helped so many people -- when he was struggling with alcoholism years ago. ""Thank you, Mom, for loving us, loving your husband, loving us kids, loving the nation with the heart of God. We miss you. God bless you,"" he said. The casket containing Ford's remains arrived in Grand Rapids on Wednesday. A welcome ceremony was held shortly after the arrival, followed by a private prayer service at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum. A public viewing of the casket was held in Grand Rapids Thursday morning. Ford died Friday at the age of 93. A memorial service on Tuesday was held near where she set up a renowned alcohol and drug abuse treatment facility, the Betty Ford Center, in Rancho Mirage, California. Among those who attended that ceremony were former President George W. Bush, who escorted former first lady Nancy Reagan to a pew, current first lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton. Former first lady Rosalynn Carter, who was a close friend of Ford's, described Ford as honest and fearless. ""She was a tireless advocate for those struggling,"" Carter said in her eulogy. ""She was never afraid to speak the truth."" In remarks to reporters Monday, Clinton spoke of Ford's bold commitment to highlighting issues such as alcoholism and breast cancer. ""I remember well when my mother's best friend was dying of breast cancer; nobody talked about it in those days,"" she said. ""But Betty Ford made it acceptable"" to discuss those issues in public.

"Luay al-Khatteeb has spoken to CNN previously about the rise of ISIS, and the challenges facing the Iraq's new oil minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi. Now, U.S. airstrikes have hit locations in eastern Syria where ISIS has been using mobile refineries to produce oil. CNN has revisited the conversation to find out the likely impact of the strikes. This is al-Khatteeb's analysis of the situation. What impact will the U.S. strikes on oil refineries have on ISIS? The impact of these strikes on ISIS oil refineries are going to be immense and grave. If they are hitting the facilities and the oil convoys on the smuggling roads they will significantly disrupt supply and regular production. If the bombardments continue it will impact the energy supply and deny ISIS much-needed fuel for their mobility and the servicing of the communities under their rule -- now around 8 million people between Iraq and Syria. It makes sense to target the refineries rather than the oil fields, as the crude can't be used to drive the tankers. The crude can be sold but the refined oil is much more valuable. The U.S. and its allies now need to clamp down on the borders to break the smuggling routes, particularly into Turkey. If the ISIS refineries are completely hit, the group will need to rely on oil being refined in Turkey via the black market. These roads now need to be closely monitored, there needs to be sharing of information and the cross-border networks need to be targeted. How much oil does ISIS control? ISIS, in control of a large swathe of eastern Syria, is now handling 60% of the country's oil assets and producing 50,000 barrels a day. This is not full capacity -- pre-conflict, the assets would have produced around 220,000 barrels a day out of the country's 385,000, according to Iraq Energy Institute figures. However, ISIS do control key oil fields including Al Omar, Tanak and Shadadi. ISIS also handle at least 25,000 barrels of oil a day in north and mid-west Iraq, but that is only a small slice of the country's total production. This oil has found its way to the global economy through Turkey's southern corridor. This black-economy zone is known for its oil trades, smuggling antiquities from Iraq and Syria's ancient sites, and funneling thousands of jihadists to both countries. Many observers see Turkey turning a blind eye on a zone that is actively contributing to the instability of the Middle East. Southern Turkey has become ISIS' safe haven for treating wounded fighters, a gateway for foreign jihadists, and a financial hub that brings ISIS over $3 million a day in oil money. What should be done to tackle the black market in oil? Now that ISIS are involved in trucking oil out of Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan must better comply with the federal regulations and stop any trucking of oil for export not accounted for by the federal authority. There is a risk the oil would be mixed with other smuggled quantities by ISIS to Turkish black markets. Moreover, the U.S. and the UN Security Council must enforce harsh measures on countries not doing enough to close down black markets contributing to transnational terrorism. Iraq has a new oil minister -- how will he help? This month, Adil Abdul Mahdi was appointed as oil minister. On his first day, he visited the besieged refinery of Baiji, which will help build respect for him in the industry. The facility has been under siege since ISIS occupied the city of Tikrit two months ago. Abdul Mahdi is a senior politician with a background in economics, and his appointment is welcome news to international companies. However, as a non-oil veteran his leadership skills have yet to be tested. He faces numerous challenges including resolving issues with the Kurdistan Regional Government, restoring the damaged petroleum industry and ramping up production to meet Iraq's planned target of nine million barrels per day by 2020, key objectives the government hopes to achieve within the next four years. If he succeeds, his name will be immortalized in history as the savior of a united Iraq. Will he be able to influence the fight against ISIS? Although the ministry of oil has a few thousand affiliated security forces, their job is not counter-terrorism -- they are not trained to handle such missions. This task will be for the Iraqi special forces, intelligence services and the army. However, he can help. The people of the Sunni-dominated provinces are hijacked by three issues. They are: ISIS, a lack of reconciliation and an uncertain economic future. Abdul Mahdi could do more to push ISIS out of current Sunni-controlled provinces by promoting oil projects that offer local jobs and investment opportunities. He could strike a deal with local tribes and businessmen to develop plans for the rehabilitation of their provinces, something that would need to be done as part of a wider reconciliation agenda. After all, the rise of ISIS could have been avoided had there been real political conciliation and economic plans in place to resolve the country's challenges. Abdul Mahdi can take some comfort from the fact around 90% of Iraq's oil production is in the south, and 10% is in Kurdistan Regional Government-controlled area, so the bulk of Iraq's super giant production centers are safe. But without having the security situation resolved in Iraq's ISIS-controlled regions, it will be impossible to resume operations, let alone consider development of the oil and gas upstream sector in conflict zones. What's the backdrop to Abdul Mahdi's appointment? When ISIS invaded the Sunni-dominated part of Iraq, sympathetic Sunni insurgencies helped them expand into large areas of land, including seven oil fields with a total capacity of 80,000 barrels per day in Mosul, Tikrit and territories bordering Kirkuk. By the end of June, 20,000 barrels had been reported as smuggled from the field of Ajil, traded at $25 to $60 per barrel. Later on, ISIS drew on oil in the fields of Hamrin, Qayyara, Ain Zala and Butma, pushing ISIS-controlled oil production to nearly 40,000 barrels per day. With the help of local middlemen -- who control the supply chain by extracting oil, trucking it across territory trucking tankers, paying off border checkpoints and handling sales -- the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula has become a black-market zone funding transnational terrorism, led by ISIS and other Qaeda splinter groups. Oil revenues have contributed to expanding ISIS recruitment, with the group's numbers now estimated to be in excess of 30,000.","Luay al-Khatteeb says ISIS now controls 60% of Syria's oil assets and a slice of Iraq's .

"(CNN) -- Our minds recoil at the thought. How is it possible that a human being could take a knife to the neck of another, an innocent man, and cut off his head? How could he do this even after perhaps hearing the pleas from his captive's mother, imploring him to spare her child? The recent slayings of journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley by ISIS, the self-described Islamic State, are only the latest acts of brutality by an organization that has strived to make ruthlessness one of its most distinctive characteristics. Far from apologizing for its inhumanity, ISIS advertises it proudly, it taunts the world with it, and goes to great lengths to confirm that the acts that horrify us are not the work of rogue members but are, indeed, the organization's policy. Cruelty is a key component of the ISIS brand. The group has managed to conquer large parts of Syria and Iraq with a systematic and efficient plan. Like everything else it does, broadcasting barbarism is a calculated strategy. But why? Brutality has psychological, strategic and ideological objectives. That's why other fighting forces have resorted to cruelty to achieve their objectives. History is replete with examples that we see echoed today. As we avert our eyes from the carnage, from beheadings, mass executions and crucifixions; as we try to avoid looking at the worst of the online videos, it is apparent that the strategy has the potential to create a huge and powerful backlash. That cruelty is turning much of the world, including Arabs and Muslims, against ISIS. And the atrocities against American and other Western citizens are all but inviting the world's most powerful armies to take on the Islamist militias. And yet, by showing its fighters massacring the enemy without mercy, by flooding social media with the gruesome images, ISIS sends several messages that its leaders believe bring benefits that outweigh the risks. Long before we heard what happened to James Foley, months before we learned that ISIS had killed hundreds of men, women and children of Iraq's Yazidi minority, burying some of them alive, the people of the Middle East had become acquainted with the mass executions, the brutal persecution of minorities, the killing of Christians, of Shiites, and of Sunnis or anyone else who posed a challenge, hesitated to follow its religious dictates, or resisted the ISIS advance in Syria and then Iraq. Cruelty communicates fearlessness, and fearlessness, coupled with battlefield success, is an irresistible draw. It's no wonder ISIS has attracted large numbers of men eager to fight, including hundreds from Europe. They share the goal, as one defector told CNN, of establishing an Islamic state in the Arab world and then taking the campaign to other countries. Beheading the enemy is an effective recruiting appeal to a small but not insignificant segment of the population that is enticed by the brazenness and ideological fervor. To them, mostly young Muslim men, the barbarism resonates with their own brand of hatred and lust for revenge: revenge over real or perceived slights against Muslims. The religious justification for the executions, described by ISIS as part of its jihad -- a war to return the reign of an Islamic caliphate and impose the Quran's dictates -- gives the killings moral, theological clearance, all but precluding empathy toward non-members. In addition, by advertising its methods, ISIS intimidates the armies it faces, causing some soldiers to flee before battle, even leaving their weapons behind, as we saw when ISIS took over Mosul. The executions of hundreds of enemy soldiers, those who chose to fight, have appeared in videos, a warning to others. And the method also works to keep populations in line after ISIS takes over territory and enforces its rule. The people of Raqqa, the ISIS ""capital"" in Syria, have seen men crucified in the streets, a punishment for transgressions that serves as warning to anyone who might plan to defy the new authorities' rule and their version of Sharia, Islamic law. ISIS is not the first organization to use barbarism as a weapon of war; to use cruelty as a method of policy enforcement. In the Middle Ages, the Inquisition, an institutionalized effort to root out heresy and strengthen the hold of the Catholic Church and its allies, made it well known that those who did not fully comply with its wishes would suffer unspeakable punishments, from torture to being burned alive. Many militant movements throughout history have managed to erase from their followers an essential element of their humanity -- a part that we think could never be destroyed inside us. We cannot imagine deliberately inflicting pain on another, particularly someone who has not harmed us. But it turns out that our restraints against cruelty can be destroyed. History is replete with examples: The millions killed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, as they sought to build a communist utopia. The industrialized killing factories built by Germany during World War II, which had no military value, playing the key role within Nazi ideology of exterminating unwanted people, principally Jews, but also the disabled, homosexuals, Roma (Gypsies) and other ""inferior"" peoples. The genocide in Rwanda, in which ethnic hatred unleashed a genocidal wave that left 800,000 dead, most hacked with machetes by their neighbors. Other Jihadi groups operating today have shown no compunction about killing civilians, women and children, about kidnapping girls in Nigeria, about blowing up city markets in Baghdad, buses in London, restaurants, cafes, and hotels in Bali, Jerusalem, or Amman. The common denominator throughout history until today is an ideology that justifies everything for the search of a ""higher"" goal, one usually suffused with some utopian vision of a perfect world.

"(CNN)North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who recently disappeared from public view for about six weeks, had a cyst removed from his right ankle, a lawmaker told CNN. South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers during a closed-door meeting that a cyst was found on Kim's right ankle earlier this year, between May and June. That cyst may have caused muscle or nerve damage and prompted him to have ankle surgery between September and October, lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said. At the briefing, lawmakers were told that ""European experts"" handled the surgery for tarsal tunnel syndrome. The syndrome is caused by compression at the ankle -- known to cause pain during standing and walking. Kim is believed to be recovering, South Korean lawmakers were told, but the cyst could recur due to his obesity and heavy schedule. After his conspicuous absence throughout most of September, Kim seemed to reappear October 14, when North Korean state media published the first photos of him, in which the beaming Kim held a cane in his left hand as he gave ""field guidance"" at a newly built residential district. Kim hadn't been seen in public since he reportedly attended a concert with his wife on September 3. It was his longest absence from official events since he made his first public appearance in 2010, according to NK News, a website devoted to analyzing North Korea. Why has North Korea decided to talk now? South Korean lawmakers also were told that a political purge continues in North Korea, as a follow-up after the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek. North Korea executed 10 party officials by firing squad for charges ranging from corruption to women's issues to the viewing of a South Korean soap opera. Intelligence officials also told lawmakers that senior military officials were demoted for poor accuracy in artillery drills. He skipped important anniversary . Before his disappearance, Kim was seen limping, prompting theories he was suffering everything from weight gain to gout. His sudden disappearance took a concerning turn earlier this month when he didn't appear at events to mark the 65th anniversary of the Worker's Party of North Korea. Kim's failure to appear fueled rampant speculation. Since his reappearance, North Korea has released several photos of Kim, but has yet to release video. According to Dr. Kim So-Yeon, the former personal doctor to Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung, Kim inherited a number of health issues, including psychological problems and a history of obesity. She said both Kim Il Sung and Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, suffered from diabetes, heart problems and stress. After studying the photos, she said Kim's face appeared to have swollen due to painkillers. She also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather, the much-revered founder of North Korea.

"To some, they're the gut-wrenching emotional cries of a man whose stepson's life was taken. Others say they were dangerous words that sparked a powder keg as violent protests broke out in Ferguson, Missouri last week. But did Michael Brown's stepfather intend to incite rioting in the St. Louis suburb? That's a question Ferguson police say they're looking into. Brown's stepfather didn't hold back as news of a grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson reached Ferguson. As throngs in front of the Ferguson Police Department listened to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch's announcement on cell phones and radios, Louis Head stepped onto a platform above the crowd and embraced his wife, Brown's mother. He then turned to the demonstrators -- some of them shouting ""F--- the police!"" -- and yelled, ""Burn this motherf---er down!"" and ""Burn this bitch down!"" His comments drew widespread attention in the aftermath of the violence as a video of his reaction, recorded just after McCulloch's announcement, circulated online. No charges have been filed against Head, but police have interviewed people who know Head and who were with him November 24, the day a prosecutor announced that Wilson would not be indicted in the August 9 shooting, Police Chief Tom Jackson said Tuesday. Head isn't being singled out, but he's one of the people being ""looked at as part of an ongoing investigation into the activities surrounding Nov 24 pertaining to the rioting, looting and arsons,"" Ferguson spokesman Jeff Small said. Brown's mother has defended her husband's reaction. Last week, CNN's Sunny Hostin asked her about accusations that her husband's words single-handedly started rioting and fires. ""I say that that's impossible,"" Lesley McSpadden said. ""These things have been going on since August 9th, when it first happened."" Protests rocked Ferguson that day, hours after Wilson shot Brown. They grew as time passed and news of the shooting spread. When the prosecutor finally revealed the grand jury's long-awaited decision last week, it wasn't long before Ferguson erupted again. St. Louis County Police tweeted their first reports of looting less than 15 minutes later. In the hours that followed, a row of businesses on West Florissant Avenue, a major thoroughfare in the St. Louis suburb, was engulfed in flames. Police cars and vehicles at a nearby dealership were turned into fireballs. There were so many blazes that firefighters couldn't reach them all. Police chief: 'We are pursuing those comments' Police have not spoken to Head about his actions, but they intend to do so, Jackson said Tuesday, adding that multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the investigation. The police chief told TV and radio host Sean Hannity something similar Monday, but he didn't classify the probe as formal. ""We are pursuing those comments, and there's a lot of discussion going on about that right now, but I really can't get into that at this time,"" he said. But police aren't singling out Head, Jackson told Hannity. ""We can't let all that happened in Ferguson and Dellwood and the community die. Everyone who is responsible for taking away people's property, their livelihoods, their jobs, their businesses -- every single one of them needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" he said. McSpadden, who was standing next to Head when he made the comments and herself told the crowd she'd never experienced anything like this, offered some context in a CNN interview last week. After hearing the grand jury's decision, McSpadden said she felt like she'd been shot herself and her ""emotions were raging."" Head was angry, too, she said. ""He just spoke out of anger. It's one thing to speak, and it's a different thing to act. He did not act. He just spoke out of anger,"" she said. ""When you're that hurt and the system has did you this wrong, you may say some things as well. We've all spoke out of anger before."" Share your view on the Ferguson decision . Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump has previously called Head's remarks inappropriate but asked the public not to condemn the family for being human. More recently, he told CNN to remember that Brown's mother and father have repeatedly asked protesters to remain peaceful. He further called Head's statements ""indefensible"" and ""not appropriate in any way."" ""We don't condone people acting on emotion calling for people to do irresponsible things at all,"" Crump told CNN. ""And so we want his family, his mother and father's message to come across louder than anybody who might be associated with them. ... And they can't control what others do. They can control what they pray for."" Others have called for Head's arrest, including Missouri Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder, who told radio host Laura Ingraham last week ""that he should be arrested and charged with inciting to riot."" Would prosecutors pursue charges? St. Louis County Police also said Tuesday that they were looking into Head's comments. Police will present their investigation to prosecutors once its complete, police spokesman Brian Schellman said. But is it a case prosecutors would pursue? It's unlikely, CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes said. ""I think they'll have a hard time proving that somebody that heard him in the midst of all that noise actually went over and did an arson or committed an act of starting a fire. I think most of the people you see in the crowd are not watching CNN. They're not watching media reporting of him saying that,"" he told ""The Situation Room."" ""So it is probably very few people that heard it at that time."" Also, Fuentes said, it's likely many people who'd gathered in Ferguson as the grand jury's decision was announced were already determined to act. ""I think the cause and effect of his words will be hard to prove,"" Fuentes said. Hostin, a CNN legal analyst, said prosecutors should also weigh what impact charging Head could have on the community. ""I think any prosecutor that looks at a case like this, given what is going on, what has gone on in Ferguson, would never touch this case,"" she said. ""You would have to be really tone deaf to the larger issues that are at play here to bring a case like that."" Ferguson police also under investigation . More than a week after the grand jury's decision, investigations into Brown's shooting and its aftermath are far from over. The U.S. Justice Department also is investigating the shooting as part of a civil rights probe -- and investigating the Ferguson Police Department, looking at past incidents, procedures and training. Another part of the probe, according to law enforcement officials, is a pattern of actions by Jackson, the Ferguson police chief, who critics accuse of inflaming public reactions after Brown's shooting. Among them: the chief's decision to release a video showing a convenience store robbery in which Michael Brown stole cigars minutes before the fatal confrontation with Wilson, Jackson's comments to the media that Wilson would be welcomed back to the police department if a grand jury declined to bring charges, and, now, Jackson's announcement that his department was investigating Head for possibly inciting a riot. Wilson resigned over the weekend, saying he was worried about putting Ferguson's residents and police officers at risk. On Tuesday, the Fraternal Order of Police revealed that its members had been providing the officer with free protection since Brown was killed. Wilson began receiving threats via phone, email and social media after the shooting, and ""the (Ferguson Police) department being unwilling or unable as an entity to provide security for him, Fraternal Order of Police members from the surrounding area volunteered and have provided him with security from that time, right up until the present,"" said the group's executive director, Jim Pasco. Despite Pasco's assertion that a police department is supposed to protect someone ""when a person in the community is inundated with threats on his or her life,"" it's been widely reported that Wilson went into hiding so hastily after the Brown shooting that he left his lawn half-mowed. In another development Tuesday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced that the National Guard will scale back operations in the area. ""The Guard has completed its duties within the city of St. Louis, and has begun to systematically reduce its presence in St. Louis County,"" Nixon said in a statement. Troops are still supporting local law enforcement agencies in Ferguson and other parts of the county, he said.

"What could possibly be more popular than the latest iPhone? An Indian company is hoping that among India's Muslims, it will be the new Quran mobile, a smartphone loaded with Islamic features. The new ENMAC Quran MQ3500 phone, launched last month in India, comes with Islam's holy book translated in 29 languages and a compass that directs users toward Mecca. Muslims bow in the direction of the holy city for prayers five times a day. The $76 phone also features an Islamic calendar, downloaded holy books, a calculator for zakat (donation to charity) and an automatic ring silencer that can be set up for prayer times at mosques. Niyas Ahmed, a 35-year-old New Delhi engineer, traded in his old Nokia for the new Quran phone 10 days ago. ""They are providing a great service,"" he said about being able to read the Quran whenever he had time to spare, no matter where was. Network engineer Mohammad Mohsin, 28, bought the phone for his father. ""The concept is great. It maximizes one's reading time,"" he said. Mohsin said the phone is sure to do well in India. All his father's friends, he said, are curious about the uniquely Islamic device that is the first of its kind in India. Anuj Kanish, head of TolMol, the Indian online comparison shopping network that launched the phone, said the Quran mobile is already on back order. He said it will be more widely available in stores starting in January. ENMAC, a Malaysia-based Islamic digital products company, developed the Quran phone -- also available in several Middle Eastern countries, Pakistan and Malaysia. But India, said Kanish, has potential for massive sales. India is home to 180 million Muslims, the world's third largest Muslim population, and a rapidly growing mobile phone user market. More than 800 million Indians -- from the poorest rickshaw pullers to wealthy entrepreneurs -- own mobile phones. Unlike Hindus, who form a majority of India's 1.2 billion people, Muslims have well-defined daily rituals, Kanish said. The Quran phone is ideally suited for Islam, he said. Sirajuddin Qureshi, president of the India Islamic Cultural Center, agreed. He hopes the new cell phone will reinvigorate interest in Islam. ""Until a Muslim understands the Quran, he cannot understand Islam,"" Qureshi said. ""One should read the Quran every day. This phone will help a lot."" Mohsin, the young network engineer who bought the phone for his father, wasn't so sure how the Quran phone would play among those of his generation who can afford more sophisticated phones. His friends, he said, may still opt for emails, Facebook and Twitter on an iPhone.  Or perhaps download an Islamic app. But for millions of other faithful, the Quran phone could just very well be the ""in thing.""","A new Quran mobile phone launched in India last month .

"(CNN)It has become synonymous with the glamor and excess of the late Seventies. But people who've retained clear memories of Studio 54, the legendary New York nightclub that defined an era, are few and far between. Tod Papageorge, the American photographer, is one of these. And not only can he remember the club -- he has a collection of stunning pictures to prove it. Now those pictures are being released in a new book, ""Studio 54"". The first edition has already sold out; a second ""silver edition"" will be available on 23 December. ""Like so many good things, my involvement with Studio 54 was a fluke,"" Papageorge tells CNN over the telephone from New York. ""My girlfriend at the time was a photographer, and had access to Studio 54. ""They asked me if I would be interested in photographing there, and who would turn that down? I was very lucky, and took advantage of it."" WATCH: New York in the Seventies . The coolest place on earth . In the late Seventies, Studio 54 was probably the coolest place on Earth. It was started by the socialites and entrepreneurs Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, and was located at 254 West 54th Street in Manhattan. The building had originally been a theater, which made for an impressive party space. And when the New York State Liquor Authority raided the premises a month after it opened for selling unlicensed alcohol, its reputation for glamor only increased. Regular visitors included Elizabeth Taylor, Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Calvin Klein, Truman Capote, Cher, John Travolta, Tina Turner, Elton John and Salvador Dali. To name but a few. ""The place was like nothing I'd ever seen before,"" Papageorge recalls. ""It was an extraordinary situation, and I knew it wouldn't ever be repeated, even moment by moment. ""People around me were going crazy, basically, and I was trying to be passionate but remain cool enough to take pictures that would be clear and compelling."" WATCH: 'The Bronx is a magical place' A magical moment in history . The intensity of the place, Papageorge says, had something to do with the fact that everybody recognized that they were experiencing a brief moment of magic. After all, in its original form it was only open for four years, from 1977 to 1981 (at the closing party, Diana Ross performed to an audience that included Richard Gere, Jack Nicholson and Sylvester Stallone). ""There was a communal recognition that this was thrilling, remarkable, unique,"" Papageorge says. ""They all recognized it. The dancers were dancing wildly, the celebrities were going into the secret rooms for cocaine or sex, and the general feeling was charged with the kind of electricity that you could never find anywhere else."" On one occasion, at a New Year's Eve party, four tons of glitter were dumped from the ceiling, forming a four-inch layer all over the floor. The owner, Ian Schrager, compared it to ""standing on stardust"", though guests complained that the glitter did not leave their clothes for months. ""It sort of pooled on the balcony, and got into everybody's eyes,"" Papageorge recalls. ""But I was so concentrated on what I was creating that I had a sort of force field that resisted the glitter."" On another occasion, a net holding gift boxes full of goodies from fashion houses was released above the crowd. The power of music . ""To me, it was partly the music that set the scene,"" says Papageorge, ""that throbbing disco beat. Partly it was the architecture of the place, it had very high ceilings and a special geometry. But mostly it was the people -- there were a lot of very beautiful and well-dressed people, particularly the women."" Indeed, Studio 54 was one of the most inaccessible nightclubs in the world. According to Papageorge, the owners wanted a ""salad"" of people in the club, comprising a mixture of the rich, famous, young and beautiful. The doormen were charged with creating this combination, and they subjected every aspiring clubber to rigorous scrutiny. According to Papageorge, this was a ""drawn out and difficult"" process. ""People would wait outside for hours,"" he says, ""waiting to be judged. The main doorman was Mark Benecke, who is now a radio presenter. These days he's a very handsome middle-aged man, but back then he was a beautiful young man. By some standards only known by him and the other doormen, it was decided who would get into the club."" Once inside, however, everybody was equal. As Andy Warhol famously said: ""The key of the success of Studio 54 is that it's a dictatorship at the door and a democracy on the dance floor."" Poignant memories . Although some of Papageorge's pictures had been exhibited in the past, they had never been gathered together in a single collection. Two years ago, he went into his archive, pulled out his ""yellow Kodak boxes"" of prints and negatives, and started the process of bringing Studio 54 back to life. ""With the intervention of the decades, I was seeing the pictures again with different eyes, and they were actually better than I remembered,"" he says. ""I think they look incredible. Having let them sit there for 35 years, I've earned the right to be enthusiastic about them again. To me, they hold up very well."" Remembering the glory days of Studio 54 is not without its poignancy. The club represented the final moments of a pre-AIDS world, and the dawn of a new, more cynical age. ""It was a terrible transition marker,"" says Papageorge. ""It was like the last gasp of the Roman empire going down, in a way. The owners were charged with tax evasion, and I the summer of 1981 there was a long article in the New York Times about this mysterious illness affecting the gay community in New York. ""A good percentage of the people in those pictures later died of AIDS. It wasn't a more innocent time -- you could hardly call it innocent. But it was an unreflective, out-of-control, wonderful, stampeding time. It will never happen again."" Unseen photos of Astaire, Garbo, Churchill and others .

"China will never grow at its explosive rate again but India is yet to match its GDP output, Russia is lagging and Turkey's potential is being leached by political turbulence, according to participants in an economic panel hosted by CNN's John Defterios. So where can the world expect to find growth? The panel, held during June's St. Petersburg International Economic Forum -- known as Russia's ""Davos"" -- explored the issue with experts. CNN's guests were Hakan Ates, president and ceo of DenizBank; Emilio Lozoya, ceo of PEMEX; Charles Robertson, global chief economist at Renaissance Capital; Vladimir Yakunin, president of Russian Railways and Nikolai Zelenski, ceo of Nordgold. READ MORE: Russia FinMin: We will survive if Fed winds down stimulus . Between them, the panelists represented countries from the BRICs, and other countries tagged as ones to watch. Robertson kicked off the conversation with his blunt assessment of the world's potential to be dragged out of its mire by China. The country, whose economy was last year flagged to become the world's biggest by 2016, has slowed and expectations for its growth downgraded. Robertson said the country ""will  never again grow at a sustainable 10%."" But the BRIC's other true pillar -- India -- cannot yet match its potential, he added. Russia and Brazil are the other two nations that fall under the BRIC acronym, coined by former Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill, and they are struggling. Russia has been reliant on commodities but prices have been falling in recent months -- and impacting the country's growth prospects. READ MORE: New powers don't need west . Yakunin's role as head of the country's railways affords him a birds-eye view of the country's investment potential.  And he pointed to the need for investment in the real economy, rather than just financial services, to boost growth and create jobs. But, as Yakunin noted, the much-vaunted diversification of the economy has proved difficult for Russia to tackle. According to Zelenski, a lack of infrastructure investment is also the key problem in Russia. Further, he argues the country did not put away enough when the times were good, unlike China. READ MORE: To Russia: Create change with football . Meanwhile in Turkey, which is not a BRIC nation but has enjoyed a buoyant economy despite the turmoil of countries around it,  faces a rockier path to EU membership after the government's heavy-handed approach to the protestors. During the keynote panel at the forum, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""shocked"" at the reaction to the protests and questioned if it was the right time for Turkey to join the European Union. The diplomatic hiccup comes after years of strong growth by Turkey under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's hand. According to Ates, the protests were not against economic pain, given the country's strong record of growth. But, when asked if Erdogan had been in power too long, he noted people needed to express themselves  to secure democracy. ""We will see at the next election if it has been too long,"" he added. Turkey should see cause for hope, Ates said. He sees a ""promising and favorable"" landscape for investors in Turkey, with a well educated population. ""The human capital is there...but we still have to do more."" WATCH MORE: Bank of BRICs? Lozoya said Mexico was another economy with significant potential due to its natural resources and proximity to Latin America. According to Lozoya, there is ""huge potential"" in areas such as manufacturing and petro-chemicals, and the chance to feed hungry markets Latin and North America. However, Lozoya said, Mexico mustn't fall back on protectionist policies. ""we have a good momentum,"" he added.","Where can the world find growth?

"(CNN)Just days after four Magna Cartas were united for the first time in 800 years at the British Library in London, another ancient version of the document has been discovered by chance in a medieval coastal town in England. Mark Bateson, an archivist in Sandwich, southern England, found the previously unknown version of the Magna Carta -- which established the principle that everybody, including the king, was subject to the law -- after historian Nicholas Vincent had asked him to look for a separate document dealing with a local forest that he was researching. After rummaging through a scrapbook of council archives, Bateson found the Forest Charter, a document issued by King Henry III in 1217, as well as a tattered page that he thought looked like the Magna Carta. ""He wasn't really aware of the fact that they were either rare or that this one was indeed what it purported to be. I think, from his point of view, it was all a bit of a shock,"" said Vincent, professor of medieval history at the University of East Anglia. But he says there is no doubt that this is a version of the Magna Carta, or ""The Great Charter,"" that was published in 1300 under the reign of King Edward I. The original document was issued by England's King John in 1215. The document is badly damaged, with a third of its text and the royal seal of Edward I missing and the back of it firmly stuck down. But despite its deformities, Vincent said it could fetch millions. ""It [the damage] probably would interfere with the value of it if someone were foolish enough to sell it,"" he said. ""But I think there's no question of that. ""This one is in nothing like the condition of the one that went for sale in New York [in 2007, for $21.3 million] but I would say it's certainly worth in the millions rather than in the tens and hundreds of thousands. And as a pair, they are all the more desirable."" And other discoveries have been made as well. ""The fact that they [Magna Carta and Forest Charter] are both there in Sandwich is particularly interesting because there is no royal forest in Kent. That really tells us something that we really didn't know before about the way that the document was published,"" Vincent said. ""And given that this is the most important document in English history, people make such a fuss about it, to find out anything new about it is rather exciting."" This is a hugely significant gain for Sandwich. ""Through the American Declaration of Independence, continuing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Magna Carta still underpins individual liberties worldwide,"" said the town's mayor, Paul Graeme. To own such a document, and the Charter of the Forest, is an honor and a great responsibility."" ""What matters is Sandwich now becomes one of a very small number of institutions -- there are only about a dozen -- that own a Magna Carta,"" said Vincent. ""There are lots and lots of institutions across the Atlantic and elsewhere in the world that would love to have this document.""","A version of the Magna Carta published in 1300 has apparently been found in an English town .

"Fanned by scorching summer winds that feel like they're directed from a giant hair dryer, firefighters variously describe the sound of an Australian bush fire as somewhere between a freight train and a jet engine just before take-off. Add to the mix boiling apocalyptic smoke clouds, desperate homeowners caught between fleeing or fighting the fire and sheets of fan-blasted flame that carpet whole stretches of country road, and it is little wonder that residents and firefighters regard bush fires with something approaching awe of the supernatural. ""If Steven Spielberg had come up with it as a special effect, you wouldn't have believed it,"" one resident of the south coast town of Huskisson told me in the wake of devastating Christmas bushfires of 2001. ""At first you could only see a bright orange glow through the thick, white smoke and then, suddenly, there were flames 100 feet high. ""They arched right over the road and set the trees alight behind my house. They were burning like candles."" The flames, almost freakishly, left his home unscathed. Unpredictable and capricious, bush fires are an erratic phenomenon -- houses burn but kitchen tables are left intact, garages burn to the ground leaving cars inside untouched. For Andrew Sullivan, however, head of the Bushfire Dynamics and Application Group at the Australian science unit CSIRO, the explanations for bush fire behavior are more the stuff of science than science fiction. ""Quite often what you get reported in the media are firefighters who are extremely stressed trying to put into words things they've witnessed, and interpreted by journalists who are keen to elaborate on the 'magic' of the situation,"" Sullivan told CNN. ""The thing to understand about fires, particularly landscape fires such as bush fires, is that they do follow physical processes ... where a fire appears to burn some houses and not others, there is a reason for that and that was because there was less fuel or a disconnection in the fuel."" He said after the fact, ordinary explanations can often come to light. ""While seeing one house standing in a row of burnt houses may look surprising, when the fire was actually burning you learn sometime later there was someone there to put the fire out,"" Sullivan said. ""There are some very pedestrian explanations for what could be construed as supernatural events."" He said what is unique to Australian bush fires -- as against wildfires in the U.S. or forest fires in Europe -- was their ability to throw ""spot fires:"" that is, carry embers on the wind and start fresh fires at a massive distance from the fire front. ""The longest distance that an Australian bushfire can 'spot' is about 30 kilometers,"" Sullivan explained, adding that it was one of the primary reasons that fighting fires in Australia is so difficult. ""Spot fires are the result of burning debris lofted in the convection column of a fire being transported up to a great height, falling out of the convection column and transported downwind. ""There's a great potential for them to start new fires -- it allows bush fires to overcome breaks in fuel and topography.  Spot fires can jump rivers or ridges -- the fire throws spots over the break, those spots coalesce and form a new fire and off it goes."" He said one of the phenomena that his unit was studying was the ability for fires to restart -- known as ""escaped fires"" --  in some cases days after firefighters believe they've been extinguished. ""To all intents and purposes it looks like the fire has gone out but when there's a change of wind direction, there's always residual heat in the char fuel,"" he said. ""One of the biggest issues firefighters face is major changes in wind direction. One of the biggest causes of bush fires in Australia are 'escaped' fires."" He said the burnt fuel can sometimes retain heat for long periods -- even without oxygen -- and has many of the qualities of peat fires, which burn underground for months. ""The ability to black out a fire edge takes an awful lot of effort and an awful lot of water because you've got this charring process that can retain residual heat for a long time, and that charring process is anaerobic -- it doesn't need oxygen."" While firebreaks -- meeting the fire with a countervailing controlled fire running in the opposite direction -- are one solution, Sullivan says old fashioned vigilance is the only solution to Australia's perennial bushfire seasons. ""You need to keep an eye on an area that was previously thought to have been put out,"" he said. With the pattern of bad fire weather recurring during the fire season, he said new fires are sparked by old fires with depressing regularity. ""During this fire season it happens twice a week -- every Thursday and Sunday it just flares up again.""","Unpredictable and capricious, Australia's bush fires are an erratic phenomenon .

"Pro-Russian gunmen seized buildings in eastern Ukraine, as new flashpoints developed in the ongoing crisis over the region's future. As tensions rose, acting President Oleksandr Turchinov held an emergency National Defense and Security Council meeting Saturday evening in the capital Kiev, according to the President's press office. In the eastern city of Kramatorsk, police and pro-Russia activists exchanged gunfire, acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov's spokeswoman, Natalia Stativko, told CNN on Saturday. Slightly north, in the town of Slaviansk, gunmen in camouflage stormed and seized a police building early Saturday, authorities said. They arrived in two mini-buses, came to the police station and opened fire at the building before getting inside the facility through windows, the Donetsk regional police press office said. Three police officers were slightly injured. The gunmen introduced themselves as part of the Donetsk republic initiative group, police said. Their goal was to seize hundreds of weapons inside the police building; they allowed the police officers inside to leave the facility, the press office said. A CNN team in Slaviansk saw dozens of armed, well-equipped men in camouflage in control of the Ukraine Security Services (SBU) building, as well as the police building. The men did not want to be filmed. Makeshift barricades have been erected around both buildings. Locals brought food and tires to the armed men at the SBU site. ""We're for democracy, for the rights of the people to express their will,"" one pro-Russian armed activist in Slaviansk told Reuters. ""We want to create a people's republic, a real one, one in Donetsk, one in Luhansk, and in general let the people of the southeast determine what they want. We want to hold a referendum."" A police building in the town of Krasni Liman also had been taken by protesters, according to Stativko, the spokeswoman for Ukraine's acting interior minister, although the CNN team saw no evidence to that effect. Special units are being sent to both Slaviansk and Krasni Liman to assess the situation, she said. Donetsk chief of regional police resigns . The latest reports come amid heightened tensions in the country's largely Russian-speaking eastern region, centered on the cities of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv. Pro-Russian protesters in those cities seized government buildings several days ago and remain barricaded in some. In Donetsk, the chief of regional police has resigned. Kostyantyn Pozhydaev announced his resignation during a pro-Russia activist rally outside the police office, the Donetsk regional police press office said in a statement Saturday. Earlier Saturday, the acting Ukrainian President's website stated that the Head of the Security Service for the Donetsk region, Valery Ivanov, was sacked. A demonstration was held in front of the Donetsk police headquarters Saturday, according to the interior ministry. Although life in most of the city continues as normal, protesters still hold government buildings. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk paid a visit to Donetsk on Friday as he seeks to rally those in the region -- which has strong ties to Russia -- behind the interim government in Kiev ahead of elections due on May 25. He suggested that constitutional reform could give more power to the regions, though the time frame is short. ""We almost don't have time to amend the constitution before the presidential election,"" he said, adding that they need to move fast so that any new president doesn't dictate terms. The United States has accused Russia of fomenting the separatist unrest in its neighbor as a pretext for military intervention. White House expresses concern, Kerry speaks to Lavrov . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Saturday, expressing ""strong concern that attacks today by armed militants in eastern Ukraine were orchestrated and synchronized, similar to previous attacks in eastern Ukraine and Crimea,"" a senior State Department official said. The two diplomats had met late last month in Paris to discuss the crisis. The official said that Kerry warned Lavrov there would be ""additional consequences"" if Russia did not take steps to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine and move its troops back from its border with Ukraine. The official also noted that militants involved in Saturday's unrest in eastern Ukraine ""were equipped with specialized Russian weapons and the same uniforms as those worn by the Russian forces that invaded Crimea."" The White House also reacted Saturday, calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government to ""cease all efforts to destabilize Ukraine."" ""We are very concerned by the concerted campaign we see underway in eastern Ukraine today by pro-Russian separatists, apparently with support from Russia, who are inciting violence and sabotage and seeking to undermine and destabilize the Ukrainian state,"" said National Security Council spokeswoman Laura Lucas Magnuson, in a statement. ""We saw similar so-called protest activities in Crimea before Russia's purported annexation."" Vice President Joe Biden will travel to Kiev on April 22, to meet government leaders and members of the civil society. ""The Vice President will underscore the United States' strong support for a united, democratic Ukraine that makes its own choices about its future path,"" the White House said in a statement. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, in a tweet, described the situation as ""worrisome. ""Russia again seems to be behind"" the unrest, Psaki said Saturday. Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury on Friday imposed a third round of sanctions on individuals considered to be involved in Crimea's annexation. They include six individuals classed by the Treasury as Crimean separatists, former Ukrainian official Sergey Tsekov, and the Crimea-based natural gas company Chernomorneftegaz, which the Treasury says has appropriated assets belonging to Crimea's state-run gas company. ""Crimea is occupied territory.  We will continue to impose costs on those involved in ongoing violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" said Treasury official David S. Cohen. Diplomatic steps . Next Thursday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton will meet in Switzerland with foreign ministers from the United States, Russia and Ukraine to discuss efforts to de-escalate the situation. That meeting will follow talks between EU foreign ministers on Monday in Luxembourg. EU defense ministers are also due to meet Tuesday, with the situation in Ukraine high on the agenda. Western powers say they want to resolve the crisis through diplomatic and political means, and have warned of tougher sanctions against Russia if it intervenes further in Ukraine. Ukraine acting Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, spoke Saturday by phone to discuss preparations for Thursday's meeting, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said. In the call, Deshchytsia demanded that Russian special services agents end their ""provocative actions"" in eastern Ukraine, which are intended to derail the Geneva meeting and impede efforts to resolve the crisis, the ministry said. Lavrov said Friday in a televised interview on Russian state television that there are no Russian troops or Russian secret services agents in southeastern Ukraine, the official ITAR-Tass news agency reported. He also said Russia has no intention of absorbing the southeastern regions of Ukraine, contrary to the fears of the West. Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region last month, following a referendum condemned as illegal by Kiev and the international community, and the West fears it may next seek to enter eastern Ukraine.","Secretary of State Kerry speaks to Russian foreign minister .

"So much blood the theater floor had become slippery. Bodies with horrific injuries. The eerie sound of cell phones ringing, over and over again. This is the scene Aurora police Officer Justin Grizzle said he encountered moments after entering the theater where, according to authorities, 25-year-old James Holmes killed 12 people in a July 20 shooting rampage. Grizzle testified Monday on the opening day of the preliminary hearing for Holmes, who is charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and weapons charges. The 13-year veteran wiped away tears while describing his efforts to rush badly wounded victims to the hospital in his police cruiser, including shooting victim Ashley Moser and her husband, who wanted Grizzle to turn around and head back to the theater. ""He was shot in the head somewhere. He kept asking where his ... daughter was,"" Grizzle said. ""He opened the door and tried to jump out."" Grizzle said he had to drive and hold the man by his shoulder to keep him in the car. The girl the man was seeking, 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, was shot four times and was among those killed in the shooting at a midnight showing of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises."" Veronica's mother, Ashley, faces a long recovery after being paralyzed in her lower half and miscarrying after the shooting. The scene was still gruesome when Detective Matthew Ingui arrived 12 hours later with other investigators. ""We saw the first victim laying on the ground,"" he said ""There's shoes, blood, body tissue and popcorn on the floor."" Blood was everywhere, he said. Ingui described how he outlined each of the victims and marked where the bodies were found. Holmes had no visible reaction during the testimony. The detective said investigators found 209 live rounds of .223 ammunition and 15 cartridges of .40-caliber rounds inside the auditorium. The preliminary hearing that began Monday is designed to show a judge that the state has enough evidence to proceed to trial. Prosecutors are calling scores of witnesses and outlining their evidence in the case. The hearing could go on for days. A gag order imposed by the judge in the case has limited the flow of information about the attack. However, a source said Holmes allegedly went out a rear exit door, propped it open and gathered his weapons. He then returned to the theater and tossed a canister inside before opening fire, the source said. Screaming moviegoers scrambled to escape from the gunman, who shot at random as he walked up the theater's steps, according to witnesses. It was a scene ""straight out of a horror film,"" said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater. While none of the four law enforcement witnesses who testified Monday offered insight into a possible motive for the shooting, some new details emerged. Prosecutors showed surveillance camera video taken inside the theater complex that they said shows Holmes -- dressed in dark trousers, a light-colored shirt with a T-shirt underneath and a ski cap covering his hair -- using a cell phone at a ticket kiosk. Holmes printed out a ticket that had been purchased July 8, they said. The cameras also captured the aftermath of the shooting as waves of people ran out of doors with theater staff behind counters. One employee even leaped over a counter. There was no video from inside the auditorium where the shootings occurred. Police Sgt. Gerald Jonsgaard said Holmes stopped the theater door from locking by using a small piece of plastic commonly used to hold tablecloths onto a picnic table. Jonsgaard also said he  spotted a shotgun and a large drum magazine  that appeared to be jammed on the floor of the theater. Holmes' attorneys are expected to argue that their client has ""diminished capacity,"" a term that, according to the Colorado Bar Association, relates to a person's ability or inability ""to make adequately considered decisions"" regarding his or her legal representation because of ""mental impairment or for some other reason."" Several times, on cross-examination, they have asked witnesses about Holmes' demeanor and what he looked like when police found him. The day's testimony concluded with a detective who interviewed people wounded in the attack and the two coroners who conducted the 12 autopsies. After the hearing, Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester will determine whether there is enough evidence for Holmes to stand trial. Security was tight at the hearing. Spectators had to pass through a metal detector and then were searched again before entering the courtroom. At least nine armed officers stood guard inside, some of them scanning the audience packed with reporters and victims' family members. Holmes did not speak during the hearing. His bushy hair and long beard contrasted with the bright red hair and close-cropped looks he sported during previous appearances. During portions of the hearing, family members of victims held one another, sobbing. Earlier in Monday's hearing, police Officer Jason Oviatt -- the first officer to encounter Holmes after the rampage ended -- testified that Holmes seemed ""very, very relaxed."" Holmes, his pupils dilated, sweating and smelly, didn't struggle or even tense his muscles as he was dragged away to be searched. ""He seemed very detached from it all,"" Oviatt testified, describing Holmes as unnaturally calm amid the chaos and carnage. Oviatt testified Monday that within minutes of the first calls, he responded to the theater and found Holmes standing outside in a helmet and gas mask, his hands atop a white coupe that turned out to belong to him. At first, Oviatt said, he thought Holmes was a police officer, but as he drew within 20 feet, he realized something was terribly wrong. ""He was just standing there. All the other officers were running around, trying to get into the theater,"" Oviatt said. A trail of blood led from the theater. The rifle that authorities believe Holmes used in the attack lay on the ground near the building. Holmes calmly complied with all Oviatt's orders, the officer testified. Another officer, Aaron Blue, testified later that Holmes matter-of-factly told him, without prompting, about the complex web of explosives that authorities would later find in his Aurora apartment. He told Blue that the devices ""wouldn't go off unless we set them off."" Holmes was a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the Anschutz Medical Campus of the University of Colorado, Denver, in Aurora, until he withdrew a month before being arrested outside the bullet-riddled movie theater. He had been a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist, according to a court document filed by his lawyers. His only brush with the law in Colorado appears to have been a 2011 summons for speeding from Aurora police. If Holmes is ruled incompetent to stand trial, the hearing could provide the best opportunity for victims and the public to understand what happened and why. To at least one victim, it doesn't matter if Holmes stands trial. ""I obviously don't want him to walk, but as long as he doesn't see the light of day again, it doesn't really much concern me beyond that,"" said Stephen Barton, who suffered wounds on his face, neck and upper torso in the shooting that night. ""To me, I see the trial as being an opportunity to learn more about what happened that night beyond just my own personal recollection.""

"Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, speaking to mobile tech leaders in Barcelona, said WhatsApp,  the mobile messaging app purchased by the social media giant last week, was ""worth more than $19 billion."" Zuckerberg's comments at Mobile World Congress, referencing the eye-watering price paid for WhatsApp, were met with surprise. But Zuckerberg said the company was ""a great fit for us. Already almost half-a-billion people love using WhatsApp for messaging and it's the most engaging app we've ever seen exist on mobile so far. ""It's on a path to connecting a billion people. There are very few services in the world that can reach that level and they're all incredibly valuable."" Zuckerberg said there were no plans to harvest data from WhatsApp messages, in answer to a question from the audience. ""That's the service that people want, we would be silly to change it."" Asked if he thought concerns over privacy could be a problem for Facebook as it aims for greater global penetration, he said: ""The NSA issue is a real issue, especially for American internet companies. ""Trust is just such an important thing when you're thinking about using any service where you're going to share important and personal information. ""We continue to work to be sure we can share everything that the government is asking of us."" ""The government kind of blew it on this. Governments have a responsibility to protect folks and to also be transparent about what they're doing and I think they've just been way over the line in terms of sharing what they are doing. ""But they are only now starting to get to the range of where they should have been. I think this whole thing could have been avoidable and it would have been a lot better for the internet."" Asked if Facebook would consider bidding again for Snapchat, Zuckerberg said: ""After buying a company for $16 billion you're probably done for a while.""  Snapchat reportedly turned down a $3 billion offer from Facebook last year. Zuckerberg's debut at the trade show, the biggest of its kind in the world, underlines the importance of mobile to the future of the social media giant. While audience interest was in WhatsApp, Zuckerberg -- on stage with technology journalist and writer David Kirkpatrick --- was at the show to promote Facebook's work with Internet.org. Facebook partnered with technology leaders, nonprofits, local communities and experts for the initiative. Zuckerberg said the goal of Internet.org is to ensure everyone in the world has access to the internet in some form, either for a small cost or for free. He said this could be achieved by improving mobile infrastructure and reducing the amount of data required to use services. ""Most people in the world don't have access to the internet at all ... it's about 2.7 billion people today. It's growing way slower than you would imagine. Our vision is to try to connect everyone."" Earlier Monday, Facebook announced it would help roll out an online education program in Rwanda. The deal, which will initially be offered to university students, has been done in partnership with telecommunications giant Airtel, which is providing free educational data for a year to those who sign up and Nokia, which is offering discounted smartphones to those participating. Pamela Clark-Dickson, senior analyst at Informa, said Zuckerberg's appearance in Barcelona made sense given that mobile is key to Facebook's strategy. ""It gives him the opportunity to engage with key mobile operator partners, which will be important in the wake of Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp,"" she said. ""Mobile operators will be keen to discuss with and to learn from Zuckerberg his plans for developing Facebook further as a service from which he can generate revenues from mobile."" Clark-Dickson said the announcement in Barcelona by WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum that the messaging service will add voice calls to its product in the second quarter of 2014 will also be something that mobile operators will want to talk to Zuckerberg about.","Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .

"(CNN)No, Beck, you're not a loser. But some people think you should have been. In Sunday night's biggest surprise, Beck's downbeat ""Morning Phase"" nabbed the Grammy for album of the year -- eclipsing darling-of-the-moment Sam Smith, who collected four Grammys, and pop queen Beyonce, whose latest, self-titled album was a critical and commercial smash. The announcement, by presenter Prince, seemed to stun the audience and even Beck himself. Kanye West briefly crashed the stage in what appeared to be mock protest but then said Beck ""should've given his award to Beyonce."" Beck later said he expected Beyonce to win. On social media, some younger people were even wondering aloud: Um, who is Beck? Here's why the scruffy singer-songwriter's upset win was so surprising -- and why it wasn't: . Beck's record didn't make a big splash . Released in February 2014, ""Morning Phase"" got strong reviews but quickly sank off the charts. None of its singles got mainstream radio play. Billboard ranked it as the 60th top-selling album of the year -- behind Mary J. Blige's Christmas album. While critics praised the record's melancholy beauty, some saw it as a sequel of sorts to his 2002 album ""Sea Change"" and not a groundbreaking artistic statement. But all the Grammy love -- ""Morning Phase"" also won best rock album -- has sparked renewed interest in an artist many may have forgotten. According to Spotify, streams of Beck's music have increased 388% since the Grammys. He hasn't been a commercial force for two decades . ""I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me ..."" Remember that song? No? ""Loser"" came out in 1994, when Beyonce was 12 years old and Sam Smith was still in diapers. The song hit the top 10 in the U.S. and was followed in 1996 by a popular album, ""Odelay,"" and such modest hits such as ""Where It's At."" Grammys 2015: Highs and lows . Critics and alternative-music fans have long admired Beck's talents -- he can play almost any musical instrument -- and his innovative blends of folk, rock, blues, hip-hop and psychedelia. But his cultural relevance seemed to be fading by the late '90s. ""The most complete album of the bunch is 'Morning Phase,' "" wrote Bay Area music critic Jim Harrington in making his Grammy predictions before the ceremony, ""yet it feels 10 to 15 years too late to hand this trophy to Beck."" Beyonce is a global icon in her prime . The most-nominated woman in Grammy history, Beyonce is much more than a photogenic pop icon with strong pipes and a famous husband. She makes great music. Released without warning in December 2013, ""Beyonce"" was a bold, personal statement about love, sex and the challenges of a monogamous relationship. It was the No. 2 top-selling record of the year and drew widespread critical acclaim for its dark, intimate themes and accompanying videos. On Metacritic, it has a higher aggregrate rating than Beck's record. The Grammys often reward strong album sales, and most prognosticators thought Queen B was overdue to claim her first album-of-the-year prize. A win by Smith in this category would not have been a surprise, either. But ... the Grammys have a history of surprises . The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, who vote on the Grammys, are an unpredictable bunch. The academy declines to release a breakdown of its 13,000 voter-eligible members by age, race or gender. But like the group that votes on the Oscars, the Recording Academy is seen by some critics as being old and out of touch with edgier contemporary music, especially when it comes to rap and hip hop. Grammys 2015: The winners list . In 2005, they snubbed Kanye West's ""College Dropout"" and Green Day's ""American Idiot"" and handed album of the year to ""Genius Loves Company,"" a collection of duets between blues legend Ray Charles and other singers. It was a sentimental choice; Charles had died the previous year. Three years later, they overlooked Kanye again, awarding the top-album prize to aging jazz-pop pioneer Herbie Hancock over West's ""Graduation"" and Amy Winehouse's ""Back to Black."" So in that context, a Grammy for Beck, 44, over Beyonce, 33, and Smith, 22, isn't a total shock. Why Beck won . So how did Beck win? As Vox's Kelsey McKinney has noted, it's probably because his competition split the vote. A fan of pop, soul and R&B could have voted for Beyonce or Smith or Pharrell or even Ed Sheeran. But Beck's was the only rock record (it's more folk-rock, really) in the category, giving him a potential edge among the academy's bloc of voters who grew up on, say, Bob Dylan.","Beck upsets Beyonce to claim the Grammy for best album of the year .

"(CNN)""Are you scared when you have to go back to the mountain at night?"" It's a not a question guides at a museum would usually be asked, but it's happened to those at the outdoor Ainu Museum and cultural village in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost and second-largest island. The museum is dedicated to the culture of the Ainu people, an ethnic group that not many -- even in Japan itself -- know much about. For weary guides at the museum, who live close to the museum in Shiraoi, an hour's drive from the city of Sapporo (but not in primitive huts on the hillside), being able to tell visitors about their unique heritage and language is worth the occasional muddleheaded question. Brutal hunting methods . The Ainu people are the indigenous inhabitants of Hokkaido. They're also present on Sakhalin, the island off the east coast of Russia, as well as northern Honshu, Japan's biggest island. Meeting a modern day Ainu isn't common. Estimates put the population of Ainu at around 24,000, and finding any who can speak the critically endangered language fluently is harder still: the Endangered Language Project puts the number of native speakers at just 10. Located outside the small town of Shiraoi (itself an Ainu word meaning ""place with many horseflies""), the museum is a re-creation of an Ainu village on the shores of Lake Poroto. Visitors are immediately greeted by a 30-foot wooden statue of a bearded Ainu chief. From this stoic totem they can stroll among a series of thatched houses and botanical gardens, getting a glimpse of Ainu traditions stretching back about 1,000 years. Museum staff with Ainu heritage host regular displays of traditional mouth harp (known as a ""mukkur"") playing, singing and dancing. They also explain the ways simple homes were decorated and colorful clothing was made from the natural materials of the areas, from bark to animal hide (including some natty salmon-skin boots). The Ainu of centuries ago had an oral tradition. Animistic beliefs and worship of fire dominated daily life and Ainu culture. Numerous rituals were enacted before younger Ainu were allowed to take on the rugged landscape of Hokkaido on hunts or fishing trips. The area's major fauna, like bears and wolves were revered, yet hunting was the norm (some visitors may be put off by the caged brown bears kept on the site that can be fed biscuits for 100 yen, or less than a dollar) and deer could be hunted. Using techniques that might seem brutal by today's attitudes to animal rights, herds would be chased off a cliff before being clubbed to death. Harsh life for Ainu . If survival in Hokkaido was harsh centuries ago, life for modern day Ainu in Japan has not been easy either. The Japanese government did not formally recognize the Ainu as indigenous to Japan, with a distinct language and culture, until 2008, while the westernization of Japan in the Meiji era from 1868 to 1912 lead to greater integration with mainstream Japanese culture. ""Ainu are in difficult economic and social position,"" says Shunwa Honda, a former professor of the Open University of Japan and a scholar of indigenous ethnic groups. ""Twice the number of Ainu are on social welfare compared to the majority Japanese population. Education levels are much lower and they have economic restraints."" While the museum and recreated village presents a vivid reconstruction of Ainu life, Honda thinks that more typical museums can do better to link tradition and heritage to the modern day Ainu life. ""Many Ainu are also reluctant to say they are Ainu. It's a problem of discrimination that lies under the surface,"" says Honda. New moves to raise awareness . However there are signs that the Japanese government may be making an effort to understand the challenges faced by the country's minority groups. In August last year it was reported that first nationwide survey of discrimination against Ainu people would take place in 2015. Educating the public is part of the mission of the museum and plans are in place for a new, more modern Ainu cultural center on the other shore of Lake Poroto in time for the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2020. According to Honda debate continues over the emphasis of the new center. ""Should it continue to highlight the Ainu culture in a historical context and be in danger of appearing irrelevant or should it do what the Smithsonian has done for Native Americans and show the situation for Ainu today?"" he asks. For now visitors to Shiraoi's  Ainu Museum can get a glimpse into the rugged life lived by the area's indigenous inhabitants while modern Japan tries to find a comfortable place for their cultural legacy.

"Since retiring he has been relaxing by building Lego models, but David Beckham is back in football -- and this time he's got his very own team. Beckham, who retired from football in May 2013, unveiled his new project Wednesday after confirming he will establish a Major League Soccer franchise in Miami, Florida. ""I want to create a team that is  personal to me,"" Beckham told reporters Wednesday. ""I know this city is ready for soccer, football, and this is going to be successful. "" I know there was a team 10 years ago which folded. I wanted to create a team that can be very personal. ""I want to make it my own team. We are very excited, Miami is a vibrant city with a lot of passion. I am looking forward to spending a lot more time and my family being here."" When Beckham signed for Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007, a clause was inserted into his contract which gave him the option to create a new MLS team for $25 million. The announcement, which was made at the Perez Art Museum in Miami, comes after months of speculation. The MLS, which will begin its 19th season on March 8, currently features 19 clubs with teams in New York City and Orlando set to join the fray in 2015. The League is expected to add three more franchises by 2020, including Beckham's. Beckham must wait to ensure his franchise meets the requirements over a stadium and financing before the MLS board can accept Miami as the league's 22nd club. But the former England captain will is confident his new project will be a huge success and bring great reward for the city. ""There are a lot of things to do, nothing successful is easy in life,"" he added. ""There will be more fun times than difficult times. We are going to have a lot of interesting people that want to invest in this club. ""When you have the right investors, with passion for the game, that is the place to start. ""We are making a soccer club that is going to loved by millions of people. We plan on this being a global team."" Beckham and his representatives have also confirmed they will fund the club's new stadium privately and have held talks with Miami Mayor Carlos Gimenez. He said: ""We don't want public funding. We will fund the stadium ourselves. ""It's something we've worked on very hard where we can fund it ourselves. ""The support we've had so far has been incredible. We want to create a club which is the people's football club."" In October 2013, Beckham revealed his desire to set up a new franchise during a show broadcast live on Facebook to his 30 million followers. ""I'm passionate about staying in football and being an owner of a team is something I'm passionate about,"" he said at the launch of his new book last year. The news of Beckham's project was revealed in more detail last November when NBA star LeBron James confirmed he was teaming up with the former England football captain. James, who plays basketball with the Miami Heat, said preliminary talks were underway and was keen to be involved in the venture. ""David has become a good friend of mine over the last few years, and I think it would be great for this city to have a football club for sure. There's interest on both sides. It's preliminary talks but there is some open dialogue,"" James said last November. If a partnership is agreed it would be James's second investment in the sport -- the 28-year-old is already a minority shareholder in English Premier League team Liverpool. ""I've grown a great interest in watching the game ... it's a pretty intense sport and my kids love it as well. I've grown to the point where I know exactly what's going on when I'm watching the game.""

"(CNN)Despite clashes that  killed at least 19 fans before kickoff, a soccer match in Egypt continued to the very end, state media reported. The nation's Health Ministry said 19 people died in the riots at a match in Cairo on Sunday. The violence occurred shortly before the match, but the game between Zamalek and ENPPI  teams continued,  Al-Ahram newspaper said. It ended with a 1-1 draw. Soccer fans posted social media images of what they said were bodies from the riots, some still wearing jerseys with their teams' names. Screaming relatives and friends gathered at the morgue in central Cairo, where they waited for the bodies. Fans from rival clubs went to console the grieving as a show of solidarity. Shortly after the incident, soccer fans traded accusations with the Interior Ministry, which blamed the violence on riots from ticketless fans who tried to push their way in. ""They climbed the fence. The security forces tried to disperse them, the fans fled to the main road and blocked traffic and stopped the bus carrying the Zamalek soccer team,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""They set fire to a police vehicle. We got reports of fatalities because of a stampede."" But Zamalek fans painted a different picture. In a social media posting, they said they were tear gassed as they tried to go through a single, small gated entrance that was opened to allow them into the match. Egypt's general prosecutor is sending a team to investigate. Meanwhile, the Cabinet has suspended the nation's premier league matches  indefinitely. Sunday's attack is not the first violence at a game. Three years ago, a riot at a match between Al-Masry and Al-Ahly teams left more than 70 people dead in Port Said city. Horrified witnesses described how police officers stood by and watched as rival fans attacked one another with rocks, knives and swords. After that incident, Egypt banned soccer fans from games. Teams played in nearly empty stadiums. Authorities later partially lifted the ban by allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, state media reported. CNN's Ian Lee and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","It is the deadliest soccer-related violence in Egypt since a  stampede three years ago .

"(CNN)Everyone agrees -- the mysterious death of Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman has all the twists of a thriller. But what exactly does that mean? A number of people have been pulled into the unfolding story of the prosecutor's death. Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating a deadly 1994 terror attack, alleged that the country's President, foreign minister and other political leaders covered up Iranian involvement in the attack. The government told Iran it would back off in exchange for a favorable trade deal, Nisman alleged. He filed his report, but one day before his scheduled testimony before lawmakers on the allegations, he was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head. There were initial reports of suicide, but many had their doubts. Sure enough, suspicions appeared to be confirmed when no gunpowder residue was found on Nisman's hands, which would have been expected if he had shot himself. Since then, a number of strange things have happened in Argentina, all seemingly related to Nisman's death. Here's a look at the people, events and places that form part of a web that continues to unspool: . The Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, or AMIA, was the target of the July 18, 1994, terror attack that killed 85 people and injured hundreds in Buenos Aires. The attack on the Jewish community center is the worst terror attack in Argentina's history. A suicide attacker drove an explosive-laden vehicle into the building. Argentina has the largest Jewish community in Latin America. He was the prosecutor who accused Argentina's President and other top leaders of covering up Iran's alleged role in the Jewish center bombing. Nisman was found dead after filing a report with his allegations in court, and one day before he was slated to testify on his accusations in front of Congress. His death remains a mystery. A gun and shell casing by his side made it look like a suicide, but an initial test found no gunpowder residue on his hands. Almost immediately, suspicions arose that Nisman's death was linked to his allegations against the President, foreign minister and other political elites. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner called it a suicide, then quickly changed her tune. The government denies it had a role in the prosecutor's death. Nisman was appointed as special prosecutor on the AMIA bombing in 2005 by then-President Nestor Kirchner, Fernandez's late husband. Even before Nisman became the lead investigator, previous Argentine prosecutors suspected Iran's involvement in the terrorist attack. In 2004, Argentina issued arrest warrants for 12 Iranians and requested that Interpol issue red notices for these suspects. But allegations of misconduct by Argentine investigators resulted in the case falling apart. Nisman was appointed after this mess to sort it out. Nisman's own investigation also pointed at Iran, and in 2007, Argentina issued new arrest warrants and went back to Interpol. This time six red notices were issued. The Iranian suspects are Imad Fayez Moughnieh, Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad Reza Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi and Mohsen Rezai. The most prominent of these suspects is Vahidi, who for a time was Iran's defense minister. Argentina also asked for red notices for three others --  former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Hadi Soleimanpour, the former ambassador of Iran in Buenos Aires. Interpol did not issue red notices for them. None of the Iranian suspects are in custody and Iran has not made them available to Argentine prosecutors. In 2013, Argentina's Congress approved the creation of a joint commission to investigate the 1994 AMIA bombing. The five-member ""truth commission"" would include Argentine and Iranian investigators who would work together to get to the bottom of the terror attack. Argentine lawmakers deliberated for more than 14 hours before passing the measure by a 131-113 vote. Later, Nisman would call this agreement the public face of the alleged cover-up. Fernandez's government heralded the agreement as a way for prosecutors to finally interrogate the Iranian suspects. But there was much opposition, including from Jewish groups. They were worried the commission's verdict would be nonbinding and distrusted Iran. Fernandez was elected President of Argentina in 2007. She succeeded her husband, Nestor Kirchner, who was President from 2003-2007 and who died in 2010. Fernandez was re-elected in December 2011 to a new four-year term. As President, she has often been combative, accusing opponents of undermining her ability to govern. When Nisman was found dead, she made a statement calling it a suicide, followed by a second statement saying she didn't believe he took his own life. In the wake of the Nisman scandal, Fernandez traveled to China on a business trip, where she made headlines for a tweet mocking the Chinese accent. Hector Timerman, Argentina's foreign minister, is among those accused of conspiring to cover up Iran's involvement in the Jewish center bombing. After Nisman's death, Timerman told CNN the allegations of a cover-up were baseless. Fernandez's government has done more than any previous administration to get to the bottom of the bombing, Timerman said. ""I am Jewish,"" he said. ""And to think that a person of my religion, the Jewish religion, can make a deal not to prosecute the death of 85 people, most of them Jewish in Argentina ... I have to tell you, it's not easy to live with."" He has said that he never asked to have the red notices for the Iranian suspects removed. His reputation has taken a hit. Timerman signed the agreement with the Iranians to investigate the bombing jointly, a move criticized by Argentina's Jewish community. At the time, he said: ""I negotiated this memorandum with who I had to, not with who I wanted to. At each step, I kept in mind that us Argentinians learned with lots of pain that we have to seek justice and not condemnations, to seek the truth and not vengeance."" Diego Lagomarsino was an assistant to Nisman. He also is the only person charged in connection with the prosecutor's death, charged with illegally letting Nisman borrow a gun. Lagomarsino faces up to six years in prison if convicted. The IT expert broke his silence at a news conference, saying he committed no crime and that he let Nisman borrow the gun at the prosecutor's insistence. Nisman feared for his safety after he filed his report in court and didn't trust his own security guards, Lagomarsino said. According to Lagomarsino, Nisman was so fearful that he didn't go out to buy his own groceries and feared for his daughters. Nisman told Lagomarsino not to worry, that he wasn't going to use the gun. But when Lagomarsino texted later to check on Nisman, the prosecutor never answered. Viviana Fein is a federal prosecutor who leads the investigation into Nisman's death. It's not unusual for her, or those she interviews, to be swarmed by television news cameras outside her office. Fein's approach to the investigation has been careful and transparent. She provides occasional statements with updates on whom she has spoken with and what tests are being conducted on the evidence. However, she made missteps that have damaged her credibility in the eyes of some. When the Clarin newspaper reported that Nisman had drafted an arrest warrant affidavit for Fernandez, Timerman and others, Fein was quoted saying it was not true. The government also denied it. The next day, Fein said her comments were misunderstood. She confirmed that Nisman had indeed contemplated seeking the arrests of the President and others. The draft documents were found in trash can in Nisman's apartment, she said. The Secretariat of Intelligence, or SI, is the country's domestic intelligence service. Locally, it is also known as ex-SIDE, referring to the agency's previous name, the Intelligence Secretariat of the State (SIDE by its Spanish initials). In the wake of Nisman's death, the government has suggested that rogue intelligence agents fed Nisman false information about a cover-up and then killed him after he filed the accusations in court. ""They used him while he was alive, and then they needed him dead,"" the President said in a statement days after Nisman's body was found. Fernandez then sent a bill to Congress that would abolish the SI and replace it with a new agency, to be called the Federal Intelligence Agency. The SI has ""not served the interests of the country,"" Fernandez said. Lawmakers are debating the proposal. Horacio Antonio Stiuso is his full name, but he is known by his nickname, ""Jaime."" He is a key witness, but he seems to have disappeared. When Fernandez refers to a rogue intelligence officer who fed false information to Nisman, she is talking about Stiuso. Stiuso led the SI until Fernandez booted him last year. The former spy chief allegedly retaliated by tricking Nisman into accusing the government of a criminal cover-up, Fernandez and her supporters claim. Fernandez moved to relieve Stiuso of his obligation to keep secrets, so that he can testify. Stiuso was slated to testify during the first week of February but couldn't be found. Fein has since said she is confident he will testify soon. Damian Pachter is a journalist for the English-language Buenos Aires Herald. A dual citizen of Argentina and Israel, he broke the news of Nisman's death, reporting it via Twitter. After the scoop, Pachter dropped off the radar, with some saying he fled Argentina fearing for his safety. In a strange response, the Argentine government published a copy of Pachter's travel records, saying they showed he simply went to Uruguay and had purchased a return ticket. But Pachter didn't return. He announced on Twitter a few days later that he was in Israel, in exile. Sergio Berni is Argentina's security secretary. His tie-in to this mystery? Local media widely reported that he arrived at Nisman's apartment, with Nisman's mother, before investigators arrived. He also was the first person to publicly call Nisman's death a suicide. Not surprisingly, questions have swirled about what a government minister was doing at the scene before the investigators, and why he announced the suicide theory so quickly.","Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman dies mysteriously while investigating 1994 attack .

"Hong Kong (CNN)China has executed a mining tycoon found guilty of murder and running a ""mafia-style"" organization, state media reported Monday. Liu Han, 48, the former chairman of Hanlong Group, was executed along with his brother, Liu Wei, and three associates, official news agency Xinhua reported. The men met with their families before they were executed, Xinhua said. Liu has been linked by state media to former security czar Zhou Yongkang -- the most senior official snared in China's anti-corruption campaign. Hanlong's interests included mining, real estate, electricity, energy and finance and the company remains a shareholder in two Australian companies - Moly Group and Sundance Resources. Liu was detained in 2013 along with his younger brother. They were sentenced to death in May 2014. The Liu brothers started out running gambling dens in their base in Guanghan, in China's southwestern Sichuan province, in the early 1990s, gathering around them ""a gang of local thugs and vagrants,"" state media reported around the time of their trial. The brothers' empire grew, before finally attracting the attention of central authorities with an alleged public shooting at a Guanghan teahouse one afternoon in January, 2009, supposedly ordered by Liu Wei and directed at an underworld rival. Liu Han also developed a reputation as a philanthropist, building a rural school campus following a 2008 earthquake that devastated Sichuan. His brother also had a reputation for charity, and had been a torch-bearer in the build-up to the Beijing Olympics, also in 2008. CNN's Tim Hume contributed to this report .","China has executed a mining tycoon found guilty of murder and running a ""mafia-style"" organization .

"(CNN)It was in a New York cab. That's when Grammy Award-winning signer Angelique Kidjo realized the extent that ""fear-bola"" had spread. ""The driver just asked, 'where are you from?' Of course I have an accent, and I'm not going to hide the fact that I'm from West Africa. Then he said, 'Ebola', and I said, 'do I LOOK like I have Ebola?'"" Later, when announcing her recently wrapped up Carnegie Hall tribute to South African singer Miriam Makeba, aka, Mama Africa, the trolls came out again. ""It should be Mama Ebola,"" one wrote, and ""I wonder if she is bringing any Ebloa (sic) with her?"" chimed in another. ""Until that point, I felt the hysteria of it, but I kept saying to myself, 'it's just the media.' Then it comes to you direct."" Overall, she's not been impressed with how the Western media has covered the epidemic. In her opinion, the current coverage represents a tragically lost opportunity. ""I thought Ebola would bring greater journalism, that they'd write about the need for great nurses and great doctors, or how every human being on this planet has the right to a good healthcare system,"" she confesses. Clearly, she's been disappointed. ""I hoped they'd show the beauty of the people. But it's much more dramatic and more entertaining to show us dying."" In typical Kidjo fashion, she channeled her outrage into advocacy, and penned a New York Times op-ed. That is how the Benin-born singer-songwriter operates. When something makes her angry, she speaks out. In 2006, she was nearly dragged off stage at a concert in Zimbabwe when she criticized the regime of President Mugabe. Earlier this year, in a CNN interview with Christian Amanpour, she expressed her contempt for Uganda's anti-gay laws. As a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador (a role she's held since 2002), she's campaigned heavily for AIDS and HIV prevention. Her critics are quick to dismiss her, and some have spread rumors that she is gay, or HIV positive, in an attempt to discredit her. ""If you search me in the French Wikipedia, I am listed as homosexual. I say well, it doesn't really matter to me. If it helps you understand that a homosexual has the same rights as any other human being, fine. If you think that me having HIV can help people protect themselves, then I will take that. I cannot be stopped by those things, because every time you keep silent, somebody dies, and we don't have endless resources of human beings."" Later this week, Kidjo will tackle another one of her passions -- female empowerment -- at a concert at London's Southbank Centre. She will perform songs from her latest album, Eve, which she made as a tribute to her mother (for whom the album is named) and to women in general. ""We woman around the globe, we carry the world on our back. We build society,"" she says. Of course, it wasn't always easy for Kidjo growing up as an outspoken woman in Benin -- a country which adheres to traditional gender roles. ""Some people look at you like you're a piece of meat, or they think because you're a woman or a girl, you don't have a brain,"" she admits. Kidjo's house, however, was atypical. Her mother taught the boys to cook, and her father valued female independence. ""My father used to say, 'sexism is cowardice, it's insecurity,'"" she recalls. Angelique Kidjo will be playing Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall on 14th November as a part of the EFG London Jazz Festival. Questions from readers . We asked and you delivered. Angelique Kidjo answers questions from CNN readers. What advice do you have for African women in the Western world? How can we keep a balance between Western culture and our roots? Well, when you go somewhere, you come with your culture, right? The balance you find is how you bring it to the table. It doesn't matter where I go, I'm always going to be an African woman. I take what I need to strengthen myself, to move forward and grow as a human being. But I ain't giving away my culture and identity for anything in this world -- never. What does ""Batonga"" [the name of one of your songs] mean? Batonga is a word that I made up. When I was in high school, and boys would insult me or make stupid comments, like ""come here and clear my food"", I'd turn back and say, ""batonga"", which for me means, ""Take a hike! Get off my back. I do what I want and I will be whoever I decide to be, despite your stupidity."" You speak Yoruba. Do you have Nigerian roots? Yes, from my grandfather. He came from slave descendants. What singers inspired you the most growing up? One day a friend of my brother's brought over a Miriam Makeba album and it was the first time I saw a black woman on the cover of an album. Before that, I only saw white females, white males and black males on vinyl covers. When you start doing things, you want somebody who looks like you to be doing it too, to get the courage to do it. That's when I started thinking that one day, if I don't become a human rights lawyer, I will become a singer, like her.","Angelique Kidjo is a Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter .

"The Florida A&M University marching band's fraternity charter has been revoked for five years because of a hazing incident two years ago, the Kappa Kappa Psi National Fraternity said Monday. Florida A&M President James Ammons announced Tuesday that the band would remain on suspension through the 2012-2013 academic year after another hazing that resulted in the death of a student last November. Thirteen people have been charged in connection with the death of Robert Champion, 26, who was badly beaten during last year's incident on a band bus after a football game in Orlando. The 28 fraternity members and alumnus members who were present during a hazing in the spring of 2010 have been expelled from the fraternity, the group said. The school's Delta Iota chapter can apply to reactivate its charter in May 2017, it said.","FAMU's Delta Iota chapter can apply to reactivate its charter in 2017, Kappa Kappa Psi says .

"The man accused of killing six people in an Arizona shooting rampage can receive medical treatment for another four months, a federal judge ruled Monday after reviewing a report from a psychologist that found ""measurable progress"" in the suspect's condition. The medical treatment plan for Jared Loughner -- aimed at improving his mental state, so he would be competent to stand trial -- was set to expire on Wednesday. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Larry Burns decided to extend that treatment until at least June 7, Ninth Circuit court spokesman David Madden said. Loughner, 23, allegedly killed six people and wounded 13 others during a January 2011 meet-and-greet event for then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords outside a Tucson supermarket. Giffords, who was shot in the head, stepped down from her position in Congress last month in order to focus on her recovery. Prosecutors have said that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia, and his mental condition has been central to much of the related court proceedings since the mass shooting. Burns led Monday's hearing from San Diego, where he is based. He is overseeing the case in part because one of the shooter's victims was Arizona-based federal Judge John Roll. Prosecutors and defense attorneys participated from Tucson in Monday's session by videoconference, according  to Madden. The judge reviewed a report prepared by Dr. Christina Pietz, Loughner's psychologist, indicating  the suspect had made what Burns termed ""measurable progress"" toward competency. Burns made his decision to extend Loughner's treatment based on that report, said the court spokesman. Neither the defense nor the prosecution presented any additional evidence. Pietz will notify Burns if she determines Loughner is competent before June 7. Loughner was declared incompetent to stand trial last May after an initial evaluation term at a federal mental hospital in Springfield, Missouri, where he is now. Norway massacre suspect to remain in custody . In July, bizarre and suicidal actions by Loughner while in custody pushed a federal appeals panel to allow authorities to force the defendant to take anti-psychotic medication. Prosecutors said then that Loughner had been deteriorating: He displayed screaming and crying fits that lasted hours, harmed himself and made claims that the radio was inserting thoughts into his head, they said. His attorneys have consistently fought court rulings that Loughner continue his treatment at the Missouri hospital. In November, defense attorney Ellis Johnston argued before a different federal judge that the side effects of the psychotropic drugs he has been receiving during his court-ordered treatment may interfere with Loughner's ability to work with his attorneys. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina Cabanillas said then that Loughner ""could revert to being a danger to himself"" if the medication were halted. ""It is his mental illness that is the cause of the danger in the hospital setting,"" Cabanillas told the court.","A judge rules Jared Loughner can continue his medical treatment until June .

"When it comes to finding a doctor, chances are you spend a lot more time worrying about your man, your kids, or your parents than yourself. After all, you're strong enough to soldier through the occasional cold, right? If this sounds like you, you're not alone: In a recent survey, nearly a third of Americans who don't have a primary care physician (PCP) said they didn't think they needed one. The truth is, we all do. Not only do people with a regular doc receive better overall care, but it's easier for them to get an appointment on short notice -- helpful for reassurance on day-to-day health queries, and especially crucial if you should ever find yourself in a serious health crisis. ""Finding a doctor before you get sick is especially important now that more insurance plans are requiring that PCPs serve as gatekeepers for our medical needs,"" says Trisha Torrey, author of ""You Bet Your Life: The Ten Mistakes Every Patient Makes"". Your mission: To locate an M.D. with great experience; an organized, friendly office staff; and, most of all, the ability to collaborate well with you (it is, after all, your body and health). Here's how. Health.com: Secrets women keep from their doctors . Step 1: Go to your network . Your social network, that is. Start by asking your friends and family (and any doctors you have and like) for the names of their favorite docs. This method may seem unscientific, but in one recent survey, doctors ranked getting a recommendation from family or friends as the most valuable way for you to choose a good physician. Consider also checking an online doctor-rating site, like vitals.com or zocdoc.com. Just keep in mind that opinions from others may be a good gauge of a doctor's bedside manner (which is indeed important), but not necessarily a way to measure her medical ability. ""Friends who have had only annual checkups don't have as good a sense of their doctors' medical competence, so see if you can ask someone who's had health trouble,"" Torrey says. ""If they felt well-served by the doctor, that's a better bet."" That was true for Abby Gardner, 36, a New York City website editor: ""Recently, I noticed a spot on my chest. My friend suggested I see her doctor, Dr. Henry Lee."" Lee had found a melanoma on Gardner's friend's roommate, who raved about his care and professionalism. ""He not only checked the spot, but also found a mole on my thigh that turned out to be a melanoma,"" she says. ""I was so glad to have a thorough doctor who caught it early."" If your friends don't give you any good leads, contact your nearest academic medical center (a hospital linked to a medical school, also known as a teaching hospital) and ask for a referral. ""Those centers are usually highly rated,"" says Lisa Rubenstein, M.D., director of the VA/UCLA/RAND Center for the Study of Healthcare Provider Behavior. Health.com: What to do when you disagree with your doctor . Step 2: Check out her credentials . There's no need to limit yourself to doctors who graduated from the fanciest medical school around. What matters more, says Rubenstein: ""the hospital where they did their residency, and where they practice."" Two reasons why: A residency is where physicians get their on-the-job training, and the other M.D.'s they practice with seem to affect their clinical style more than where they went to school. Look for a doctor who is board-certified and affiliated with a reputable hospital (your insurance company's website will generally list credentials and affiliations), since, if you ever wind up being hospitalized, this will likely be the place you'll go. ""Academic hospitals generally do better in terms of safety and patient outcomes than unaffiliated community hospitals,"" says Rubenstein. Hospitalcompare.hhs.gov can help you assess the quality of hospitals in your area. Health.com: Want to skip the doctor? Try this . Step 3: Vet the office . You can find out some key details about a prospective doctor just by calling her. Start with how you're greeted. If the receptionist treats you poorly, it may be a sign that the practice isn't respectful of patients in general, says Torrey. If the doctor and her staff are nice and professional, on the other hand, you will know that she runs a practice where patients are treated with respect. Health.com: How to have a great doctor-patient relationship . Step 4: Size her up in person . Once you're finally face-to-face with the M.D., do a gut check. Do you feel comfortable? Your health will benefit if you do: A recent study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that patients who had empathetic, engaged physicians felt more supported and were better able to take charge of their own well-being. Last year, Brenda Avadian, of Los Angeles, went in search of a new primary care doctor because her last one was dismissive of her complaints of exhaustion. She vetted a prospective doc online, then set up an appointment. ""After an hour, I decided to switch to him,"" says Avadian, 52, who works in the caregiving industry. ""He really took time to listen to me."" Her new doctor ordered a complete blood panel, and within a couple of days, Avadian had a diagnosis: Her thyroid was sluggish. ""The problem could have gotten worse,"" she says. ""It worked out because I found a doctor who really listens."" You may not get an hour with your prospective PCP the way Avadian did, but all you need is a few minutes to tell if she's up to snuff. Rubenstein recommends that you bring three questions about your health issues, big or small, to your first appointment. As the doctor answers your queries, think to yourself: Does she explain things well? Does she consult with me and give me time to ask follow-up questions? A doctor who does these things -- and makes you feel comfortable -- just might be your perfect match.","Nearly a third of Americans who don't have a PCP said they didn't think they needed one .

"(CNN)Georgia has its first confirmed case of measles since 2012, the state's Health Department said Monday. ""The infected infant arrived in Atlanta from outside of the U.S. and is being cared for at Egleston at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta,"" the Georgia Department of Public Health said in a statement. Health officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ""to identify anyone who may have been exposed to the patient and to prevent further spread of measles,"" the statement said. Measles is a serious and highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads when a person breathes, coughs or sneezes and droplets travel through the air. The disease is especially dangerous for infants, who cannot receive vaccines until they are at least 6 months old. Young children are also particularly vulnerable in cases in which they have received only one dose of measles vaccine. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, tiny white spots on the inner lining of the cheek and a rash with tiny red spots that starts at the head and spreads. Though there's no cure for measles, it can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective, according to medical professionals. ""Keeping immunization levels high is critical to preventing outbreaks or sustained transmission in Georgia,"" said Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health. ""More than 98 percent of children heading into kindergarten in our state have received all school required vaccines, which includes two doses of measles vaccine."" Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but a recent outbreak has been traced to Disneyland in California. As of February 6, there are 121 cases of measles in 17 states and Washington, D.C., the CDC said. There are 88 cases in California, and 103 cases nationwide are linked to the Disneyland outbreak. The state with the second-highest number of measles cases is Arizona, which has seven, the CDC reports. Illinois has three, and Washington has four. The other places reporting one or more cases are Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Utah.

"(CNN)Home means many different things to different people. It's an idea that intrigues German-born photographer Corinna Kern, who moved into a squatted commercial building for several months in order to document the uncommon lifestyle unfolding behind its walls. She first visited a squat -- a building occupied by people who don't own it or pay rent -- out of personal interest in April 2013, while she was in London studying for her master's degree. The notion that this interest could be developed into a wider concept only came along a month or two later, she said. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled ""A Place Called Home,"" in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place. Having moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. She also found herself part of a wider alternative community that's both transient and close-knit. Through the connections she made, she visited six other squats in north and south London. One was in a former fabric warehouse, another in an abandoned garden center, a third in a white-walled former design studio. ""As the squatting scene is very interconnected, I came to discover how diverse squats can be, both in their visual appearance and emotional vibe,"" she said. ""The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project."" All the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises. A law enacted in September 2012 made it illegal to squat in residential properties. With housing costs high in London and affordable options in short supply, squatting can seem an appealing option to some people -- although, as Kern points out, it's not a lifestyle chosen simply because of homelessness or poverty. ""What might commonly be perceived as a shelter for the homeless or poor is often a conscious choice of an alternative and communal way of living,"" she writes in the text accompanying her images. ""The squatting lifestyle attracts many individuals on their search for adventure, freedom, friendship and self-discovery. Yet, it demands sacrifices and the ability to change and adapt."" The squatters' campaign group SQUASH (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes) says no one knows how many squatters there are nationwide at any one time. But it is clear that tens of thousands of people in the UK have squatted at one time or another, it says. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The Empty Homes Agency, an independent charity group that campaigns for empty homes to be used for those in need, estimates that there are currently 610,000 empty homes in England. About one-third of these homes have been empty for six or more months, it says. But since it's now illegal to squat in residential properties, empty or not, squatters have turned to London's disused commercial buildings, many of which have been left empty long-term. When squatters move in, they bring a new life to the space, often surprising in its incongruity. In one of Kern's photographs, taken inside the disused fabric warehouse, a man rests on a shelf used for storing rolls of cloth. He's hard to spot at first among the jumble of multicolored fabric. Other images show ""The Castle,"" a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Graffiti covers the walls, and party detritus is scattered across the floor where office workers once walked. Another of Kern's photographs, taken in a squat in a former cabaret restaurant, shows a young man and woman, semi-clothed and hard at work to repair and alter their surroundings using cloth and wood. For her project, Kern says, she used only a wide-angle lens to reflect the closeness of her subjects. ""The use of natural light adds to a candid feel,"" she said, adding to the authenticity of the images. ""I visually tried to convey the very different vibes of the squats that became homes, according to both their residents and the nature of the occupied spaces. Especially for the squat that I stayed at, I focused largely on the communal lifestyle in order to convey a sense of home."" Far from encountering resistance as she ventured into people's intimate space, Kern says she made many friends. This was in part because she won people's trust by living among them -- but also because her project aimed to celebrate the positive aspects of their lifestyle rather than reinforce the negative stereotypes of squatters as wasters, tax dodgers or down-and-outs. ""My fellow squatters knew that I was a photographer documenting the squatting lifestyle, since I was always carrying my camera with me,"" she said. ""The squatters were very welcoming when I first met them, became my friends, hence the majority reacted positively towards me taking photographs."" Despite the privations that come with squatting in buildings that often have no electricity or running water, Kern says she would do it again -- although she wants to try out the many other alternative lifestyles out there first. From her images and her words, it's clear she found her time in a squat an overwhelmingly rewarding experience. ""You may not have a shower, but you may gain the most amazing rooftop views,"" she writes. ""You may have to share your room with seven other people, but you may share your happiest moments with them.

"The United States and several Arab nations carried out airstrikes against ISIS in Syria early Tuesday, intensifying the campaign against the Islamic militant group. Tomahawk missiles launched from the sea began the strikes against the Sunni Muslim extremists, followed by bombers and fighters. Here are answers to key questions about the new phase in the conflict with ISIS: . Which areas were hit? The bombing has focused on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, a city in northern Syria. ISIS has had control of Raqqa for more than a year, imposing its brutal interpretation of Islamic law on the city's residents. The extremists have made the city, which sits on the banks of the Euphrates River, the de facto capital of their self-declared ""Islamic State"" that stretches across large areas of Syria and Iraq. ISIS targets around other Syrian cities -- Deir Ezzor, Al Hasakah and Abu Kamal -- were also hit in the strikes. What is the Khorasan Group? What was struck? The attacks damaged multiple ISIS targets, the U.S. military said, including training compounds, headquarters, storage facilities, supply trucks and armed vehicles. ""Usually the first part of any air campaign are strategic targets -- fixed locations, big buildings, things that you don't need a guy on the ground to laser-designate,"" said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, an Air Force veteran intelligence officer and CNN military analyst. The Pentagon also said ISIS fighters were hit in the strikes but didn't specify how many. In Raqqa, a building in the governor's compound, a post office and a recruitment center were among the sites struck, activists reported. Maps: Arab nations join U.S., expand fight against terror to Syria . Why is Raqqa a focus of the initial strikes? The city is known as a place where ISIS houses training centers, weapons depots and accommodations for fighters. During the Syrian conflict, the group has also seized military bases from the Syrian regime near the city and in the wider Raqqa province. The targets hit by the airstrikes are intended to hurt ISIS' ability to command and control, resupply and train, a senior U.S. military official told CNN's Jim Sciutto. ISIS has made Raqqa the flagship for its model of governance, providing food, fuel and security to people struggling to survive after years of civil war. But it also imposed hardline Islamist law there and metes out harsh punishment to those who don't follow orders. Locals started calling the city Tora Bora last year, saying it felt as if the Taliban of Afghanistan had taken over. Who is taking part in the airstrikes? All the foreign partners participating in the strikes with the United States are Arab countries: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain and Qatar. ""It's a remarkable diplomatic achievement,"" said CNN Political Commentator Peter Beinhart. ""I don't think it was expected that there would be this much Arab support."" How long will the attacks go on? For a while. The first wave of strikes was expected to last into the early hours of Tuesday morning in Syria, CNN's Sciutto reported. It is aimed at striking a strong initial blow, a senior U.S. official told CNN. The aerial campaign on ISIS targets in Syria is expected to continue beyond Tuesday. Counterterrorism expert Philip Mudd said Tuesday's attacks were ""just the start."" ""This is not a definitive blow,"" said Mudd, who previously worked for the CIA. ""When this gets interesting to me as a former practitioner is six months down the road, when a second-tier ISIS commander starts to create some sort of cell to recruit foreigners from Europe or the United States or Canada into Syria, do we still have the will and capability, and the intelligence, to locate that person, or that group of people, and put lead on the target?"" What happens next? U.S. military officials will be trying to assess the effectiveness of the first night of bombing. Some analysts have suggested that ISIS had already started dispersing its assets and fighters after President Barack Obama's warning of action in Syria earlier this month. The response of ISIS fighters to the initial strikes may give military officials clues on what to target next. ""The follow-up to some of these strikes is -- what are their actions now?"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, a CNN military analyst. ""There is intelligence that flows from the initial strike,"" he said. The Arab governments involved in the strikes could also face discontent among their own people. ""Parts of the population do not agree with Sunni going against Sunni,"" Hertling said. The United States is also pushing for a binding resolution at the U.N. General Assembly this week that aims to prevent and track the travel of foreign fighters to Syria. How has ISIS reacted? There was no immediate confirmed comment from the militant group on the strikes. ISIS' official Bayan Radio tweeted a photo that it claimed showed damage to a communications tower in Raqqa. CNN wasn't immediately able to independently verify the image. The militant group has increased security patrols in Raqqa, an opposition activist told CNN. ISIS has previously linked the U.S. campaign of airstrikes in Iraq to its decision to execute three of its Western hostages -- two Americans and one Briton. It also recently called for attacks against the United States and its allies. How have Syrian opposition groups reacted? Hadi al Bahra, the President of the Syrian Opposition Coalition, welcomed the strikes. ""Tonight, the international community has joined our fight against ISIS in Syria,"" he said in a statement. ""We have called for airstrikes such as those that commenced tonight with a heavy heart and deep concern, as these strikes begin in our own homeland. We insist that utmost care is taken to avoid civilian casualties."" Did the U.S. consult with the Syrian government beforehand? The regime of President Bashar al-Assad said it was given a heads-up about the attacks through its ambassador to the United Nations in New York. A senior U.S. State Department official confirmed that the U.S. notified the Syrian regime of the planned action, but the official said that the Obama administration didn't seek the regime's permission or coordinate with it. Finding the 'right' Syrian rebels . Beinhart said al-Assad's government may end up as ""the real winner"" from the airstrikes on ISIS, since the moderate U.S.-backed rebels aren't ""in a position to take this territory that we are pulverizing from the air."" Did Obama have the authority to begin the attacks? The White House argues it doesn't need any new authority; that it's using an existing authorization to combat al Qaeda to expand its airstrike campaign. But some lawmakers say it's Congress' role, not the President's, to declare war. They say they were open to holding a vote on military action against ISIS -- but not until after the midterm elections in November. ""It was one thing to attack in Iraq, where you had a government that wanted us to,"" Beinhart said. ""But Congress did not vote for U.S. airstrikes in Syria and we don't have a government requesting us to do that."" What are U.S. lawmakers saying? When the strikes began, Congress had already left town to campaign for the midterm elections, and most of the reaction came from those who had pressed the administration to act sooner. Privately, many of them conceded  they were relieved not to have to take a vote on a controversial issue just weeks before voters went to the polls in November.","The strikes focus on Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIS' self-declared Islamic state .

"(CNN)Newly married, Zhang Xun was keen to try for a baby -- at least until friends told her that any child born in the upcoming Year of the Sheep would face a lifetime of bad luck. Perturbed, she convinced her husband to delay their plans to conceive.  They now hope to have a baby in 2016 - the Year of the Monkey, according to the Chinese lunar calendar. ""I'm just superstitious,"" she told CNN. One of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, the sheep gets a bad rap. Many people believe that sheep babies end up with characteristics associated with their birth signs -- docile and destined to be followers, not leaders. According to one common folk saying, only one in 10 people born in the Year of the Sheep find happiness. Zhang says she hadn't heard of the superstition until recently but chooses to believe it nonetheless. She discovered her cousin was a sheep and his parents got divorced, she says. ""I don't really care what zodiac sign my baby is, but it better not be sheep,"" she told CNN. Many couples have rushed to give birth in the current Year of the Horse, thought to be a more auspicious sign, or put off pregnancy, like Zhang, according to media reports. And some hospitals say they're seeing fewer expectant mothers as the new year approaches. According to the Chinese lunar calendar, the Year of the Sheep (sometimes called ram or goat) begins on February 19. ""The number of pregnancies registered recently has seen a marked decline,"" an obstetric nurse from the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital in Shanghai told CNN. Academics say despite the anecdotal evidence, there's no reason to believe the birth rate during sheep years varies on a national scale. Duan Chengrong, a professor of demography at Renmin University, analyzed population data from 1954 to 2002 and says that the avoidance of childbirth in sheep years is a ""myth"" that does not stand up to analysis. He calls it a ""social phenomenon"" that's more common in northern China than the south.  A native of Chongqing, he said he'd never heard of it when he was a child. However, the perception of bad luck for those born in the Year of the Sheep has become so rife that state media have carried a string of reports in recent months that attempt to debunk the myth. One listed famous people born in the Year of the Sheep . They included Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Twain, Jay Chou and Zhang Ziyi. It's not clear exactly how sheep became so maligned. Each of the 12 animals has it virtues and flaws, with the dragon, horse and tiger considered the luckiest. Isaac Yue, who teaches Chinese mythology at the University of Hong Kong, says the sheep was associated with compassion and filial piety -- important qualities praised by ancient scholars but these virtues have fallen out of favor.. ""The modern interpretation is that it's naive and innocent,"" he said. Even those well-versed in the cosmic arts of fortune telling say the weight placed on a baby's birth year is misguided. ""The month, date and exact time of birth are more important in the lunar calendar than the year,"" says Kerby Kuek, a Hong Kong-based practitioner of feng shui. He says he's often asked by couples to pick the best time to have a baby and some schedule C-sections to secure the luckiest slot. Zhang Xue, a college senior from Beijing, was born in the Year of the Sheep. She said she grew up hearing the myth, but she never believed it. Yet the coming lunar year still means a lot to Zhang. It will be her benmingnian -- her year in the twelve-year cycle that in Chinese tradition is often thought to bring challenges and change. It's when she will graduate from college and enter the real world, as she puts it. She is both anxious and excited about how things will unfold but Zhang is confident that whatever happens, it will have little to do with her zodiac sign. ""I think my fate is under my control,"" she says.","Some Chinese couples are putting off pregnancy to avoid ""sheep babies""

"It may seem ironic that one of the most sustainable city infrastructure projects underway in the United States is taking shape in a metropolitan region known best for its traffic congestion and expansive urban sprawl. Or perhaps it should be expected here, where, consciously or not, we are beginning to reconcile the physical structure of highways and arterial roads on which we have prospered for the last 60 years with a dramatically changing marketplace that has rendered that structure newly less desirable. In either case, it is remarkable that in a region many view as the poster-child for urban sprawl, we also find the Atlanta BeltLine, a uniquely innovative, sustainable and ambitious idea that has begun to address not only the physical challenges of sprawl, but also to change Atlanta's cultural expectations for itself and for its future. And for regions of the world as culturally different as China and The Netherlands, where one can find evidence of the same early steps toward urban sprawl that America took six decades ago, Atlanta's grasp for more sustainable strategies should serve as fair warning. Read more about the Atlanta BeltLine scheme . In college, I spent a year abroad in Paris and almost every day I would walk under an abandoned railroad viaduct on my way to the grocery store or laudromat.  When I returned a few years later, the viaduct had been transformed. At street level its large brick vaults were filled with arts-related studios and businesses, reinvented as the Viaduc des Arts.  And along the railroad up top there was the Promenade Plantee, a linear garden walk with a third-story vantage point that changes the way you see Paris and how people might think about obsolete urban infrastructure and public space. Later in graduate school, I envisioned a much larger transformation for my own hometown.  The Atlanta BeltLine began its current reincarnation as my thesis project on public transit, economic development and community revitalization. The proposal repurposes a loop of mostly abandoned railroad tracks encircling downtown into a sustainable new transportation corridor and a signature public meeting ground comprised of a linear park with an electric tramway and multi-use trails.  It reinvigorates 45 diverse neighborhoods along the way, organizes adjacent abandoned industrial land for transit-oriented development, expands transit service within the urban core, and connects various parts of an emerging regional trail system. But while this physical transformation of underutilized infrastructure is a relevant precedent for other cities -- the Promenade Plantee is itself a prototype for the much larger, BeltLine-scaled Petite Ceinture that encircles the historic heart of Paris -- that may not be its most compelling story.  In a world that faces daunting challenges for sustainable urban development and increasingly polarized politics, perhaps a more important lesson is the project's role as a catalyst for cultural change. Starting in 2001 and over the next three years, with infectious optimism and a lot of hard work, the citizens of Atlanta bought into a compelling grassroots vision for the Atlanta BeltLine and made it their own, creating a powerful informal alliance between neighborhood groups, developers and nonprofit organizations who found themselves in the unlikely position of advocating for the same set of ideas. Hear the story at TEDx Atlanta . This broad support then empowered the city's political and business leadership to endorse the project and sparked an expansion of the project's vision, including over 1,000 acres of new parks, the largest affordable-housing initiative in the city's history and perhaps the longest and most unique arboretum in the country. With every expansion of its vision, the physical project reinforces changing cultural preferences about the built environment, demonstrating local sustainable growth strategies that can be applied to other parts of the region, and over time, make comprehensive changes more politically palatable.  In this way, the Atlanta BeltLine not only profoundly changes the physical city, it changes the way we think about Atlanta -- what is possible, and what our cultural expectations are for the places that we live. This kind of change is critical to the region's economic success -- to any region struggling to reinvent itself so that it can thrive in the global marketplace.  Because while these new perspectives contrast sharply with previous generations who built our sprawling roadway network, they mirror national shifts in preferences about the built environment driven largely by a general disenchantment with car-dependent lifestyles and an increasing desire for cultural authenticity in the places that we live and work. Successful cities have always been places where people want to be, and once again technology and changing generational preferences are redefining that kind of place, this time leading us back toward social environments with mixed-use districts, strong cultural resources, greater mobility and a more robust public realm.  Communities that recognize and take advantage of these changes first will be best positioned to succeed in a more competitive future. So whether they look to district-scaled projects like the South Bronx Greenway in New York or Seoul's Cheonggyecheon, or to city scaled projects like the Petite Ceinture or Madrid's Calle-30, or to complex regional proposals like those for the Los Angeles River, cities can find innovative, non-partisan public works projects that not only begin the physical transformation required to attract future residents and jobs, but also catalyze a cultural shift in thinking about what kinds of policies and infrastructure we should be investing in.  This cultural shift will mean far more for global sustainability than any physical project ever could.","Atlanta BeltLine bringing abandoned rail road and adjacent land back to life with walkways and parks .

"U.S. Apache helicopters struck ISIS targets in Iraq's Anbar province over the weekend in an effort to push back ISIS forces advancing near Falluja, a senior U.S. defense official said. The Pentagon did not specify the precise targets when it issued a news release Sunday. Four ""strikes northeast of Falluja struck two mortar teams, a large ISIL unit and two small ISIL units,"" the release said, using another acronym for ISIS. Fixed-wing aircraft also were part of the mission. But because Iraqi forces were close to ISIS forces, the Apaches were used because they fly low and can strike with precision, the official said. In Anbar, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Baghdad, ""ISIS continues to make advances,"" the official said. In Falluja, ""Iraqi security forces are struggling to retake territory.""  The official described the area as ""very much contested with ISIS continuing to make gains."" The Apaches' low altitude poses a risk of a surface-to-air attack against the U.S. helicopters. But with ISIS forces in such a populated area, that precision was needed, the official said. So far, the U.S. doesn't see ISIS making a direct run for Baghdad, but there is concern that ISIS elements are in the city and around the airport, the official said. That has been the U.S. assessment for some time. Given ISIS advances, the official said, there will be more attacks against ISIS targets in Anbar, as well as in other contested areas such as along the Turkish border. There will probably be more strikes against mobile and fixed targets in the Kobani area, the official said. The United States is also still assessing whether it killed Muhsin al-Fadhli, 33, the leader of the Khorasan Group, in the first night of strikes in Syria, the official said. While he has not surfaced publicly or on social media, the U.S. has still not seen sufficient corroborating intelligence, such as evidence of a funeral or martyrdom statements, to conclude that he is dead, the official said.","Four ""strikes northeast of Falluja"" struck a mortar team and ISIS units, Pentagon says .

"(CNN)As the snow falls, so do records for extreme weather. In Boston on Monday -- with 62.5 inches of snowfall since January 15 -- the record for most snow in a 30-day period has already been broken. The previous record was set in 1978. With the third storm in as many weeks, how long will it be before the new record will be surpassed? ""I know that it's frustrating right now, particularly with the amount of snow, and it's frustrating to all of us,"" said Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. ""This is snow like we've never seen before in the past."" Boston is in the cross hairs again, and winter storm warnings are in place across large portions of the Northeast, including Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The National Weather Service forecasts 12 to 16 inches of snow by the time the storm ends Tuesday. For upstate New York, the numbers are 8 to 14 inches. After the storm, cold air will funnel in, followed by yet another snow event for Thursday and Friday. Authorities say the problem is not the storm itself, but that it comes right after two previous ones. Three straight Mondays, three straight snowstorms. To put it in perspective: Only nine days into February, the amount of snowfall makes this year the fifth-snowiest recorded February. Schools in parts of the Northeast, including Boston, will be closed Monday and Tuesday. Boston's mayor said students haven't had a full week of school in three weeks. He issued another snow emergency and parking ban Sunday in anticipation of all the new snow. Cars left on city streets were being ticketed and towed to make room for snowplows. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, known as the T, suspended all rail services starting at 7 p.m. ET Monday. No rail service is scheduled for Tuesday. Walsh urged Bostonians to stay indoors until the worst is over. ""These storms that we're getting are unprecedented,"" he said. ""We've never seen this type of snow in the city of Boston at any other time in the history of our city."" Track the storm . The storm was snarling air traffic again. FlightAware.com showed more than 700 flights within, into and out of the United States canceled for Sunday, on top of the more than 1,900 flights canceled as of Monday at 2:25 p.m. ET. Boston Logan International Airport remained open, but most flights are canceled, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday. The big issue for the state, he said, is not the current snowfall but the accumulation of snow over the past two weeks. ""It's only been 14 days, and we've gotten 70 to 80 inches of snow around the commonwealth,"" Baker said. ""This is pretty much unprecedented."" Later, he told reporters that he had signed an emergency declaration for the state, which should help with access to equipment. ""If I've learned one thing over the course of the past two weeks, it's (that) Mother Nature makes the rules,"" Baker said. One Boston resident used the hashtag #getmeoutofhere to describe his feelings of being in the city during the storm. The two other storms that hit the Northeast in the past two weeks closed airports, canceled classes and created mountains of snow along cleared roadways. ""It's kind of depressing sometimes,"" Jesus Cora of Nashua, New Hampshire, told CNN affiliate WMUR. ""It's really depressing, you know?"" Boston University freshman Cameron Barkan shared the same sentiment. ""I'm tired of it,"" said Barkan, who has missed three days of class because of the storms. ""I usually like snow, but this is just a little much."" Boston has also set a record for the snowiest seven-day period, with over 40 inches, the National Weather Service said last week. The city is way past its average annual snowfall of 47 inches. The string of storms is taking a toll on city coffers, too. ""We've gone through our $18 million budget for snow removal,"" Walsh said. The weather forced big Massachusetts trials to be delayed. The murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been pushed back to Wednesday, and jury selection in the trial of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was similarly delayed. CNN meteorologists Monica Garrett and Dave Hennen contributed to this report. CNN's Faith Karimi, Susanna Capelouto, Josh Levs, Kevin Conlon and Kristina Sgueglia also contributed to this report.","""Mother Nature makes the rules,"" says Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker .

"Cunning wolf? Working class hero? Or bland Beijing loyalist? C.Y. Leung, the Hong Kong leader whose resignation has become a rallying cry for the protesters that have filled the city's streets this week, was a relative unknown before he took the top job in 2012. As the son of a policeman who has used the same briefcase since his student days, his supporters said he would improve the lot of ordinary people in a city that has one of the world's widest wealth gaps. ""He wanted to present himself as someone from the grassroots, not linked to the tycoons... but people have been terribly disappointed,"" says Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong. It's Leung's failure to make progress on the universal suffrage that was promised to the city under the terms of its 1997 handover to China that has rankled Hong Kongers most, bringing tens of thousands of them onto the streets in recent days. Beijing lackey? One of his nicknames is ""689"" --  a sarcastic reference to the number of votes he obtained from the city's 1,200-strong election committee, a group of people selected from the largely pro-Beijing elite. And Leung, a former surveyor and real estate consultant, has done little to dispel the prevailing view that he is Beijing's lackey. A day after being elected as chief executive he paid a visit to the central government liaison office, Beijing's outpost in the city and he was the first leader to make his inauguration speech in Mandarin -- rather than the Cantonese that is spoken by most people in this former British colony. ""He is in daily communication with Beijing,"" says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""C.Y. is a very obedient cadre."" Despite this, Leung was not in fact Beijing's first choice to become chief executive. The early favorite was Henry Tang, a  bumbling former financial secretary best known for his penchant for red wine. But revelations that Tang's home had an enormous basement which hadn't been approved for planning permission, dubbed an underground palace, derailed his campaign. However, it was later discovered that Leung's home in the city's exclusive Peak neighborhood also had an illegal structure. Leung declared ignorance but it undermined trust in the city's new leader from the get-go and helped earn him another nickname -- ""wolf."" The moniker sounds similar in Cantonese to his family name but also suggests a cunning political operator. His approval ratings have plummeted since 2012 and a plush toy wolf made by IKEA sold out across the city earlier this year as Hong Kongers, eager to use it as a tongue-in-cheek symbol of protest, snapped it up. A gigantic, enlarged effigy of Leung's head, replete with lupine fangs, has also been a distinctive sight on the streets during the protests. Villain? For all his colorful nicknames, Harry Harrison, political cartoonist at the South China Morning Post, the city's main English-language newspaper, says Leung is a difficult character to portray. ""C.Y., despite his pantomime villain appearance, hasn't really turned out to be all that cartoonable,"" he told CNN.  ""I've hardly featured him in any cartoons for months now."" Those that do usually feature Leung sitting in his office with a picture of malevolent panda -- symbolizing China -- behind him. The reason, says Harrison, is that Leung is rarely out and about and has little public presence, coming across as aloof. His unease with ordinary members of the public has been on display this week. Leung has only appeared in public three times; twice for press conferences and once for a National Day flag-raising ceremony attended by dignitaries. Protest leaders have repeatedly called for him to go and refuse to negotiate with him, preferring a meeting with his number two -- Carrie Lam. While Leung says he will not resign, many observers feel his days are numbered, with protesters setting up a makeshift tomb at the protest site. ""Beijing would ... lose face if they were to sack Leung in the near future,"" says Lam at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. But ""it's a foregone conclusion that C.Y. Leung has to go because he is a very divisive and very unpopular figure.""","C.Y. Leung was relatively unknown before taking Hong Kong's top job in 2012 .

"Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN)They seemed strong and resilient, hiding their grief and fatigue with smiles, and even a laugh or two. ""They are tough parents,"" said our local producer, Jamal.

""She loved this, her dream, she loved traveling. To become flight attendant she could travel for free,"" Haidar says. Nisa's adventurous spirit, her mother says, took her hundreds of miles away from the family home in Sumatra. Still, Rohana says, Nisa called her every day -- including the night before she boarded the fateful flight. Nisa always told her mother when and where she was flying. But that night, for some reason, she didn't. ""We were on our way to a wedding ceremony,"" Haidar says. ""My relatives called me and they asked, 'Where did Nisa fly?' I said, 'Why are you asking that question?'"" In their hotel room in Surabaya, her mother and father's eyes light up as they look at dozens of pictures Nisa posted to her Instagram account. They are proud of their daughter and her ambitions, Haidar and Rohanna say, saying she just wanted to please her family. ""She's an obedient daughter. She is always tidy. She loves to learn.

We also catch a glimpse of Nisa's boyfriend, Divo, quiet and looking forlorn.  A recent picture Nisa posted was a note to him that read, ""I Love You, From 38,000 Feet."" But even in the face of such loss, the family's strength shines through. Nisa's father says her brother had wanted to follow in her footsteps and travel the world.

"Russia warned Tuesday that any use of force in Ukraine's eastern region could lead to civil war, as Kiev seeks to regain control after pro-Moscow uprisings in three cities. Pro-Russian protesters seized government buildings in the cities of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv on Sunday. Declaring a ""people's republic,"" protesters inside Donetsk's regional government building called Monday for a May 11 deadline to vote to secede from Ukraine. There were conflicting reports late Tuesday over whether demonstrators who seized control of a Security Service of Ukraine building in Luhansk took hostages. An anti-terrorism unit outside the building claimed the pro-Russian demonstrators were holding hostages, Victoria Syumar, a security service spokeswoman, and Yarema Duh, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council, told CNN. Fifty-one people were released from the building early Wednesday morning, the security service said in a statement. But pro-Russian demonstrators holed up in the building denied they have taken anyone hostage, according to Reuters reports. The security service also accused the demonstrators of placing explosive throughout the building, a claim the protesters denied, Reuters reported. Russia's Foreign Ministry said reports that the protesters are facing a crackdown by Ukrainian authorities are of particular concern. ""We are calling for the immediate cessation of any military preparations, which could lead to civil war,"" it said in a statement on its website. The ministry alleged that what it called ""American experts from the private military organization Greystone,"" disguised as soldiers, as well as militants from the Ukrainian far-right group Right Sector, had joined Ukrainian forces preparing for the crackdown in the country's east. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday that Russian forces and special agents have been behind what he called the ""chaos"" in eastern Ukraine in the past 24 hours. Kerry described the developments as ""more than deeply disturbing"" and said they amounted to what could be a ""contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in Crimea."" He followed up by warning of increased sanctions targeting Russia's banking, energy, mining and arms sectors if the Russians ""cross over"" into eastern Ukraine. Current sanctions target individuals over the Crimean annexation. Kerry will meet Monday with his Russian, Ukrainian and European Union counterparts to discuss efforts to de-escalate the crisis, according to a statement released by the spokesperson for EU Foreign Minister Catherine Ashton. Ashton ""calls against any further destabilization of Ukraine, whether from the inside or the outside,"" the statement said. Building cleared . Late Monday, special forces cleared armed protesters from the security service headquarters in Donetsk, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov's office announced. But Ukrainian interim Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Yarema was quoted by Russian state-run news agency ITAR-Tass as saying Tuesday that authorities are not going to storm the city's regional administration building. Yarema said the decision was made after talks with representatives of the protesters in the building. Donetsk protesters dig in at government building . According to the deputy head of the National Security and Defense Council, Victoria Syumar, negotiations are under way between the protesters and police, coordinated by influential oligarch Rinat Ahmetov. Donetsk is the hometown of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose pro-Russian government was toppled in a popular revolt in February. At a news conference in Kiev,  interim presidential chief of staff Serhiy Pashinksiy said he had ""convincing evidence"" suggesting the protests were being financed by Yanukovych and his supporters. In remarks posted by Russia's Interfax news agency and confirmed by his press secretary, Pashinksiy said authorities had frozen ""dozens of bank accounts and seized colossal resources. All of these massive rallies are financed."" This could not immediately be independently verified. 'Anti-terrorist operation' Police detained about 70 people in Kharkiv in an ""anti-terrorist"" operation that cleared the building in Kharkiv, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman said. Special forces police from outside of the city carried out the operation, in which all those arrested were armed with knives or batons, spokeswoman Natalia Stativko said. Those arrested have been taken to police detention centers in the cities of Poltava and Zaporijya and face charges relating to separatism, violence and taking part in mass protests, she said. Earlier, in a Facebook message, Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the city center had been closed to the public and urged people to remain calm. No guns were fired, he said. Turchynov blamed ""separatist groups coordinated by Russian special services"" for the revolts, which he said echoed events leading to the Russian annexation of Crimea three weeks ago. ""Enemies of Ukraine are trying to play out the Crimean scenario, but we will not let this happen,"" he said in a televised message. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the protests bore ""all the hallmarks of a Russian strategy to destabilize Ukraine"" and warned of ""grave economic and political consequences."" Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy warship USS Donald Cook is scheduled to enter the Black Sea no later than Thursday as part of the latest U.S. military effort to demonstrate support for Eastern European allies concerned about Russia's troop buildup, two U.S. military officials said. The ship will conduct exercises and port visits while in the Black Sea, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal announcement has not been made. The move comes ahead of an April 15 meeting among top NATO political representatives, who will discuss and potentially approve NATO recommendations for additional military measures, including shortening the response time of NATO forces in a crisis. Other options include more military exercises with member nations, including the United States, and potentially providing military advisers to Ukraine. Ukraine to Russia: I'm not your child . ‎Separatism outlawed . Turchynov reiterated Tuesday he would treat Russian separatists who have seized buildings in the east of the country as ""terrorists"" who will be prosecuted with the full force of the law. His remarks to parliament came ahead of a vote in which it approved legislation outlawing groups and individuals who call for separatism. Of the 450 members of the Ukrainian parliament, 230 voted in favor of the bill. All members of the Communist Party abstained from voting. Before the vote, a fight broke out in parliament when Petr Simonenko, the leader of the Communist Party, began to say lawmakers should listen to the demands of eastern Ukraine. He defended demonstrators who have seized local government buildings, saying they are not doing anything different from what the current interim government has done. He also accused ""nationalists"" of starting the crisis in eastern Ukraine. Simonenko was prevented from speaking further by a member of the far-right Svoboda party, and peace was restored in the parliament. Russia urges talks . Russia, which has tens of thousands of troops near the Ukrainian border, said Monday that it was ""watching closely"" what was unfolding and told Ukraine to stop blaming it for Ukrainian problems. President Vladimir Putin's government pushed Ukraine to set up a federal system in which regions with ethnic Russian majorities would have more autonomy, and its Foreign Ministry urged Ukraine to enter into talks over the issue. ""Ukrainian people want to get a clear answer from Kiev to all their questions. It's time to listen to these legal claims,"" a Foreign Ministry statement read. The Ukrainian government was acting ""irresponsibly,"" it said. At a news conference Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow has proposed involving Ukrainian presidential candidates in Russian, U.S. and EU talks on Ukraine. He insisted that representatives of southeast Ukraine take part, too, according to the Interfax news agency. He said Russia was ready for the talks, which may take place in 10 days. Moscow dispatched thousands of troops to Crimea in support of a pro-Russian movement that seized power in the semi-autonomous region shortly after Yanukovych fled to Russia. The Black Sea peninsula was then subsumed into Russia after a referendum denounced as illegal by Kiev and the West. Russia has called Yanukovych's removal a coup and says the interim government in Kiev is illegitimate. It has said it doesn't intend to invade eastern Ukraine but reserves the right to protect ethnic Russians there. Ukraine says it retakes building seized by protesters . Is Russia done after Crimea?

"(CNN)The fight against ""revenge porn"" chalked up a small victory recently. So why am I not celebrating? The Federal Trade Commission released a statement saying it had barred Craig Brittain, a Colorado man, from posting nude images of women to his website without their written consent. We are by now familiar with the concept of what's broadly known as ""revenge porn,"" that is, posting explicit images online of people -- women, mostly -- without their knowledge or permission. The practice has swept up celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson, Rihanna and Jennifer Lawrence, putting the issue on the national radar. Sometimes the images are stolen by hackers able to access phones, computers or clouds; in other cases, they may have, at one time, been willingly shared with a romantic partner who, after the relationship ends, seeks to enact ""revenge"" by making those private images public. The FTC's move is a positive step toward punishing these acts, mostly because it symbolizes that the federal government recognizes the seriousness of the violation. But it doesn't go far enough. Brittain was ordered to destroy the images he had in hand -- and that's it. He wasn't fined or sent to jail. That's because revenge porn isn't a federal crime -- Brittain was found in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act, not in violation of criminal law. As an agency of the U.S. government, the FTC can enforce federal laws but does not have the power to prosecute criminal cases on its own, instead referring cases to the FBI or a U.S. attorney's office. But because revenge porn isn't a federal crime, the punishments federal law enforcement can place on perpetrators are limited. And so the guy loses his pictures and has been told not to do it again. So what. Currently, 16 states have laws addressing revenge porn, though some are broader than others. Prosecution often still depends on first determining who uploaded the photos -- many of these sites allow for anonymous postings -- and where the photo originated. If the photo was uploaded by a third party, the website may be protected from liability by the Communications Decency Act, the same federal law that protects news outlets from being held liable for online comments made by readers and other user-generated material. A more effective law would be one that aims to protect personal information shared within the context of a confidential relationship and limits free speech to cover information that does not exploit the privacy of another private individual. (New Jersey's law, gets at this -- it makes it a felony for any person to disclose sexually explicit photos or images of someone else without that person's consent.) But until recently, a California revenge porn law did not protect victims who took the photos themselves, even if those photos were stolen or otherwise posted without their knowledge or consent. That wasn't just ineffectual lawmaking, but full on victim blaming. Indeed, when it comes to revenge porn, there is a lot of that going around. Think back to when Jennifer Lawrence and others had their nude, formerly private photos posted online. People asked why these women would be so careless as to take them, and send them, in the first place? What did they expect would happen? Never mind that many of the photos had been originally shared with trusted partners, some of whom were still in these women's lives, or that in at least one case, the stolen pictures in question had been deleted years ago. (There are some very skilled hackers out there.) If they don't exist, the logic goes, you've got nothing to worry about. Nothing, that is, beyond buying into the idea that women who ""put themselves in a compromising position,"" in a way deserve whatever consequences result. It's a short hop to the thinking that helps rapists avoid punishment because ""she asked for it,"" or ""she didn't say no,"" or ""just look at what she was wearing. Just look at how she's acted in the past."" There are many reasons to create stronger, clearer, federal criminal laws prohibiting the anonymous public posting of naked photographs of people who are not you. But perhaps the most important reason is to work toward eliminating, once and for all, the idea that victims of crimes bear any modicum of blame. Criminal invasion of privacy continues to occur because criminals exist, and they are not adequately punished. Curbing our own behavior only means they win.","Peggy Drexler: FTC's barring man from posting nude images online doesn't go far enough .

"(CNN)The suspected Islamist terrorists who had a shootout with police on Thursday in Verviers, Belgium, have ties to ISIS-linked cells in other European countries, a senior Belgian counterterrorism source told CNN on Friday. The two suspects who died in the shootout are believed to have fought with ISIS in Syria, the source said. Another man was captured but hasn't revealed any information. There also was a dire warning: Not all the terrorists in the cell have been rounded up, according to the source. Belgian police have taken out part of the terror network plotting an attack in Belgium, but they have not yet taken down every component of it, the source said. There is fear others may try to avenge the two men. Authorities investigating the aftermath of the raid in which the men were killed found materials used to make bombs, including chemicals for the powerful explosive TATP, but the suspected terrorists had yet to assemble those weapons. They also had grenades. Cell members had discussed attacking police in wiretapped phone conversations, but Belgian investigators still did not know what they were intending to target for sure, the source said.  The discovery of police uniforms after the raid suggested the possibility they may have been trying to gain access to sensitive sites. The source characterized the cell as one with organized structures, a logistical support network and links back to Syria and Iraq. Belgium is one of the nations participating in airstrikes in Iraq, and officials are concerned this plot is ISIS ""pivoting"" to launch attacks on the European countries involved in the military action against their troops in Iraq. ""I think one of the things that's happening is we're seeing something that's surprising me. That is the pivot of ISIS,"" Philip Mudd. a former CIA counterterrorism official and a CNN analyst, said. ""Just last summer, we were talking about how quickly ISIS was taking over geography. For a terrorist group to turn around in six or eight months and start training people for operations in Europe is remarkable."" In the raid in Verviers, a city of about 56,000 people, police approached three suspects as they carried large duffel bags outside of a former bakery that might have been their lair, a Western intelligence source told CNN. The suspects immediately opened fire with multiple weapons, prosecutors' spokesman Thierry Werts said. Police returned fire; two gunmen were killed and another was arrested, federal prosecutor Eric van der  Sypt said. That raid turned up four Kalashnikovs, handguns, bomb-making materials and police uniforms, van der Sypt said. Van der Sypt refused to name the two killed in Verviers, but said ""we have a pretty good idea"" who they were. Answering reporters' questions, the prosecutor would not comment on reported plans by the suspects to abduct or behead any victims. The Belgian counterterrorism source said Belgian authorities had asked the CIA for help in finding the director of the plot, a Belgian who was in Greece. Neither the CIA nor Greek officials were able to locate the man. He is described as a key link to ISIS in Syria for the terror cell and once fought there. The two men killed in the shootout were among more than a dozen people rounded up in across-the-country raids designed to stop a group's allegedly imminent attack -- a plot to kill Belgian police in streets and stations --   van der Sypt said earlier Friday. The alleged plotters -- including the two people killed Thursday night in a battle with police in Verviers -- were confronted in 12 raids across Belgium from Thursday into Friday, Sypt said. ""Could have been hours, certainly no more than a day or two"" before terror attacks were to begin throughout Belgium, van der Sypt told reporters of the alleged plot. Besides the two killed, 17 have been arrested in the investigation -- 13 in the Belgium raids and four others in France, including two who were detained while trying to cross from France into Italy, van der Sypt's office said. Investigators haven't found any links between the alleged Belgium plot and last week's Islamist terror attacks that killed 17 people in Paris, the prosecutor said. But the Belgium raids come amid fears of ongoing terror threats in Europe -- as many as 20 terror cells with 120 to 180 people may be ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, a Western intelligence source told CNN. Thursday night's raids were a dramatic culmination in a chain of Belgian police investigations into an alleged terror cell that included people who had fought in Syria, van der Sypt said. The U.S. intelligence community knew for weeks of the plot in Belgium and was sharing critical information with Belgian authorities, several U.S. officials told CNN. The officials wouldn't say precisely what they knew, how much they knew, and when they knew it. There is concern those details could signal other militants planning other potential attacks. One  U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr the entire ""developing plot was being monitored and watched."" The official said, ""We were aware. We were tracking this,"" and added, ""'There is a high probability other attacks were being planned"" before the plots were disrupted by the raids. A European security source told CNN that Belgian authorities arrested two men returning from Syria over the weekend and interrogated them, then decided to act quickly. The United States was aware of the timing of the Belgian moves, U.S. officials said. Verviers is a little off the beaten path in eastern Belgium, the last stop before open fields and forest. Like many European towns, it's densely built. People live close together. The whole city must have heard the explosions and the gunfight, according to resident Frederic Hausman. ""I can hear it. Everybody can hear it,"" he said. ""In this little city, everybody heard the sound."" From his window, he could see police firing assault rifles at a nearby house. Hausman recorded the assault on the house and posted it on YouTube. The two who were killed were of North African descent, the Western intelligence source said. Verviers is home to many people with Moroccan roots, according to a study by the nearby University of Liege. Immigrants make up more than 11% of the population, with the largest contingent from other European countries. Moroccans are the next-largest group. Verviers is about 69 miles (111 kilometers) east-southeast of Brussels and 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of Paris. The raids came as authorities monitored people returning from Syria, said Werts, the prosecutors' spokesman. Police had arrested, questioned and searched Neetin Karasular, a Belgian suspected arms dealer allegedly aligned with ISIS and suspected of providing weapons to Amedy Coulibaly, the man who attacked a Paris kosher supermarket. Karasular knew Coulibaly's wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, who is also a terror suspect in France. Karasular's lawyer Michel Bouchat said his client was facing local firearms charges and had no connection with any jihadi groups or terror plans. In the process, police turned up names that solidified their suspicions about known persons, the Western intelligence source said. Last weekend, they arrested two more men at the Charleroi airport -- as they returned from Syria -- squeezed them for information then decided to act quickly, the source said. ""The investigation made it possible to determine that the group was about to carry out major terrorist attacks in Belgium imminently,"" Belgian prosecutor spokesman Werts said. Authorities believed the suspects in Thursday's gun battle had been providing documents and weapons to men returning from Syria, the intelligence source said. A senior Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN that the alleged terror cell is believed to have received instructions from ISIS. Belgium is putting 150 troops on standby for deployment in light of the increase in the country's terror threat level, Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon said Friday. It has not been determined where they will be deployed, he said. The threat level will stay at three (with four being the highest) for one month, Prime Minister Charles Michel told CNN affiliate RTL. ""It is a way to mobilize all forces to raise security,"" added. In France, police also made at least 12 arrests Friday in the probe of last week's slayings of 17 people. Additionally, two people suspected of involvement with the alleged Verviers suspects were detained while trying to cross from France into Italy through the Frejus tunnel, a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said Friday. Belgium is asking France to extradite those two, said the spokesman, who would not disclose the suspects' names or nationalities. In neighboring Germany, police in at least two cities arrested men they accuse of supporting jihadis in Syria. These suspects did not appear to be planning homegrown attacks, German authorities said. The fear of terror was already high in Western Europe after the bloodbaths in France that followed multiple threats of attacks from ISIS -- the Islamist group fighting to establish what it calls its Islamic caliphate in Iraq and Syria -- and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP has claimed responsibility for the Paris slayings. Men claiming to be ISIS terrorists and speaking French promised new attacks in France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland, in an online video found on Thursday. ISIS has said it would lash out at European countries participating in bombardments in the Middle East. More than 3,000 Europeans have left to fight in Syria in recent years. Authorities have long warned that those fighters could return and carry out attacks at home. British intelligence has also warned another Islamist group in Syria was planning ""mass casualty attacks against the West,"" an apparent reference to the Khorasan group. The Belgian raids came against the background of a terror trial of dozens of men suspected of recruiting jihadists or trying to go to Syria to fight. An Antwerp court was to return verdict this week but postponed it due to the Paris attacks. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Richard Greene, Margot Haddad, Catherine E. Shoichet, Dheepthika Laurent and Jim Sciutto contributed to this report.","Officials believe this is a new strategy from ISIS to organize attacks on nations in airstrike coalition .

"The morning tide keeps time on the barrier islands of Cape Hatteras National Seashore. It slowly washes away tiny tracks left by newly hatched sea turtles that wobble into the surf under the cover of darkness. Meanwhile, dolphins play in the waters close to shore as brown pelicans hover in competition to snack on schools of fish. The Outer Banks were home to Native Americans long before 1584 when Sir Walter Raleigh attempted to make Roanoke Island the first permanent European settlement in the new world. A little more than a century later, the pirate Blackbeard unscrupulously assaulted Ocracoke Inlet, marauding and terrorizing merchants. The Ocracoke, Hatteras and Bodie Island lighthouses were built and rebuilt throughout the 19th century to help ships avoid the ""Graveyard of the Atlantic,"" and the Wright Brothers made history's first recorded flight in Kill Devil Hills at the beginning of the 20th century. Cape Hatteras National Seashore is history, a vacation destination, a home to endangered wildlife and a geological wonder combined into one national park site on North Carolina's coast. Park stats: More than 2.3 million people visited Cape Hatteras National Seashore in 2012, and it has averaged more than 2 million guests per year since 2008. It is the fourth-most visited national seashore, according to the National Park Service. The location: Cape Hatteras National Seashore lies on North Carolina's Outer Banks, about a four-hour drive from Raleigh and 2½ hours from Norfolk, Virginia. The park has north and south entrances. The north entrance is in Nags Head at the junction of U.S. 64 and state Highway 12. The south entrance, state Highway 12 north of Ocracoke, is accessible only by ferry. If you go: There is no admission to enter Cape Hatteras National Seashore, and there are visitor centers on Cape Hatteras and on Bodie and Ocracoke islands. Cape Hatteras and Bodie Island lighthouses are open from the third Friday in April through Columbus Day. Admission to each lighthouse is $8 for adults and $4 for children under 12. Ticket purchases do not transfer from one lighthouse to the other. Weather permitting, visitors can climb the steps of Cape Hatteras Lighthouse on their own, and rangers conduct guided tours of the Bodie Island Lighthouse. Ocracoke Island, home to the second-oldest operating lighthouse in the United States, is about 60 miles south on state Highway 12 and accessing it requires taking a ferry across Pamlico Sound. The ferry to Ocracoke from Avon, North Carolina, is free, but ferries from Swan Quarter or Cedar Island are paid and require reservations. The Wright Brothers National Memorial is in Kill Devil Hills, about seven miles north of Nags Head. Fort Raleigh National Historic Site is on Roanoke Island about three miles north of Manteo. Meet our ranger: Patrick Gamman is the district interpretative ranger for Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The seeds for Gamman's career in the park service were planted when his aunt gave him a subscription to Ranger Rick magazine as a gift for his 7th birthday. Gamman, now 44, grew up in Oregon and says Ranger Rick's adventures taught him environmental ethics. While attending the University of Oregon, Gamman sought out nature during spring break instead of following classmates to traditional destinations. ""I wouldn't go party,"" he says. ""I chose national parks instead."" Gamman changed his major to geology after spending a summer volunteering at Wind Cave National Park. After graduation, he joined the Peace Corps and helped develop cave national parks in the Philippines. He then worked seasonal ranger jobs until landing his first permanent job in the park system at Grand Canyon's backcountry office. He came to Cape Hatteras National Seashore in 2010. ""It's a barrier island, one of the three most dynamic geological formations (along with volcanoes and glaciers) in the world,"" he says. ""We're having a ball here because there are so many fun things to do."" For a day trip, don't miss: Seashell hunting on the beach, touring one of the lighthouses and watching the sun set over Pamlico Sound. ""It's rare to see sunset on a body of water on the East Coast,"" he says. Favorite less-traveled spot: Nighttime on the beach. Gamman says Cape Hatteras has the darkest night sky on the Eastern Seaboard. In addition to stargazing and watching ghost crabs scramble across the sand, he says, hot summer nights cause the water to glow with bioluminescence. ""I can't get enough of it here,"" he says. ""The night sky blows me away."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: The boardwalk near Bodie Island Lighthouse. Gamman says the boardwalk leads guests through bird ponds to a gazebo, where they can also watch crabs chase fish. ""There is always great wildlife sightings no matter what time of day,"" he says. Most magical moment in the park: His first trip kayaking on the Pamlico Sound. Gamman says Pamlico Sound is not deep and is a relatively safe body of water. Almost every village on Cape Hatteras National Seashore rents kayaks, and he recommends paddling along the shore to ""bliss out."" ""It all has to do with peace and tranquillity,"" he says. ""Whenever I take my kayak out, I'm seeing turtles and brown pelicans."" Moment that made him smile: Raising a camera to photograph a young couple at Bodie Island Lighthouse and seeing the guy get down on one knee. ""I'm like, 'Oh my God, I think I know what is going to happen,' "" he says. ""I just went crazy taking pictures. There are a lot of (wedding) proposals at the top of lighthouses."" Gamman says the woman accepted, and he was happy to share news of the marriage engagement with the other guests on the tour. Oddest moment at the park: A music teacher giving students a demonstrative lesson on sound resonance by playing a didgeridoo, a wind instrument used by Australian aborigines, at the base of Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. ""It was way out there, but I really liked it,"" he says. ""The crowd waiting applauded when he finished."" A ranger's request: Educate yourself about rip currents before entering the water and do not go swimming at sunset or sunrise. Gamman says rip currents are common at Hatteras because of small sand dunes that build up in shallow water. When the water gets pulled back out to sea, it punches holes in the dunes, creating the pull for rip currents. Gamman says the way to escape a rip tide is to remain calm and float on your back. The current will take you out about 100 yards, he says. From there you should swim parallel to the shore until you clear the pull. Then swim back. ""People try to swim out of it and you can't,"" he says. ""Michael Phelps couldn't do it."" Another park he'd like to visit: Dinosaur National Monument in Utah. The area features a combination of science, history, geography, petroglyphs and fossils. ""They've got dinosaur bones,"" he says. ""How cool is that?"" What national park would you like to visit?

"(CNN)Harley Earl taught Detroit how to get its Hollywood swing on. He's credited for single-handedly igniting an automobile renaissance. His legacy has been compared to Leonardo da Vinci and even Steve Jobs. I mean, this guy created the Corvette, for God's sake. So, with a resume like that, why isn't Harley Earl a household name? It's not like Earl was a slacker. He came to Detroit from Hollywood, where he was designing cars for movie stars. As General Motors' top designer, Earl created iconic cars with unique, sweeping lines and features like tail fins and wraparound windshields. ""It's uncanny how he embodied the words 'pioneer' and 'trailblazer,'"" Earl's grandson Richard Earl said on the phone last week from his home in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""Harley Earl was the first car designer to allow regular folks to get their hands on a work of art. He allowed you to step into the equivalent of a Rembrandt, drive it away and then show it off."" During his heyday spanning the 1930s to the late '50s, Earl created innovations that were decades ahead of their time: . -Rear backup cameras connected to dashboard video . -An automated driving system . -Collision warning alarms . -Cruise control . -Keyless entry . -Onboard computers . -Rain-sensing technology . Earl was the first, say experts, to meld car style with functionality — kind of like what Apple's Steve Jobs did with personal computers. Related story: World's 'crazy beautiful cars' Jobs and Earl executed their unique vision in similar ways. The Apple chief had a reputation for being demanding. So did Earl. Standing at 6 feet, 4 inches tall, ""Earl was very authoritative, he absolutely got his way,"" said award-winning automobile journalist Ken Gross. ""He got his own way because he had the taste, the intelligence and the vision to force it."" Like Jobs, Earl ""offered products we didn't know about until they were unveiled,"" wrote ZDNet's Oliver Marks. ""Some of these innovations turned into products Americans wanted so badly they then couldn't live without, a format Apple has used with devastating effectiveness. ..."" Yep, Jobs called those heart-pounding product unveilings ""keynotes."" In the 1950s, Earl called them Motoramas. Motoramas were GM's annual traveling car shows where new designs were unveiled. Eventually, ""people aspired to have the latest, the most exciting, the most stylistic"" cars every year, said Gross. That spurred sales, created jobs and helped turn automobiles into the lifeblood of America's economy. Death in the family . All this innovation and success came in the wake of a family tragedy. In 1927, Harley and Sue Earl's 2-year-old son Billy died suddenly after a botched medical procedure. ""To deal with it, he thew himself into his work,"" Richard Earl said. ""It left him a little terrified of being a father."" Harley Earl developed a reputation as an imposing workaholic who ruled his design studio ""with an iron hand, demanding minute changes, ordering countless modifications,"" according to Gross. His drive to execute his vision turned Harley Earl into a car industry disruptor, 70 years before disruptors became cool. GM's competitors didn't want to redesign their cars every year. But Harley Earl's success forced them to. His unconventional ideas -- and even his flamboyant pastel suits -- shoved the car-making establishment back on its heels. Here was ""this stylish, dominating, supercreative guy amidst the gray suits and the finance folks,"" said Gross. ""I'm sure during lunches at the Detroit Athletic Club there were people who were annoyed by Earl -- saying kind of, 'Who is this guy?'"" Earl also wanted to put a finger in the eye of European car-makers who dominated the sports car market at the time. That's kind of how the Corvette was born. By the early 1950s, Harley Earl was tired of seeing European roadsters on America's highways. As Richard Earl put it: ""Harley was like, 'No more!'"" It was high time for the Europeans to meet a worthy American competitor. ""Harley and a board-man and a body engineer sat around and came up with the idea for the Corvette in a darkened room in Detroit's historic Argonaut Building,"" Richard Earl said. ""It was Harley's vision pure and simple — a lot of people forget that Harley was not only an artist, he was an engineer."" Today, 62 years after its debut, GM describes the Corvette as, the ""world's longest-running, continuously produced passenger car."" Experts call it the most collected car in America. Related: Rocket-powered 'Vette . 'Vettes have held a treasured place in Richard Earl's heart since age eight. That's when a simple gesture from his grandfather forged a memory he will never forget. To celebrate young Richard's birthday, Harley Earl made plans to take him on a spin in one of his custom Corvettes, a 1963 Sting Ray convertible painted a stunning bright blue and outfitted with spectacular chrome side-pipes. The car's top was off when Harley Earl pulled into the driveway wearing his aviator shades. Richard hopped in. ""You ready to roll?"" grandfather asked. ""I felt like I'd been touched by the automobile gods,"" Earl recalled with a chuckle. ""He was kind of like a movie star, with a kind of presence about him."" Off they went on a sports car adventure, cruising through the ritzy avenues of Palm Beach turning heads at every corner. ""Nobody had a car like this,"" Earl recalled. ""People noticed."" ""I remember him stepping on the accelerator,"" Earl said. ""I remember the roar of the engine. I remember the smile that spread across my face when he'd go fast ... and slow down ... and go through an S turn. It's a feeling I only had once in my lifetime. And it was a great feeling."" Related: Corvette Z06 among world's fastest cars . An army of Harley Earls . Decades later, Richard Earl is on a crusade to invigorate his grandfather's legacy and to spark a car design revolution. So many car designs today all look the same, Earl complains. He wonders if 21st century automakers have forgotten that innovative designs can boost car sales. ""I want to inspire an army of new Harley Earls across the planet,"" he said. Gross admits that ""some people think of their cars more like appliances,"" instead of appreciating them as functional art. But Harley Earl never had to include all of today's safety and environmental factors in his designs. Nonetheless, Gross said there are plenty of stylish designs coming off modern assembly lines. He named Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz and even BMW, despite its much-dissed ""Bangle-Butt."" So why ISN'T Harley Earl a household name? Should he be? ""For a lot of people who aren't enthusiasts, it's not particularly important who designed the car,"" Gross said. ""I don't know that anyone is going to erect a statue to Harley Earl, but I think it's important that he's remembered. There really isn't anybody today in the design industry that has the impact and the clout, the presence and the profile that Harley Earl had in his day. ... But Harley had a unique set of circumstances. He was The Man."" Future product designers could take a few lessons from Earl, said Gross, including having ""the courage of their convictions"" and being ""confident in their creativity."" Full circle . In 2007, Harley Earl paid a visit to his grandson. Well, sort of. Richard Earl reunited with his late grandfather's 1963 blue Sting Ray at a car show, where he got a chance to relive that birthday cruise. As Richard steered the roadster through its paces, his mind returned to that day, exactly 40 years earlier. ""The story had come full circle,"" Richard said. He remembered his grandfather's rare demonstrations of affection as they exited the car —  tousling Richard's hair, then, a warm embrace. ""I think he really was trying to be a good grandfather,"" Earl said. ""Maybe that wasn't the easiest thing for him most of his life, because he had worked so hard. But we had a moment — it was one of those moments you treasure.""","Experts say we can take a lesson from legendary car designer Harley Earl .

"(CNN)At long last, ""Breaking Bad"" fans got to see the first episode of ""Better Call Saul"" on Sunday night. The spinoff's much-hyped premiere started off slowly, with a downright depressing look at a defeated Saul (Bob Odenkirk), working at a Cinnabon, reminiscing about the good old days of his law firm. Then we flashed back to 2002 to see Jimmy McGill -- as Saul used to be known -- struggling to keep clients and pay the bills between issues with his brother, Chuck, and some skateboarding twins who reminded him of his con-artist days. When Jimmy teamed up with the twins to basically bribe a potential client into signing with him, things went horribly awry, with a hit-and-run and Jimmy ultimately taken at gunpoint, a cliffhanger to be resolved on Monday night's episode. There were a few shout-outs to ""Breaking Bad,"" in particular the character of Mike Ehrmantraut, but this show is more of a balance of comedy and drama than the critically acclaimed ""Bad."" Much of it rests on the performance of Odenkirk as Jimmy, and he delivered an Emmy-worthy performance here. We can't wait to see what's to come. Critics loved it -- the show stands at 100% on RottenTomatoes.com -- and fans on Twitter responded rapturously.","Much-anticipated ""Breaking Bad"" spinoff ""Better Call Saul"" premiered Sunday .

"Dallas (CNN)A generation of troops have served grueling tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq since the 9/11 attacks, but few have gripped the country's conscience in the way Chris Kyle has. In the autobiography that inspired the blockbuster film ""American Sniper,"" Kyle wrote that his work on Iraqi battlefields earned him the nickname ""Legend."" That's what those fighting with Kyle called him. His enemies used another nickname. They dubbed him ""al-Shaitan Ramad,"" or the Devil of Ramadi, indicating the fear a man can instill in his foes when he's capable of taking out a target from a distance of almost 1.2 miles. Of course, he wasn't the only sniper engaged in those epic battles of the Iraq War, but the legend of Kyle resonates with a wide American audience. Not only did his autobiography spend weeks on best-seller lists, but the Clint Eastwood-directed film, which has earned six Oscar nominations, including best picture, has shattered the box-office record for a war movie, previously held by ""Saving Private Ryan."" Despite all the talk of war's complications, Kyle's view of the Iraq War was unapologetically simplistic. ""I wanted to go to war. I signed up to protect this country. I do not choose the wars. It happens that I love to fight,"" he wrote in his autobiography. After completing four tours of duty in Iraq with at least 160 confirmed sniper kills, Kyle said he never had regrets about plying his deadly trade. Even if he had to take out a woman cradling a toddler -- as he reportedly did on his first sniper assignment -- he had no qualms pulling the trigger if it saved the lives of the Marines whom he was charged with protecting. ""It was my duty to shoot and I don't regret it,"" Kyle wrote in his book. ""After the first kill, the others come easy. I don't have to psych myself up, or do anything special mentally."" Fame weighs on trial of accused killer . As a Navy SEAL, Kyle fought in some of the Iraq War's most vicious battles, including Falluja, Ramadi and Sadr City, and while 160 was his tally of confirmed kills, he had 95 probable kills that couldn't be verified. His reputation for taking out insurgents resulted in an $80,000 bounty being placed on his head during the war. Kyle's autobiography, which he wrote with the help of authors Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice, was published eight months after SEAL Team Six executed the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. That historic operation spurred fascination with the inner workings and personalities that make up one of the U.S. military's most secret and elite forces, yet many military veterans are leery of all the attention Kyle has received. Kyle, they say, was one of tens of thousands of troops who served heroically in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""You remove Chris Kyle from the story, there's 20,000 other heroes that you can put in there,"" said CNN global affairs analyst James Reese, who runs Tiger Swan, a security consulting firm founded by ex-members of the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force. Reese, who himself was a sniper, and served separately as a Delta Force commander during battles in Falluja, said special forces operators carry a mystique that appeals to Americans who've never served in the military. ""They are very dynamic,"" Reese said. ""People are drawn to them. They are American heroes. But they're all American heroes."" But there is a side to Kyle that's overlooked. It's left out of the book and movie, but a series of now-debunked stories have served only to make Kyle's legend larger. In his autobiography, Kyle wrote about a confrontation with a celebrity whom he called ""Scruff Face,"" later identified as former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Kyle claimed in his book that Ventura told him that the SEALs ""deserve to lose a few"" in the wars and then, ""I laid him out."" Ventura said the incident never happened and sued Kyle for defamation. Last year, a jury ordered Kyle's estate to pay Ventura nearly $2 million. The verdict is being appealed. It is just one story in a collection of outlandish tales that Kyle reportedly repeated often. Kyle bragged about traveling into New Orleans in the days after Hurricane Katrina with a fellow sniper and shooting at least 30 looters from the roof of the Superdome. There's no evidence anything of the sort ever occurred. And then there's the story Kyle told of how he killed two men who tried to carjack him while he was stopped at a gas station along a rural highway southwest of Dallas. When police arrived to investigate and ran his driver's license, Kyle said, they received a phone number for someone at the Department of Defense. The story ends with the police officers letting Kyle drive away. Kyle told the gas station story to Michael Mooney, a writer for D Magazine who was working on a profile. Mooney spent months trying to verify the story, he said. He interviewed people at every gas station along the stretch of highway where the shooting allegedly happened. He spoke with state and local law enforcement officials in three counties. Nobody had ever heard of the incident. ""He was a hero. He was the most celebrated war hero of our time,"" Mooney said. ""It's really hard to know what to think. We don't know. The fact is he was killed, and there's no way to get an answer from him now."" CNN asked Kyle's widow, Taya, to shed light on why her husband told these stories, but she declined the interview request. A representative said she was not available to speak about the incidents. At Kyle's funeral, which, befitting the grandeur of his legend, was held in the Dallas Cowboys' massive football stadium, Taya Kyle did not shy away from her husband's darker side. ""I don't need to romanticize Chris because our reality is messy, passionate, full of every extreme emotion known to man, including fear, compassion, anger and pain,"" she said. Despite his well-reported shortcomings, it's difficult to overlook his life after the Navy and how he touched and inspired so many people. While he was working to launch a security company -- Craft International, whose motto is, ""Despite what your momma told you, violence does solve problems"" -- Kyle dedicated much time to helping fellow veterans with mental health issues transition back to normal life after the battlefield. The struggle consumed him in many ways. ""War one day; peace the next,"" Kyle wrote in his book. It's also the work that led to his February 2, 2013, death. Kyle had taken his friend, Chad Littlefield, and fellow veteran Eddie Ray Routh to the firing range that day. A hunting guide would later find Kyle and Littlefield dead. Routh was charged in their deaths. A jury was seated Monday and opening statements in the capital murder trial are slated to begin Wednesday. For many of the military's elite, the decision to leave the battlefield is an excruciating one. The sense of duty to protect fellow troops is a feeling that Kyle struggled to let go. There's also a sense of glory and power that snipers find hard to walk away from. ""We're trained to go out and kill people,"" Chris Kyle wrote in his autobiography. ""And then at the same time, we're also being taught to think of ourselves as invincible bad asses. That's a pretty potent combination."" Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Jason Morris contributed to this report.","Jury seated in capital murder trial of Eddie Routh, charged in Kyle's killing .

"(CNN)He was a Taliban commander captured by the United States and held at Guantanamo Bay. But he was let go and returned to Afghanistan. Mullah Abdul Rauf went on to become a recruiter for ISIS in Afghanistan. He was killed in a drone strike Monday, two officials told CNN. Rauf and five others were killed, four of them Pakistani militants, said Mohammed Jan Rasoulya, the deputy governor of southern Helmand province. A senior Afghan security source confirmed Rauf's death. The Washington Post, in a headline last month, called him ""the shadowy figure recruiting for the Islamic State in Afghanistan."" The New York Times called him the ""militant commander at the center of the concerns in Helmand Province"" but said some local Taliban figures ""dismiss claims"" that he had established ""a significant new Islamic State cell in Helmand Province."" He was known to many with the name ""Khadim"" tacked on to the end of his name. ""Until 9/11, the hard-nosed Khadim commanded (Taliban creator) Mullah Omar's elite mobile reserve force, fighting regime opponents all over Afghanistan,"" Newsweek wrote of Rauf in a 2011 list of list of most-wanted insurgents. ""Arrested and sent to Guantanamo soon after the Taliban's collapse, he was released in late 2007, having convinced his jailers that he wanted only to go home and tend his farm. Escaping from house arrest in Kabul, he fled to Pakistan."" Although the United States does not publicize the names of detainees at Guantanamo, a document posted by WikiLeaks showed that the United States recommended Rauf be ""transferred to the control of another country for continued detention"" as early as 2004. In a 2011 hearing of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations -- part of the Armed Services Committee -- a lawmaker asked about Rauf and another former detainee. Ed Mornston, director of the Joint Intelligence Task Force of the Defense Intelligence Agency, responded that ""there have been instances where detainees who have been transferred from Gitmo have reengaged and have been in the fight and have impacted the lives of U.S. service members. We do track that. I can't discuss that much further in this open session, but we do in fact know that that has happened.""","Mullah Abdul Rauf was a Taliban commander released from Guantanamo Bay by the U.S. in 2007 .

"Washington (CNN)Israeli officials are looking at changing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, including potentially relocating the speech, according to an Israeli source. The debate follows mounting criticism of Netanyahu's move to use the high profile address to criticize President Barack Obama's policy on Iran. While a range of ideas are being discussed there is no final decision yet, the Israeli source stressed. An official in Prime Minister Netanyahu's office insists ""at this moment"" the speech is still on, suggesting the Israelis were leaving themselves some wiggle room. ""In recent days the Prime Minister has received a number of inquiries about his visit to the US. At this moment there is no change to the plans,"" this official told CNN. House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu last month to speak in the House chamber, but did not consult with the White House before officially reaching out to the Israeli leader. The speech is slated for March 3 but many congressional Democrats have urged the Israeli leader to reconsider delivering the speech, and have also asked the Speaker to shift the date. They argue the timing -- two weeks before the election in Israel -- is inappropriate. But Democrats' larger issue with the speech is it gives Netanyahu a broad public platform for his strong criticism of the Obama Administration's negotiations with Iran.  They worry that the Israeli leader's message could jeopardize the international talks over Iran's nuclear program, which are approaching a critical deadline. A move to shift the speech to a venue outside the Capitol, or deliver the speech in a closed chamber could be a face saving compromise for Netanyahu. He could still deliver his sharp message on Iran, but also repair the damage he's done to his relationship with Democrats on the Hill, who are angry their allegiance to a key ally is being questioned. Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. made the rounds last week on Capitol Hill, meeting with frustrated House Democrats, including some Jewish members, who lashed out at his handling of the matter.  Dermer met with Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee.  He also met with others including Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Illinois, Rep. Sander Levin, D-Michigan, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New York.  While affirming their support for Israel, these members urged Netanyahu to reconsider coming to the House floor, and suggested moving the speech to another venue --anywhere in Washington outside the chamber, according to one source familiar with these discussions. An Israeli source says they are looking at the possibility of Netanyahu speaking somewhere else, or in a closed session on the House floor.  In exchange for the shift, Netanyahu would potentially add a meeting with top congressional leaders to his schedule. They also hope to have a meeting with White House officials in which the President could drop by, though there's little evidence the administration is interested in making such a deal. One senior House Republican leadership aide tells CNN the Speaker's office is moving forward with plans for Netanyahu's visit. Obama acknowledged his ""very real difference"" with Netanyahu over Iran at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday.  He also reiterated his position that he didn't support a public address so close to the Israeli election. ""We have a practice of not meeting with leaders right before their elections, two weeks before their elections.  As much as I love Angela, if she was two weeks away from an election, she probably would not have received an invitation to the White House, and I suspect she wouldn't have asked for one,"" Obama said. On Friday, Vice President Joe Biden's office announced he would not attend the speech because he will be traveling abroad.  When foreign leaders are invited to address the House and Senate, the Vice President typically attends speeches and sits on the dais behind the leader - a public image beamed around the world.  Biden's office did not release any details of his trip but said it had been in the works for a while. ""As we have consistently said, this is an event that was coordinated between the Israelis and Speaker Boehner.  We are not playing a role in this event,"" a senior Obama Administration official told CNN. Last week, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said she hoped that Netanyahu's speech would be cancelled.  While Pelosi conceded that she had no reason from her discussions with Israeli officials to think that the speech that Netanyahu would withdraw from the invitation, she strongly suggested circumstances could change. ""You never know, things happen in people's schedules,"" Pelosi said. Asked if she planned to attend the joint meeting, Pelosi said, ""as of now it is my intention to go."" But other House Democrats, including several members of the Congressional Black Caucus, say they will boycott the speech if it goes ahead as scheduled. Netanyahu's Likud party is in a close election race with the center-left opposition led by Labor Party chairman Isaac Herzog and former justice minister Tzipi Livni, who leads a small centrist party. Both Herzog and Livni, who have teamed up to form an alliance in the election, have criticized Netanyahu's decision to address Congress and have urged him to cancel it. Netanyahu has campaigned on a tough-against-Iran platform and has been accused of using the speech as a way to play up those credentials with voters. On Sunday, he addressed French-speaking members of his Likud party, doubling down on the decision to address Congress on March 3, saying ""I will go any place I'm invited to convey the Israeli position against those who want to kill us"". But there are signs the controversy is impacting Netanyahu's standing in the polls, with the Israeli media and public voicing concern that Netanyahu is contributing to further strains between Israel and the United States, its closest ally. An Israel Army Radio poll on Monday said only 34% of Israelis think Netanyahu should go ahead with the address, while 47% think he should cancel. Another poll published by the Times of Israel on Monday showed Netanyahu's party four seats in the Knesset behind Herzog and Livni's  Zionist Camp alliance. CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report .","Netanyahu scheduled to address Congress March 3 .

"(CNN)Tori Sisson and Shanté Wolfe of Tuskegee, Alabama, camped outside the Montgomery County Courthouse overnight, hoping that when the sun rose Monday, they'd be the first same-sex couple to be legally married in the county. They arrived at 2 p.m. Sunday and set up their tent. Expecting a crowd -- of mostly media and friends, or their ""chosen family,"" as many of their kin don't approve of their relationship -- they awoke at 5 a.m. Monday to get dressed ""so that when we got out of the tent we'd look like a million bucks,"" Sisson said. Sisson, 24, and Wolfe, 21, have known each other for seven years. They've been dating for two. Last year, the pair got ""spiritually married"" in Tuskegee, but it wasn't a state-recognized union -- where all the rights and benefits of matrimony are conferred on both partners. They previously considered going to a state that allowed same-sex marriage, but Wolfe balked at the idea. ""We work here and we pay taxes here, and we didn't feel it was right that we'd have to do that because nobody else does,"" she said. Though there were some minor computer problems in issuing their license, their wish soon came true. With one of their godmothers performing the ceremony, they exchanged vows outside the courthouse and kissed as a phalanx of media cameras captured the moment. (One of those cameras belonged to the Human Rights Campaign, a watchdog group involved in marriage equality advocacy; Sisson works for the organization.) Sisson wept, while Wolfe did not. ""One of us has to hold it together,"" Wolfe quipped. Sisson's tears weren't borne solely of the bliss that comes with being joined in union with your beloved. Sure, those sentiments were there, Sisson said, but she cried also because she had been thinking all night about the myriad couples who were denied the opportunity she and Wolfe were able to seize Monday. ""We have the honor to be the first couple in Montgomery County to do this. It's amazing,"" Sisson said, explaining the ""overwhelming and overflowing love I have for Shanté but also for people and the hope I have in my heart that this really means progress here."" Though the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama cleared the way for same-sex marriages to begin Monday in Alabama, the famously conservative chief justice of the state Supreme Court on Sunday mounted a last-ditch effort to stop the weddings, instructing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. That didn't stop several couples from converging on county courthouses across the state. Probate Judge Alan King in Jefferson County, the state's most populous, said there appeared to be a larger-than-usual crowd outside the courthouse when he arrived at work Monday. State Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was ousted from his first chief justice post in 2003 after refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery, wrote that his Sunday order on same-sex marriages is necessary to ensure justice in the state. ""Effective immediately, no Probate Judge of the State of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama Probate Judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent"" with the state code or constitution, Moore wrote in the order. The state code says ""marriage is inherently a unique relationship between a man and a woman."" The American Civil Liberties Union called Moore's order spurious and reminded Alabama's probate judges they are sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution, which outweighs state law on this issue. ""Judge Roy Moore has no authority to trump a federal court's decision,"" said Susan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. ""By issuing his 'order,' he has done nothing but create confusion among the different probate offices across the state. Whereas some counties are issuing licenses to same-sex couples, there are many who aren't. Unfortunately, we have received a number of complaints to that effect."" The Human Rights Campaign has already denounced the order as a ""clear violation of all codes of legal ethics,"" and several counties -- including Jefferson, Montgomery and Madison -- have told CNN they intend to issue same-sex marriage licenses Monday. But in Tuscaloosa County, where five same-sex couple were awaiting licenses when the court opened Monday, chief probate clerk Lisa Whitehead said the court would follow Moore's guidance. ""We will be issuing traditional marriage licenses,"" she told CNN. Shelby, Marshall and Houston counties also are declining to issue the licenses, and in Lee County, where two same-sex couples attempted to tie the knot Monday, Judge Bill English said he, too, was ""complying with an order from the chief justice late last night."" Other probate judges weren't sure Moore had the law behind him. ""I was shocked,"" King said of his reaction to Moore's order. ""I'm old enough to remember the George Wallace stand in the schoolhouse door. I was a kid at the time."" King was referencing the 1963 attempt by then-Gov. Wallace to stop the federally ordered desegregation of schools by blocking black students from entering the University of Alabama's Foster Auditorium. Contacted before his court opened for the day, King said he doesn't want to be on that side of history. After consulting with attorneys who helped him analyze Moore's order, ""I'm convinced it's my duty to follow the U.S. Constitution and the federal court order. At 8 a.m., we will be issuing marriage licenses to all in Jefferson County. ... I don't think (Moore's order) is grounded in legal theory, just like Gov. Wallace in the 1960s was not grounded in law,"" he said. Gov. Robert Bentley said he would not punish probate judges who issue the licenses. In a statement that included a link to the U.S. Supreme Court's dissenting opinion but not the majority opinion that cleared the way for the marriages, the governor said he was disappointed ""a single Federal court judge disregarded the vote of the Alabama people to define marriage as between a man and woman."" He added that he had ""great respect"" for the legal process and said, ""We will follow the rule of law in Alabama, and allow the issue of same sex marriage to be worked out through the proper legal channels."" Anyone monitoring the situation in Alabama likely expected Moore to try and block it. Four days after a U.S. District Court judge struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriages on January 23, Moore hand-delivered a letter to Bentley calling for him ""to stop judicial tyranny and any unlawful opinions issued without constitutional authority."" The federal court that struck down the ban permitted a stay until Monday to allow probate courts to prepare. Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange asked the U.S. Supreme Court to block the marriages until the high court rules on a case on its docket that will decide the fate of same-sex marriages in four states. The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday it would not intervene for now, making Alabama the 37th state (plus Washington, D.C.) to permit same-sex marriages. ""In this case, the Court refuses even to grant a temporary stay when it will resolve the issue at hand in several months,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent. ""I would have shown the people of Alabama the respect they deserve and preserved the status quo while the Court resolves this important Constitutional question."" Strange responded in a statement: ""In the absence of a stay, there will likely be more confusion in the coming months leading up to the Supreme Court's anticipated ruling on the legality of same-sex marriage."" Strange further advised probate judges to consult with their attorneys ""about how to respond to the ruling."" Opinion: Gay marriage is Alabama judge's latest battle . CNN's Devon M. Sayers, John Branch, Deborah E. Bloom, Dave Alsup and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.","Governor slams ruling but says, ""We will follow the rule of law in Alabama""

"(CNN)Francesco Schettino arrived in court ahead of his defense's closing arguments in Grosseto, Italy, on Monday in a dark wool scarf after fighting off a weekend flu that kept him out of court last week. ""I had a high fever,"" he told CNN during the coffee break at Monday's trial.  ""But I'm better now."" Schettino, who was the captain of the Costa Concordia cruise ship when it crashed into the rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio, in January 2012, is facing 26 years in prison for charges of causing a maritime disaster, abandoning ship and multiple counts of manslaughter for the 32 people who lost their lives in the accident. A three-judge panel heard testimony from technical experts, passengers and crew members who were on the vessel at the time of the accident. During the 19-month trial, they also heard from the captain's female guest on the cruise, Domnica Cermortan, a Moldovan dancer who testified under duress that she was in a romantic relationship with the captain and that she was with him on the bridge when the accident occurred. Schettino's lead lawyer Domenico Pepe began his closing arguments on Monday by referring to the fact that the champagne bottle used to christen the ill-fated vessel when it was put into service in 2006 did not break. ""Everything about this ship and this process since then has been a mystery so far,"" he said. Pepe then addressed each of the charges against the captain, starting with causing a shipwreck and maritime disaster.  He repeated the accusation that because his helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin allegedly did not understand English -- a language he was required to speak -- when Schettino gave the orders to turn the ship away from the island, he, in fact, caused the accident, not Schettino. Rusli Bin was subpoenaed to testify, but his last known address was in Indonesia and he could not be forced to come to the court in Italy. Pepe said Schettino had been vilified from the moment the ship wrecked, and that the negative image has hurt his case.  ""This man, the accused,"" he said pointing to Schettino, ""was arrested immediately, he was prejudged as an assassin."" He then went on to criticize the prosecutor who referred to Schettino as an ""idiot"" in his closing arguments last week. ""Schettino is a good man,"" he said.  ""He is not an idiot.""  He then suggested that finding Schettino not guilty would actually be good for Italy's image, somehow restoring it in the eyes of the world who have seen this case as an example of Italian ineptitude. Schettino's defense has hinged in part on alleged malfunctions of the ship's equipment and infrastructure, including claims that the ship had faulty watertight doors and generators, and that the elevators did not work when the ship was listing. ""Everything that did not work on the ship is part of the cause of the accident,"" Pepe told the court. ""Lights didn't work. People fell into holes. Elevators got stuck."" These claims were hard to verify because much of the ship was immersed off the coast of Giglio for many months after the accident. Pepe  tried to explain why his client left the ship ahead of so many passengers, part of the charge of abandoning ship.  He used an elaborate graphic to illustrate the inclination of the ship at the time Schettino apparently lost his balance and fell into the lifeboat that took him to shore.  He said that once on shore, Schettino was able to conduct the rescue operation and that he never lost control of the operation. Pepe  then addressed the famous exchange between Gregorio De Falco -- commander of the Livorno Port Authority the night of the accident -- and Schettino, during which De Falco told Schettino to ""get back on board for f**k's sake."" Pepe called De Falco's tone degrading and said the commander was unprofessional and egotistic at a moment when he should have been a voice of calm. Pepe suggested it was De Falco's stern manner, rather than Schettino's apparent ineptitude, that damaged Italy's reputation. He then showed what were intended to be compromising photos of De Falco with a local Italian journalist to imply that De Falco was involved in some sort of conspiracy to set up Schettino.  ""In the exchange that gained national attention, De Falco was painted as a hero when he should not have been,"" Pepe said. Pepe said his client could not have returned to the ship when it was on its side without risking his life.  ""He's not superman or a spider,"" he told the court, before asking them to  ""absolve Schettino of abandoning ship."" Addressing the manslaughter charges, Pepe tried to bolster his argument that because no one died on impact when the ship slammed into the rocks, Schettino cannot be held liable. Everyone who perished lost their lives as a result of the chaotic evacuation, he said. Pepe defended Schettino's decision to delay the call to abandon ship by nearly an hour.  ""Stop for a minute to consider what would have happened if he had abandoned ship 1 kilometer from shore,"" Pepe said. ""There could be 4,500 dead, not 32.""  (There were 4,229 passengers and crew on the ship) Five Costa officials, including the head of the crisis center, Roberto Ferrarini, were granted plea bargains with fines paid by Costa Cruise company and suspended prison sentences, Pepe said. Ferrarini and Schettino were on the phone more than a dozen times between the moment the Concordia hit the rocks and when the call to abandon ship was made, he said. Pepe accused the Costa Chairman Michael Thamm of interfering in the case by moving a large number of Costa employees from Genoa to Switzerland, and essentially paying the fines and buying freedom for the other suspects.  ""Schettino should be judged like the others at fault,"" he said. Schettino was denied a plea bargain similar to that his five colleagues were granted.  Pepe instead insisted that money was the motivation behind the Costa company trying to pin the blame on Schettino. ""There is a lot of money at play here,"" he told the court.  ""There is a lot of money at risk."" Schettino's third lawyer Donato Laino, who is handling the technical aspects of the defense, said that Schettino navigated the ship ""with an organization"" -- not single-handedly.  ""He was annoying as a commander,"" Laino said, referring to Schettino as someone whose attention to detail borders on perfectionism. Lawyers for 16 civil parties, including the island of Giglio, which are included in criminal trials in Italy, will have a chance to offer final arguments along with the prosecutor.  Then Schettino's defense team will have one more chance at a brief final rebuttal before the three-judge panel retires to deliberate. A verdict could come on Tuesday evening or, more likely, on Wednesday.","Closing arguments were in process Monday for former captain of Costa Concordia .

"(CNN)First, it was the snowy weather. An American Airlines flight trying to leave Boston on Sunday night was delayed for about 2½ hours before it finally took off at 10:52 p.m. The crew of American Flight 223 knew hours before takeoff that they couldn't go the distance to Los Angeles. The first officer was going to exceed his allotted work time, as dictated by the Federal Aviation Administration, if he flew the entire route, American spokeswoman Victoria Lupica said. That's why the crew made the decision to divert to Chicago O'Hare International Airport that night and informed the passengers hours prior to takeoff, Lupica said. The passengers were told about the stop in Chicago while still in the Boston boarding area, several hours before departing, she said. They would have had time to rebook if they wanted to do so. ""Certainly, the weather had a lot to do with this decision,"" Lupica said. ""It was prudent to depart and be able to go as far as Chicago,"" especially with the snow predictions in the Boston area. Given Monday's snowfall in the Boston area, it seems like a smart decision to get out of town. It's not likely the flight would have taken off Monday. Boston Logan International Airport remained open, but most flights have been canceled, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said. 3 Mondays, 3 straight snowstorms bury the Northeast . Snowstorms in the Northeast have caused the cancellation and delay of thousands of flights over the past couple months. FlightAware.com showed more than 700 flights within, into and out of the United States canceled for Sunday, on top of the more than 1,500 flights scheduled to be scrubbed Monday. Flight 223's passengers landed in Chicago just after midnight and were put up in hotels overnight. They departed Chicago with a new crew at 8:05 a.m. Monday and landed in Los Angeles at 10:11 a.m., according to FlightAware.com.

"The captain of the Dutch national team says his players were subjected to racial abuse at a training session in the Polish city of Krakow this week, just days before the Euro 2012 football tournament was due to begin in Poland and Ukraine. Several hundred people out of a crowd of 23,000 reportedly targeted black members of the squad with ""monkey chants"" during an open session Wednesday at the Stadion Miejski, the home of Wisla Krakow. ""It is a real disgrace especially after getting back from Auschwitz (the Dutch squad had visited the concentration camp on Wednesday) that you are confronted with this,"" Netherlands skipper Mark Van Bommel told a press conference late Thursday. ""We will take it up with UEFA and if it happens at a match we will talk to the referee and ask him to take us off the field."" Euro 2012 hosts hit back at racism accusations . When questioned over the incident by Dutch journalists who claimed they did not hear the abuse, Van Bommel replied: ""You need to open your ears. If you did hear it, and don't want to hear it, that is even worse,"" according to ESPN. The Netherlands are due to hold a news conference at 1715 GMT Friday in Poland followed by another training session in front of fans, according to UEFA's official website. ""UEFA has now been made aware that there were some isolated incidents of racist chanting that occurred at the open training session of the Dutch team in Krakow. UEFA has not yet received any formal complaint from the KNVB (Dutch football association),"" read a UEFA statement. ""Should such behavior happen at further training sessions, UEFA would evaluate the operational measures to be taken to protect the players. Blog: Racism overshadows buildup to Euro 2012 . ""UEFA has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to discriminatory behavior and has given the power to referees to stop matches in case of any repeated racist behavior."" The KNVB released a statement Friday confirming it would not be making a complaint to UEFA. ""As at one moment there was a lot of noise coming from a specific stand, the team decided to train at the other side of the stadium, which was much quieter,"" the Dutch ruling body said of the incident on Wednesday. ""A few players have heard sounds, which could be described as possible monkey chants. However, the training staff on the pitch were not aware of this. Although KNVB will not make an official complaint to UEFA, they are more than willing to answer questions of UEFA in this respect."" Poland's Sport and Tourism Minister told CNN that the incident was not racist, but involved a small hooligan element. ""As far as I know this is a very small hooliganism incident, not a racist one,"" Joanna Mucha said Friday. ""You can be sure that it is very marginal in Poland, you've got hooliganism all over the world in sporting arenas. It will not happen again -- if it does we will react appropriately."" Mucha said football supporters should not be afraid to come to Poland for the tournament. ""My message is you will be safe and you will feel safe in Poland. There is a huge security operation and we will manage to do it, to make you safe,"" she said. CNN Special: Racism - It's not black and white . The buildup to the football showpiece, which kicks off in Warsaw on Friday, has been marred by a host of reports highlighting incidents of racial violence in the Eastern European nations. The families of two of England's black players, Arsenal's Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain and Theo Walcott, will not be traveling to Ukraine and Poland, while Italy and Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli says he will walk off the pitch if he is targeted by racists. The England team is scheduled to train in front of 3,500 fans at the same stadium in Krakow on Friday. UEFA president Michel Platini says players must not take matters into their own hands, and that any player that walks off the pitch will be cautioned. Referees will deal with racists . ""It is a referee's job to stop the match and he is to do so if there are any problems of this kind. I count on the fans from Western and Eastern Europe to come to participate in a great football feast. If I am here as a UEFA chairman and you all are here it is because we want this to be a football feast, not a problem,"" he told reporters Thursday. A recent documentary from the BBC featured right-wing supporters from both Poland and Ukraine displaying racist and anti-Semitic attitudes. The ""Panorama"" episode broadcast footage filmed at matches in both countries that purported to show fans displaying Nazi salutes in the stands and aiming monkey chants at black players. This prompted former England footballer Sol Campbell to warn fans not to travel to either country. However, officials from the co-hosts hit out at the program. Marcin Bosacki, a Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman, told CNN it was ""cheap journalism,"" while Volodymyr Khandogiy, Ukraine's ambassador to Britain, said it was ""unbalanced and biased reporting about the situation in Ukraine."" But Piara Power, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe organization, said there was still plenty of work to be done in both countries. ""I think we know the situation in domestic football in both Poland and Ukraine and I'm afraid the documentary hit the nail on the head -- it's a very bad situation,"" he said. ""Nevertheless there is some good work going at grass roots level to make sure that Euro 2012 inside stadiums does not resemble the sort of scenes we saw in the documentary."" Aside from allegations of racism, the choice of Poland and Ukraine as hosts of UEFA's European international football competition -- an event which UEFA says will see 1.4 million fans travel to the region and a further 150 million television viewers tune in worldwide -- has drawn criticism from lawmakers of many EU nations, with some refusing to attend the tournament. Concerns have arisen over the treatment of former Ukrainian prime minister and opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, who was jailed for seven years in October 2011 for abuse of office. Tymoshenko, who was a leading figure in the 2004 Orange Revolution and had been on a 20-day hunger strike until last week, argues she has been victim of mistreatment and politically-motivated imprisonment driven by current president Viktor Yanukovych. The Ukrainian prime minister, Mykola Azarov, denied the claims in an interview with CNN on Thursday. ""This is a mistake made by some politicians when they express their opinion without digging into the case. No one accuses Tymoshenko of her political decisions. Tymoshenko is accused of a concrete crime,"" Azarov said. ""There was no government decision which she is referring to when she signed an unfavorable gas contract for Ukraine. She falsified that government decision which means she committed the fraud. So it's not a political decision."" The situation prompted the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to announce they would be effectively boycotting the event: ""No ministers will be attending group games at Euro 2012. ""We are keeping attendance at later stages of the tournament under review in the light of Ministers' busy schedules ahead of the Olympics and widespread concerns about selective justice and the rule of law in Ukraine,"" their statement read. Foreign Secretary William Hague went further in an interview with the BBC, saying the UK government did not want its backing of the England football team to be interpreted as ""giving political support to some things which have been happening in Ukraine which we don't agree with."" Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN the government will be meeting later Friday with the prime minister to discuss attendance by the nation's lawmakers at the tournament, while a German government spokesman confirmed that chancellor Angela Merkel would not be attending any of the first-round matches due to her time schedule. Austria's Council of Ministers decided on May 2 to boycott all games held in Ukraine as a sign of solidarity with Tymoshenko.","Hundreds of people reportedly targeted black members of Dutch squad .

"San Diego (CNN)As you're driving along the highway, wouldn't you like to know if there's a police car up ahead so you can slow down and avoid getting a ticket? You'd also probably like to know if there's a speed trap around the next corner, so you don't wind up spending your weekend at traffic school. Well, there's an app for that. Police chiefs, sheriffs and law enforcement groups wish there wasn't. They say they want to protect the lives of police officers, but what if they're just trying to protect the revenue that flows into government coffers due to speeding tickets? Waze is a new and controversial mobile app that tracks cars moving through traffic in real time and shares that information so users can get around traffic jams. This sounds harmless. But there is more. The app also uses a small icon of a tiny face in a police hat to warn users if police are nearby, either in speed traps or parked on the side the road. It obtains that information when other users who are driving further up the road input data into the system. It's ingenious -- and for law enforcement personnel, also frustrating. Police chiefs and sheriffs are not amused at this high-tech example of information-sharing. In fact, they're determined to put a stop to it. Law enforcement leaders claim to be concerned about officer safety. After all, lately, officers have been gunned down simply for wearing a uniform. They say they're worried about everyday citizens keeping track of the comings and goings of officers, and they insist that the app is a high-tech ""police stalker."" They claim that this technology -- while helpful to motorists -- turns officers into ""sitting ducks"" for criminals. The folks at Waze, for their part, insist that the app improves the safety of roadways because most users tend to drive more carefully when they think police are nearby. That sounds reasonable. It also sounds as if police doth protest too much, and that they're not telling us the whole truth as to what they're really concerned about. It's not as if motorists can't often times spot police cars and adjust their speed without the help of an app; often, the patrol cars are in plain view on the side of the road. Likewise, those who want to harm law enforcement officers will find a way to do so regardless of what app is or isn't on the market. It's easy to see why Waze -- which was purchased by Google in 2013 for $966 million -- is so popular. There is a huge appetite for this technology. Potential customers include anyone who hates speed traps -- and that probably covers most Americans. In fact, there have been cases where individuals have tried to warn motorists about an oncoming speed trap and the police have come down hard on the good Samaritans. Luckily, the courts have, in turn, come down hard on the police, citing a First Amendment right to alert others as to the presence of police. In February 2014, for example, a county judge in Frisco, Texas,  about an hour north of Dallas, reportedly dismissed a complaint against 33-year-old Ron Martin who was arrested for holding a sign warning drivers of a speed trap. The sign read: ""Police Ahead."" The charge was ridiculous but creative: a misdemeanor count of violating the city's sign ordinance. It's not just signs that are protected speech. Signals are covered too. A few days before the Texas ruling, in St. Louis, a federal judge ruled that motorists ""have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights to warn"" fellow drivers that police are nearby or setting a speed trap. In 2012, Michael Elli flashed his headlights to warn oncoming vehicles that police were waiting with radar just up the road. A police officer pulled over Elli, citing him for ""flashing lights on certain vehicles...warning of RADAR ahead."" The city dropped the charge, but the American Civil Liberties Union decided to sue on Elli's behalf, charging that his First Amendment rights were violated. The judge agreed. Let's hear it for common sense. Speed traps are, by their very nature, a form of cheating. Law enforcement officers are bending the rules to hand out tickets. Worse, they're also an example of government-sponsored thievery. Cash-strapped cities and counties have come up with new ways of generating revenue. One of the first places they look are unsuspecting motorists who are in a poor position to complain because -- the authorities are likely to claim -- they wouldn't have received a ticket in the first place if they weren't guilty of speeding. But what are the authorities guilty of? If police have a quota to meet, or a sheriff's substation is competing with other substations as to the number of tickets it hands out, discretion will suffer. People who might not normally get a citation are going to be written up. That's not right. It's one thing for police officers to come across someone speeding in the course of their normal duties, and write that person a ticket. It's another for them to lie in wait for motorists to make mistakes so the government agency they work for can fleece the citizenry. That's not right either. When police set up a speed trap where motorists are likely to be driving over the speed limit -- say, at the bottom of a hill -- and then wait for drivers to meander into their web so they can write tickets that generate revenue for a city, county or state, they're violating a social contract. Those who have sworn an oath to protect us aren't supposed to prey upon us.","Law enforcement groups have complained about Waze mobile app .

"(CNN)ISIS has released a new video in which a captive British journalist acts as though he is reporting on Aleppo in Syria. John Cantlie, who has appeared in previous ISIS videos, calls this one the ""last in this series."" In the video, he shows parts of Aleppo, saying the destruction is caused not only by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad but also U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. The coalition has been targeting ISIS. Cantlie also shows a religious school and a court, where he explains that Islamic Sharia law ""is 1,400 years old. And it is the rule of God, the rule of Allah. And therefore it cannot be changed.""  He cites, for example, that the punishment for robbery is having one's hand cut off. Cantlie was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley. A video published by ISIS in August showed Foley being beheaded. ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, has taken over swaths of land in Syria and Iraq and carried out barbaric killings.","Captive journalist John Cantlie calls video the ""last in this series""

"Renowned psychic Sylvia Browne -- a leader in the paranormal world who appeared regularly on television and radio and also wrote dozens of top-selling books -- died Wednesday in a northern California hospital, according to her website. She was 77. A believer in reincarnation as well as God, Browne conducted thousands of hypnotic regressions and hundreds of trance sessions to help people around the world, according to her official biography. She explained on CNN's Larry King Live that she both communicated with the dead and looked into the future. ""I don't know how I do it,"" Browne once explained on King's show. ""I've done it all my life."" Her following extended well beyond those she helped directly. Some got to know her through her writings, others through the media --  including appearances on ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" ""Loveline with Dr. Drew"" and ""The Montel Williams Show,"" on which she was a weekly guest for 17 years. ""I, like so many of you, lost a friend today,"" Williams said in a posting on Browne's website. ""But, as has been for the last 20 years, she'll always remain a part of me."" Born in Kansas City, Missouri, during the Great Depression, Browne first became aware of her psychic abilities at age 3, her bio says. It was a ""very scary thing"" for her when she realized as a youngster she could tell if someone was going to die, she told King in 2000. ""The only thing, I think, that saved my sanity was that there are so many -- well, we can track our lineage back to 300 years -- of psychics,"" Browne said. After moving to California in 1964, she moved from helping people privately to doing so publicly to help ""thousands of people gain control of their lives, live more happily, understand the meaning of life and to find God in their unique way,"" her website states. She founded The Nirvana Foundation for Psychic Research in 1974, and went on to publish more than 50 books. According to her bio, 22 of those made it to the New York Times Best Sellers list. Browne also trained ministers to help spread her thinking through the Society of Novus Spiritus organization, and created The Sylvia Browne Hypnosis Training Center to teach her hypnosis methods. While beloved by many in the psychic community, Browne also had detractors. They included those critical of her remarks, on a 2004 episode of ""The Montel Williams Show,"" that then-missing Amanda Berry was dead -- telling Berry's mother she would next see her daughter ""in heaven, on the other side."" Berry ended up being rescued -- along with her young daughter, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus -- last May in the Cleveland home of Ariel Castro, where they'd been held captive for the better part of a decade. Browne subsequently posted a statement on her website saying, ""If ever there was a time to be grateful and relieved for being mistaken, this is that time. Only God is right all the time."" Browne's Facebook page includes a September 10 posting stating, ""If you are afraid to die, you will not fully live."" The final message came less than a month ago, on October 27, when Browne wrote, ""My one prayer every morning that has carried me through my life is, 'Hi God, it's me again.' ""It doesn't matter how you pray,"" she added. ""It can be just simply talking to God. Remember, God knows your heart and soul.""

"(CNN)Every age has the heroes it deserves, as the saying goes. To judge from the success of the movie ""American Sniper,"" the hero of the current moment would be the trained killer. Director Clint Eastwood's movie has been highly praised and loudly criticized. Each new round of critical and public controversy over its presentation of war, veterans and their families boosts its ticket sales higher. It is the highest grossing war movie ever made in the United States. Why has this movie become ""a cultural phenomenon,"" as many term it? The answer lies in its focus on the figure of the sniper, whose military role isolates what is universally most fraught about warfare -- the act of targeting and shooting a human being -- and yet who also stands for values that are particularly cherished by many Americans. Unlike a helicopter or airplane pilot or tank commander -- to cite icons of other times, other wars -- the sniper works alone. He often has a spotter and is in contact with his unit but needs no one else to operate his lethal weapon. It is all about the relationship of the eyes and the trigger finger. ""American Sniper"" is at its most ambiguous as an anti-war war film when Eastwood aligns our vision with Chris Kyle's (played by Bradley Cooper), involving us in the emotions and moral dilemmas that come with the kill, even as this highlights the sniper's singular and heavy responsibility. Opinion: 'American Sniper,' a powerful anti-war film . The sniper embodies the individualism that is sacred to a large swath of the American population. It is the sniper's operational independence that allows his skills to be transferred to the civilian realm. Whether in the woods, at the shooting range, or in combat, the action and the equipment are not dissimilar. In ""American Sniper,"" the hero's gun is an extension of his personality, as much as he fights against it: Not only through his mechanically enabled vision but also through the prominence of weapons in his private life.  It is not surprising that in the movie Kyle gravitates to the shooting range as a means of easing his transition to civilian life. War heroes can appear in various guises. There are those who save their comrades in the heat of battle, and those who win accolades for their mastery of the weapons and strategies most valued at that combat moment. Think of World War I crack fighter pilot Manfred von Richthofen, nicknamed the Red Baron, whose skill confirmed aerial warfare's potential. The sniper's ascent comes in part from his utility in American counterinsurgency campaigns such as those conducted in Afghanistan and Iraq. Drones, too, are part of this warfare in which high technology surveillance sometimes aids that most traditional of combat pursuits -- the manhunt. But the military sniper, long held in suspicion for his independence by Marines and other American military units, has an almost romantic appeal for those immersed in gun culture. Opinion: Michael Moore is wrong about 'American Sniper' The Western-style showdown staged in ""American Sniper"" between Kyle and the crack enemy sniper Mustafa (Sammy Sheik) is not only a nod to Eastwood's filmmaking history, but to a fundamental figure in American history: the lone gunman, on a crusade to make the world safe. The most effective snipers have psychological as well as physical distance from their targets, which is useful now that the line between military and civilian enemy targets has become increasingly blurred. In counterinsurgency warfare in urban settings, everyone is a potential carrier of grenades or bombs, and uniforms are almost meaningless. In such situations, taboos against killing traditional noncombatants, such as women and children, come to seem outmoded and foolhardy. Now that the major American military interventions overseas have ended or are smaller in scale, the millions of veterans created just in the past decade will have fewer options. ""American Sniper"" is a current film in this way as well. It models a transition for the military professional from wartime to peacetime, with gun culture as its constant. This is, in part, the secret of its success in America: It is an anti-war film that is not anti-gun. Kyle did not become a hero because he died (he was shot to death at a shooting range in 2013 and a fellow veteran is on trial in the case), but because he knew how to kill so well. He is the perfect hero for a country that has made a cult of the art of precision shooting, whether in combat or at the local range or gun show, and a country that clings to the right to bear arms, no matter how many civilian casualties, Kyle among them, accumulate.","Ruth Ben-Ghiat: ""American Sniper"" has become the top-grossing war movie in U.S.
She says America admires the lead character for his individualism and affinity for guns ."
"(CNN)A few months before Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, an enthusiastic plane spotter named Gunnar Kullenberg heard Malaysia Airlines was about to stop flying to the United States. He wanted a photograph of its majestic Boeing 777-200 and planted himself at the Los Angeles airport at dawn. That's where he snapped a photo of the airplane dancing in the glowing sky. ""I didn't think much of it, other than that it was a beautiful fall day here in Southern California,"" Kullenberg recalled. Ercan Karakas, an airline captain, captured a similar image in Istanbul in January 2012. ""I'm a spotter. I love to watch and photograph the takeoffs of heavy aircrafts,"" he wrote of the experience. ""I know they are not a metal, flying bird; they connect thousands of people in a journey to happiness."" When Flight 370 went missing, Kullenberg and Karakas were among the plane spotters who checked their trove of images. Several found they had photos of the plane when they discovered the registration number matched. Flight 370 was airplane 9M-MRO. These spotters' fantastical musings of planes in flight turned suddenly to dark speculation. ""I fly 60 to 90 times a year; how could this happen?"" asked Hansueli Krapf, a Swiss businessman who captured 9M-MRO sitting on the runway in South Africa two years ago. ""What on earth could have happened to a plane when there is so much tracking?"" Plane spotters upload hundreds of images to air buff websites all the time, reflections of their fascination with flight. They chat for screen pages about the mechanics and wonder about their far-off destinations and the passengers. They invent stories about people from far-flung countries touring faraway lands, on holiday, on business or studying abroad -- just like the passengers of Flight 370. After the plane disappeared, Michael Raisch, a visual historian, surfed the airline websites looking for postings of the missing plane. ""You begin to see how interconnected the world is,"" said Raisch, who once compiled a time-lapse photo project of the rebuilding of One World Trade Center. ""There is a mystique to flying. Like everything matters more if it happened on an airline."" Raisch put up a Web page with some of the photos and reached out to the photographers for their recollections. What is emerging is a visual history of the plane. The plane spotters document the 9M-MRO's travels. It spent time in Los Angeles, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Perth, Australia. It set down in South Africa, Vienna and Rome. The dates the spotters shared with CNN for the pictures they posted on  websites such as airliners.net and Wikimedia.org sync with the dates the plane flew through those airports. So does the information they provided about their own backgrounds as pilots or aviation students or ordinary folks with long histories of photographing planes. Their motive for recording air travel is also well-documented. They all love planes. Plane spotters seek 'Wayne's World' thrills . Canadian Dan Miclea said he contributed to the gallery after he had an ""Oh, wow"" moment when he realized he'd seen 9M-MRO sitting on a runway in Rome on June 27, 2010. The 20-year-old has taken thousands of images of planes, including the moment he spotted a shiny Boeing 777 from Malaysia. ""It's fascinating that we get such a big piece of metal up in the air and fly,"" he said. Bernhard Ebner posted his photo when he discovered he had spotted the missing plane on May 5, 2013, in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. ""We wanted to wake up early in the morning to catch the most long-haul flights,"" Ebner said. ""It was a beautiful sunrise at this day as you can see on the picture, and a little bit foggy. Perfect for catching the early birds."" His excitement over capturing a picture of an exotic Malaysian airliner turned to sadness when he realized it had later vanished from the sky. ""I was so surprised about this and can't really believe it. They have 105 planes, 15 Boeing 777-200, and I caught exactly this one, I don't know what I really should (say) now,"" Ebner said. Raisch said he believes the plane spotters are deeply affected by having a piece of the airplane's history. ""It's human nature to want to hold on to a piece of something,"" said Raisch, who still marvels at his photos of the towers before 9/11 and talks passionately of his chance encounter with actor Paul Walker, who died in a car crash. ""The human part of you says, 'OMG, I have this piece of something that is now missing. I have something that is now lost.' "" Krapf, the frequent flier, said he feels like each picture allows him to share a special part of an airplane's history. He has been fascinated with planes since he was 4. ""My father used to take us to Zurich Airport, and we would just watch,"" said Krapf, who later became an amateur pilot. ""For me, pilots were heroes, gods. The aircrafts themselves with the noise they made and the size of them, the fact that we could fly, it all fascinated me."" He remembers the five-hour layover in South Africa, where he caught sight of the bold white plane with its blue and red streaks sitting on the runway, a glint of sunshine piercing the metal. ""I was on a business trip on the way home from Zambia. I always take free time at airports to take some photos of planes,"" he said. Lorenzo Giacobbo's image on January 30, 2011, in Rome is the kind of breathtaking photo the plane spotters yearn to capture. The sky is cloudy and rain showers are painting the clouds. Streaks of light pierce the liquid gray sky and illuminate the metal. ""The moment I saw those images that I took of the plane, I was feeling shock and glad at the same time, because I never believe that plane is now gone and I have in my personal collection a copy of the plane,"" he wrote. The experience is perhaps most emotional for Ignatius ""Iggy""  Kwee, who snapped his image in Perth on August 10, 2010. He was active on a WhatsApp chat group for aviation fans when word of the missing plane came through. ""It's just sad really, and being a Malaysian myself, I might even have had a ride on that similar aircraft once upon a time ago flying from Kuala Lumpur to Perth back in the days before AirAsia X came to this part of the world,"" he said in a message to Raisch. ""The triple seven is a joy to fly in. It's graceful with its huge twin engine, feeling robust in the air and beautiful to photograph in action with all the flaps down, the triple landing gear bogeys. Now having learned this is the first total airframe and lives lost of a triple seven in a crash, it's just unbelievable in this modern aviation world.""

"(CNN)Deadly flames licked all around her, but a heroic dog in a suburban Cincinnati basement refused to leave her owner. Now that dog, a 9-year-old boxer named Carmen, has a team of vets fighting around the clock to save her life. Carmen was injured Thursday when a fire broke out in the basement of the home where she lived with her owner, Ben Ledford, in Goshen Township, Ohio. First responders on the scene found Carmen, a 9-year-old boxer, on top of Ledford, trying to shelter his face from the heat, smoke and flame, according to CNN affiliate WCPO. Ledford, 33, was taken to a hospital where he later died. Carmen ended up at Cincinnati's Care Center, a critical care veterinary hospital, where the vets there have placed her on a ventilator. ""She's doing OK. Considering what Carmen has been through we think she's doing as well as can be expected,"" Dr. Daniel Carey, a vet at the hospital, told WCPO. Carey said Carmen is battling severe lung damage and is not strong enough to breathe on her own yet. The doctors had hoped to get her off the ventilator by now, but as of Sunday night, it just wasn't happening. ""It's not unexpected that she's not ready to come off (the ventilator). It's just that in our best case scenario (we thought) maybe we could've hoped to get her off (Sunday) afternoon,"" Carey told WCPO. ""Whenever they put a patient on a ventilator they're looking at a 50-50 chance of getting them off breathing on their own. The smoke ventilation cases are often the hardest to manage off the ventilator."" Despite her breathing problems, Carmen has shown improvement in other areas. She is mentally alert and showing no signs of neurological problems, the vet said. ""She's resting. She's very heavily sedated so that she won't fight -- you know, that she's got a tube down her trachea or windpipe. She seems very comfortable."" Ledford's family and friends, while mourning the loss of his life, are still doing what they can to help Carmen save hers. They've turned to crowdsourcing website CrowdRise to raise funds to help pay Carmen's hospital bills. On the site, they thanked the doctors and expressed gratitude at the ""generosity being offered to help Carmen."" The hospital is also providing updates on Carmen through social media, using Facebook to post pictures of the dog resting on a pink blanket and keeping company with a pair of stuffed animals. Dr. Marlo Anderson, another vet at the hospital who is caring for the dog, told WCPO she was not at all surprised that Carmen tried to save her owner. ""A lot of dogs instinctively know when there's a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go to try to protect their owners, so she very well may have been trying to protect him,"" she said.","Carmen, a 9-year-old boxer, tried to save her owner last week during a house fire .

"(CNN)The Four Corners was just a restaurant in Chapel Hill to me for years after I moved here.  I thought the data programmers -- who left calculus back where I left fractions -- were out of their analyst minds when, the morning after a game, they'd huddle in the office hallways to relive a lay-up or exclaim about a buzzer-beater basket. Then I met Coach Dean Smith. I was in my second semester teaching feature writing in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of North Carolina.  Among the assignments I gave my students was an interview piece.  As I'd done the first semester, I brought in a person of prominence for the students to interview.  In this case, coach Dean Smith. He arrived on time, was directed to my classroom, and, as I heard later, word of his being there spread through the halls.  When word reached the library that Dean Smith was in the building, I was later told, the librarian -- who one has to think didn't follow basketball -- asked: ""What's he dean of? The students knew. And learned from the coach that, ""I have a job I enjoy.  If you enjoy going to work, then you're one of the lucky people in the world ..."" That he'd ""like to study great Jewish and Christian theologians.  With that background anyone could go out and help society in any job.  I think we're all ministers, whether good or bad ..."" One student's piece captured that side of the man, who was the first coach to give a full athletic scholarship to a black man, integrating men's college basketball. In the article, the student wrote: . ""Like his credentials, which only manage to scar the surface of the man's personality, there's something more. ""Perhaps it has to do with that one word which kept clicking through Dean Smith's conversation like a scratched record: society. 'I'm still listening to society a little ...' 'Society is saying win -- lose ...' '... most State alumni, who reflect society ...' '.. if only we could teach society ...' "" That spring of 1981, he still had not won ""the big one,"" still had the ""monkey on his back."" He took care of that the following year, when Carolina won the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship, with a little help from Michael Jordan, James Worthy and Sam Perkins.  Then won again in 1993. When he retired in October 1997, Dean Smith had 879 victories, an NCAA Division I record.  The man who in his first year, as a young coach, with a losing record, returned from an away game to find he'd been hanged in effigy.  It came up in class that day, and I remember that however matter of fact, yes-that's-what-happened his reply, it didn't quite hide the hurt. During his visit, I also remember him telling the story of the time at practice one of his players -- who liked to shoot the ball, not pass it -- had to take the ball out of bounds after a basket.  When he did, coach Smith pulled the other players off the court.  The player stood there on the sideline, looking to his left for someone to throw it to, then to his right, then straight ahead, as his fellow players watched on the opposite sideline, smiling. He got the message. Speaking of practice, coach Smith reportedly never allowed anyone to watch practice.  It mattered not if you'd given a million dollars for a building -- or might give a hundred million. But, then, when I was at The Carolina Inn with School of Journalism Dean Richard Cole for a business lunch with an associate, coach Smith came in, passed our table and moved on to his table.  As he did so, Dean Cole told us how coach Smith had sent word to the parents of a little girl who had been murdered on her way to school two days before, and the media was still camped out on her street.  So her brother would not have to come home to that, coach Smith invited him to watch practice. There are uncounted examples of his kindness and thoughtfulness. Woody Durham, ""The Voice of the Tar Heels"" for more than 25 years, also came to class to be interviewed.  I'd frequently ask him to talk about the time Michael Jordan did his dipsy-doodle, whirly-gig, now-you-see-it-now-you-don't dunk at the end of a game against Maryland. It was so hard to believe that the video of the play was run over, and over, even the following night on the late sportscast.  But, Woody said that as he was preparing his weekly radio program with coach Smith, he received a call from the coach's long-time secretary, Linda Woods. I forget if she relayed coach Smith's wish or he came on the line, but there's no question about what he wanted: He wanted Woody to make no mention of the play, lest it embarrass the Maryland coach and players. I met coach Smith a number of times in the years following his visit to my class.  We ""did not do lunch,"" as I like to say, but he was always friendly and would nod. The last time I saw him was at a local restaurant eight years ago. The spring of 2007. That year, in meeting the student assignment for a color feature on a basketball afternoon or evening in Chapel Hill, my student Megan Etling wrote about the Dean E. Smith Center, better known as the Dean Dome -- a term, I understand, he hated.  She titled her feature ""Olympus"" because the Dean Dome was where ""thousands make the semi-weekly pilgrimage to worship at the altar of greatness."" A bit later, ""We risk a long fall to look up and be humbled by the testaments to glory-day heroes hanging in the rafters.  Only the great ones live there in the rafters, as if hung in the stars like gods. ""On Saturday, legends filed into Olympus to be praised by tens of thousands of revelers living the glory vicariously through these men.  Before the crowds stood the 1957 and 1982 National Championship winning basketball teams and Dean Smith, Zeus himself. ""Sam Perkins. Jimmy Black. Lennie Rosenbluth. ""James Worthy. Michael Jordan. Dean Smith."" A couple of weeks later, as I was seated at a local restaurant, I glanced around and there, two tables to my left, with a friend, was Dean Smith. I almost had to put my hand over my mouth to keep from blurting out: . ""And Zeus himself."" Up there with the gods.","Lauder: Dean Smith was a winner whose social conscience helped reshape college sports .
Students regarded him rightly as an Olympian, she says ."
"(CNN)The winter is surgery season. People get into skiing accidents and need to replace knees, or they slip on ice and need to fix a hip, or they just want to get ready for bikini weather and schedule a nip here and an enlargement there. Surgeons are particularly busy these days, but Dr. Jamal M. Bullocks, a surgeon from the Kelsey-Seybold Clinic in Houston, has advice if you do need surgery. A successful surgery depends on a number of factors -- a few of them you can control. Even minor surgery may pose some risk that has long-term implications. So, for those considering surgery, there are six habits you need to commit to right now to help your body heal. Here's how Bullocks suggests you can improve your chances of recovering more quickly if you do go under the knife: . I shouldn't even have to tell you this. If you smoke, you know this habit can cause irreparable damage to your organs. It increases your chances for heart attack and stroke. Smoking can significantly hamper the success of your procedure. While in surgery, the damage from smoking to your airway and lungs makes it more difficult to control your breathing while you are under anesthesia. Additionally, because smoking damages your vascular system, it can bring on complications in wound healing that may lead to infection and wound breakdown. If you smoke and have plans to go under the knife, talk to your physician about smoking-cessation programs and products and follow his or her advice. Use this surgery as an opportunity to improve your overall health by quitting smoking. Malnutrition and the effects of poor eating habits can negatively alter how your body reacts to surgery. Malnutrition is a serious condition that can affect overall health and is a concern for many older adults since senior citizens are at particular risk. Malnutrition can weaken your immune system, cause muscle weakness that can decrease cardiac and respiratory function and may negatively affect wound healing. Talk to your physician about your eating habits, and if he or she determines you need help improving your diet, work with a registered dietitian before surgery. Even if you eat a well-balanced diet, your diet may still be lacking in important vitamins and protein that promote healing after surgery. Supplemental vitamins (such as vitamins A, E and C) and protein can promote acute wound healing -- and despite looking and feeling healthy, your body may need a boost. Ask your physician to confirm that you are not deficient in any vitamins and to test your protein building capacity and work with him or her to determine an appropriate supplement regimen before surgery. This is easier said than done. Being overweight or obese raises your risk because many people with this condition have other risk factors such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory abnormalities, heart failure, hypertension, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. If you are overweight or obese and considering a nonurgent surgery, work with your physician to develop a weight-loss plan and try to attain a healthier weight. It may help improve your overall condition as well as lower your surgery risk. Diabetes, kidney disease and hypertension are just a few examples of chronic conditions that may increase the chances of complications during and after surgery. It is important to be in the best possible condition before undergoing surgery. If you have a chronic condition that is not well-controlled, work with your care team to help improve your outcomes before an elective surgery. You've chosen your surgeon to guide you through this experience based on a lot of things. You did research on this procedure, and he or she came highly recommended. Such a surgeon may have special credentials or certifications that make you feel more confident. You trusted your surgeon enough to start down the path of preparing for this surgery, so why won't you listen when we give you special instructions to follow beforehand? Surgeons are like every other kind of doctor; they want to help patients improve their health, but they also want to minimize the risk of a condition worsening as a result of the surgery. This is a team effort, and it is imperative you do your part to eliminate potential problems and help with a successful outcome. Follow your surgeon's instructions before surgery -- and always ask questions if something is confusing or unclear.","Even minor surgeries may pose some risk with long-term implications .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN)It was an unbecoming way for the Australian prime minister to begin the week. But when he emerged from a 30-minute meeting with his Liberal Party colleagues, called to discuss his possible removal as leader, Tony Abbott was still the Australian premier, if irretrievably damaged. When last week a member of Abbott's party signaled his intention to move a motion to debate the leadership of the ruling party, shocks waves rippled through the body politic. Elected just 17 months ago promising ""adult government"" after three years of backbiting, infighting and two leadership coups in the previous Labor Party government, unity wasn't expected to be a problem Abbott would face. But disunity set in quickly after a series of bad decisions, policy flip flops, poor polling and as they say in Australia, a ""zinger"" -- the knighting of Prince Philip, the Queen's husband, on Australia's national day. Abbott won Monday's ballot, with 61 out of 102 of his colleagues voting down the motion to remove him, while 39 voted to vacate his position, along with that of his deputy, the Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. The principle of cabinet solidarity meant the prime minister went in to the meeting with nearly 40 votes secured. Despite a significant block of lawmakers opposing their leader, the Liberal Party's whip, Phillip Ruddock, a former immigration minister, said there was no debate and that ""the result is clear."" The meeting originally scheduled for Tuesday was brought forward a day, to prevent the prime minister's detractors caucusing in Canberra ahead of the first week of parliament this year. The move was a ""captain's call"" quipped his nemesis, the immensely popular Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who was being urged to show his hand and pledge to stand for the top job in the event the motion to vacate the position was successful. In the end, Turnbull skated close to declaring his candidacy but stopped short. He would now have been obliged to resign from the Cabinet had he done so. He may well have won the vote, but the fact 39 out of 102 members of the party have declared a lack of confidence in their prime minister leaves Abbott very exposed.  In recent Australian political history, no leader who has faced such a challenge, itself a vote of no confidence, has gone on to survive the wrath of colleagues. All have eventually been overthrown. But for now Abbott has at least spared himself the indignity of becoming the shortest serving first term prime minister ousted by his own party. While lawmakers remain angry by his failure to sell the government's first budget, which has stalled in the country's upper house, Abbott has been accused of not consulting his colleagues on big decisions, among them a botched paid maternity leave scheme, widely seen as favoring the wealthy, and the bizarre knighting of Prince Philip. He seemed to consolidate this view of him as a non-collegiate player by calling Monday's vote a day earlier than anticipated and without apparent consultation, even with his deputy whose job would also have been vacated had the no-confidence vote succeeded. Australians have looked on at the shenanigans in their capital with a mixture of delight and dismay. Those who dislike the government were divided by a desire to see the end of Abbott's government and the fear that replacing him with Turnbull would spell disaster for the Australian Labor Party's chances at the next election. Others raised concerns about tossing out leaders when unpopular decisions are taken. News Corp political commentator Paul Kelly noted that the apparently new political culture of tossing out leaders who make unpopular decisions was damaging the ability of government to govern. ""The politicians will try to deny it -- but our system is moving inexorably into a 'death of reform' straitjacket,"" he wrote. The 2016 election is likely to be dominated by political advice to Liberal and Labor not to provoke the voters. This will put Australia on a long-run trajectory of decline and growing unhappiness. There is broad agreement that frequent leadership changes are not good for Australia. But that is no guarantee that Abbott can and will survive to battle the next election. Indeed, Monday's vote suggests strongly he won't.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott survives a vote of no confidence in his own party by 61-39 .

"(CNN)For nearly two decades, ubiquitous access to the Internet has been the elusive dream of technologists, policymakers and ordinary users. But today, the prospect of worldwide, always-on and high-speed (or close to it) Internet communications is in sight, and could become a reality within a decade. The Internet has become the essential communications medium of our time. For students, Internet access is as crucial as textbooks and blackboards. For workers, it's hard to find a job, apply for public benefitsor participate in the global economy without basic connectivity. Creative solutions to problems such as how to provide efficient health care now assume users will be connected to the Internet, whether they're in an underserved neighborhood in Detroit or a remote village in Brazil. That's why achieving the goal of ubiquitous and affordable Internet access is more important than ever. In many cases, Internet access will grow naturally as increased demand and the economics of cheaper connectivity drive existing carriers and upstart providers to do more. But we also have to find new ways to deliver data. Rather than relying on a single technical breakthrough, we'll need a combination of solutions, from mobile broadband and low-cost DIY infrastructure to far-out ideas such as drones and balloons. So, what's on the menu? Fiber investment and undersea cables: We can expect to see more projects like Google Fiber, which promises to deliver gigabit speeds at reasonable prices, and the construction of massive new undersea cables that dramatically increase the transmission capability of networks. Cheap smartphones and mobile data plans: These will soon expand the Internet's footprint by billions of people, especially in parts of the world where wired networks have not been fully built out. Cognitive radio technologies: These tools can turn unused and ""junk"" spectrum into wireless superhighways far more powerful than today's Wi-Fi networks. Converted pay phones, weather balloons and drones: Engineers are looking at all of these as ways to bridge the ""last mile"" gap in hard-to-reach areas. With new technology and better use of the airwaves, it may soon be possible to blanket a rural area with high-speed wireless connections or enable a school to provide fast Internet access to the surrounding community without digging up the streets. No matter the technology, a critical piece of this revolution will be the growth of community-driven infrastructure. Communities are increasingly defining and building the next generation of Internet deployment to promote access and affordability. Long before Google Fiber was deployed, Chattanooga, Tennessee, built a gigabit fiber network for city residents and businesses to spur economic development and civic engagement. New York and San Francisco may not  compare favorably with Internet speeds in Asia and Europe, but cities like Chattanooga and Lafayette, Louisiana, which have invested in public broadband networks, are increasingly competitive. Communities from Berlin to Tunisia, Brooklyn and Detroit are also building and operating their own open source, wireless communications infrastructure, customized to meet local needs. Like the collectives that electrified rural areas of the United States in the 1900s, it is a local, bottom-up approach -- supported by policy frameworks promoting flexibility and grassroots innovation -- that will be the key path to 21st century Internet access. What's more, these locally-controlled networks can improve governance, foster a greater sense of community inclusion and offer more secure communications and greater resilience in the event of disasters like Hurricane Sandy. Better public policies will expedite progress. So what should governments do? Podcast: Make Internet everywhere a reality . Incentivize investment, encourage better use of spectrum, and allow local community build-out: Sometimes, governments stand in the way. For example, 20 states in the United States have laws that unbelievably ban cities from investing in their own public networks, prompting the Federal Communications Commission to consider removing these barriers. During the 2015 State of the Union, President Obama also urged the FCC to do so as part of his broader initiative to promote high-speed broadband investment. Make more spectrum available for unlicensed and innovative uses that support super Wi-Fi and community networks: We need to more spectrum to support Americans' ever-growing data consumption habit, but repurposing it all for exclusive use by cellphone carriers makes it harder for creative, local or unexpected solutions to connectivity challenges, which require access to the airwaves to succeed. Keep costs down to help promote adoption: Cost is a significant barrier to Internet adoption around the world -- not to mention here in the United States, where four out of five Americans who aren't online live below the poverty line -- which in turn slows down the virtuous cycle of infrastructure investment and innovation. Policies that encourage broadband competition can help bring down the cost of connectivity, which will be a boon to underserved areas. Anticipate new questions about free expression, governance, and individual choice: The next three billion netizens will come from widely varied political traditions. Their governments may have different ideas about the free flow of information or personal privacy. Clashes over Internet control have garnered attention in Thailand and Iran, but are also emerging around issues like hate speech and public safety from France to India.

"(CNN)Drew Peterson, the imprisoned former Chicago-area police sergeant found guilty of murdering his ex-wife, was charged Monday on two counts of murder solicitation. Between September 2013 and December 2014, Peterson allegedly hired someone to try to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, the prosecutor who won a conviction in 2012 that sent Peterson away for 38 years, according to the Illinois Attorney General's Office. It was unclear from court documents whether the alleged murder solicitation resulted in any attempt on Glasgow's life. Glasgow remains the state's attorney in Will County. In a statement, he said that he has ""absolute faith in law enforcement and our criminal justice system to handle this case appropriately."" ""It is unfortunate that prosecutors sometimes must deal with allegations of this nature. However, in no way will a threat to my personal safety deter me from the important work I perform as the State's Attorney on behalf of the citizens of Will County,"" said Glasgow. Peterson is imprisoned at Menard Correctional Center in Illinois' Randolph County. He made an initial appearance at the Randolph County Courthouse on Monday on one count of solicitation of murder for hire and one count of solicitation of murder. A call for comment to Peterson's attorney was not immediately returned. A preliminary hearing is set for March 3 at 10 a.m. local time, the attorney general's office said. The case will be jointly prosecuted by that office and the Randolph County state's attorney's office.

"Tokyo (CNN)After the deaths of two Japanese citizens at the hands of ISIS, Tokyo has stopped a journalist from traveling to Syria by confiscating his passport. It's the first time the Japanese government has taken such a step. But the journalist, Yuichi Sugimoto, has suggested it's a breach of his rights. ""Ministry officials and police officers told me that unless I returned my passport, I would be arrested,"" he told Japanese television. Sugimoto, a 58-year-old freelance photo journalist, said he challenged the officials over whether the confiscation conflicted with freedoms of expression, movement and the press. The Japanese Foreign Ministry said its officials, accompanied by police officers, visited Sugimoto's home in the city of Niigata on Saturday night. They asked him to surrender his passport, citing a provision in the passport law that refers to the protection of citizens' lives in emergencies. Japanese media reported that Sugimoto had been planning to leave Japan for Turkey later this month and then head across the border into Syria. The Foreign Ministry said that before Saturday's visit, officials had repeatedly asked Sugimoto to refrain from traveling to Syria, warning of the risk of capture by ISIS militants. ""We understand that the freedom of reporting, news gathering and travel should be respected as much as possible,"" Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Monday. ""But at the same time, the government has the extremely important duty to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens who travel or live abroad."" Suga cited ISIS' recent brutal killings of two Japanese hostages it was holding, the journalist Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa, an aspiring security contractor. ISIS has ""warned it will try to kill more Japanese,"" he said. The Islamic extremist group, which controls large areas of Syria and Iraq, has killed some of the other international hostages it has held, including two American journalists.

"(CNN)The man who 3-D printed and sold ""Left Shark"" figurines isn't going to bow down to requests from singer Katy Perry's lawyers to stop offering them. Fernando Sosa received a cease-and-desist letter last week from Perry's legal representatives, demanding that he stop selling figures based on one of the backup dancing sharks from her Super Bowl halftime show. Sosa, who typically prints and sells sculptures based on politicians, had said he was going to abide by the order because ""all this lawyer crap is very stressful."" On Monday, he announced that he had changed course, had retained legal counsel and was going to fight Team Perry. ""Usually when it comes to small business owners, when the lawyers come after you the outcome is usually pretty predictable. Lawyer sends you a threatening letter and in fear of legal action you do whatever the lawyer tells you to do,"" Sosa wrote in a blog post. ""I decided to finally take a stand and break the usual cycle of rolling over or giving into legal threats."" Sosa's reps claim, among other things, that costumes cannot be copyrighted and that the NFL may have had more control over the halftime show than Perry did, based on an interview she gave. ""Going ahead with these very dubious copyright claims will not benefit Katy Perry,"" Sosa's lawyer, Chris Sprigman, wrote in a letter to Perry's legal team. Sosa plans to keep selling the shark figures for the time being. Perry's lawyers have not responded to requests for comment.","Vendor of 3-D printed sharks plans to fight Katy Perry's cease-and-desist order .

"Prescott, Arizona (CNN)The days pass one after the other in Prescott, Arizona, without bringing any real answer about Kayla Mueller. For a year and half, Mueller's family in this idyllic town has lived with the knowledge that the Islamic militant group ISIS is holding the 26-year-old American aid worker. Publicly, they kept silent about her plight, with her captors threatening to execute her if the family spoke out. But on Friday, ISIS claimed that Mueller had been killed in a building that was hit during a Jordanian airstrike on Raqqa, the militants' de facto capital in Syria. ""Friday was a dark day,"" said Todd Geiler, a longtime friend of the family. ""Punched a hole through you. A big hole."" But ISIS offered no proof to back up its claim, other than an image of a building in rubble. The Muellers are holding out hope that she's still alive, imploring the militant group to contact them. ""We have sent you a private message and ask that you respond to us privately,"" her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, said in a statement Friday. ""You told us that you treated Kayla as your guest,"" they said. ""As your guest her safety and well-being remains your responsibility."" Jordan is openly disputing ISIS' claim about Mueller's fate. ""What we know about this terrorist organization is that they are liars when it comes to these things,"" said Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani. He questioned the extremist group's ability to identify Jordanian warplanes flying at high altitudes. But in Prescott, Mueller's family are staying out of the claims and counterclaims of what happened. ""At this time, they just want contact through the original channels,"" said Geiler. ""This is such a fluid situation, going hour to hour,"" he told CNN. Some observers have questioned why no militants died in the collapsed building, and why, if the building had just been struck, there was no smoke from smoldering debris. But others say they fear ISIS may have killed her previously and been waiting for an opportunity to announce the death. Jordan says it believes the militants killed one of its fighter pilots weeks before they released a video of him being burned to death. ISIS has made a big show of its barbaric killings of international hostages, including three Americans, two Britons and two Japanese citizens. The militants had threatened to kill Mueller last summer. They set a deadline of August 13, for a ransom of nearly $7 million to be paid to prevent her execution, according to a source close to the family. U.S. officials are investigating the theory that she may have died weeks or months ago and that ISIS was possibly ashamed to announce that they had killed a woman. But retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. James Reese says it's plausible a hostage may have been inadvertently killed in Syria. ""We all know that intelligence ... in Syria is not as good as we have in Iraq now,"" Reese said. ""So it is plausible, and it could be unfortunate. But sometimes ... that happens in these wars."" Like some of the other ISIS hostages, Mueller went to the Middle East to help the flood of refugees affected by Syria's grinding civil war. Since her teenage years, she had thrown herself into international causes. In high school, her local paper showed her marching through town as part of the Save Darfur coalition, lobbying members of Congress and staging silent protests against the genocide in western Sudan. As a student at Northern Arizona University, Mueller was president of a group called Stand, a student-led movement to end mass atrocities. After graduating, she joined aid agencies that took her to India, Israel and the Palestinian territories. She came home briefly in 2011, volunteering at a women's shelter and an AIDS clinic. But she couldn't ignore the unfolding crisis in Syria. ""I am in solidarity with the Syrian people. I reject the brutality and killing that the Syrian authorities are committing against the Syrian people,"" she said in a video posted online. In 2012, Mueller went to Syria with the Danish Refugee Council and Support to Life humanitarian agency. She fell into the hands of hostage takers in August 2013 in Aleppo, Syria, her family said, after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital. Her family heard nothing until 10 months later, when ISIS got in touch with its ransom demand. ""You have no control. You have to abide by the rules,"" Geiler said of the situation. ""It was a living hell, and it has been a living hell for the family, and it is today."" CNN's Kyung Lah contributed from Prescott, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Ben Brumfield and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","""It has been a living hell,"" a longtime friend of the family tells CNN .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN)Why did AirAsia Flight QZ8501 crash into the sea while the seven other planes flying nearby eventually landed safely? That's the big question on the mind of Indonesia's Transportation Minister as investigators finish preparing the initial report into the crash last month of the Airbus A320-200 with 162 passengers on board. ""The question is why this plane suddenly climbed"" from 32,000 feet to almost 38,000 feet ""without any information and any warning,"" Ignasius Jonan told CNN in an interview Monday. Jonan said none of the other planes in the area experienced the turbulent weather patterns that led the pilot of QZ8501 to request a change of course and an increase in altitude shortly before it disappeared off radar. Data provided by the Indonesian Transportation Ministry shows that less than three minutes after making that request, Flight QZ8501 began climbing sharply, rising nearly 6,000 feet in less than a minute. The plane then fell rapidly and disappeared off radar in the middle of the Java Sea. That sequence of events is based on radar and transponder information, not on the contents of the plane's flight data recorder. The analysis of the information from the data recorder, and the other so-called black box, the cockpit voice recorder, is expected to be part of the preliminary report that Indonesia is due to submit to international air safety regulators by January 28. The Transportation Minister told CNN that he wants to ensure the victims' families and the public are kept informed and that there's nothing hidden from them. But when asked if that meant he would release the preliminary report to the public, he said no. Jonan said he will urge investigators to release the final report as soon as possible. ""It won't be a year, that's my promise,"" he said. Jonan oversaw an investigation into why Flight QZ8501 was able to take off on a Sunday, even though AirAsia lacked permission to fly from Surabaya to Singapore on that day of the week. His inquiry discovered 60 other flights had been running without proper approvals. Those flights have been banned, he says, and ministry officials are now regularly checking the schedules. While he calls the issue of flights operating without permission a ""big worry,"" he says he believes it was unrelated to the crash of Flight QZ8501. He also says he thinks that this crash should not be seen as a permanent black mark against Indonesia's safety record. ""We run around 1,000 flights a day and 7000 flights a week,"" Jonan said.  ""And that's a lot of flights in the air of Indonesia. So one crashed unfortunately. So I would suggest it's not a big issue that can make everybody not fly in the air of Indonesia."" Journalist Masrur Jamaluddin contributed to this report.","Other planes in the area didn't experience turbulent weather, Transportation Minister says .
Officials don't plan to release the preliminary report to the public, he tells CNN ."
"Efforts to clean up a 168,000 gallons of thick, viscous oil that spilled into the Port of Houston near Galveston, Texas, stretched into a third day Tuesday, as wildlife rescuers sought to estimate the impact on birds and marine life. The spill, which occurred over the weekend after two vessels collided, has forced the closure of the heavily trafficked port, putting dozens of ships in limbo as they wait in a queue to enter and exit the waterway early Tuesday afternoon. The Houston Ship Channel was opened to limited barge traffic within the channel, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Andy Kendrick said, but the channel remained closed to all other vessels, and the vessels in the port were not allowed to leave. As of early Tuesday afternoon, 101 inbound and outbound vessels were stuck in the channel, Kendrick said. On Galveston Island, the cruise terminal is loaded with passengers waiting for ships docked at sea, while cruise ships waiting to get to port are stuck on the water. The U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies are evaluating whether portions of the busy shipping channel can be reopened, pending the ""skimming and booming"" efforts under way to contain the environmental disaster. Meanwhile, the Galveston Bolivar ferry has been granted permission to run amid efforts to clean the port and locate affected wildlife. According to authorities leading the joint effort to contain the spill, there have been 18 birds captured, 10 deceased, and eight ""oiled"" but not captured. There have also been sightings of oiled birds that have yet to be confirmed. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department personnel said they are continuing to look for affected wildlife in Bolivar Flats, which is considered a significant refuge for birds. ""Galveston Bay is one of America's greatest estuaries and an important home to Texas seafood providers and recreational fishermen as well as the entry point to the Port of Houston. While the area has long dealt with many pollution concerns, this spill is significant,"" said scientist Doug Rader of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. ""In the early stages of this spill much remains unknown, but for shrimp, blue crab, menhaden and other marine life, which rely on the bay as an essential nursery, further investigation and long-term monitoring within the footprint of this spill is necessary."" Approximately 15.5 miles of nonconsecutive shoreline have been impacted, and more than 750 people are working to resolve the spill, officials said. The Coast Guard said they will continue their investigation. After 25 years, Exxon Valdez oil spill hasn't ended . Gulf oil may be big trouble for big fish .

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN)Rashid Fouad Abdullah is a Kurdish peshmerga fighter in his late 50s, but he's younger than his gun. It's a British artillery piece manufactured in 1941, kept in immaculate condition and in daily service as Kurdish forces tighten their grip around Iraq's second city, Mosul. Abdullah is one of a few dozen peshmerga stationed on Mount Zartak, overlooking Mosul from the east. The city is still firmly under the control of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, but the peshmerga are in buoyant mood, having first stemmed and then partially reversed territorial gains made by ISIS last summer. They expect much more fighting ahead, and from the generals to the volunteers, they all lament a lack of modern weapons that would help them take on ISIS. Abdullah said he would have happily showed us how his old gun worked, but he had only 20 shells left. On Saturday, clutching AK-47s and more ancient rifles, Abdullah and his fellow fighters gazed into the sky and watched the arc of vapor trails as coalition planes hit ISIS targets all around Mosul. Kurdish fighters told us it was the heaviest day of bombardment they had witnessed. We heard well over a dozen loud detonations to the east, but their exact points of impact were difficult to determine through the haze. The peshmerga defensive positions on the mountain are well-fortified, with lines of sandbags and concrete bunkers, and a track carved into the mountain slopes for access. The Kurdish flag -- red, white and green horizontal stripes with a 21-point yellow sun -- flutters above. The fighters said that ISIS occasionally launched Katyusha rockets at their positions, but most fell short. The situation of peshmerga on the plains below is more precarious. There are ISIS positions to the east and south. CNN witnessed an exchange of fire between the two sides at the weekend, with ISIS shooting from an abandoned cement plant just 500 yards away and the peshmerga firing back with heavy machine guns. They have placed large concrete barriers across the highway, once the main road between Irbil and Mosul, but they are vulnerable to mortar fire and Humvees converted into devastating suicide bombs. The commander said he'd asked for airstrikes time and again, but nothing had happened. The Kurds say they are short of essential equipment such as night-vision goggles. Most infiltration attempts by ISIS come at night or in thick fog. Along one stretch of their defenses, peshmerga have rigged up floodlights to try to detect movement at night, but they don't provide much coverage. Gen. Sirwan Barzani, a son of the President of Kurdistan, Massoud Barzani, told CNN his troops needed heavy machine guns, anti-tank missiles and armored vehicles above all else. They say 70% of the 1,000 peshmerga killed in the current conflict have been the victims of improvised bombs. ISIS has rigged villages with dozens of such devices before falling back, some of them ingeniously designed to avoid all but the most forensic inspection. Kurdish fighters have begun building their own armored vehicles. One -- on the front line southwest of Irbil -- looked like a collision between a carnival float and something out of ""Mad Max,"" a monstrous contraption of steel plates laid on the chassis of a truck. The Kurds -- highly regarded warriors themselves -- have been struck by the tenacity and skill of their enemy. One senior commander called them ""very professional and well-trained,"" noting the complex attack launched from four directions on Kirkuk at the end of January. ISIS' ability to rig up quickly and detonate explosives has destroyed bridges across the region -- among them a modern concrete bridge on the main highway between Irbil and Mosul now reduced to slabs. Some of the peshmerga, who are at the front lines on two-week rotations, are grandfathers fighting their third or fourth war. Near the village of Gwer, we met Said Mahmoud, a fighter sporting a moustache straight out of colonial India and the traditional white and red checkered headscarf. ""I am too old for this,"" he said with a laugh -- and then pointed toward a sandbank in a nearby river where ISIS fighters had several times crossed at night. ""A couple of nights ago, it was raining,"" he said. ""They crossed the river by boat. We fought them until the morning. When our reinforcements arrived, we forced them to the other side of the river. Aircraft were attacking them."" The Kurds have built a modern-day version of Hadrian's Wall along a stretch of territory more than 100 miles long, with bunkers on hilltops, fences and deep trenches designed to keep out ISIS' Humvee suicide bombs. Some of these vehicles are captured and briskly converted for use by the peshmerga. ""We are getting American weaponry,"" joked one fighter. ""It was given by the Americans to the Iraqi army, and when they fled, ISIS took it. Now we are taking it from ISIS."" Kirkuk is an oil-rich city, home to nearly a million Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen and long a fault line in Iraq's ethnic mosaic. It's also a target for ISIS. At the end of January while using fog for cover, the group launched an attack on the city from four directions, taking several bridges on the outskirts. It took two days of heavy fighting by peshmerga, supported by airstrikes, to repel the offensive. Fatih Muhammad, the Kurdish commander in the area, expects another assault. Without the peshmerga presence, he insists, the city would fall to ISIS within hours. For now, the two sides are separated only by a narrow canal. The black flag of ISIS can be seen clearly on the other side. The Kurds have established a line of fortifications; earthmovers scramble to dig deeper and more defensible positions. Just behind them are hastily dug graves for some of the dozens of ISIS fighters killed in the recent battle. In the city, there is an uneasy but peaceful sharing of duties between the peshmerga and the Iraqi police and army. But there's no doubt who holds the upper hand. While Iraqi police sport new Ford Taurus cars in green and yellow livery, many seem restricted to traffic duty. The peshmerga race through Kirkuk and its surroundings in pickups, and other traffic keeps a respectful distance. The soldiers wave at peshmerga checkpoints but pass Iraqi positions without acknowledgment. Kurdish security officials told CNN they are sure ISIS has cells inside Kirkuk, waiting for orders to launch suicide attacks, as they did two weeks ago on an abandoned hotel used by local police. While the Kurds see Kirkuk as very much their city, few expect or want to be involved in cleansing Mosul of ISIS. It is principally a Sunni Arab city, and the Kurds have no desire to spill their own blood for a place they don't regard as theirs. They don't expect the Iraqi security forces, now being retrained and rebuilt, to be ready for such an offensive before the summer. In the meantime, they are intent on strangling ISIS in Mosul by cutting off its freedom of movement and resupply from Syria. They have surrounded it on three sides, with an inner and outer ring of positions. The Iraqi army, supported by Shia militia, is involved in combat in Anbar province, far to the west, and has pushed ISIS units out of Diyala, to the north of Baghdad. But in this part of Iraq, the peshmerga -- supported by airstrikes of growing intensity -- are the ones inflicting real damage on ISIS. And once the terrorists are defeated, the Kurds might be in no mood to compromise on their hard-won gains. Ministers, soldiers and ordinary civilians speak of Iraq becoming a loose confederation, but taking orders from Baghdad is not on their agenda. Ten years ago when I first visited Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish Regional Government, it was a bustling but provincial town. Now dozens of cranes dot the skyline as apartment blocks and office complexes are built. A new ring road is being constructed. Oil is the basis for this new-found wealth, but construction and trading companies are also flourishing. Electricity and water flow uninterrupted. Flights from Europe and the Middle East arrive daily at the new airport. ""Soon this will be like Dubai, but in the mountains,"" said one Irbil resident -- without a hint of hyperbole. But first the enemy that a few months back was just 20 miles from the gates of this city must be vanquished. Violence flares after Baghdad's decade-old curfew lifted .","In northern Iraq, Kurds are taking the lead in keeping ISIS at bay .

"Port au Prince, (CNN) -- The guard wearing a Haitian Football Federation T-shirt paces nervously in front of the heavy, blue steel door, his pump-action shotgun held tightly in his right hand. He presses his finger against the trigger when anyone bangs loudly on the metal to enter the Stad Sylvio Cator in downtown Port au Prince, pulling the door slowly open and gingerly peering his head out to see who it is. Usually they are met with a firm volley of abuse in Creole, but this time it is the guests he has been expecting. The Haitian national football team bus has arrived for training the day before one of the most important matches in the team's history: a 2014 World Cup qualifier against the minnows of the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is also the country's first home football match since as many as 300,000 people were killed when a massive 7.0 earthquake reduced much of the city to rubble. ""It's 46 degrees on the pitch, we just measured it,"" lamented the team's Brazilian coach Edson Tavares. It is three in the afternoon, the same time the match is due to be played 24-hours later. ""It's crazy. FIFA [football's world governing body] agreed to move the match to this time. CONCACAF [the governing body for the Caribbean] said no. What do they know? They work out of New York and know nothing about the heat in the Caribbean."" But the change in time was a necessity as much for the Haitians as anyone else. Electricity is scarce in the city, too scarce for the expensive but impotent flood lights that had been installed. Soccer salvation: How Haiti is healing after its earthquake . Haitian football, like virtually every aspect of Haitian society, was almost terminally injured when the earthquake hit in January 2010. The Haitian Football Federation's headquarters were leveled, killing more than 30 of its staff. Its president, Yves Jean Bart, was one of only two survivors. The stadium itself had become, like any other scrap of spare space in Port au Prince, a makeshift camp. Hundreds of families lived here until being moved out in July when a new pitch was laid. A torn blue ribbon of despair still surrounds it. Workers busily paint the steps inside blue, yellow and red -- the colors of the Haitian flag -- to erase the memory of its temporary incarnation. The smell is of paint, excrement from the nearby open sewers and burning trash. The HFF president, knowing that the game has such a place in Haiti's heart, went on to rebuild the federation and hired Tavares to achieve the dream of emulating Haiti's golden generation who qualified for the 1974 World Cup. ""My first impression was to take my flight back to Brazil,"" Tavares explains a few hours before traveling to the stadium. ""The country was completely devastated. Today is a paradise compared. If you compare with last year ... you could be walking the street and find the [severed] legs of people, the arms of people."" Tavares began by paying for his own flight to Europe, where he hired a car and visited the professional players of Haitian descent who play on the continent. ""I rented a car to travel to five countries to persuade the players to play for his original country. Only one refused. We contacted 20 players. And they are here. Most of them don't speak Creole. One only speaks Italian. One only German."" The squad for the U.S. Virgin Islands' game was full of talented new professionals gleaned from the diaspora, like Jean-Eudes Maurice who is on Paris Saint-Germain's books and goalkeeper Steward Ceus, a New Yorker born and raised who plays for the Colorado Rapids. ""I was in college when I heard a buzz about Haiti being interested in seeing me,"" explains Ceus, whose grandmother used to be a baker for the former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Soccer storm in the Caribbean: How diplomacy faltered over football . ""Coming here left me speechless. The fans come after training, before training, crowding around the bus. My passion for soccer has always been there and I always wished that the people around me shared that passion. For the first time I found the passion I've been looking for."" Yet sometimes passion isn't enough and Tavares hopes that the professionalism of his new team will rub off on the local players, who he believes are some of the most talented in the world. ""I have never seen a country with so many talents as here,"" he says. ""If you put these guys in Manchester United and Barcelona, they would be great player[s]. The problem is to be a great player you need good food and a good environment. Here is nothing."" On the morning of the match the country's president Michel Martelly, a former singer known as ""Sweet Micky"", arrives to meet the players. He shakes each by the hand, presents them with a flag and sings the national anthem together. ""I believe there's a new movement. There's a new will to show a new face of Haiti,"" he says. ""Haiti is ready to show that new face. In the past we talk about our problems and issues. But today is a chance to prove that today Haiti can be a great nation and can be victorious. I couldn't express in words what Haiti would be like if ... when, not if, we qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil."" As kick off approaches 10,000 Haitians, maybe more, try and fail to crush through the single open door into the stadium at the same time. A police blockade had been thrown around the stadium. Creole rap music is played at ear-splitting level. The crowd push forward in the hope of getting in, the police use shields and clubs to beat them back. It's chaos, but such is the passion for football in Haiti, that a match against a tiny team like the U.S. Virgin Islands brings the country to a standstill. ""I am very happy, we will have our victory. This will be a victory for all of Haiti,"" explains Johnny, a 28-year-old engineer and translator waiting in line behind the crowd, which had by now threatened to get out of control. But then the rain comes, just in time to dampen the anger as the fans run to take cover. ""Life is very hard here,"" Johnny adds. ""With God everything is possible. But this is the reason why football can change something. I hope Haiti scores ten goals."" Haiti tear the U.S. Virgin Islands apart. Six goals are scored, the post is hit three times, sending the crowd delirious. Ceus is a virtual spectator until the final whistle. ""I did touch the ball once,"" he says with a wink as he comes off the pitch. ""But not with my hands."" There is a long way to go. Tougher tests lie ahead. On Tuesday they play Curacao. Next, perhaps Jamaica or Mexico or the dream ticket: USA. But, for now, Les Grenadiers brought something to Haiti that has been in short supply for so long: hope. ""I feel so happy to see what happened in the country and to see all the Haitians come to the game. It was incredible,"" says James Marcelin, the Portland Timbers player who scored in the rout. ""We only have one thing left, and that's football. You can play and all the world is watching you. The flag can fly everywhere because of football. It's the one thing that people live for now.""","Haiti prepare for the 2014 World Cup qualifier against minnows U.S. Virgin Islands .

"(CNN)North Korea tested what it described as a new type of ""cutting-edge"" anti-ship missile with its leader Kim Jong Un pictured beaming at the launch, as shown in state media on Saturday. But some analysts are saying North Korea's touted missiles appear to be Russian designs. The announcement of the test also occurs just weeks before the annual joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, that annually draws colorful rhetoric and promises of catastrophe from Pyongyang. The test-firing took place in the East Sea and the North Korean media boasted that its ""intelligent rocket precisely sought, tracked and hit the 'enemy' ship after taking a safe flight."" The South Korean Defense ministry said five short-range missiles were fired on Sunday with a range of 200 kilometers (124 miles). The purpose of the new missiles are for North Korea to defend its waters and ""strongly react to any attempt of the enemy's fleets of warships for military attack, through close combat or distant combat,"" according to North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency. North Korean media also showed a beaming Kim standing with military generals who were applauding. It also reported that Kim expressed ""satisfaction"" over the ""highest level"" of rockets being developed in North Korea. But that point is being disputed, as one analytical officer wrote the weapon appeared to be a Russian Kh-35E anti-ship cruise missile. ""Whether the KPN (Korean People's Navy) acquired the system directly from Russia or a third party is unclear,"" wrote Joseph S. Bermudez  in the North Korea analysis site, 38 North. ""Should the new system be successfully integrated into the KPN and widely deployed it would represent a significant step towards redressing the service's obsolescence and increasing the threat poised to South Korean and U.S. Navy vessels in the region."" Bermudez also cautioned that this was only a ""potential development"" as North Korea's military has a ""long history of slow and often poor system integration."" This year, North Korea has made the usual protestations of the joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which it has referred in the past as ""joint saber-rattling."" It offered a nuclear moratorium earlier this year in exchange for canceling the joint exercises. But the U.S. rejected the proposal, with a State Department spokeswoman calling it a ""false choice."" Through KCNA, North Korea has since denounced U.S. with its colorful slogans as: ""Let's wipe out and annihilate the enemy and give death to him!"" and warning that the U.S. ""imperialists will face final doom."" After the Korean War, which ended with an armistice in 1953, the U.S. has maintained military personnel in South Korea. Based on a mutual defense treaty, the countries have carried out annual joint military exercises between U.S. units and South Korean armed forces, that they say are defensive in nature.

"(CNN)Would sending weapons to Ukraine block Russia from grabbing territory and stem violence in the volatile region? Or would it fuel further conflict and destabilize Europe? That's a key issue Western leaders are weighing. And even as they tried to present a unified front at a press briefing Monday, it was clear that it's an area where U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel don't quite see eye to eye. Obama said he hasn't decided yet whether to send arms to Ukrainian forces defending their country against Russian-backed separatists, and he hasn't set a deadline for when he will. But he insists it's an option that should be considered if diplomacy fails. Any weapons the U.S. sends would not be meant to help Ukraine defeat the Russian army in an all-out battle, Obama said. ""Our goal has not been for Ukraine to be equipped to carry out offensive operations,"" he said, ""but to simply defend itself."" Merkel said European diplomats are making ""one further effort"" at negotiating a deal. A key step is in the works: a possible meeting Wednesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. ""I've always said I don't see a military solution to this conflict,"" she said. ""We have to put all our efforts in bringing about a diplomatic solution."" Both Obama and Merkel stressed the importance of working together. ""There may be some areas where there are tactical disagreements. There may not be.  But the broad principle that we have to stand up for ... the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty is one where we are completely unified,"" he said. Western leaders cannot stand idly by ""and simply allow the borders of Europe to be redrawn at the barrel of a gun,"" Obama said. Merkel said the strong alliance between Europe and the United States would thrive despite any differences. Russia's incursions on Ukraine's borders, she said, are too dangerous for Europe to tolerate. ""I can only say that if we give up on this principle of territorial integrity of countries, then we will not be able to maintain the peaceful order of Europe that we've been able to achieve,"" she said. Of course, those borders have already been redrawn once in the conflict. Last year, Ukrainian and U.S. officials say Russia flooded Crimea with troops ahead of its widely disputed annexation of the territory. Russia has steadfastly denied accusations that it's sending forces and weapons into Ukraine. But top Western and Ukrainian leaders have said there isn't any doubt that Russia is behind surging violence and separatists' efforts to take over territory in eastern Ukraine. Merkel in the middle of a U.S.-Russia standoff . Representatives of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France were making preparations Monday for a planned meeting Wednesday in Minsk, Belarus, to discuss efforts to reach a ceasefire. If those talks fail, U.S. lawmakers will likely ratchet up pressure on Obama to send weapons to Ukraine. But even that gathering, which could be a significant meeting between Putin and Poroshenko, isn't set in stone. ""We are planning for Wednesday if we succeed in settling the various points that we have discussed so intensively over these last days,"" Putin said Sunday. The big challenge facing Putin, Poroshenko, Merkel and French President Francois Hollande is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick. A peace agreement was signed in September in Minsk. It called for a drawback of heavy weapons, self-rule in the eastern regions and a buffer zone to be set up along the Russia-Ukraine border. But the agreement quickly disintegrated, and the violence continued. The new plan envisions a much broader demilitarized zone to run along the current front lines. All the while, the crisis in Ukraine, which stemmed from a trade agreement, has killed more than 5,000 people, including many civilians. At least 224 civilians were killed in the final three weeks of January alone, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said. CNN's Holly Yan, Mike Pearson and Catherine E. Shoichet reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN)The historic end of Baghdad's decade-old curfew was marred by more violence a day afterward -- highlighting the security challenges that still plague Iraq. The curfew, which was in place nightly, was lifted at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. The move represents the first time the curfew, aimed at stymying violence in Baghdad, has been completely lifted since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. But in the hours leading up to the curfew removal, 11 people were killed in a pair of suicide attacks in Baghdad, a police source told CNN. At least 30 people were killed in a bombing at a restaurant, and six people were killed when an assailant detonated explosives at a busy market. While Sunday marked a day or relative calm after the curfew was lifted, violence erupted once again early Monday morning. A suicide bomber targeted a popular restaurant in northwestern Baghdad early Monday morning, killing at least 12 people and wounding 42, Baghdad police officials told CNN. And in northeastern Baghdad, an improvised explosive device detonated on a busy street, killing one person and wounding another four. Both the attacks Monday took place during the overnight hours that previously would have been subject to curfew. And both took place in primarily Shiite neighborhoods. No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks. But more and more, civilians are falling victim to deadly violence in the country. The infiltration of ISIS in the past year contributed to a staggering civilian death toll in 2014: at least 17,049, according to Iraq Body Count. That number is roughly double the number recorded in 2013 -- which was about double the number from of the previous year. Kurdish fighters battle equipment woes as well as ISIS in northern Iraq .

"(CNN)Sunday night's midseason premiere of ""The Walking Dead"" saw the heart-wrenching loss of another fan favorite character, soon after Beth died in the previous episode. Tyreese (Chad L. Coleman), who had tried to maintain some morality in the nightmarish postapocalyptic world, fell victim to a walker bite halfway through the show and struggled to stay alive as Noah went for help. Tyreese was haunted by visions of his friends Beth, Bob, Lizzie and Mika, who told him this was how it had to be and all would be OK. The Governor and Terminus character Martin also showed up in his mind to taunt him, making him lose touch with reality as he was attacked by a second walker, and later as Rick, Michonne, Glenn and Noah cut off his bitten arm. It was a sad farewell to yet another character who tried to stand up for what was right, as the now-dead Dale and Hershel had, and one couldn't help but be touched by the sight of Tyreese's hat at his gravesite. Some fans were surprised by the turn of events. But the plot twist didn't get approval from everyone. After so many deaths lately and the group still determined to push on to Washington, one can only wonder who will be next to go.","Beloved characters have been dying left and right on ""Walking Dead""

"Former California tech executive Carly Fiorina has hired a top Republican National Committee spokeswoman to join her political action committee, another signal she is taking steps toward a bid for the White House later this year, CNN has learned. Sarah Isgur Flores, the RNC's deputy communications director, will leave the party group for Fiorina's super PAC, Unlocking Potential, starting Monday. A Harvard Law School-educated attorney, she previously worked as the political director for Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's campaign and advised presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Should Fiorina transition the PAC's operations into a presidential campaign, Isgur Flores would serve as deputy campaign manager, according to the PAC. ""Carly Fiorina is a sharp, thoughtful and committed conservative leader who believes in the limitless potential of all Americans, and I'm looking forward to getting started,"" Flores said in an emailed statement.

"Allegations of endemic doping within Russian athletics revealed in a German documentary are to be investigated by the World Anti-Doping Authority. The Das Erste documentary broadcast by ZDF/ARD alleged Russian officials covered up positive drugs tests in return for financial reward, that athletes traveled under assumed names to avoid doping programs and if they had failed tests they wouldn't be allowed to compete in major events. According to the English transcript, provided by Das Erste, former Russia discus thrower Evgenia Pecherina -- currently serving a 10-year doping ban -- alleged in an interview for the program that ""most of"" Russian athletes were doping. She told ""Secret Doping Dossier: How Russia produces its Winners:"" The greater part. 99%. And you get absolutely anything. Everything the athlete wants. And the shorter the period it can be detected, the more expensive the product."" The World Anti-Doping Authority, or WADA, said it had seen the allegations and ""will ensure that all matters raised are fully investigated. ""WADA has in fact already received some information and evidence of the type exposed in the documentary,"" the anti-doping organization said in a statement. ""All of that information has been passed to the appropriate independent body within the international federation, the IAAF,"" added the WADA statement, referring to the International Association of Athletics Federations, the governing body for athletics. ""We will await the outcome of that independent body's deliberations. The anti-doping body promised that if ""action is warranted, WADA will take any necessary and appropriate steps under the Code."" The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) announced it would also be launching an investigation into the allegations Friday. However, the day before Russian athletics federation president Valentin Balakhnichev, who is also the treasure of the IAAF, told Reuters news agency the documentary's allegations were a ""pack of lies."" Russia came top of the medal table at the winter Olympics in Sochi this year and of their tested athletes none provide positive tests. One of the athletes interviewed in the one-hour documentary, Liliya Shobukhova -- a former Chicago and London marathon winner -- alleges she paid the Russian Athletics Federation hundreds of thousands of dollars to cover up ""abnormal blood values"" and as a bribe to compete in the 2012 Games. ""It all started at the end of 2011, in December,"" Shobukhova tells the program on camera, according to the transcript sent to CNN. ""The Russian Athletics Federation approached us. They told us that we could have problems -- that participating at the 2012 Olympic Games was endangered. ""And now we would have to pay 150,000 Euros to solve these problems. Then I could take part in the Olympic Games. I have dedicated my whole life to preparing for the Olympic Games."" By the next summer, Shobhukhova says she paid a total of 450,000 euros in bribes, according to the documentary. Earlier this year the Russian Athletics Federation handed Shobukhova a two-year ban after her biological passport -- a method used to monitor any potential doping violations -- showed ""abnormal haematological curves."" Many of the claims made within the program come from Vitaliy Stepanov, a former official at RUSADA and his wife, Yuliya, a former runner who was banned for doping. Vitaly Stepanov worked for RUSADA between 2008 and 2011, but he and his wife have now left Russia, according to the documentary. ""In a training camp in Portugal, our athletes simply lived under false names,"" Yuliya told the documentary, according to the transcript CNN has been given. ""They have taken banned substances, they undertook a course of doping, and to ensure that foreign control officers did not come and test them, they provided false names. ""When we were in Kyrgyzstan in a training camp, I was supposed to start a course of tablets on 15 November. A coach asked me, 'Have you got clean urine?' I said to him: 'No, you should have told me about that before.' ""Then he said: 'Fill some in here in advance, so that you have some if the control officers come here.' I then did what he had said and I had a container in the freezer with clean urine. However Grigory Rodchenkov, the director of Moscow's doping control lab, told investigative journalist Hajo Seppelt, who worked on the documentary: ""You should be very careful to believe cheaters. Because they have the catastrophe of their life."" The Russian government funds and oversees the Russian Athletics Federation, RUSADA and the national doping test laboratory. The IOC told CNN that it is now awaiting a report from the IAAF. ""These are very serious allegations and the IOC will not hesitate to take all necessary steps,"" an IOC spokeswoman told CNN in a statement. ""The IOC Ethics Commission has already been in contact with IAAF independent Ethics Commission which has begun an investigation. The IOC Ethics Commission has asked to be kept fully informed of any issues that could fall under its jurisdiction and for which future action may be necessary."" According to the latest IAAF report, Russia currently has 68 athletes banned for doping offenses. In a statement on its website, the IAAF revealed that its ethics commission would be examining the allegations. ""The IAAF has noted a number of grave allegations regarding doping activities related to the sport of athletics in Russia, which have been broadcast on the German TV channel ZDF/ARD on 3 December 2014,"" read the statement. ""An investigation by the IAAF Ethics Commission is already ongoing with respect to some of the allegations made in the documentary. ""We would like to underline that the IAAF Ethics Commission is completely independent of the IAAF and has full powers to investigate and issue sanctions when relevant. ""A transcript in English of the German TV documentary has been forwarded to the Ethics Commission.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented a united stance with Haitian President Rene Preval during her visit Saturday to the quake-battered capital. Clinton, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the country since Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake, sought to assure the Haitian people that the United States is working with the government ""to assist in every way we can."" ""We are here at the invitation of your government to help you,"" she said. ""As President Obama has said, we will be here today, tomorrow and for the time ahead."" Clinton said she and Preval will issue a joint communique Sunday ""setting forth our intention to cooperate together."" Clinton arrived in Haiti via a U.S. Coast Guard plane Saturday afternoon and immediately went into meetings with Preval, Rajiv Shah, the director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and other U.S. officials already on the ground. Get the latest developments in Haiti . ""We had a very good meeting about all of the priorities of the Haitian government and the Haitian people,"" Clinton said after a brief news conference following the meetings. She said air efforts are focused on providing water, food and medical help. She also stressed the importance of restoring the country's communications networks, electricity and transportation. ""We agreed that we will be coordinating closely together to achieve these goals."" In an interview with CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, Clinton said ""every day we are making progress and I expect that to continue."" In addition to the immediate needs, Clinton said the focus will switch next week to long-term recovery and reconstruction, telling Gupta she believed that Haiti, with the help of the international community, could be a better place than it was before Tuesday's quake. The U.S. Coast Guard plane she arrived on was carrying 100 cases of water, 100 cases of meals-ready-to-eat, and food and toiletries for about 140 U.S. Embassy staff members. Fifty Americans, who have been waiting to be evacuated, will fly back to the United States when Clinton departs. Clinton landed hours after President Obama announced Saturday that former Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush have agreed to lead an effort to raise funds for Haiti. Frustrations continued to mount in the earthquake-pummeled country as survivors remained in dire need of food, water and medical aid. One medical official warned that a third of the patients at a makeshift hospital -- one of many being erected in open fields, abandoned stadiums and empty warehouses around the capital -- were in need of immediate surgery, and could die without it. ""They will die of infections, they'll die of dead tissue, they'll die of malnutrition and metabolic derangements,"" Dr. Jennifer Furin with the Harvard Medical School said of the roughly 300 patients at the hospital on a U.N. compound near Port-au-Prince's airport. Elsewhere, a food drop by U.S. helicopters in Port-au-Prince became a chaotic scene as hundreds of Haitians without food and water for four days rushed the boxes of aid being shoved out of the open doors. A similar scene erupted Friday when a food convoy with the World Food Programme was forced to leave an area after men in the crowd starting pushing and shoving their way to the trucks. Impact Your World . Amid the chaos, there were signs of progress: more aid distribution sites and hospitals, a system for identifying the dead and even more survivors rescued from the ruins of buildings. U.S. troops handed out about 2,500 meals in Petionville on Saturday and 14 aid distribution points had been established. The Israel Defense Forces began operating a field hospital at an abandoned soccer field, and the U.S. Naval Hospital Ship Comfort, staffed by a crew of 64 and 560 hospital personnel, left the Baltimore Harbor on a trip that will take about five days. Increasingly, Haitians were seen helping Haitians. One local church was able to scrounge up some potato chips, bottled water and juice to hand out. Local authorities were seen setting up a makeshift clinic on a street corner in Port-au-Prince with one doctor and a couple of tables and folding chairs. U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Edmond Mulet said common grave sites were being created for the thousands of victims, calling mass graves discovered by CNN crews Friday ""not very dignified."" He said the dead will be photographed in hopes of providing identification for families. While there has not been an official count of the dead, Mulet said the number of casualties in the capital, which has a population of 3 million, ranges from 100,000 to 150,000. He said Friday 13,000 bodies had been recovered so far. The State Department has put the American death toll at 15 so far. U.S. officials said search and rescue operations will continue through the weekend. As of Saturday afternoon, 22 people had been rescued since Tuesday from collapsed buildings by U.S. urban search and rescue teams. At least one man was pulled from the rubble on Saturday and other crews were working to reach others. Tapping noises were heard at a collapsed day-care center, but later stopped. One trapped person apparently was sending text messages from beneath a collapsed bank. Meanwhile, the Port-au-Prince airport remained overwhelmed by the influx of air traffic bringing in supplies and efforts continued to clear the roads. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who confirmed Saturday the deaths of the top two civilian officials at Haiti's U.N. mission, was to arrive in the capital Sunday. On Friday, the United Nations said that at least 37 U.N. personnel have died -- 36 with the U.N. mission and one with the World Food Programme. The number of unaccounted for U.N. people exceeded 300. There are 12,000 people working for U.N. entities in Haiti.

Newcastle held on to a satisfying 2-1 home win despite seeing Stephen Taylor sent off for a second bookable offense and a late header from Chelsea striker Didier Droga. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho might also be seeing red after his side's first Premier League defeat in 265 days.

"Washington (CNN)If Sen. Bernie Sanders were the director of the Lego Movie, whose catchy song blares, ""Everything is awesome,"" the animated film's title track would have been decidedly less upbeat. For Sanders, everything in the United States isn't awesome -- far from it, in fact. ""I know that people aren't comfortable when I say this, but I worry very, very much of the future of democracy in our country,"" said the Vermont independent, speaking at the Brookings Institution on Monday. Sanders is known for highlighting what he sees as the ills that plague the United States in speeches and interviews. He regularly decries the amount of money in politics, frets about the growing income inequality gap and attacks the ""greed, recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street."" But Monday's was down even more dour than usual. Sanders said former President Abraham Lincoln's vision of ""government of the people, by the people, for the people,"" was not only ""perishing"" but ""coming to an end."" Instead, Sanders argued the United States was becoming a country ""of the billionaires, by the billionaires, for the billionaires"" who are now able to ""purchase the candidates of their choice."" ""The most serious problem we face is the grotesque and growing level of wealth and income inequality,"" Sanders said. ""This is a profound moral issue, this is an economic issue and this is a political issue."" After a 30-minute prepared speech, one questioner joked that Sanders wasn't laying out a positive agenda like Ronald Reagan's ""morning in America."" Moderator E.J. Dionne quickly joked it was more like ""mourning in America."" ""I have been trying to be more cheerful,"" he said, adding that his wife jokingly says he should hand out ""tranquilizers and anti-suicide kits,"" after he speaks. The senator, who is entertaining a 2016 presidential run, wasn't without ideas to combat these problems, though. Sanders urged breaking up big banks, backed a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure and proposed making college free to anyone who wants it. He also urged raising taxes on Wall Street -- whose business is based on ""fraud and deception"" -- and passing ""real tax reform"" to pay for his plans. He also came out against Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu's upcoming speech to Congress. ""I am not going,"" he said. The speech has rankled some in the White House because it did not follow traditional protocols for foreign leaders visiting the United States. The message, however dour, seemed to connect. After the event, people could be heard asking about the senators presidential aspirations and urging him to run. Sanders will travel to key presidential states like Iowa and New Hampshire in the coming months where he will take this message on the road. If he runs, Sanders will likely face Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Clinton is ""a woman I respect, clearly a very intelligent person who I think is interested in issues,"" Sanders said, adding that if he challenges her, he hopes to have a debate over climate change, the war in Iraq and other issues. ""It is not my style to trash people,"" Sanders said, hinting that he wouldn't go negative if he runs.","Sen. Bernie Sanders was dour on the state of the United States in a speech on Monday .

It was a long, hard decision, but this isn't a goodbye, but rather a see you later. ""I feel like a footballer still and I will keep on playing but I will always be loyal to Real Madrid. I have tried to give everything in my time here. ""A new period starts today. I have been happy at Real Madrid and I will always be willing to help the club in whatever it needs."" Tributes poured into Raul from his teammates, including Cristiano Ronaldo who told the club's official website: ""Playing by Raul's side has been an honor. I always dreamed of doing so as a kid."" New Real captain Iker Casillas added: ""Raul is a symbol of Real Madrid. A great captain is defined by ups and downs, knowing how to always make the best of any situation. ""Raul is an example of professionalism and he helped me grow as a player and person. The incredible histories of clubs are written by great footballers, and Raul is one of them."" Real president Florentino Perez said: ""We will never forget Raul. There are many men who form part of the legend of Real Madrid but few that are chosen to embody the club - Raul is one of those."" Meanwhile, Raul's former Real Madrid teammate Guti has signed a two-year deal with Besiktas, the Turkish club have confirmed on their website. The 33-year-old joined the youth academy aged just nine and made his debut for Real in 1995. He went on to make 542 appearances, scoring 77 goals. Besiktas, based in the Turkish capital Istanbul, finished fourth in the league last season and play the first-leg of their Europa League third qualifying round tie this Thursday.","Raul leaves Spanish giants Real Madrid after 18 years at the club .

"Despite Republicans' claims that they're going to shorten the 2016 primary process, the contest is already under way. At the end of March, potential Republican presidential candidates Chris Christie, Scott Walker and Jeb Bush were among those who rushed to Las Vegas to compete in the first primary for an all-important constituency of one: billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. In 2012, Adelson and his wife, Miriam, spent at least $93 million backing Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney and other Republicans in their effort to defeat President Obama and Democrats at every level. These candidates are all too eager to try to court and please the likes of Adelson, who's trying to buy the White House. But the problem's not just that Adelson is writing blank checks to the candidates of his choosing. The problem is that Adelson and other super-wealthy Republican donors are directing their largesse to buy elected officials who support policies that benefit their bottom lines at the expense of middle-class American families. People like Sheldon Adelson support candidates who are in favor of lowering tax rates for corporations and the super-wealthy -- people like Sheldon Adelson. But those tax giveaways aren't free. Rep. Paul Ryan's House GOP budget pays for those tax breaks by gutting funding for investments in education and infrastructure, ending Medicare as we know it, and raising taxes on middle-class families with children. Sheldon Adelson's not alone. The billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and their allies have given hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Republican candidates and causes. And their focus isn't limited to the White House, or even House and Senate seats. They're opening their checkbook to tip the scales in local races in towns and neighborhoods across the country. The Washington Post and The New York Times report that the Koch brothers are investing resources in local races, such as county board and small-town mayoral elections. They're exerting their influence in debates over local issues such as property taxes. It's a tall task to stand up to, especially when people like the Kochs are spending with no end in sight. Even Gingrich, whose 2012 candidacy was kept alive month after month by Adelson, is now turning on his former patron and his ilk: . ""Whether it's the Koch brothers or (George) Soros on the left or Sheldon (Adelson),"" Gingrich told the National Journal, ""if you're going to have an election process that radically favors billionaires and is discriminating against the middle class — which we now have — then billionaires are going to get a lot of attention."" According to a George Washington University Battleground Poll, about half of Americans know who the Koch brothers are. Considering the lengths that they have gone to keep their involvement in local affairs secret, that figure is a victory for watchdogs and government sunshine groups, not to mention Democrats. But it's alarming for anyone disturbed by their ability to exert disproportionate influence with millions of dollars that represent little more than pocket change to them. The Koch brothers are legally allowed to flood ""dark money"" into your town, influencing who represents you in Congress or the Senate, or who sits in your mayor's office. They can do so anonymously, thanks to a ruling by the Supreme Court in Citizens United. And with the court's recent ruling lifting the cap on the number of candidates Adelson, the Kochs and others can give money to, there seems to be little left in their way. Even though it's only April, the Koch brothers are already breaking spending records. Americans for Prosperity, one of the Kochs' front groups, has spent more than $30 million since last August running ads in at least eight states. According to The New York Times, AFP has more than ""200 full-time paid staffers in field offices in at least 32 states."" It's no coincidence that these targets tend to follow Koch Industries' business interests. In Michigan, Rep. Gary Peters has called attention to the toxic mountain of petroleum coke -- a byproduct of refining oil sands --  that stands in Detroit and is owned by Koch Minerals. Also called petcoke, the substance poses environmental and public health concerns when the dust blows into the air and water. Peters called out the Koch brothers in a news conference at the restaurant of Jacques Driscoll, who lives near one of the petcoke storage sites in southwest Detroit and said he was fearful for the health of his then-pregnant wife and then-unborn child. In return for his efforts to represent the well-being and safety of his constituents, Peters's bid for the United States Senate has been targeted with millions of dollars in attack ads from the Kochs and AFP. And like the petcoke, the commercials play dirty. One such ad featured Julie Boonstra, who has cancer, claiming that she lost her doctor under the Affordable Care Act and that insurance became ""unaffordable."" A fact check showed that neither claim was true and noted that she even experienced ""substantial savings"" under the law. No community is too small. AFP's Wisconsin chapter flooded Iron County, home to fewer than 5,000 voting-age residents, with a thousand brochures attacking seven county board candidates as ""anti-mine radicals."" Another full-color mailing supported the organization's preferred pro-mine candidates. The dispute? A debate over new mining regulations friendly to Gogebic Taconite and their proposal to construct a $1.5 billion iron ore mine in Iron and Ashland counties. David Fladeboe, state director of Americans for Prosperity, recently admitted, ""the mining issue has been a big one for us."" One candidate attacked by AFP told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, ""I have a hard time understanding why the Koch brothers think I am such a threat to their well-being — that they single me out in poor little Iron County?"" Sure enough, on Election Day, four out of the seven Koch- and AFP-backed candidates won. Whether billionaires are buying federal candidates who will lower their taxes or local officials favorable to their business interests, their outsized influence is a threat to our democracy, particularly when it is obscured in the form of ""dark money."" Middle-class Americans -- who can't afford to buy a school board seat, let alone a U.S. Senate seat -- deserve elected officials and a system that will ensure their voices are heard.

"(CNN)The Red Bull Formula One team has had its trophy cabinet cleared out by thieves in a smash-and-grab burglary Friday night. The British-based marque has won 50 grands prix, four constructor titles and four drivers' world championships in its 10-year history. The spoils of this success had been on display in the reception to its factory, which is based on an industrial estate in Milton Keynes, England. ""We are obviously devastated by this serious factory break-in, which saw offenders drive a vehicle through our front entrance and steal more than 60 trophies which took years and hard work to accumulate,"" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement. ""The break in caused significant damage and was very upsetting for our night officers who were on duty at the time. ""Beyond the aggressive nature of this break in, we are perplexed why anyone would take these trophies. ""The value to the team is of course extraordinarily high due to the sheer hard work and effort that went into winning each and every one. But their intrinsic value is low; they would be of little benefit to those outside of the team and, in addition to that, many of the trophies on display were replicas."" Smash and grab . Thames Valley Police are investigating the incident which took place just before 01:30 Friday. A statement by the police, who are appealing for witnesses, detailed the robbery was carried out by around six men. ""Two cars were involved in the burglary,"" the statement added.

"Hong Kong (CNN)A Hong Kong housewife has been found guilty of imprisoning and abusing a young Indonesian maid whose case has prompted protests and calls for reform of the city's laws governing domestic workers. Over several months last year, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih was kept as a prisoner in the home of Law Wan-tung, a 44-year-old mother of two who regularly deprived her of food, sleep and payment for long hours of grueling work. After the verdict, Erwiana thanked her supporters and called for the governments of Hong Kong and Indonesia to do more to protect the rights of migrant workers. ""What I hope together with my fellow domestic workers are just fair and humane treatment and for people to stop treating us like slaves,"" she said. Law was convicted of grievous bodily harm, common assault, and failing to pay Erwiana's wages or give her statutory rest days. Sentencing has been deferred until February 27 to give the defense time to compile character references and psychological reports. In delivering her verdict, Judge Amanda Woodcock described the 23-year-old victim as ""a simple young lady who tried to financially better her life and that of her family."" She said Erwiana had no reason to fabricate the evidence, and that the abuse had been so frequent and over such a long period of time, it was reasonable that the young maid might not be able to recall specific dates. Woodcock said Erwiana thought she was under surveillance at all times, and believed Law's threats that her family would be killed if she told anyone about the abuse. ""They made her compliant and more subservient,"" Woodcock said. Erwiana started work in Law's home in May 2013. However, within one month she tried to escape because she hadn't been paid her wages. The court heard she called the building's security guard who contacted her agency. Later, an Indonesian woman turned up and took her back to the flat, saying there was no need to find a new employer. That's when the physical abuse started. It began with punches, then progressed to beatings with a mop handle, coat hangers, and the rod from a vacuum cleaner. By the following January, she had become too weak to work and was escorted to the airport with a one-way ticket by her employer, who told her to wear a diaper because she was too ill to stand. ""(Law) asked me to put on six layers of clothes and two pairs of pants,"" Erwiana told the court. "" She also asked me to wear Pampers because I was unable to go to the toilet because I was very weak. She put make up on me so I don't look like someone who'd just been tortured."" She also repeated threats to kill her parents if she told anyone of the abuse, Erwiana said. Even before the trial, Erwiana's case became a cause celebre for campaigners who say that Hong Kong rules dictating that domestic workers reside at their employers' homes expose hundreds of thousands of foreign workers -- mostly women -- to potential abuse. Last April, Erwiana was named by Time magazine as one of the world's 100 most influential people, which commended her bravery for drawing attention to ""the plight of a vulnerable often invisible population."" The Hong Kong government started allowing foreign domestic helpers to work in the Chinese territory in the 1970s to fill a shortage of local staff. Now, around 320,000 come here from Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as other Asian countries, to earn more money than they could at home. Many who come via agencies direct from their home countries don't meet their employer before signing a two-year contract requiring them to live and work in their homes. They're paid a minimum wage of HK$4,110 ($530) a month and by law are only entitled to one day off a week. After the verdict, Amnesty International said the case should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for the government to stop the ""widespread exploitation"" of domestic workers. ""The Hong Kong authorities can no longer bury their heads in the sand and dismiss horrific abuses as isolated incidents,"" said Norma Kang Muico, Amnesty's Asia-Pacific migrant rights researcher. Amnesty says workers are under pressure to stay in abusive situations because Hong Kong law demands they leave the city within two weeks of terminating their contract, if they can't find a new job. During the trial, Erwiana told the court the only time she was allowed to rest was between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. She was made to clean doors at 3 a.m., she said, so the neighbors didn't see her. Desperately hungry, on one occasion she said she knocked on a neighbor's door and asked for food. He immediately shut it. Erwiana said Law's children overheard and told their mother who then threatened her again. Erwiana slept on the floor, moving the vacuum cleaner and bags of books to make room to lie down when permitted. By day, she was so tired that on at least one occasion she fell asleep while doing the vacuuming. Her employer, Law, grabbed the vacuum, she said, and shoved it in her mouth, twisting it so the metal tube cut her lips and her ""mouth was bleeding."" Another time when she fell asleep while vacuuming, Erwiana said Law stripped her in the bathroom and sprayed her with cold water. When the water was turned off, she was forced to stand naked in front of a fan. After one to two hours, she was allowed to dress and resume work, the court heard. Law and Erwiana were not the only ones living in the flat during the abuse. Law's two children -- her 18-year-old son Edmund Tsui Wing-kit and 16-year-old daughter referred to only as""Kelly"" to protect her identity -- provided no evidence against their mother. Tsui testified that she was ""gentle"" to maids. His sister said she didn't pay much attention. Erwiana said Law's husband was never there and she had only seen old wedding photos of him in the flat. During questioning by the defense, Erwiana became upset when it was suggested she was making up the threats. Why didn't she call for help? Erwiana said it was because she wasn't let out, her passport had been taken, and she feared that Law would make good on her threats to kill her family. She tried to escape twice; both attempts failed. Her employer watched her every move, she said, even on CCTV via her mobile phone when she wasn't there. Indonesian maid says she was tortured with vacuum cleaner . Two other domestic workers were involved in the case, who alleged they too were the victims of assault and criminal intimidation while working in Law's home. Judge Woodcock found Law guilty of assaulting and threatening Tutik Lestari Ningsih sometime between April 2010 and March 2011. However, she found Law not guilty of the same offenses against another domestic worker, Nurhasanah, dating back to late 2011. Despite abuses, foreign domestic workers still flock to Hong Kong . When Erwiana's employer escorted her to the airport in early January 2014, other Indonesian women noticed her condition and pressed her to tell them what had happened. One of them, Riyanti, told CNN Erwiana tried to blame her scarred and blackened skin on allergies, before admitting, ""I was tortured."" Erwiana's claims led to protests in Hong Kong, demands for justice and calls for the law to be changed to allow domestic foreign workers to live outside their employers' home. After the verdict, Erwiana said she wouldn't be returning to Hong Kong and to her former life as a maid. ""My body is not as strong anymore. Being a domestic helper is heavy work that needs strength and energy,"" she said. She said she's been offered a scholarship to a private university and plans to finish school, with the aim of helping other victims of abuse. ""I have a dream of putting up a foundation that will help other migrant workers,"" she said. Cousin tells of Filipino maid's horrific burns .

"It is an old Hollywood maxim that everyone flees from failure. When a big movie bellyflops at the box office -- like ""John Carter,"" which has pulled in a cringe-inducing $62 million in the U.S. in its first three weekends, barely a fourth of the film's $250 million budget -- usually everyone involved tries to get as much distance as they can from the film, as quickly as they can get it. Everyone's hoping to salvage not only their careers, but their psyches as well, especially when that much blood, sweat, and treasure has been invested in a passion project that's become a media punching bag. Apparently, no one told Taylor Kitsch this is how he's supposed to behave. When EW caught up with the actor a few hours before he was embarking on his global press tour for ""Battleship"" -- his second effects-laden big budget studio picture this year -- the 30-year-old said he had ""absolutely no regrets"" about his first big screen starring role. ""I would do 'John Carter' again tomorrow,"" he says forthrightly. ""I'm very proud of 'John Carter.' Box office doesn't validate me as a person, or as an actor."" Kitsch understands that the sci-fi adventure's financial failings -- while it's pulled in over $230 million worldwide, Disney still expects to lose $200 million on the film -- are clearly ""unfortunate,"" if for no other reason than it's a virtual certainty that director Andrew Stanton's planned two sequels will never see a greenlight. ""I'd love to go do 'John Carter 2,'"" he says. ""I really would. It's just s***ty I don't get to work with the ['John Carter'] family. It really was a special thing."" But Kitsch isn't dwelling on the past. ""I'm going to keep working,"" he says. Kitsch points out that after Battleship, he's got Oliver Stone's ""Savages"" coming out in July, and then he'll likely start shooting the Navy SEAL drama ""Lone Survivor"" for ""Battleship"" director Peter Berg in the fall. ""It's an exciting time,"" he says, and he clearly means it. See the full article at EW.com.","Taylor Kitsch said he had ""absolutely no regrets"" about his role in ""John Carter""

"(CNN) -- An environmentally-friendly surfboard has taken to the waves after five years in development. Surf's up: Mark Harris tries out the Eden eco-surfboard. British profession surfer Mark ""Egor"" Harris was one of the first to try the British-made board at Fistral beach in Cornwall, England, giving its performance and eco-credentials the thumbs up. ""It felt good and I can see these boards being popular with surfers. We spend a lot of time on the beach and in the sea and surfers have been campaigning to clean up the oceans for years. This board goes hand-in-hand with that philosophy,"" said Harris. The surfboard has been in development in the south west of England for five years and is the culmination of a collaboration between the Eden Project gardens and biosphere and three local companies. Chris Hines, former sustainability director of the Eden Project and a lifelong surfer and committed environmentalist came up with the idea for the board when a balsa tree had to be taken down in the rainforest biome. ""I said, well, let's make a completely sustainable surfboard, because I knew people who could laminate in hemp cloth and plant-based resin, so we went for it. It was a eureka moment: we thought, let's really have a go, let's really see what we can do,"" he told CNN. Hines and the Eden Project team soon realized that balsa and hemp cloth were too heavy for commercially viable surfboards, but desire remained to produce a surfboard that reduces the reliance on petroleum chemicals and uses more sustainable materials. The Eden team worked with local company Homeblown to create a new type of foam core for the eco-board, 15 to 20 percent of which is made from plant derived material. Another local Cornish company, Sustainable Composites, developed a resin made almost entirely from linseed oil instead of oil-derived coatings, meaning over 50 percent of the final finished surfboards are made from renewable materials. Completing the use of local companies, the boards are being manufactured by surfboard shapers, Laminations. Junior British surfing champion Tassy Swallow is set to compete at the International Surfing Association World Junior Championships in Ecuador on a new Eden surfboard. ""It's a really good board, it worked really well,"" said Swallow after her first outing on the board. ""It feels a lot more buoyant in the nose which makes it easier to catch waves. It will really catch on when people realize that it's as good as a regular board.""","New eco-surfboard made with over 50 percent renewable materials .

"He never knew the name of the woman he killed all those years ago, back in Arizona. Then Matthew Gibson started getting mysterious messages, at least some bearing the name, ""Anita Townshed."" So, according to police, in June the 55-year-old drove from his North Carolina home all the way to Arizona, where he walked into the Winslow, Arizona, police department and confessed. The thing is, as the Charlotte Observer newspaper noted in breaking the story Monday, the name of Gibson's victim wasn't Anita. It was Barbara Brown. And police didn't know anything about Gibson. ""I think because he recently found religion he was starting to feel guilty and wanted to do the right thing,"" said his attorney, Ron Gilleo. Gibson had never had any run-ins with the law, not even a traffic ticket, Gilleo said. ""He could have gotten away with this,"" Bullhead City police Detective Mary Garcia said. Instead, he was recently sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. The saga began in 1997, when police found Brown's body along the Colorado River in Bullhead City, about 50 miles southeast of Las Vegas. According to the Charlotte Observer, Gibson told police he had met Brown one night and the two went back to his trailer. He found her ""loud and obnoxious,"" the newspaper reported, but she refused to leave. He used a large flashlight to beat her to death, Garcia said, put her body in the trunk of his car and dumped it in a park. He tossed the flashlight on a road heading toward Las Vegas. A few months later, he moved from Bullhead City, according to police. Years of drifting intervened.

On June 5, he walked into the Winslow Police Department and said he wanted to confess to a crime, according to the police report.

"(CNN) -- ""Blood, sweat, and tears"" on the football pitch used to mean a very different thing in Sierra Leone. In a country where Ebola is spreading faster than anywhere else on the planet -- with around 7,000 reported cases so far -- each droplet of bodily fluid evokes suspicion. Here, even a post-match handshake is an uneasy encounter. In this fearful new climate, football has been banned. And to sports-obsessed Sierra Leoneans, the embargo is tantamount to forbidding God. ""Football is like a second religion in Sierra Leone,"" explained the country's Football Association president Isha Johansen. ""Bearing in mind this is a poor country, you would have situations where people would rather go without food, just so they could buy tickets to a big football match."" On Sundays, the long stretch of sand at Lumley Beach, outside the capital of Freetown, would usually be filled with thousands of people playing the national sport. That was before the outbreak which has had over 1,400 new cases in the last three weeks alone, making Sierra Leone set to eclipse Liberia as the worst-affected country on the globe, according to the World Health Organisation. Now the national premier league has been suspended. Casual kick-abouts in the community have dried up. Even watching the game in halls and cinemas has come to a standstill. ""This virus is about sweat, blood, and interaction,"" said 50-year-old Johansen, when I meet her in an inner-city London cafÃ©, a world away from the devastation back home. ""And that's football. There's a lot of interaction, there's a lot of sweat and blood."" Don't touch . Beyond the deadly virus itself, are the psychological effects on a naturally ""touchy, feely people who love to hug and hold hands,"" said Johansen. ""It's a very strained and difficult place to be in mentally. You have to reprogram yourself. So you find that when people reach out to you, it's kind of like 'argh,' she says, screwing up her elegant face and holding up her hands. ""I think one of the vital things we've failed to adhere to as a people, is not to touch a sick person,"" she says of a disease in which 20% of transmissions happen during burials. ""And that is such basic humanity, isn't it? When someone you love is sick, you want to hold that person, you want to carry them,"" says the mother-of-one. ""But you can't."" Invisible enemy . Just over a decade after the civil war which left more than 50,000 people dead, the country is now facing a new, invisible enemy. ""It's not like the war that we've been through whereby you saw the rebels coming,"" said Johansen, who as a little girl never owned a doll, instead playing football with her brothers and their friends. ""But with Ebola, you wake up one morning and it's hit a town, it's hit another town. For a long time we didn't know the signs, we didn't know the symptoms to look out for."" Morocco's call . Indeed, what initially appears to be a common cold, can quickly escalate into vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding -- both internally and externally. Transmission through bodily fluids makes football a ripe setting for infection, and last month Morocco reneged on hosting the 2015 African Nations Cup due to fears over the spread of the disease. ""Let's just say I wasn't surprised,"" said Johansen, who is also owner of a premier league club called -- FC Johansen. ""I think if I was in Morocco's position, I would be focusing on saving lives and wanting to contain the Ebola virus,"" she says with a resigned sigh. Coming from Sierra Leone, Johansen knows full well what it's like having to ""beg to play in other countries."" Her country's players have reportedly suffered ""humiliating"" prejudice at away games, with opponents refusing to their shake hands and crowds chanting ""Ebola"" at matches. Women's work . Personally, Johansen also suffered ""the most humiliating attacks I have ever endured"" -- though rather than Ebola, she says they related to her gender. As one of only two women to head a national football association in the world, Johansen says she came under fire in a country where ""women are still perceived to know their place."" ""In Sierra Leone, football is their all. And you don't see women playing it, you don't see women telling them how to do it, and you certainly don't see women organizing it,"" says the daughter of one of the founding members of the country's East End Lions Football Club, who as a child grew up with footballers constantly walking in and out of her family home. ""Yes, horrible things were said about me that I wouldn't want to repeat. Very, very degrading things and cartoons. Bearing in mind, that I am a mother, and I am somebody's wife, and I am somebody's daughter,"" she says about slurs during her campaign for the top job in 2012. Her coping method has been to switch off from local media and social networks. ""I don't see it, I don't read it,"" she says. ""I kind of disconnect from that and just stay focused."" Cleaning up . She believes part of the vitriol has come from her hardline stance on corruption. ""The FA was in total tatters before I came in,"" she says. ""We had a bad reputation internally and externally. We had no structures. Integrity was at an all time low. There was no discipline."" And in a country where football and gambling go hand-in-hand, Johansen's zero tolerance was a hard pill to swallow. ""If people choose to gamble as a recreational pastime, well that's up to them,"" she says, hands clasped around a mug of mint tea. ""But you cannot have people in high administrative offices participating in gambling or betting. It's a no-no."" When it comes to corruption allegations at the highest levels of football's international governing body, FIFA, Johansen is less willing to talk tough. ""All these things that are swimming around, these controversies, is something that I really wouldn't like to get involved in,"" she says. ""It's really unfortunate, and I'm really hoping that FIFA can rise above it much sooner than later,"" she says of the organization which this year gave Sierra Leone's Football Association $750,000 plus another $50,000 towards social projects used for tackling Ebola. Does that mean Johansen will be voting for FIFA president Sepp Blatter in next year's election? ""Sepp Blatter has been very supportive of African nations and trying to build up our football development,"" she says, choosing her words carefully. ""And in that respect I think, not just myself, but I most African countries will recognize that."" For now, her main focus is on the virus which has so far claimed over 1,400 lives across the country, and silenced its beloved football fields. ""We're just waiting for that day when they tell us -- boom! -- the vaccine is out, go and take your jabs,"" she says. ""Every morning we wake up waiting to hear that message. ""And it'll come.""

"Pope Francis -- the Catholic Church's first Latin American pontiff -- celebrated his birthday Wednesday with a major geopolitical wish granted: The end of a half-century of frozen relations between the United States and Cuba. Francis, who was elected last year and turned 78 on Wednesday, acted as the chief advocate for renewing diplomatic ties between Washington and Havana, officials said. The Pope made a personal plea to President Barack Obama and Cuban leaders in a letter this summer, writing that the two nations should try to reset their relations after decades of friction. ""I want to thank His Holiness, Pope Francis, whose moral example shows us the importance of pursuing the world as it should be, rather than simply settling for the world as it is,"" Obama said Wednesday as he announced the U.S. policy shift on Cuba. When Obama met the Pope at the Vatican in March, the discussion turned toward moving U.S.-Cuba relations into a new era. White House officials said the Pope specifically addressed the case of jailed American contractor Alan Gross, who was freed  Wednesday as part of the new detente between the two countries. The Vatican also hosted talks between U.S. and Cuban delegations in October, where details of Gross' release and aspects of the new U.S. trade policy were hashed out. ""The Holy Father wishes to express his warm congratulations for the historic decision taken by the Governments of the United States of America and Cuba to establish diplomatic relations, with the aim of overcoming, in the interest of the citizens of both countries, the difficulties which have marked their recent history,"" the Vatican Secretary of State wrote in a statement Wednesday. The U.S.-Cuba deal isn't the first time Francis has used his moral authority to try to broker international truces. After visiting the Holy Land in May, he hosted former Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas at the Vatican for a joint prayer service. Francis Rooney, the U.S. ambassador to the Holy See from 2005 to 2008, said that top Catholic officials, including current Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, regularly lobbied American envoys to relax the economic embargo on Cuba. Previous popes, such as Saint John Paul II, who was raised in communist Poland, had little love for totalitarian states but believed that sanctions impoverished ordinary Cubans and isolated a government that might be won over through careful diplomacy. That's a common approach for the Holy See, said Rooney, author of ""The Global Vatican,"" a study of 1,200 years of statecraft by Catholic popes and priests. ""They are focused on the human condition, rather than secular interests."" Cuban-American theologian Miguel Diaz, the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican from 2009 to 2012, said Wednesday's breakthroughs represent both a personal and professional triumph. ""This is something that we have worked on for such a long time,"" said Diaz, who has born in Havana. ""I raised the Gross case with my Vatican interlocutors regularly."" Diaz, now a professor at Loyola University in Chicago, said talks were particularly intense ahead of former Pope Benedict XVI's visit to Cuba in 2012. Relations between the Vatican and Cuba, strained during the 49-year rule of communist dictator Fidel Castro, have improved since Raul Castro replaced his sickly brother as the island nation's president. Diaz and other Catholics said the presence of the first Pope from Latin America has also played a role in how world leaders view Cuba. Francis has surrounded himself with advisers who have deep experience in Latin America, including Pietro Parolin, who was formerly Benedict's ambassador to Venezuela. In addition, the Holy See's former ambassador to Cuba, Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu, is now a high-level diplomat at the Vatican. ""We now have people in the highest offices of the Catholic Church who understand the situation in Cuba, the situation in Latin America, and who also understand the need for a different roadmap to lasting peace,"" Diaz said. Cuba was officially atheist from 1962-1992, and an annual State Department report issued this year said religious activity there is only allowed ""if explicitly authorized"" by the government. The Catholic Church estimates between 60-70% of Cubans are baptized. In October, the Caribbean country allowed the first new Catholic church in 55 years to be built, according to The Associated Press.","The White House says Pope Francis wrote letters to both countries and hosted meetings at the Vatican .

"It used to be as simple as folding a piece of paper up your sleeve or writing on the inside of your wrist. But now, as students across the world ready themselves for exam season, cheating is going high tech. With smartwatches, smartpens and Google glasses now on the market, the modern pupil has an array of gadgets to trick the sharpest pair of eyes. Educators now need to spot -- not just keep up with -- the latest tech inventions. ""I do think wearable technology is going to be an issue,"" Larry Rosen, psychology professor at California State University, told CNN. The Educational Testing Service, or ETS, is likely to be ""grappling with this for the SAT, GRE and other standardized exams that they administer,"" he said. There are ""unanticipated consequences"" of rules that lag behind technology, Rosen added. Governments are starting to respond to the high-tech threat, according to the UK Department For Education. Schools are expected to take ""appropriate action"" on cheating, it said in a statement, and report the incident to the exam boards. The invisible threat . But some devices are near impossible to see -- such as the so-called ""invisible""  Bluetooth earpieces. They work with a tiny microphone, which is synced to a Bluetooth cell phone. They can enable questions, whispered from exam rooms, to be answered from someone outside the room. Taylor Ellis, associate dean at the University of Central Florida, heads its testing center and is familiar with the tactic. Examiners are trained to look for suspicious behavior and ""if we observe a student waving their pen in front of the computer, or if I see them waving their wrist close to it, these are all signs that they're probably taking a photo of the screen,"" Ellis said. ""That's when we intervene."" The center is equipped with cameras so, once the exam is over, Ellis can review the footage to pick up any suspect activity he may have missed. ""I tell my staff we can't stop cheating, but I will find out about it."" China shows way to future . China has been at the forefront of the tech cheating crackdown. Its schools and universities have been using technology to combat high-tech cheating for over a year. Among other anti-cheating tactics, staff members monitor radio signals and check students with scanners. Such advanced technology could, some argue, make teachers redundant. ""It's hard to find a teacher who's up on what's happening in the tech world,"" digital media consultant Shelly Palmer said. ""They don't know about the latest wearable technology, you only see that in medical schools or in a research lab."" Palmer told CNN a complete overhaul of the education system was needed. Factoids and long division is a wasted skill in today's society because in the future, a child will never be without a computer, he said. ""There was a time when you had to build a house and you needed the tools to do that, but most of us no longer translate mechanical energy into wealth, we don't plough the fields,"" Palmer added. Palmer said children would be better served by learning with such high-tech tools, rather than being separated from them. These days, it's ""intellectual property"" that is translated into wealth, he said.

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are matching each other hat-trick for hat-trick as their remarkable scoring battle continues apace. Messi grabbed his third treble in four games Sunday to lift Barcelona to a 5-1 derby victory over Espanyol in the Nou Camp. It came the day after Ronaldo took his La Liga record for hat-tricks to 23 as Real Madrid stayed top of the standings with a 3-0 win over Celta Vigo. Barcelona's come from behind win has seen them move back into second spot, two points behind its arch rival. Both men have scored over 200 goals at better than a goal a game since Ronaldo first moved to La Liga with Real in 2009, with a string of records falling into their grasp. Barca needed Messi's magic after going behind to its city rival as Sergio Garcia converted with a fine early strike. The Argentine ace conjured up the equalizer in first half injury time after being set up by Xavi on the edge of the penalty area. It was to open the floodgates and within five minutes of the restart Luis Suarez had centered for Messi to put Barca ahead for the first time. Gerard Pique connected with a Ivan Rakitic corner to head the home side further ahead with Pedro Rodriguez adding the fourth after a brilliant through ball from Jordi Alba. Messi completed his 21st hat-trick for Barcelona near the end after an assist from Pedro to send home the majority of the 76,057 fans home happy. Meanwhile in the English Premier League, Andy Carroll scored twice as West Ham beat Swansea 3-1 at Upton Park to move up to third in the standings behind Chelsea and champions Manchester City. Scotland international Alan Hutton hit the winner for Aston Villa in a 2-1 win over bottom club Leicester. Ciaran Clark had canceled out Leonardo Ulloa's opener for Leicester at Villa Park. In Italy's Serie A, Genoa has also moved up to third spot after handing AC Milan its first away defeat of the season. Luca Antonelli's first-half header separated the two sides, Genoa leapfrogging Napoli, who was held 2-2 by Empoli earlier.","Lionel Messi grabs hat-trick in Barcelona's 5-1 derby win .

"(CNN)The 2015 Grammys offered the familiar -- a slew of awards for a newcomer, some outstanding performances -- and the unfamiliar: Kanye West laughing and smiling? Here are a few things that dominated the evening and ideas to make the show better: . Welcome, Sam Smith! A year ago, the British soul singer was an unknown in America. Sunday night, he took home four Grammys, including song of the year, record of the year (both for ""Stay with Me""), best new artist and best pop vocal album (for ""In the Lonely Hour""). He also gave a dazzling performance of ""Stay with Me"" with Mary J. Blige pitching in. About the only thing that could have made it better was if Tom Petty, who was credited on the song thanks to similarities to ""I Won't Back Down,"" had joined him. ""I'm having a really, really, really good night,"" Smith said as he won song of the year. That was an understatement. Is that Kanye West? Like dancing unicorns and functioning Congresses, a smiling, laughing Kanye West was considered a mythical creature: occasionally talked about but never seen. On Sunday night, though, the usually grim-faced rapper gave a soulful performance of ""Only One,"" joined Rihanna and a somewhat awkward Paul McCartney for ""FourFiveSeconds"" and then jokingly stole the show by running on stage when Beck won album of the year for ""Morning Phase."" On the other hand, maybe he wasn't joking at all. Beck's big night . Obviously, Kanye didn't expect Beck to win album of the year -- and neither did Beck himself. But ""Morning Phase"" took home that major prize as well as best rock album. Obviously flustered, Beck thanked the entire production team, as well as his children for ""letting me keep them awake extra longer."" How did Beck beat out Beyonce? Pointed statements . The Grammys got in some issue-oriented statements . President Obama dropped by via video to speak against domestic violence, with activist Brooke Axtell giving a moving speech. Others weren't even spoken aloud: During his performance of ""Happy,"" Pharrell and his background performers held up their hands in the now-familiar ""Don't shoot"" move. Grammys 2015: Race takes center stage . And then there was Prince, who came out to present album of the year. ""Like books and black lives, albums still matter,"" he said. Annie Lennox goes to church; AC/DC goes to hell; Sia goes looking for a  place to hide . Hozier was doing a fine job with his ""Take Me to Church,"" but Lennox gave the song a new dimension -- and then took the audience to church with her soulful, dramatic version of Screamin' Jay Hawkins' ""I Put a Spell on You."" Then there was AC/DC, which started the show with ""Rock or Bust"" and ""Highway to Hell."" As surprising as it was to see the heavy-metal heroes on the Grammys -- not usually known for a fondness for metal -- it was equally surprising to see a group of celebrities wearing devil horns in the group's honor. And Sia, known for hiding her face, performed her song ""Chandelier"" while facing a wall. Kristen Wiig and Maddie Ziegler handled the dancing duties. Sia was even reclusive on the red carpet.","Sam Smith wins four Grammys, including song, record of the year .

"At Chi-Med's labs in Shanghai, a group of 70 chemists has been working for a decade to try and crack the mysteries of Chinese medicine. The company's scientists are attempting to break 1,300 medicinal herbs into their component parts and then test them for global use against diseases. It's an ambitious effort and one that looks close to paying off. Chi-Med, in partnership with Nestle, has started the first worldwide phase III clinical testing trials -- the final step before approval for sale -- for a botanical drug based on Chinese Traditional Medicine. If Chi-Med and Nestle succeed in winning U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, the companies will be at the forefront of efforts to export Chinese medicine beyond its loyal following at home. They'll also have tackled the central problem in taking Chinese medicine global: how do you get a centuries-old remedy through the rigors of modern government regulation? ""The simpler the product, the better at this stage,"" says Chi-Med CEO Christian Hogg. ""The more similar it is to conventional drugs, the better from the FDA standpoint."" That's why the company has started with a drug called HMPL-004, which treats inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The testing was made possible by a change in the FDA policies and procedures in 2004 regarding botanical drug products. The new guidelines removed some of the obstacles involved in getting an investigational new drug application (IND), the first step in getting a drug developed and marketed in the U.S. Since the guidelines were introduced, the FDA has only approved two botanical drugs, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. Fulyzaq, an antidiarrheal drug used for HIV/AIDS patients and derived from the red sap of the Croton lechleri plant, was approved in December 2012. Veregen, a treatment for warts based on green tea extract, was given the green light in 2006. By Chinese medicine standards, HMPL-004 is a simple drug. It's a single extract from a single herb, called andrographis, which has a long history of use in Asia for stomach problems. Contrast that with She Xiang Bao Xin Wan, one of Chi-Med's primary products in China. It's a prescription cardiovascular drug with over 100 different chemical components, which Hogg explains makes it nearly impossible to get through the current U.S. approval system. ""If you are working with the FDA to register that, you are going to have to explain to them exactly where each of those compounds comes from and you are going to have to guarantee every step that exactly the same amount of the compound is in that product,"" he says. There are currently 2,800 patients in the phase III clinical trials to determine if HMPL-004 is both safe and effective. If FDA agrees with the results, the drug will then enter the $7 billion global market to treat IBD. Chi-Med is not alone in its efforts to take Chinese botanical drugs beyond China. Dr. Yibin Feng at Hong Kong University's School of Chinese Medicine is studying the effectiveness of Chinese medicine treatments for cancer and liver disease. He says the lack of advanced science and technology has meant in the past that traditional Chinese medical doctors did not understand how the treatments worked. ""We know this works for some disease, but I don't know what the scientific basis is,"" he says. ""Why does it work for this disease?"" Dr. Feng believes all of that is changing now. Both he and Hogg think the slowing pace of conventional drug development is driving more people to look to Chinese medicine. ""Now new drug discovery from natural products and other material is more difficult that many years ago, people notice the wisdom in Chinese medicine,"" says Dr. Feng. He's particularly hopeful people outside China will begin to see the value in China's more complicated, multi-ingredient treatments. In fact, he sees these multi-faceted remedies as one of the major assets of Chinese medicine. Dr. Hogg believes gradually the foreign regulators will become more open to the range of Chinese drugs. ""It is in the best interest for the public health to be bringing these therapies to the market,"" he says.","Chi-Med and Nestle working to get FDA approval for some Chinese medicine .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Hundreds of anti-government protesters marched toward a presidential palace in Yemen on Sunday, calling for regime change in the Middle Eastern country. Some of them chanted, ""First Mubarak, now Ali,"" referring to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and Hosni Mubarak, who recently resigned as president of Egypt after nearly 30 years in power. Security forces put up a barbed wire barricade and blocked the protesters' path about two miles from the palace. At that point, the situation intensified as protesters turned away and attempted to reach the palace through side streets. Clashes between protesters and police were reported by witnesses. According to Tawakkol Karman, a prominent Yemeni rights activist and president of Women Journalists Without Chains, anti-riot police then ""went into the crowd of protesters with batons and tasers,"" attempting to disperse them. Karman said she and other protesters were hit with sticks and that at least 12 people were arrested. One of those arrested, human rights lawyer Khaled Al-Anesi, has since been released. The CNN crew at the scene was surrounded by security officers, who seized the journalists' videotapes. Nearby, a group of about 40 pro-government demonstrators chanted, ""With our souls, with our blood, we will sacrifice for Ali."" The anti-government group first gathered at the gates of Sanaa University earlier Sunday, where another group of pro-government demonstrators carried pictures of Ali. Police tried to disperse the crowds and stepped in to prevent pro-government demonstrators from following when the anti-government group headed away from the university and toward the palace. The group of anti-government protesters included students and rights activists. Their numbers swelled from about 400 to more than 1,000 as they marched through Sanaa's streets. The anti-government protests were significant because earlier in the day, Yemen's Embassy in Washington confirmed that the opposition coalition had announced its intention to hold a national dialogue with the administration. The government welcomed the opposition's willingness to initiate a dialogue -- though the protesters indicated otherwise. Meanwhile, the state-run news agency Saba reported that Saleh had decided to delay a visit tot he United States that was to take place in late February. Saleh has ruled Yemen for 32 years and has pledged not to stand for re-election when his current term -- which started in 2006 -- ends in 2013. Mubarak's lengthy rule ended Friday when he stepped down after 18 days of anti-government protests rocked Egypt. Echoes of Egypt's revolution resonated across the region, with anti-government protests in Yemen and Algeria. Demonstrations are also planned in Libya and Iran on Monday. Brief clashes erupted Saturday in Yemen between hundreds of pro- and anti-government demonstrators who staged rival rallies in the capital. The clashes, which left a small number of people injured, followed an anti-government protest Friday night in which men armed with knives attacked more than a thousand demonstrators, according to human rights groups.","Clashes reported between protesters and police .

"More than one month after a police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the case continues to provoke public unrest and remains far from settled. The white police officer's shooting of the unarmed black teenager in the St. Louis suburb is being robustly debated and investigated. Where does the criminal investigation stand? So far, there have been no charges filed, but the investigation is ongoing. A St. Louis County grand jury is investigating and hearing testimony into Brown's killing and whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged or not. The grand jury will look at two issues: was a crime committed and is there ""probable cause"" that the accused person -- namely Wilson -- committed that crime. The grand jury, which meets in secrecy, consists of nine white people (six men and three women) and three black people (two women and a man), court officials said. Grand jurors began meeting last month, and their progress on reaching a decision isn't public information, though it's expected to take two months. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch is the prosecutor presenting evidence to the grand jurors. What is the U.S. Justice Department doing? Federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations, one into Brown's killing and the other into Ferguson Police Department's overall track record with minorities. One investigation is looking into the August 9 shooting by Wilson, a 28-year-old officer with six years of experience, including four in Ferguson. A civil rights violation would require that Wilson had shown ""racial hostility"" against Brown in the shooting, legal analysts say. The U.S. Justice Department also announced a second inquiry this month to examine accusations that the police department as a whole practiced racial profiling and heavy-handed tactics. ""People consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the Ferguson police force. These anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this month. ""Our investigation will assess the police department's use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson's city jail,"" Holder said. The second investigation typically looks at possible reforms for a law enforcement agency, rather than punishing past alleged misconduct, analysts say. How long will the two federal probes take? They will likely require lots of time, if similar past cases are any indication. For example, the U.S. Justice Department took five years in its investigation of whether Cincinnati police Officer Stephen Roach, who is white, violated the civil rights of Timothy Thomas, 19, who was black and fatally shot by Roach, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. As in the Brown case, the killing of Thomas ignited riots in Cincinnati in 2001, but the Justice Department announced in 2006 that Roach didn't violate Thomas' civil rights, the newspaper reported. When investigating an entire police department, the Justice Department investigation can easily take a year or more, according to a 2013 report by the Police Executive Research Forum that's entitled, ""Civil Rights Investigations of Local Police: Lessons Learned."" For example, in 1994, the U.S. Justice Department investigators took a year to investigate the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Police Department for civil right abuses, the research forum said. By 1997, Pittsburgh entered into a consent decree in which the city would identify problematic police behavior and collect data on officers' conduct. In 1999, the Los Angeles police officers in the Rampart division were accused of misconduct and later convicted of ""an array of crimes that included unprovoked shootings and beatings,"" the research forum said. By 2001, Los Angeles police entered into a consent decree to make reforms over five years, but a federal judge became displeased with the progress of reforms and he extended the decree five more years, amounting to a total of 12 years of federal oversight, the forum said. In all, more than 25 police department have experienced some form of U.S. Justice Department intervention the past two decades, and ""some later investigations and reform processes have taken 10 years or more,"" the police forum said. What is Ferguson doing to address community anger? In the aftermath of street riots following the shooting, the Ferguson City Council has tried to soothe public outrage, but at a council meeting this month, the first since the Brown shooting, the gallery turned raucous. Residents chanted Brown's name and shouted at council members, according to media reports. Nonetheless, the council gave the first reading of a proposed ordinance to create a citizen review board to work with the police department. The proposal must undergo another public reading at a subsequent meeting, and then the council can vote on it, city officials said. Some critics have found the measure inadequate. The proposed citizen board is ""a step in the right direction,"" but ""it is very weak"" in terms of how complaints against police would be filed, said John Gaskin, a member of NAACP board. ""At the meeting, very little details were given regarding this board, as to who can sit on it, what type of qualifications they will need, how these people will be elected."" The day after the September 9 council meeting, dozens of protesters threatened to shut down a portion of Interstate 70 near Ferguson and threw rocks and bottles at police. About three dozen people were taken into police custody after refusing to leave the street, and four were charged with assault on a law enforcement officer.","A grand jury is hearing testimony into killing of Michael Brown .

"(CNN)A human rights official has apologized for his part in an alleged racism incident involving Chelsea supporters on the Paris Metro, but has insisted he is not a racist. Richard Barklie was one of three men identified by the UK's Metropolitan Police in a video showing what appears to be a group of Chelsea fans preventing a black man from entering a train, following the English club's UEFA Champions League game against Paris Saint Germain last Tuesday. The group of supporters can be heard chanting on the train: ""We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it."" A director of the World Human Rights Forum, Barklie has issued a statement through his lawyers admitting his involvement ""in an incident when a person now known to him as Souleymane S. was unable to enter a part of the train."" However, the Chelsea season-ticket holder, who was formerly a Royal Ulster Constabulary and Police Service of Northern Ireland officer, denies he participated in the chanting and ""condemns any behaviour supporting that."" The statement read: ""Pending formal engagement with police our client is anxious to put on record his total abhorrence for racism and any activity associated with it. ""As someone who has spent years working with disadvantaged communities in Africa and India he can point to a C.V. in human rights work which undermines any suggestion he is racist. ""Today a senior official in the World Human Rights Forum confirmed their support for him."" 'Sincerest apologies' The black man who was physically stopped from getting on the Paris Metro, identified as Souleymane S, has said those found guilty should be ""locked up."" Barklie offered his ""sincerest apologies for the trauma and stress suffered by Mr Souleymane,"" while saying he ""has an account to give to police which will explain the context and circumstances"" of the incident. The statement went on to explain that the 50-year-old Barklie has traveled to Chelsea matches for over 20 years ""without incident"" and that he traveled alone to Paris for the UEFA Champions League clash. Barklie -- whose image was released by the Metropolitan Police along with two others -- insists he ""has no knowledge whatsoever"" of the identities of the other people seen in the video footage of the incident. The statement added that the Metropolitan Police have said arrangements are in hand ""to take the investigation to the next stage."" Chelsea condemnation . Chelsea confirmed Friday that it had suspended five people from attending games at its Stamford Bridge stadium and has apologized to the victim. A club spokesperson also said that owner Roman Abramovich was ""disgusted"" by the incident, while manager Jose Mourinho said he was ""ashamed."" Mourinho invited Souleymane S. to attend the return match against Paris Saint Germain at Stamford Bridge, while at Chelsea's English Premier League home match against Burnley Saturday -- its first game since last week's incident -- fans were seen holding banners reading: ""Black or white, we are all blue"" and ""No racism at the Bridge. That's the way we like it."" Former Chelsea player Paul Elliott, a member of the English Football Association's Inclusion Advisory Board, has welcomed the positive response in the UK to what happened. ""In 21st-Century, multi-racial Britain, sport is the catalyst and the key that engages and unites. For me it's the most potent weapon for breaking down barriers,"" Elliott said at the British Ethnic Diversity Sports Awards. ""The response to the Paris Metro incident has been so uplifting. Society has self-policed it, in the sense that it is so obviously unacceptable to people in the 21st Century."" West Ham video . Rivals supporters have also had their say on the Paris Metro incident, with West Ham fans poking fun at their Chelsea counterparts in what has proved to be a viral hit.

"(CNN)Thanks to the resilience of U.S. workers and businesses of all sizes, ""Made in America"" is making a comeback. According to data released last week by the Department of Commerce, American businesses exported $2.35 trillion in goods and services in 2014, hitting a record high for the fifth straight year. The United States sold more to our 20 free trade partners than ever before and logged record exports to more than 50 overseas markets. This is good news all around -- for our economy, workers and wages. After all, U.S. exports have been one of the primary drivers of America's economic resurgence, contributing one-third of our economic growth since 2009 and supporting 11.3 million jobs in 2013. With those jobs paying up to 18% more, on average, than jobs not related to exports, trade promotion has an important role to play in boosting the incomes of middle class Americans. Yet America's recovery remains incomplete, and unfair foreign practices are threatening our progress. Today, many of our workers are competing against counterparts in countries that lack basic labor rights. Meanwhile, some foreign governments are further skewing the playing field by providing subsidies and encouraging competition without concern for the environment. At stake is not merely America's status as a place that makes real things, but more fundamentally, the strength of our middle class and the sanctity of our values. When worker rights aren't respected abroad, the human toll is measured both in American jobs and in a deficit of dignity for workers around the world. Likewise, the absence of environmental protections beyond our borders puts workers and businesses at a competitive disadvantage here at home while jeopardizing the health of our waters, wildlife, air and other treasures that span national boundaries. In the face of these challenges, trade agreements are among our best tools for defending American interests and values. Just look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that the United States is negotiating with 11 other countries in the Asia-Pacific and which includes nearly 40% of the global economy. If agreement can be reached, the deal would grow U.S. exports by more than $120 billion a year, one study estimates, and support more well-paying jobs. Most importantly, the TPP will allow the United States to level the playing field for our workers and businesses in the world's fastest-growing region.  At present, American autoworkers are handicapped by tariffs that can reach 30% in rapidly growing markets such as Malaysia. For their part, American farmers are forced to contend with tariffs as high as 40% on poultry in Vietnam.  In these industries and others, TPP will eliminate or significantly reduce barriers to U.S. exports. Additionally, TPP will contain the toughest environmental and labor protections of any trade agreement in history, including the first provisions to combat the trade in illegal wildlife and the products of illegal fishing, among other advances. The benefits of TPP are clear, while the alternative to leading on trade is alarming. In recent years, countries in the Asia-Pacific have struck over 200 trade agreements, while U.S. companies and workers have largely missed out. China has been extremely active, and we cannot afford to sit on the sidelines. While passing TPP will start a race to the top, ceding leadership to others could result in a race to the bottom. Not leading on trade would undercut our capacity to safeguard labor rights, environmental protections, a free and open Internet, a level playing field between state-owned companies and our private businesses, and a host of provisions which unite America's interests and values. Getting this done will require unity of effort.  In calling for bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority, President Barack Obama has invited Congress to assert its role on trade and provide guidance to the executive branch, including on issues that have emerged since that authority was last updated in 2002, such as the role of state-owned companies and the digital economy. As the President said during his State of the Union address, 95% of the world's customers live outside the United States. No savvy entrepreneur would leave that much of the market untapped. Passing a bipartisan trade promotion bill is an important step toward opening those markets, unlocking opportunity for all Americans and advancing the first trade agenda that's as progressive as it is pro-growth.","American businesses exported $2.35 trillion in goods and services in 2014 .

The incident made headlines worldwide, drawing condemnation from Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho, the club's secretive Russian owner Roman Abramovich and even French President Francois Hollande. But the story took a further twist Saturday as British Transport Police appealed for witnesses to come forward with regard to a separate alleged incident of racist chanting at London's St Pancras train station on Wednesday evening. St Pancras is the main terminal for Eurostar trains from Paris. ""The racist chanting was reported by a member of the public who was disgusted by the behavior of the men who had traveled on the 18.40 service from Paris Gard du Nord,"" Superintendent Gill Murray said in a statement. ""The men shouted as they walked through the station having alighted from the train a short time earlier."" Murray also urged any eye witnesses to the incident to come forward. ""If you traveled on the train from Paris or were at the station and have information which can assist our investigation I would urge you to get in touch as a matter of urgency,"" the statement continued. Chelsea condemnation . Chelsea FC moved quickly to condemn the first incident, calling the chanting ""abhorrent"" and something that ""has no place in football or society"" in a statement released Wednesday. ""I watched the image the next day, I didn't want to watch again, I watched only once,"" Chelsea coach Mourinho said in a press conference Friday. Mourinho also invited Souleymane S. to attend the return match against Paris St Germain in London. ""It is enough for me, it is sad enough for me. It is a humiliation for that gentleman, I imagine myself in that same situation, I want to go home after a day of work and a couple of guys they kick me out of my public transport,"" Mourinho added. ""And I cannot go home. It is a humiliation. It is difficult to believe that this can happen in modern times but the reality is that it happens."" A club spokesperson also confirmed that owner Roman Abramovich was ""disgusted"" by the incident whilst French President Francois Hollande personally spoke Souleymane S. ""President @fhollande spoke to Souleymane S and offered his support over the odious racial attack he suffered,"" the Elysee announced via Twitter. ""I didn't know I was filmed"" The Frenchman on the receiving end of the abuse was initially unaware of the media storm as he lost his phone in the incident. He was later shown the footage by the French newspaper Le Parisian for the first time, during an interview. ""I didn't know I was filmed,"" he said, before calling on the perpetrators to be arrested. ""The fact that I'm talking about it now gives me courage to go to the police and file a complaint. These people, these English fans should be found, punished and locked up. What happened should not go unpunished."" Whilst no arrests have been made Chelsea confirmed Friday that it had suspended five people from attending games at Stamford Bridge. Mandela video . When contacted by CNN about the latest allegations a Chelsea spokesperson said that the club would not be making an immediate statement before Saturday's English Premier League match against Burnley. Shortly before the 3pm kick off -- 10am EST -- Chelsea's official Twitter account released a video of several senior players and coach Mourinho reciting a Nelson Mandela quote. Supporters also held several signs, placards and banners denouncing racism as the match got underway. But those efforts could well now be overshadowed by allegations of a second alleged racist incident. ""It's clear that unfortunately there is still a minority who think it is acceptable to behave in such an abhorrent manner,"" Superintendent Gill Murray said. ""The men shouted as they walked through the station having alighted from the train a short time. There is more that needs to be done to address the issue once and for all and British Transport Police is actively working with football clubs, the football authorities and other key agencies to tackle this appalling behavior."" Meanwhile, Souleymane S. confirmed that he will not be taking up Chelsea's invitation to attend the second match against Paris St Germain in London. ""I am touched by the invitation from Mr Mourinho,"" he told Le Parisian Saturday. ""But I'm not in the right frame of mind to go to a stadium at the moment."" Chelsea draw, Man Utd lose . There would be no respite from Chelsea's terrible week after they drew 1-1 with relegation threatened Burnley. The match began brightly for the home side. Branislav Ivanovic, who scored in Paris on Tuesday night, scored again after good work from Belgium international Eden Hazard. But the game turned on a controversial sending off. Chelsea's Serbian international midfielder Nemanja Matic was on the receiving end of a horror tackle from Burnley's Ashley Barnes. Matic, who somehow avoided serious injury, reacted by pushing Barnes to the floor giving the referee little choice but to show the red card. Burnley pressed home their advantage and equalized late on through Ben Mee as the match finished 1-1. Manchester City will hope to make the most of Chelsea's rare slip when they play Newcastle in the Saturday evening kick off. Manchester United, meanwhile, threw away a one goal lead as Swansea City came from behind to win 2-1. Ander Herrera gave Manchester United the lead before goals from  Ki Sung-yueng and  Bafetimbi Gomis turned the game on its head. Arsenal leapfrogged Manchester United into third after what appeared at first to be a routine win against fellow London rivals Crystal Palace. A Santi Cazorla penalty and  Olivier Giroud goal had given the north London club what seemed like an unassailable lead. But Arsenal were left hanging on when Palace scored in the 95th minute and almost grabbed a second. But Arsenal held on and the match ended 2-1.","NEW: Met Police say three men in alleged racist incident in Paris have been identified .

"(CNN)  -- Low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of an Afriqiyah Airways flight that crashed just before landing in Tripoli, Libyan sources with knowledge of the investigation said Saturday. The plane, an Airbus A330-200, originated in Johannesburg, South Africa, and was at the end of its nearly nine-hour flight when it crashed Wednesday. All but one of the 104 passengers on board were killed. The sources said that as the pilot approached Tripoli International Airport, he took the plane off auto-pilot hoping to manually land the aircraft. He realized he was in trouble and tried to pull the plane up and turn the auto-pilot back on to give it another try, the sources said. But the effort was too late and the plane slammed violently into the ground, explaining the condition of the wreckage and damage to the plane's tail at the crash site, the sources said. An investigation into the crash is under way, and authorities are reviewing the aircraft's flight data recorder. Meanwhile Ruben van Assouw, the 9-year-old sole survivor of the plane crash, has returned home to the Netherlands. He suffered multiple fractures to his legs and underwent surgery at Al Khadra Hospital, said a doctor at the hospital who declined to give her name. Both of Ruben's parents and a brother were killed in the crash, a Dutch foreign ministry representative said. Ruben's family issued a statement Friday expressing gratitude to people who have helped them, such as Libyan hospital professionals and Dutch envoys, as well as the outpourings of sympathy from citizens in both countries. The family also thanked ""the vast majority of the Dutch media for respecting our privacy."" The family, which will raise Ruben, said the boy knows that his parents and brother were killed. ""Considering the circumstances, Ruben is doing fine. He is sleeping a lot; now and then he wakes up and is then lucid,"" the family said in the statement. ""He has drunk a little, and has seen the flowers and cuddly toys."" Ruben's family said it has to deal with ""two kinds of grief"" -- the sorrow the boy is enduring and the sadness over the loss of the other family members. ""The coming period will be very difficult for us,"" the family said. ""We hope that all the media will respect our privacy."" More than two-thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch, the ministry said. Passengers from Libya, South Africa, Belgium, Austria, Germany, France, Zimbabwe and Britain were also among the victims, the airline said on its Web site. The Dutch foreign ministry said Friday it is sending more experts to Tripoli to help Libyan authorities and Dutch colleagues identify the victims.","Sources: Mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of crashed plane .

"(CNN) -- If you fall off while riding a bike, get back on it as soon as you can. That's what conventional wisdom suggests. So what would be the advice to a cricketer who has inadvertently killed an opponent while bowling a short-pitched delivery? According to one former England cricketer, it's to deliver exactly the same ball. And that's what happened when Australian Sean Abbott returned to action, bowling competitively for the first time since delivering the 'bouncer' that resulted in the death of Phillip Hughes late last month. The New South Wales (NSW) player on Tuesday came on at the 12th over to applause from the small crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SGC) -- the same venue as the November 25 incident -- in the first session of a domestic four-day match against Queensland. The over included a bouncer, his fifth ball. Abbot went on to take two wickets and NSW bowling coach Geoff Lawson praised the 22-year-old's resilience. ""He's practiced well, he's looked good but you never know what's underneath the surface with young guys,"" said Lawson. ""But the proof is in the pudding -- he got onto this field and he did the business. He's a young guy on the way up and he played like it today so I guess his mindset is a pretty good one."" New South Wales players had black armbands on, in memory of Hughes. ""Abbott is doing the right thing by getting back on the pitch as soon as possible,"" Matthew Hoggard, who played for England between 2000-2008, told CNN prior to the start of Tuesday's game. ""If, in his first over, he can bowl a bouncer -- just to get rid of the stigma -- then he should. ""It would help get the horrible memory out of his mind."" ""The longer he goes on without bowling a bouncer, the worse it will get. He needs to get back to bowling like he did."" Australia and India pay tribute . The Australian Test team also took to the field competitively, as the postponed First Test against India also began on Tuesday in Adelaide. Prior to the game, players and coaching staff from both sides assembled on the field to honor Phil Hughes. Hughes was named as the 13th man for the match. A tribute by former Australian cricket captain and legendary commentary Richie Benaud played out followed by 63 seconds of applause. Hughes, who had been tipped to earn an international recall for the Test, had made 63 runs when he received the delivery that shocked and rocked the cricketing world. The Australian players all wore Hughes' Test cap number, 408, on their shirts as well as black armbands. In the build up, one of Australia's lead bowlers has said he will not be changing his approach against India, following an incident that has been frequently been described as 'freak' by those within the game. ""I've been bowling very aggressive for the last 18 months and I'm not going to change that,"" Mitchell Johnson told reporters. However, the paceman was left in a more quizzical mood when asked how he would react if one of his short-pitched deliveries were to hit an Indian batsman. ""I'm not sure,"" he replied. ""It might be (a) different (reaction) this time."" Hughes' domestic team, South Australia, took on Tasmania in Hobart. It was the first time also his former teammates had taken to the field since his death. Both teams paused for 63 seconds before the start of play to remember Hughes. According to local ABC media, the South Australian playets had ""PH 612"" etched on their shirts, in reference to Hughes' South Australian cap number. A bouncer is an aggressive delivery, pitched short and fast with a good ball rearing up at the batsman's upper torso and head. Abbott's ball to Hughes hit the batsman on the back of the head -- Hughes slumped to the floor and lost consciousness seconds after he was hit near his left ear. He was stretchered off the ground, put into an induced coma at hospital and and later died. 'Appalling incident' Abbott has received nothing but support from the cricket family across the globe but Hoggard hopes it can go one step further on Tuesday. Now retired, the former bowler believes the onus is on NSW's opponents Queensland to help the 22-year-old through his mental battle especially as his return to the game is at the same venue as the Hughes incident. ""To be stood at the wicket and run over the same spot where your friend died makes it doubly hard,"" opined Hoggard. ""The opposition has a big part to play as they need to tell Abbott to be himself and to bowl the short ball."" ""Bowling bouncers is within the laws of the game and they are part of a bowler's armory, so you have to bowl short pitch. ""I'm sure Phil Hughes would not have wanted those laws to change."" Yet it's not just Abbott that Hoggard is worried about, since his teammates were bystanders to one of the most appalling incidents in cricketing history. After the impact of the ball severed a vertebral artery, prompting a massive bleed into Hughes' brain, a number of New South Wales players -- Abbott included -- rushed to support the batsman's head after his collapse. ""They are all in the same boat,"" said Hoggard, who shed a tear at Hughes' death despite not knowing him. ""To have been holding their friend in their arms after the incident and then to find out later that he died, it would affect anybody. ""It's down to personality as to how they cope.""","Former England star advises Sean Abbott to bowl a 'bouncer' as early as possible .

"Jose Callejon scored a late winner for Real Madrid against Mallorca on Saturday evening as Jose Mourinho's men fought back from a goal down to defeat Mallorca 2-1 and extend their lead at the top of La Liga. Israeli international Tomer Hemed gave Mallorca the lead in the 39th minute which they held on to until the last quarter of the match. Substitute Gonzalo Higuain leveled the scores in the 71st minute before Callejon netted five minutes from the end to give Real an eight-point cushion over rivals Barcelona who play Real Betis at the Nou Camp on Sunday. Third-placed Valencia missed the chance to move within one point of Barca as they slumped to a 1-0 home defeat to Real Sociedad. French winger Antoine Griezmann's deflected shot in the 55 minute proving enough to earn Sociedad a vital win. Earlier, Sevilla and Espanyol played out a 0-0 draw, while bottom-of-the-table Real Zaragoza earned a point with a 1-1 draw as they hosted mid-table Getafe. Mauricio Lanzaro gave them the lead with a well-executed header in the 39th minute, but 11 minutes from time Zaragoza defender Javier Paredes scored an own goal. It denied the home side a valuable three points which would have put them in touch with fellow strugglers Sporting Gijon and Villarreal. Meanwhile in Italy, Saturday's only fixture between Catania and Roma was abandoned 20 minutes into the second half due to a waterlogged pitch. The kick-off had already been delayed due to a torrential downpour, but further rain during the game forced referee to Paolo Tagliavento to take the players off and eventually force a premature end to the match with the score a 1-1. Nicola Legrottaglie put the hosts ahead in the 24th minute but Roma responded with an equalizer three minutes later courtesy of a strike from Daniele De Rossi.","Real Madrid come from behind to beat Mallorca 2-1 .

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday night that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's steps toward a run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination would have no bearing on his own decision about whether to jump into the race, a decision he will make later this year. Bush's announcement last week that he was ""actively exploring"" a run was a blow to Christie's ambitions because the two men will be competing for many of the same donors as they test their viability as candidates. But Bush will be leaning on a far deeper network of financial supporters that came together to back the winning presidential campaigns of his father, George H.W. Bush, and his brother, George W. Bush. Many of those donors were intrigued by Christie before the George Washington Bridge scandal broke earlier this year. During an hour-long interview with Steve Adubato on NJTV, Christie said his decision would be based solely on three factors. ""Is it right for me? Is it right for my family? Is it right for the country ... If I answer 'yes' to all three of those things then I will run. If I don't answer 'yes' to all three then I won't,"" he said. Adubato pressed him on how much a run by Bush would affect his plans. ""It's not one of the three questions,"" Christie said with a faint smile. He did not elaborate on his thoughts or make any comments sizing up Bush as competition. Christie, who has faced many questions about his temperament as he has moved on to the national stage, also waved off questions about whether his brusque and sometimes confrontational manner would wear well over time. Adubato noted that Christie's demeanor has in many ways been ""his calling card"" and how he gets ""stuff done,"" but asked whether he would modulate his behavior to appear more ""presidential. "" ""No,"" Christie responded with characteristic bluntness. ""Why would I? It's who I am."" ""If people want somebody different, then if I ever ran for president, they'd vote for somebody different,"" he said. ""I don't intend to become a phony to win an election."" RELATED: Poll: America not ready for 'Jersey Guy' president . Christie added that members of the public rarely ask him about those traits, and argued that the subject is an obsession of reporters. In a recent incident where he told a heckler to ""sit down and shut up,"" he noted that many news outlets only ran that sentence without showing him let the man ""yell, go on, block the cameras with his signs, speak over me, get booed by the crowd."" The governor said he told the man that he would talk to him later -- a part, he said, that often gets edited out of the footage -- but that he stood by his direction to the heckler to sit down and shut up. ""I don't regret that for one second and I wouldn't change that part of myself,"" he said. ""What you all do,"" he said, referring to the media, ""is to take that small part and say 'Look at him, all someone had to do was stand up and something, and bang, he says sit down and shut up.'"" ""People like to watch that,"" he said. He joked that his sometime unpredictable demeanor was one reason why people were tuning in to Monday night's hour-long interview. ""I don't think they've seen me punch you yet,"" he said to Adubato. ""But they live in hope.""","Chris Christie says Jeb Bush's plans will not affect his .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Scientists have found what they described this week as the earliest oil paintings ever discovered. Afghan murals show oil painting was going on for centuries earlier in Asia than Europe. Murals found on cave walls in Afghanistan prove that painting with oil had been going on in Asia for centuries before artists used the technique in Europe, scientists said this week. Until now, art historians believed that oil painting started in Europe in the 15th century. Scientists found the murals in a network of caves where monks lived and prayed in the Afghan region of Bamiyan, according to a statement on the Web site of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, where the ancient paintings were analyzed. Until 2001, two colossal 6th-century statues of Buddhas stood at the mouth of the caves. Then the Taliban, which then ruled Afghanistan, blew up the statues on the grounds that they were un-Islamic. The action drew international condemnation. Inside the caves, scientists found murals painted in the 7th century. They show images of Buddha in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures. In 12 of 50 caves, the murals were painted using drying oils -- perhaps from walnuts and poppy seeds -- the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility said. Its findings on the age of the oil paintings were published this week in The Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry. ""This is the earliest clear example of oil paintings in the world,"" said Yoko Taniguchi, leader of the team of scientists. Bamiyan, about 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of Kabul, was once a thriving center of commerce and Buddhism. The paintings, scientists say, were probably the work of artists who traveled along the Silk Road, the ancient trade route between China, across Central Asia's desert to the West. The Taliban used dozens of explosives to demolish the Buddha statues in Bamiyan. Museums and governments around the world had hoped to save the two Buddhas, the earliest of which is thought to have been carved into sandstone cliffs in the third century A.D. At heights of 53 meters and 36 meters, the statues were the tallest standing Buddhas in the world. Later in 2001, U.S.-led forces toppled the Taliban following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Now, the United Nations cultural agency, UNESCO, is trying to restore the bigger of the two statues. The task could take years.

"They came home from school to find their father missing. It had started off like any other day. As usual, Ronald Soza dropped off his kids Cesia, 17, and Ronald Jr., 14, at school in Pompano Beach, Florida. Ronald Soza returned home to find U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents waiting for him at his doorstep. Soza, an undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua, was taken to a detention center. When the teens -- both legal residents -- came home to an empty house at the end of the day, they realized something was very wrong. Then the phone rang. It was their father, trying to reassure them that everything would be OK. ""Even though we knew my father might get deported, we never thought that it would actually happen, especially since ICE already took our mother away five years ago,"" Cesia told CNN. But it did happen. Ronald Soza was deported to Nicaragua, joining his wife, Marisela. Suddenly, the teens' parents were gone and the Soza children faced a frightening future with foster families and unfamiliar schools. It's been weeks since that terrible day last September, and they still haven't seen either of their parents. The Soza kids ""were devastated after their mother was deported,"" said Nora Sandigo, a family friend and immigrant rights activist. Now, they're ""living a tragedy ...  they've lost everything, their parents, home... everything."" Now they're living with Sandigo and her husband and two girls in Miami. How immigration reform would affect 3 families . ICE told CNN in a written statement that Soza was arrested last year and was allowed to return home under certain conditions, such as attending appointments with immigration authorities. But while under supervision, Soza committed 39 violations, including failure to attend appointments with immigration authorities, according to ICE. Cesia said her father was overwhelmed with his single-dad duties. He did attend his ICE appointments, she said, although ""it's possible he arrived a few minutes late. But perhaps they counted that a no-show."" The siblings represent America's young legal residents who are at risk for long-term emotional trauma because of a system that doesn't deal with the situation. About 5,100 U.S. children in 22 states have lost parents to deportation, according to the Applied Research Center -- a 30-year-old racial justice think tank. Some 15,000 more face similar threat in the next five years. These families live in constant fear of deportation as their kids attend school and pledge allegiance to the flag. Constantly worrying that their parents will be snatched away, children often feel angry, helpless and trapped. Families like the Sozas are referred to by the system as ""mixed-status families."" Ronald Jr. was born in the United States. Cesia -- who was born in Nicaragua -- lives in the U.S. legally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. DACA grants two-year reprieves from deportation to undocumented youths who came to the U.S. as children. At their father's request, Sandigo has become the Sozas' legal guardian. She receives no government funds to offset the cost of raising them. Making ends meet isn't easy. The Soza teens rely on whatever their parents can send from Nicaragua. It's not much. Their father -- who works in construction -- says he has had a difficult time finding a job since moving there. ""We've had to leave everyone we knew behind, switch schools, and we're constantly trying to catch up in our new school,"" said Cesia. In the middle of all the chaos, she's been juggling paperwork for her immigration status while filing applications to several universities. Another problem: being under Sandigo's guardianship may threaten Cesia's ability to qualify for college financial aid. ""It's been really stressful doing all this without my parents,"" she said. ""I miss them so much."" But the siblings have managed to hold on to a few reminders of their former life: some family photos and their precious Chinese Shar-Pei, Snoopy. They talk to their parents on the phone every day. Cesia says it doesn't come close to having them by her side. Anguishing decision . Their behavior has changed since that day in September, Sandigo said. At school, the teens keep to themselves and don't talk much with other kids. Sandigo worries they may be depressed and are withdrawing from social interaction. Experts say repercussions of traumatic experiences like the Sozas' can take a serious toll. ""The psychological effects on these children left behind include depression, possible conduct disorders, and having a constant sense of a diminishing and ambiguous future,"" said Dr. Luis H. Zayas, dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Texas. ""No parent should be put through such an anguishing decision of whether or not to leave a child behind, but most importantly, how will these kids feel about their government when they grow up?"" An estimated 340,000 babies born in the United States in 2008 were the children of unauthorized immigrants, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. That number is projected to grow. On average, 17 children are placed in state care each day as a result of the detention and removal of immigrant parents, according to ICE. Some kids are fortunate enough to have other family to stay with, said Zayas. Others get lost in the child welfare system. In some cases, younger children are transferred to state custody and put up for adoption, never to see their parents again. In the end, Zayas warns that the policy threatens to hurt the nation in the long run. ""What other future does the U.S. have other than losing a whole generation of kids because of the way their parents were treated?"" Torn between two nations . Desperate to reunite with their parents, Cesia and Robert Jr. have considered moving to Nicaragua -- an idea opposed by their father, who believes there's no future for them there. The parents left Nicaragua in the 1980s because the government, they said, was putting too much emphasis on political indoctrination and social control. But the teens' argument about why they should stay in the U.S. is this: They feel they are Americans. The United States is their home. ""I came here when I was 18 months old and I don't know Nicaragua at all,"" Cesia said. Ronald Jr. admitted his Spanish is less than perfect. ""I can contribute more here than in Nicaragua,"" he said. Sandigo wishes she could do more to help. ""But I can't replace their parents,"" she said. She accuses the Obama administration of failing to honor its pledge to make parents like the Sozas less likely to be deported. The Obama administration stated in 2012 that undocumented immigrants without criminal records would be considered low-priority removals, including those parents of U.S.-born children with strong ties in the United States. Sandigo argues that if this were the case, Cesia and Ronald Jr. would be with their parents today. Overall, Sandigo questions whether federal officials are committed to making sure children whose parents are deported are properly taken care of. ""I have yet to receive a call from ICE asking if these children are even alive -- yet with a legal guardian,"" she said. It's almost impossible to know the full scope of the problem. Child welfare departments and the federal government aren't required to track cases of families separated by deportation. During the past 25 years, Sandigo says she has found homes for about 800 children whose parents have been detained or deported. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers seem to give little attention to the situation. Some say a bipartisan immigration reform bill passed by Senate in 2012 might help. Supporters say it aims to provide a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, strengthen border security and change the visa system. Opponents in the House, many of them Republicans, reject any reform that involves what they consider ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants. In Florida, the Soza children long to see their parents again. And they haven't given up. ""Although we are separated, we are still united in a way,"" said Cesia. ""I have to stay hopeful that this will all work out."" Immigration reform would help GOP .","Teen siblings who are legal U.S. residents were left alone after feds deported immigrant parents .

"Did police in Ferguson, Missouri, deliberately fire tear gas and rubber bullets at a television news crew Wednesday night? Photos and videos from the Al Jazeera America camera crew were widely shared in the wake of Wednesday's incident, which Al Jazeera called an ""egregious assault on freedom of the press that was clearly intended to have a chilling effect on our ability to cover this important story."" The images showed a tear gas canister exploding close to the Al Jazeera correspondent Ash-har Quraishi, who tried to shield himself from the smoke. Was it intentional? Quraishi's crew members seem to think so. ""We were clearly set up as press with a full live shot set-up,"" producer Marla Cichowski said in an e-mail, responding to questions from CNN. ""As soon as (the) first bullet hit the car, we screamed out loud, 'We are press,' 'This is the media.'"" Cichowski said there's no way to know who ordered police to shoot in their direction. ""But they shined a huge floodlight at us before firing, and I can only imagine they could see what they were shooting at."" Sam Winslade, the videographer, said in another e-mail message that ""we were fired at from a police MRAP vehicle."" MRAP is shorthand for a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, something usually associated with war zones. The crew left their equipment where it was, and moved on foot to what they thought was a safer location. ""We sought shelter between houses,"" Winslade said, and then they called 911 and Al Jazeera's New York assignment desk. A little bit later, another MRAP vehicle approached the area where the crew was seeking shelter. ""We (a group of three) yelled out to the MRAP (that) we were press and we approached vehicle with hands visible,"" Winslade said.  ""They opened the back of the vehicle and ordered us inside. Whilst the doors were open and we were outside -- I do recall seeing 'SWAT type' firearms pointed at us. We were helped aboard, and taken back to our vehicle."" On the way back, Winslade added, they passed what he believes was the MRAP vehicle that shot at them on their way out of the area. Heightening the confusion, the crew members did not know which police force fired the tear gas and rubber bullets, nor which police force picked them up and drove them back to their vehicle. On Thursday morning, a representative of the St. Charles County Sheriff's Department told The Wrap that its SWAT team did not fire the tear gas, but did pick up the crew later. Ferguson Mayor Jay Knowles told CNN Thursday that the St. Louis County police have been ""in charge tactically since Sunday."" Another camera crew nearby, from the local television station and CNN affiliate KSDK, recorded what happened to the Al Jazeera crew. By Thursday morning, its pictures were being broadcast on CNN and other networks. The KSDK video showed police officers placing Al Jazeera's lights and other equipment on the ground. But something happened in between the tear-gassing and the police interference with the equipment, Winslade said: Local residents came over to the camera position and ""played with the camera on the tripod."" Nothing was damaged, but Winslade's account suggests that the police action might have been intended to deter residents from damaging the expensive equipment. Al Jazeera America, an offshoot of the Qatar-based international news network that recently marked its one-year anniversary, said in a statement that ""thankfully all three crew members are physically fine."" ""We believe that this situation must be investigated along with those involving our colleagues at other media outlets,"" the network added.

The Rossoneri were 3-0 down at the interval following goals from Guillermo Giacomazzi, a Massimo Oddo  penalty and Carlos Grossmuller. But Ghana international Boateng came off the bench to spark a remarkable turn around with a 14-minute treble. Yepes then headed home in the 83rd minute to give Massimiliano Allegri's men an unlikely  victory. ""It was very important that we could win this game, it was unbelievable, we came back, I scored three goals,"" man-of-the-match Boateng told AFP. Boateng's effort was the fastest triple in Italy since David Trezeguet scored a 10-minute  hat-trick for Juventus in 2001. Elsewhere, Udinese went top with a 3-0 victory over newly-promoted Novara. Captain Antonio Di Natale scored a double and Maurizio Domizzi added the  third as their side opened up a two-point lead over Juventus, who were held to a 2-2 draw by Genoa Saturday. Milan's city rivals Inter won their second game in a row as Thiago Motta scored the only goal in their 1-0 defeat of Chievo in the San Siro. In Germany's Bundesliga there was a big upset as leaders Bayern Munich lost 2-1 at Hannover in a bad-tempered game in which both sides ended with 10 men. Norway striker Mohammed  Abdellaoue and Germany's Christian Pander scored for Hannover to inflict only Bayern's second defeat of the season. After Abdellaoue converted a 23rd-minute penalty for Hannover, the contest reached a fever pitch with a players from both sides in a mass brawl. Bayern had defender Jerome Boateng sent off and Pander increased the lead after 50 minutes. Hannover were also reduced  to 10 men when captain Steven Cherundolo was sent off for a foul on Franck Ribery just after the hour mark. David Alaba pulled a goal back for the leaders with seven minutes left and Bastian Schweinsteiger hit the post, but the home side hung on. Defending champions Borussia Dortmund won 5-0 against Cologne Saturday and trail Bayern by three points.","Kevin-Prince Boateng hits 14-minute hat-trick for AC Milan .

"A leading Italian soccer coach has called for stronger action against racism after a top-level match between AC Milan and Roma was suspended Sunday due to abusive chants by supporters. Milan striker Mario Balotelli was targeted by visiting fans throughout the match, and referee Gianluca Rocchi called the game to a halt in the second half to warn the crowd via the public address system. After several minutes' delay, the match continued and ended in a 0-0 draw. Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri later said the official's decision was not strong enough. ""In my opinion, there's only one solution to racism in stadium and that's suspend the match,"" Allegri said on Milan's website. ""To get rid of this stuff in our stadiums, you have to make big decisions. It could penalize some people but in the long run it would help us to grow as a nation and become more civilized."" He told reporters at the post-match conference: ""There's no point in interrupting the game. It's a middle ground decision and it serves no purpose. Either the game should be suspended or you keep playing. ""Mario gave all he had this evening, but he's 22 years old and always subject to these racist boos and that's not good. People go to the stadium to watch the two teams but there's always these uncivilized people."" Roma was fined €50,000 ($65,000) by the Italian league on Monday, its fans having been accused of abusing three Milan players -- though none were named in the Lega Calcio's notification of the punishment. The club issued a statement saying it ""condemns any form of racial abuse."" ""This type of behavior from any football supporters, including ours, is completely unacceptable,"" it said. ""We are committed to facing this issue head-on to rid our sport of this problem and promote respect for all."" The Italian football authorities are battling to eradicate racism at matches, with several clubs having been fined for offenses. New rules have been implemented which allow referees to stop matches if racist abuse continues after an official warning. Milan's Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch due to racist abuse during a friendly match against a lower league team in January, being followed by his teammates. He has since joined the anti-racism task force set up by world soccer's governing body FIFA. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he was ""appalled"" by the abuse at the Milan-Roma game. ""Tackling this issue is complex, but we're committed to action, not just words,"" Blatter said on Twitter. Balotelli, who has Ghanaian immigrant parents, has been targeted by racists since returning to his native Italy from English club Manchester City during the January transfer window. The Italy international striker was also involved in another controversial incident during the Roma match, which ended up with teammate Sulley Muntari being sent off after manhandling the referee. Muntari took offense when Rocchi booked Balotelli in the first half, and was ordered off after trying to prevent the referee from issuing another yellow card when the midfielder protested the decision. The veteran Ghana international clasped the official's arms and kept them pinned to his side, but was eventually sent from the pitch after Boateng intervened to calm him down. ""Sulley made a mistake but it's in the past now,"" Allegri told reporters. ""He's mortified and it was a blow playing the game with 10 men, but he shouldn't be crucified."" The draw mean third-placed Milan ended the weekend two points ahead of Fiorentina in the race to win a place in the qualifying rounds of the European Champions League next season, with one match still to play. Fiorentina stayed in contention by beating Palermo 1-0 with a first-half goal from veteran striker Luca Toni that relegated the visiting team. Balotelli racially abused again in Italy: Why Serie A must act now . To miss out on the Champions League, Milan will have to lose next weekend's final match at relegated Siena, while Fiorentina must beat bottom club Pescara -- or win by more than four goals if the Rossoneri draw. Earlier Sunday, Edinson Cavani took his Serie A-leading goal tally to 28 as second-placed Napoli came from behind to beat Siena 2-1 thanks to Marek Hamsik's injury-time winner. Hamsik had earlier set up Cavani's leveling header with 17 minutes to play. Udinese stayed fifth with a 2-1 win over Atalanta as Antonio Di Natale scored both goals to take his total this season to 22, keeping the striker second behind Cavani.","Milan-Roma match is suspended in second half due to racist abuse by visiting fans .

"""This is the start of the new Manchester United,"" trumpeted Louis Van Gaal after his expensively rebuilt side kick started its Premier League campaign with a 4-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford Sunday. A defeat and two lackluster draws prior to the international break had left the English powerhouses languishing near the foot of the standings, but this was the first match when all his new signings were in action. Two of them, Angel Di Maria and Ander Herrera, were on the score sheet while Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo also made their first starts. With United 4-0 up in the second half, Colombian striker Radamel Falcao was also given his debut from the bench, but could not add to the scoreline. Former Real Madrid star Di Maria was particularly impressive and his curling free kick gave United an early lead. He also played a part in the buildup to Herrera's strike for the second and for Wayne Rooney to score a fine third just before half time. England captain Rooney is now the joint-third top scorer in Premier League history. The second half proved left eventful but it was Di Maria again who set up Juan Mata for the fourth before Falcao was introduced with 23 minutes remaining, showing a few glimpses of his undoubted talent. Harry Redknapp's QPR offered little in reply but it was still a morale boosting win for Dutchman Van Gaal, who succeeded David Moyes as United manager after their poor 2013-4 campaign. Van Gaal has been set a target of a top-three finish to guarantee automatic qualification to the Champions League next season, but is already setting his sights higher. ""I want to win the Premier League title,"" he announced after the victory. ""If it is not this year then the second or third year. I want to give a championship to the fans."" His side were ending a four-match winless run, which also included an embarrassing defeat to third flight MK Dons in the English League Cup. ""This is special because it is also the birthday of my wife (Truss). I have already given her a present but she said the biggest present shall be the victory. We give it to her,"" Van Gaal added. In other football action Sunday, Hanover 96 joined Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen at the top of the Bundesliga after a 2-0 win over Hamburg, which left the visitors at the bottom of the table. First-half goals from Leon Andreasen and Artur Sobiech gave Hanover three points to move to seven points after three games with champions Bayern and Leverkusen. In La Liga, Valencia continued its unbeaten start to move into second place with a 3-1 win at home to Espanyol. Pablo Piatti, Dani Parejo and Paco Alcacer scored for Valencia in a comfortable win.","Manchester United beat QPR 4-0 at Old Trafford .

"(CNN)So, Sony and Marvel have joined forces to take the Spider-Man movie franchise in ""a new creative direction,"" with the next installment planned to hit theaters in July 2017. That's right -- another ""Spider-Man"" reboot, announced just nine months after Spidey's last swing through theaters in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" and three years after the franchise's first relaunch. Sigh. Again? Already? Seriously? According to the Hollywood Reporter, star Andrew Garfield is not returning as Spider-Man, freeing the producers of the next movie to cast a new face. OK, so maybe Sony and Marvel are eager to purge the sour aftertaste of the last ""Spider-Man"" movie, which was savaged by fans and critics alike. But even by Hollywood's increasingly impatient time frame for relaunching superheroes, this move feels awfully hasty. The Internet, usually awash in enthusiastic fanboys, was skeptical. ""We're <10 years away from a Spider-Man movie that reboots itself during the movie,"" tweeted New York Times culture reporter Dave Itzkoff. By Tuesday afternoon, Twitter jokesters were rallying around the hashtag #PutSpiderManInEveryMovie. And among fans another theme emerged: If they're going to reboot ""Spider-Man"" again, maybe it's time to get more creative with casting. Some people are clamoring for new movies based on an alternate version of Spider-Man by Marvel Comics that replaces Peter Parker -- the hero from the original 1962 comic -- with Miles Morales, a teenager who is half Latino, half African-American. Monday's deal between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Disney's Marvel Studios allows them to share Spider-Man, meaning that the web-slinging superhero could also appear in movies with, say, Captain America or Iron Man. Whichever way Sony and Marvel go, there's a lot of money at stake. The five ""Spider-Man"" movies have earned more than $4 billion worldwide, making it the most successful franchise in the history of Sony Pictures. But people may be wearying of the series in its current form. Each of the last four ""Spider-Man"" movies made less money than its predecessor. We understand that risk-averse Hollywood loves superhero movies, which earn big profits in overseas markets, jump-start lucrative franchises and sell lots of related merchandise. But rushing out another, similar ""Spider-Man"" could come across like a creatively empty cash grab. Wouldn't it be better for Sony and Marvel give Spidey a break?  That way they could give fans time to breathe, build anticipation for a reimagined character and take the series in a bold new direction that reflects 2020, not 1962.","Sony is teaming with Marvel and rebooting the ""Spider-Man"" movies again .

"(CNN)Recently, the new on-demand economy met U.S. employment law, and the encounter left both sides dazed and confused. In San Francisco, one federal district judge speculated that the ride-sharing company Uber may have to treat its drivers as employees rather than independent contractors.  In another courtroom in the same city, a different judge, hearing a lawsuit brought by drivers for Uber's rival, Lyft, opined that U.S. employment laws actually may not cover the drivers as employees. Neither court has yet issued a final decision, but when they do, both judges will be right. Work -- both its structure and its very nature -- is undergoing rapid change in our country. Major corporations are increasingly using subcontracting structures, like outsourcing jobs, hiring workers through staffing agencies, and franchising. By calling workers ""independent contractors,"" companies hope to divest themselves of their legal responsibilities as employers.  At the same time, companies retain enormous control over when, where and how workers do their bidding and build their profits. Companies like Uber and Lyft fit squarely within this paradigm, forcing their drivers (or ""partners,"" in Uber-speak) to bear all of the risk of running their own businesses -- investing in cars, paying for maintenance, insurance and gasoline, but without any guarantee of steady work --while sending much of the rewards to the company. Uber alone is valued at over $41 billion. According to Uber's own survey, the company is comprised of largely part-time drivers making roughly $300 to $400 a week, before paying off their expenses. In the new on-demand economy, companies are turning the Internet into the equivalent of a street corner hiring site and turning workers into day laborers. Hundreds of thousands of people work days-long or hours-long ""gigs"" -- housecleaning for Homejoy, stocking shelves through Wonolo, or running errands as Taskrabbits. Some gigs last only minutes, and pay as little as a penny per task, including those posted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. These piece-rate workers do the jobs that computers can't do (yet).  They tag online images, write copy for websites or match performers to labels on CDs. Like the Uber and Lyft drivers, workers who take on these kinds of jobs through online platforms are on their own.  Unless the courts rule otherwise, they will continue to be treated as independent businesses. That means they will have no access to basic legal rights like minimum wage, overtime pay, workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, employer-provided benefits and most critically, the formal right to come together and bargain with the companies for better wages and working conditions. While some workers will, like taxi drivers already have, organize and win fair treatment independent of what the courts rule, that task will be a hard one for workers who work in isolation, cut off from one another. Experts say this is just the beginning of a brave new world in which most workers will have a ""portfolio"" instead of a job.  Even now, Uber claims 160,000 drivers use its application to find customers and earn money. Mechanical Turk claims 500,000 ""turkers"" across the globe. PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimated last summer that the sharing economy as a whole, valued at $15 billion in 2013, could reach $335 billion globally by 2025.  It's not hard to see who wins and who loses in this scenario. More people, working in what former U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Robert Reich calls the ""sharing the scraps"" economy, will have less to live on, no ability to progress in a job and nothing to live on at the end of their work life. As the San Francisco judges recognize, these developments have implications not only for the way in which work is organized, but for whether or not work delivers decent pay and working conditions, the right to join with other workers to improve jobs and the social safety net on which workers rely when they are between jobs or ready to retire from the world of work. If this is our future, we have to get it right. And we can get it right.  We can deliver a decent standard of living for a decent day's work to these workers and those who will follow them.  The jury may still be out on whether companies like Uber, Lyft, and Wonolo and platforms like Mechanical Turk may be employers in the traditional sense.  Some of them certainly are, and some companies will have to treat their workers as employees. But we have other policy solutions close at hand, because we have seen these structures before.  The new platforms operate just like the traditional labor brokers in the agriculture and garment industries, who recruit workers, match them with jobs, and make a tidy profit for themselves in the bargain. Why shouldn't Uber, Lyft, and their kin be required, just like other labor brokers are, to register, pay their workers minimum wage and overtime, limit the commissions they are allowed to keep from each job they arrange and pay the payroll taxes that ensure workers have access to basic benefits like workers' compensation when they are injured and Social Security when they retire? Given the kind of huge revenue being generated in some of these companies, it's not a lot to ask. For the sake of our economic future, we need to make sure that these companies treat workers fairly. America cannot thrive off of a nation of freelancers who are sharing the scraps.","In the new on-demand economy, companies like Uber are turning workers into day laborers .

"(CNN)The city of Los Angeles is expecting more than 40 million visitors this year. If you're among the inbound, you're going to need to do a lot more than leave the heavy coats at home and drop a few ""dudes"" into your repartee if you don't want to be mistaken for the latest Hollywood wannabe to drop off a turnip truck. Follow these tips and you just might pass for a local. If your deception goes well, you can bring your suave Angeleno persona home from vacation and try it out with your locals. Just don't push it. Having ""I Love L.A."" as a ringtone is a little much. 1. Don't mention the weather . The wonderful monotony of not-too-hot, low-humidity days and mild nights is taken for granted. Weather isn't a topic of conversation -- unless something really weird is happening, like, you know, rain. 2. For God's sake, don't order a Corona . Corona is the sort of bland corporate bilge a Budweiser drinker graduates to when he gets his first good job after college, so have a Bohemia or a Negro Modelo instead. And unless you're auditioning for the role of village idiot, don't ask ""when is Cinco de Mayo this year?"" That's been known to happen. Really. 3. In Venice Beach, don't be nonplussed by anything . If every day is like an R-rated variety show overseen by an LSD aficionado -- and in Venice Beach it is -- you deal with it. You don't go slack-jawed when you see a five-legged dog relieving himself on a square of grass while mustachioed women and men with elaborate facial tattoos full of typos look on. 4. In Hollywood, show your cool . If you wangle an invitation to a ""screener"" -- a showing of a completed but unreleased movie for industry types and critics -- be early. There aren't any trailers. Seven p.m. means the feature starts at 7 p.m. Don't be demonstrative or loud. You're there because you have something to do with the film industry. This is your job. Be cool. 5. Eat at a food truck . The food truck scene is amazing and getting more so. Example: Get Toasted, a truck featuring superb Filipino-Mexican hybrid comfort food, comes along, and its originality and excellence don't even stand out. 6. Honor the local deities . There are popular Angelenos, there are admired Angelenos. And then there are the Angelenos who might as well be secular gods, they're so beloved. The first is warm, witty Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, who has been announcing the team's games since 1950, when the franchise was in Brooklyn. Scully manages to be funny and insightful without ever being mean. He's like family to millions of people. Scully used to be alone on this island of extreme L.A. esteem. Now he's been joined by Magic Johnson, the sunny former Lakers superstar turned AIDS activist and business tycoon. Magic is so gracious that he almost seems too good to be true. He's true. In a city full of phonies and in a sports world full of arrogant jerks, he easily connects with everyone. Don't diss Magic. Or Vin. Unless you want people to think you're from San Francisco. 7. Have an opinion on Shaq and Kobe . If you live in L.A., especially if you're a male able to breathe, you have to have a considered take on Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, the testy NBA duo that brought three consecutive NBA titles to the Los Angeles Lakers. Their snippy, contentious 1995-2004 run with the Lakers amounts to the ""Citizen Kane"" of real-life sports psychodramas. You can be pro-Shaq: Kobe didn't want Shaq to win a fourth NBA Finals MVP in the 2004 matchup with Detroit, so he wouldn't pass to Shaq even though Shaq was being covered by a midget, costing the Lakers the title. You can be pro-Kobe: Bleep Shaq. If he cared as much as Kobe, the Lakers would have won the Finals every year. You can be down on both: Shaq coasted on raw physical dominance more than any athlete ever, and yeah, Kobe works hard, but in his heart of hearts, he is me-first. But for God's sake, don't say, ""You know that Shaq and Kobe? They were sure something!"" At least if you're a male able to breathe. 8. Be discreet about celebrity sightings . If you're eager to see someone famous, that defines you as a non-Angeleno. But if you really want a celebrity story to take back home, you can get one a lot more discreetly than by hanging around Nobu or Chateau Marmont and gawking at the patrons. Instead, go to the fancy Pavilions grocery store on Heathercliff Road in Malibu. On a Saturday morning, you can't throw a rock without hitting someone who's at least been a regular on a network TV show. But you might not recognize him or her -- because at Pavilions, unlike Nobu, the celebrities aren't wearing copious makeup. Chris Reed moved to Los Angeles County in 1990 and has been a Southern California journalist ever since, writing for such newspapers as the Los Angeles Daily News and Orange County Register and appearing dozens of times on ""The John & Ken Show"" on KFI AM 640 and ""AirTalk with Larry Mantle"" on KPCC-FM, a PBS affiliate.","Dying to be part of the L.A. scene?

"(CNN)Bali's most renowned dishes, made rich by the heavy use of local herbs and spices, are traditionally eaten during the colorful Hindu ceremonies that punctuate life on the Indonesian island. Dining out is a relatively recent development in Bali -- a few generations ago people may have grabbed takeaway from warungs (small shops and restaurants) but generally did not go out to eat. These days though, plenty of classic dishes are served everywhere from tiny warungs through to high-end restaurants, making it easy for travelers to savor the flavors of real Balinese cuisine. Babi guling (suckling pig) Pork dishes are relatively hard to find across the mostly Muslim Indonesian archipelago, but Bali's famed suckling pig makes any roaming traveler's wait worthwhile. While strictly speaking a suckling pig should still be feeding on its mother's milk, in Bali the pigs used in this popular dish can weigh about 70 kilograms (150 pounds). They are rubbed with turmeric then stuffed with a ""base gede,"" or spice paste, which usually includes a combination of coriander seeds, lemongrass, Asian lime leaves and salam leaves, chillies, black pepper, garlic, red shallots, ginger and kencur (lesser galangal). The pig is roasted on a spit over coconut husks or wood to tender perfection. When ordering a plate, expect sliced meat, a few pieces of satay, caramelized crackling and more obscure parts, like crispy intestines -- this is nose-to-tail dining at its most traditional. While warungs serve the dish right across the island, Ibu Oka's in Ubud (Jalan Suweta/Tegal Sari No. 2) is the most renowned place to try it and is the choice of Bali-based U.S. pastry chef Will Goldfarb, of Mejekawi and Room 4 Dessert. ""They don't need the press, but I hate the haters,"" he says. Richard Millar, director of cuisine at W Retreat, suggests Pak Malen Warung in Seminyak (Sunset Road). ""The skin is served crispy and the meat is always tender -- they also offer a special that is served with rice and spicy soup which is delicious."" Lawar . Lawar is a crunch-tender mix of vegetables, grated coconut meat and minced meat mixed with various heady herbs and spices, and often fresh blood -- every village has its own version. While it's the usual accompaniment to babi guling, lawar can stand as a dish in its own right -- lawar nangka, or young jackfruit lawar, is an example. Mamasan and Sarong chef Will Meyrick recommends the nasi lawar campur at Warung Lawar Sapi Odah (Pantai Segara, Sanur). ""This place is always packed,"" Meyrick says, adding that the variety of dishes accompanying the lawar are excellent. ""The serapah sapi, which is a mixture of shredded vegetables, velvety offal, thick blood and coconut milk, is just a winner. Don't be off put by the inclusion of blood, it is a part of every meat dish adding flavor, freshness and texture."" Bebek betutu (slow cooked duck) Another ceremonial dish, bebek betutu needs to be cooked for so long that you'll have to order it a day in advance. Chef Penny Williams from Bali Asli (Jalan Raya Gelumpang, Gelumpang, Amlapura) explains that the duck is first rubbed with tamarind puree and salt to purify any ""ducky"" aromas and tenderize the meat. This is then washed off and the bird (chicken is often used instead) is stuffed with eggs, cassava leaves and bumbu rajeng, a spice mix specifically created for this dish. It's then wrapped in ""upeh"", or betel nut husks, and slow cooked until the meat falls off the bone. ""There are variations, as upeh can be difficult to find and expensive at times -- banana leaves can also be used,"" says Williams. While Bali Asli occasionally makes the chicken version, a good spot to sample the succulent duck dish is at German chef Heinz van Holzen's long-running Bumbu Bali (Jalan Pratama, Tanjung Benoa). Sate lembat . Bali's take on satay, the classic meat-on-a-stick dish found across the Indonesian archipelago, is minced meat pounded in a mortar and pestle with young grated coconut and a bumbu, or spice mixture, that varies according to region. It may be similar to the pastes used in babi guling or bebek betutu but perhaps with cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, tamarind or cumin seeds also making an appearance. The seasoned meat is shaped around a split bamboo skewer and quickly barbecued, often while hand-fanned, over hot coals. Forget the peanut sauce found elsewhere, sate in Bali is accompanied with shrimp paste-based sambal ""matah"", meaning raw or alive. Sate is a popular street food dish so it can be found at any busy market, but a higher-end option is the Alila Uluwatu's Warung (Jalan Belimbing Sari, Banjar Tambiyak, Desa Pecatu), where the sate lilit ikan is served on aromatic lemongrass skewers. Ikan bakar (grilled fish) Jimbaran-style . While not a particularly authentic Balinese dish, tucking into ikan bakar (grilled fish) seaside in Jimbaran Bay as the sun sets, toes flexing in the sand as candles flicker to life, is a quintessential Bali dining experience. Merah Putih, chef Wayan Mustika, suggests heading to Lia Cafe, reputed to be the very first ikan bakar warung in Jimbaran, on the beach -- these days it can be found amid a cluster of warungs off Jalan Pemelisan. Here Nyoman Gasim makes a superlative ikan bakar using kakap merah (red snapper) over wood charcoal with ""the most amazing sauce which he refuses to give the recipe for,"" Mustika says. The basic ingredient of the special sauce is chillies, though it's not spicy as it's balanced with lots of tomato amid other fresh ""secret"" additions, he adds. Be siap sambal matah (chicken in 'raw' sambal) Eelke Plasmeijer from Locavore (Jalan Dewi Sita, Ubud) nominates be siap sambal matah as his favorite dish: it's shredded chicken in a raw sambal of shallots, lemongrass, ginger torch, chillies, coconut oil, shrimp paste, salt and lime leaves. Most warungs offering nasi campur (rice with mixed dishes) will have it among their dishes of the day, but Locavore's restaurant manager's mother makes the version he likes best for their staff meals. ""I can't get enough of it! It is a dish you won't find anywhere in Indonesia other than Bali and cooked properly it's not to be missed,"" he says. ""People can always come and join our staff meal if they like."" Samantha Brown has been living and working in Southeast Asia since 1997and these days manages online regional guide Travelfish.org.","Originally eaten only during Hindu ceremonies, these Balinese dishes can now be found in tiny local cafes and high-end restaurants .

"(CNN)Police say she's at it again. ""Serial Stowaway"" Marilyn Jean Hartman has been caught doing what she appears to be good at, traveling for free. She is known for repeatedly trying to board flights in California and Arizona without a ticket -- and sometimes getting away with it.  This time she's flipped coasts and is under arrest in Florida. Hartman has been charged with fraud/impersonation, defrauding an innkeeper and trespassing and now has a complimentary room at the Nassau County Jail. Hartman's latest travelog begins in Minnesota, according to Bill Leeper at the Nassau County Sheriff's Office. She told deputies she traveled to Jacksonville on Sunday without a ticket.  Authorities are investigating whether she stowed away or not.  She did not give an airline name. Once in Jacksonville, she hopped a hotel transport to the Omni Amelia Island Plantation Resort, about a 30-mile drive from the airport, where she checked into another person's room under her real name and paid with her own credit card. Hartman bolted when the person who had booked the room showed up.  She was found Monday, staying in another room at the resort that was being renovated. Hartman has been arrested numerous times for trying to sneak aboard airlines and staying in places without authorization. In August, she had two run-ins with authorities at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix. On August 14, Hartman was given a warning for trying to enter a security checkpoint without a ticket. Twelve days later, she was arrested in an airport terminal for criminal trespass.  A day after that, Hartman was again seen loitering around a security checkpoint, Phoenix police said. Earlier that month, she pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of stowing away a flight from San Jose, California, to Los Angeles International Airport, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. She was sentenced to two years probation and three days in jail. She was given credit for time served and released. Outside the courthouse, Hartman refused to detail to reporters how she got through security. ""I don't think it's wise to say how I got through. I don't want to help the enemy,"" she said. ""...I want to go with a paid ticket. ... I want to do everything legal,"" Hartman said. ""It was clearly wrong on my part. ... It was stupid and it is something I don't want to repeat."" A day later, Hartman was back at LAX and re-arrested. Hartman has long been described by authorities as a serial stowaway for repeatedly trying to board flights at San Francisco International Airport to Hawaii without a ticket. Earlier in 2014, she was sentenced to probation and ordered to stay away from the San Francisco airport. Hartman's first court appearance on the latest charges is scheduled for Tuesday.

"(CNN)The fiancée of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been granted immunity, compelling her to testify at his murder trial, according to a decision released by the trial judge on Tuesday. In early January, the fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, met with Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting, but the results of that meeting are secret, even from the Hernandez defense team. ""It allows the prosecutor to force her to testify in front of the jury without taking the Fifth"" (Amendment against self incrimination), CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said of the order. ""If she lies, she can still be prosecuted for perjury because a grant of immunity never (immunizes) someone against committing perjury on the witness stand."" Hernandez, the former tight end who once had a $40 million contract, has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Odin Lloyd. He has also pleaded not guilty to weapons charges. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Jenkins has been a regular at hearings for Hernandez. He has often been seen mouthing ""I love you"" to her. Jenkins is on the prosecution's witness list. It is not known whether her testimony will help or hurt Hernandez. ""Normally, a fiancée is not going to testify adversely against her true love,"" said Callan, a former New York homicide prosecutor. But there is no privilege in Massachusetts allowing engaged couples to avoid testifying against one another. Prosecutors suspect Jenkins of following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to take the bag to a dumpster and throw it away.  According to court documents, she doesn't remember where. Her sister was the girlfriend of the victim and has already testified against Hernandez. Prosecutors said Jenkins, Hernandez's high school sweetheart, lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in their North Attleboro home, among other issues. She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges. She has pleaded not guilty. Jenkins and Hernandez are the parents of a daughter who was less than a year old when her father was arrested on June 26, 2013. Jenkins' sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors. Who's who in Aaron Hernandez case . Prosecutors allege that on the day after Lloyd's killing, Jenkins got a coded text message from Hernandez. Search warrants said Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement. ""Go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box ... jus (sic) in case u were looking for it!!! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" TTYL is shorthand for ""talk to you later."" The evidence against Hernandez: What's in, what's out . A home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house about an hour later carrying something ""rigid"" she described as a box, court documents state. She placed it inside a garbage bag, covered it with children's clothing, and carried the bag to a car and drove away, prosecutors said. Jenkins borrowed her sister's car, something her sister told investigators she had never done before. When Jenkins returned home, she was seen on the same security system but without the ""rigid"" item. Jenkins told a grand jury she threw the item in a dumpster but couldn't remember where, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors suspect the murder weapon was inside. It has not been found. Hernandez's lawyers have argued there's no way of knowing what was in the box. ""I mean, who knows?"" Hernandez co-counsel Jamie Sultan told the court in 2014. ""It could be drugs, it could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about, that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact. There are all kinds of possibilities."" Hernandez's defense team has filed a motion demanding to know what promises prosecutors may have made to Jenkins. If she made a deal for a lesser charge or immunity, the jury will have to take it into account. ""The jury is going to look at that and say, 'You know something? He must be guilty if even his fiancée would say that,'"" said Callan. ""Or the defense would convince them that she's made such a sweet deal with the prosecution that she's decided to lie to implicate her lover,"" he added. Callan suggested that if Jenkins is put on the stand as a prosecution witness and repeats her grand jury testimony that she threw out the item without knowing what was inside and can't remember where she disposed of it, she could put herself in greater legal jeopardy. That's because, Callan said, prosecutors could later contend at a perjury trial that she repeated an alleged lie under oath. ""It's going to increase her guilt if the prosecutor pursues perjury charges,"" Callan said. CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","Aaron Hernandez is on trial in the death of Odin Lloyd .

"(CNN)  -- By the year 2050, China will no longer be the most populous country in the world. India will see its population grow by 700 million people by 2050, the U.S. Census bureau estimates. That distinction will pass to India, where more than 1.8 billion people could be competing for their country's resources, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's International Data Base. The 2007 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and the United Nations Population Division set China's current population at around 1.3 billion people, and India's at around 1.1 billion. If population continues to grow at the estimated rate, such rapid growth in India between now and mid-century could lead to overpopulation and an uncertain future for the environment and the people living there. And while organizations like the Population Institute and the United Nations Population Fund are working to promote the human rights and environmental consequences of overpopulation, not everyone views the newest population estimates with pessimism. ""Nothing ever continues at its present rate, neither the stock market nor population growth,"" said Doug Allen, the dean of the school of Architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and an expert in the history of cities and urban design, which he's taught for more than 31 years. ""There is a substantial body of evidence that the world population will flatten out in about 30 years,"" he said. ""Built into that model would be an assumption that more of the world's population will become urban, and as such the population will begin to decline."" Citing historical evidence of falling birthrates in urban populations, Allen looks to Italy as a current example of the phenomenon. ""Italy right now [is] not at a point where it can sustain its current level. And I don't think that's because people in Italy have suddenly become aware of the need to conserve resources. I think it has more to do with decisions that are made by families on the margin not to have as many children."" Consequences of overpopulation . Overpopulation occurs when a population's density exceeds the capacity of the environment to supply the health requirements of an individual, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Environmentalists have long been concerned about the resources threatened by rapidly growing human populations, focusing on phenomenon such as deforestation, desertification, air pollution and global warming. But the worst-case scenario for people experiencing overpopulation, according to Lawrence Smith, president of the Population Institute, is a lack of fresh, clean water. ""If the water goes, the species goes,"" he said. ""That sounds kind of alarmist,"" Smith conceded, ""considering there's water all around us, but 97 percent plus is saltwater, and the freshwater that we use to sustain ourselves is just native to 3 percent. ... So the accessibility of water, the competition for water, the availability of water is going to be a major, major threat,"" he said, noting world population growth estimates at more than 9 billion people by 2050. Nine billion is an exceptional amount of people, considering the world's population only reached 1 billion in 1830, according to the Population Institute, a nonprofit organization that works to fund population and family planning programs around the world. By 1999, world population reached 6 billion, and in the relatively short time between 2007 and 2050, there could be roughly 2.4 billion more people on Earth needing clean water, space and other natural resources from their environment in order to survive. Governments facing overpopulation will also struggle to manage waste, said Allen. ""Handling your waste and the public health consequences of not handling it well is the biggest problem that will be faced in rapidly growing urban areas in the developing world."" When London, England, faced a population boom in the 1850s, for example, its infrastructure was not prepared for the excess waste, which resulted in Cholera outbreaks. ""Huge outbreaks,"" said Allen. ""Fifty-thousand people dying over the summer. That's the kind of thing that in the developed world we no longer have problems with, but in the developing world are very, very real."" Smith said that 97 percent of world population growth between now and 2050 will occur in the developing world, where governments face serious economic and social challenges. ""I would say most of this is in sub-Saharan Africa, where by every other health indicator, they rank at the bottom,"" Smith said. ""This growth rate is taking place despite the high levels of HIV and AIDS and [tuberculosis] and malaria."" Health care -- and the lack of it -- is also a factor in the rising populations in developing countries, according to Stan Bernstein, United Nations Population Fund senior policy adviser. ""We've seen a global trend of people wanting smaller families, but in the poorer settings that's not quite the case yet,"" Bernstein said. ""And it's certainly not the case within countries that the poor [do not] have access to the kinds of services that the wealthy avail themselves of."" Globally, Bernstein said the poorest fifth of people in countries with rapid population growth have twice as many children, on average, as the wealthy people in those same countries. Birthrates make a difference . The massive growth in developing nations is due in large part to fertility rates, where women during their reproductive years will have an average of five children, said Smith. ""That's considerably higher than it is in the developed world."" In addition to the growing demands of developing nations, emerging countries like China and India are rapidly industrializing, said Smith. ""Their demands for food alone will have considerable impact on global markets."" China's government has instituted population control methods in order to curb growth. Their controversial ""one child"" policies have garnered an uneasy reception, especially in rural populations, where people complain of stiff fines or forced sterilizations and abortions as a result of breaking population laws. Traditionally, rural populations are larger than urban populations, said Smith. This is because rural families need to be larger in order to work and live off the land, and urban populations -- with better education, health care and family planning opportunities -- offer parents the luxury of choosing how many children they will have, he said. This year is the first year that rural and urban populations are nearly equal, according to the United Nations Population Fund's annual report. This creates a mixed bag of concerns, according to Smith, that include susceptibility of young urban populations in poor countries with weak governments to recruitment for terrorism and conditions of instability. ""We have never in the history of the world experienced urban growth rates or metropolitan growth rates at the same level that we are experiencing now,"" said Allen.

"(CNN)If you're going to work for the water department in San Francisco, you better learn how to hold it. That's what the city's water utility advises after a manager was caught relieving himself into a reservoir that supplies water to millions of people. Last month, employees with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission witnessed Martin Sanchez, a $111,000-a-year maintenance planner with the utility, urinate in the Priest Reservoir, said Tyrone Jue, a spokesman for the utilities commission. The Priest Reservoir is a 674 million-gallon basin, located about 150 miles east of San Francisco, that provides water for 2.6 million people in the San Francisco Bay Area. The water in the reservoir is untreated and disinfected with chlorine and ultraviolet light before it reaches customers. There was no water in the reservoir at the time of Martin's bathroom break -- it had been drained for maintenance, Jue said -- but that made no difference. ""There is no public health risk to be concerned about because the reservoir was not in use and the fact any water would have been treated anyway,"" said Jue. ""Still, his actions are completely unacceptable."" Sanchez is facing disciplinary action from the utility, which could include several days of suspension without pay. San Francisco isn't the only city that's had to deal with this. Last April, Portland, Oregon, was forced to dump 38 million gallons of water from a reservoir after a teen urinated in it. A security camera captured the 19-year-old, with the help of two friends, climbing a fence surrounding the reservoir and, ahem, taking care of business. The city decided to get rid of the water in the reservoir because it was slated to go directly to homes and there was no way to treat it. The teen and his two accomplices were cited by police. As for Sanchez or any other employees in San Francisco who may be working around a reservoir and want to save themselves a trip to the restroom, Jue offers a warning. ""Come to work wearing your big boy pants or diapers. If not, you'll need to find another place to work.""","Water manager was caught last month urinating in a San Francisco reservoir .

"A detention order against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on sexual assault allegations should remain in place, a Swedish judge ruled Wednesday. Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for more than two years in a bid to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning about allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Assange calls the charges false and politically motivated, but has said he fears that Sweden will transfer him to the United States -- where he could face the death penalty for the work of WikiLeaks -- if he were charged and convicted of a crime. He was represented at a hearing Wednesday in Stockholm by lawyers Thomas Olsson and Per Samuelsson, who argued that the detention order against their client should be revoked. But Stockholm District Court Judge Lena Egelin ruled that Assange was still suspected, with probable cause, of sex crimes and that his detention order should remain in place. Elisabeth Massi Fritz, a lawyer representing one of the women making the allegations against Assange, called the decision ""correct and expected."" Prosecutor Marianne Ny told reporters after the verdict that it was now up to the UK police to enforce the arrest warrant for Assange. ""It is in the hands of Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, whether or not he decides to leave the embassy,"" she said. Ny said the warrant could remain in place until the statute of limitations takes effect -- five years for unlawful coercion and 10 years for rape. In court, Olsson said the case has dragged on for too long, harming his client, and claimed there was no valid reason for the prosecutor not to agree to interrogate Assange in London, rather than Sweden. ""I've been sitting in on interrogations where the FBI has traveled all the way from the United States to conduct interrogations. And if the FBI can travel from the United States, then surely the Swedish prosecutor can travel to London,"" he said. Olsson noted that Assange hadn't gone outside for the past two years, a basic right usually granted to detainees. Defense argues that Assange has political asylum . The attorney also charged that his client had a right to political asylum in Ecuador. Assange did make himself available for questioning once in Sweden, Olsson said, and when he left the country for work reasons, he had been unaware the prosecutor would want to question him again. Assange had had only sporadic contact with his then-lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, because of a very serious threat to his safety, Olsson said. Samuelsson said the case was in deadlock, and appealed to the court to end the stalemate. Swedish authorities will not move forward with the investigation until Assange is in Sweden, he said, while the defense has not been able to start its work ""since we are not given all the information that the prosecution has."" ""The detention order cannot be executed,"" Samuelsson told the court. ""It will not lead to Assange being transferred to Sweden within the near future because of the political asylum. And thus, this detention order will not provide anything positive for the Swedish state, but it will lead to more harm for Julian Assange."" Prosecutor Ingrid Isgren, speaking on behalf of the prosecution authority, said the detention order should remain in place. There are sufficient grounds to believe Assange could be found guilty of the allegations against him, she said, and his evasion risk remains the same. Isgren told the court Assange had intentionally stayed away and had no intention of appearing for questioning in Sweden. The prosecution does not want to question Assange in London because of the nature of the crimes, and because it would be difficult to get all the necessary evidence if it had to be done via another country's judicial system, Isgren said. She also rejected his claim that the defense had not been given access to all the relevant evidence against him. It is ""likely"" but not certain that Assange would be indicted after questioning, the prosecution told the court. However, the prosecution intends to go forward with the case. WikiLeaks vows an appeal . The prosecution presented evidence that would constitute probable cause for the case against Assange behind closed doors, in order not to interfere with the investigation. The prosecution's written statement to the court rejected the claim that Assange's lawyer was unaware he was wanted for further questioning. A representative for the lawyer for the two alleged victims was also present in court. Kristinn Hrafnsson, a WikiLeaks spokesman, expressed disappointment after the court's verdict. ""I had been moderately hopeful, but this didn't come as a surprise,"" Hrafnsson said. ""Now we will appeal and we hope the higher court will reconsider all the solid arguments we have presented. This has to come to an end."" Assange rocketed to international fame, and infamy, in 2010 after WikiLeaks began helping publish secret government documents online. Ecuador granted Assange asylum in June 2012 and he fled to the country's embassy in London to avoid extradition.

"No, you're not looking at an idyllic scene from pre-Death Star Alderaan. This futuristic building is the plan for George Lucas' $300-million art museum on Chicago's lakefront. Beijing-based MAD Architects and Chicago firm Studio Gang have released artist renderings of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art that wouldn't look out of place in its namesake's ""Star Wars"" franchise. The avant garde structure, set to open in 2018, will have three levels of exhibition space topped by an observation deck with panoramic views of the city and Lake Michigan. Inspired by the works of Frank Lloyd Wright and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (both of whom designed buildings in Chicago), it's meant to evoke a disc floating above the surrounding harbor. ""Its uninterrupted stone surfaces are as primitive as it is futuristic, evoking the great achievements of architectural history,"" MAD wrote on its website. ""More than a building, it is an urban vista for social interaction, bringing people closer to each other and to nature."" The building was conceived by MAD founder Ma Yansong, who is best known for the curvy Absolute Towers -- nicknamed the Marilyn Monroe towers -- built just outside of Toronto, Canada. Studio Gang have designed the 17 acre plot's landscape, and will design a bridge connecting the plot to nearby Northerly Island. VOA Associates, also from Chicago, will lead the building's implementation. The Lucas Museum will showcase images that are used for storytelling, from comics and children's books to digital art and film. The permanent collection will feature works from Lucas' personal collection, which is estimated to be worth $600 million and includes Norman Rockwell paintings, Alberto Vargas pin-ups and, yes, original props from ""Star Wars."" The museum will also host temporary exhibitions, lectures and educational programming.

"(CNN)A man suspected in last year's killing of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has been charged with first-degree murder in the case, a prosecutor told reporters Tuesday. The murder charge against Jesse Matthew Jr. comes in addition to a count of abduction with intent to defile filed against him previously, Albemarle County Commonwealth's Attorney Denise Lunsford said. ""These indictments signal the beginning of the next phase in what has been an incredibly difficult process for the family of Hannah Graham, for our community and for the men and women of the many departments and agencies who have worked on this matter since September of last year,"" Lunsford said. Lunsford's team decided not to charge Matthew with capital murder, which could have led to a death sentence if he were convicted. Lunsford said she wouldn't give details on what led to that decision, except to say that a ""great deal of serious thought"" went into it. Those considerations included ""the impact on the community, the Grahams, and the need to provide Mr. Matthew with a fair trial."" ""I have discussed this matter with the Grahams on many occasions, and they are aware of the indictments,"" Lunsford said. Matthew also was charged with reckless driving in two incidents about a week after Graham's disappearance, Lunsford said. Matthew's first court appearance on the indictments is scheduled for February 18. His attorney, Jim Camblos, declined to comment Tuesday, except to acknowledge the February 18 court appearance and to say that he received news of the indictments late Monday afternoon. Graham, 18, went missing before dawn on September 13 after she was  last spotted on surveillance video in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area. In October,  authorities found what turned out to be Graham's skull and bones on abandoned property 8 miles from where the college sophomore was last seen. Surveillance video and other accounts led authorities to identify Matthew as a suspect in her disappearance. Matthew, 33, was taken into custody on September 24 on a beach in Galveston County, Texas, about 1,300 miles away from where Graham was last seen. Matthew's arrest in the Graham case prompted authorities to investigate his possible links to a string of unsolved killings and disappearances in the area. One of those cases involved 17-year-old Alexis Murphy of Lovingston, Virginia, who disappeared in 2013 and whose body has not been found. But on Friday, authorities said they had found no link between him and Murphy's slaying. Matthew is also charged in the sexual assault of a woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005; the trial in that case is scheduled for March. Authorities said that in September 2005, a 26-year-old woman returning from a grocery store was grabbed from behind and sexually assaulted. The attacker was scared off by a passerby. Information from the 2005 victim led police to link Matthew to the case of another missing young woman, Morgan Harrington, a Virginia Tech student who vanished in Charlottesville in October 2009 and was found dead a few months later. Matthew has not been charged in that case. Investigators are looking into his possible connection to other similar cases in the area. They include the August 2009 killing of Virginia Tech students Heidi Childs and David Metzler and the October 2009 killing of 23-year-old Cassandra Morton of Lynchburg, Virginia. Police are also investigating Matthew's possible ties to the disappearance of 19-year-old Samantha Ann Clarke of Orange, Virginia. CNN's Jean Casarez and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Jesse Matthew Jr. is charged with first-degree murder, a prosecutor says .

"(CNN)Last week, 16-year-old Maxwell Morton was arrested and charged with murder after he posed for a selfie with the body of a teenager he had just allegedly shot and then uploaded the picture to Snapchat. A friend of Morton showed a screen grab of the picture to his mom, who then called police. Of course, it's absurd to suggest a selfie was in any way an incentive or motive for the murder, just as it's absurd to suggest that social media causes criminal behavior.  People have been killing each other since the days of stone tablets. But is social media, which allows for limitless self-absorption, exacerbating hatred and violence when mixed with seeming anonymity? Or is social media simply allowing us to be more open about what we do—and in some cases, allow crimes to be easily discovered and reported? In other words, does a ""selfie culture"" show us as we've always been or is it turning us into something worse? Last year, there were several instances in which sexual assaults were documented on social media by the alleged perpetrators. In July 2014, a 16-year-old Texas girl named Jada went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped. Jada doesn't remember what happened. What she does know is that picture of her naked and bent body was shared all over the Internet and then mimicked in what became a perverse ""meme,"" in which others posted pictures of themselves in the same pose. In an eerily similar story, police say a 26-year-old North Carolina woman had no idea she was sexually assaulted during a party in September until pictures of her assault were later posted on social media. In November, several high school students in New Mexico allegedly sexually assaulted a young girl and posted pictures of their crime on social media. In the New Mexico incident, people reposted the pictures to hold the Albuquerque police and school district accountable for their failure to take action against the alleged assailants. In the Texas incident, Jada spoke out about being victimized, not only by her assailants but also by those on social media—and this helped spark awareness and outrage about rape culture in America. Social media is also used by victims to tell their stories. A woman in Florida used social media to post a picture of her bruised arm, alleging her Florida State University football player boyfriend had battered her—leading to a police investigation. A woman in England posted a picture of her own battered face after a man had allegedly attacked her in a nightclub. The 29-year-old woman, Jeanne Marie Ryan, wanted to raise awareness about domestic violence and raise £100 for a women's shelter. She reportedly ended up raising £12,000—or over $18,000. There's no evidence that incidents of rape and sexual assault are increasing because of social media. It could be that the opposite is true. But, social media seems to have increased incivility or hate speech in our society by making us more aware of its prevalence. People who were once shouting sexist and racist epithets from the windowless basements of their parents' homes now have Internet connections and can share those epithets on Twitter and beyond. The assault on civility, just like the assault on women's bodies, is nothing new. The new part is that even the loneliest of people now have the tools to broadcast their assaults far and wide. One can't help but feel the simultaneous accessibility and anonymity of social media makes it easier to be less caring. Studies show Millennials feel that technology is dehumanizing. Posting the picture of an assault victim online, or a hateful tweet about someone, certainly is a dehumanizing act. Would the thousands who posted photos as part of the hideous #JadaPose meme have literally assaulted the 16-year-old girl if given the opportunity? I hope not. Did they even think their mocking photos were contributing to justify Jada's assault and re-victimizing her? Doesn't appear so. They probably weren't thinking much about Jada at all. She'd been reduced to a ""meme""—an idea, a representation of a concept—not a person. We take more selfies than ever before, and yet we seem to be less self-aware. Social media allows the narcissism in all of us to come out. Some people take it to the extreme by posting assaults of violent acts. One has to wonder how much this public platform has eroded our humanity.","Maxwell Morton allegedly killed a teenager and posted a selfie with the victim on Snapchat .
