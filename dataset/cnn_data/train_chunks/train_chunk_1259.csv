"Arsene Wenger came within a whisker of signing Lionel Messi from Barcelona’s La Masia academy when he was just 16. Sportsmail can reveal that Wenger wanted to sign three players in 2003 - Messi, Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas - with the promise of playing first-team football in their teens. Incredibly Messi was interested in moving to north London, but the deal was fraught with problems because of issues over the Argentina forward’s work permit. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Messi terrorises defences at 16 for Barcelona youth team . Lionel Messi (wearing mask) lines up for Barcelona's youth team in January 2003 alongside Spain internationals Gerard Pique (back row, third from left) and Cesc Fabregas (back row, second from right). Messi was wearing a protective mask after suffering a badly fractured cheekbone in an a previous match . Messi has gone on to win the Ballon d'Or four times and establish himself as one of the greatest ever players . Since attempting to sign Lionel Messi, Arsenal have won three trophies (one Premier League and two FA Cups). Messi, by contrast, has won 13 major honours with Barcelona - La Liga six times, three Champions Leagues, two Spanish Cups and two World Club Cups. He has also won the Ballon d'Or four times. Messi eventually became a Spanish citizen in 2006, but that was three years after Wenger’s audacious attempt to pull off one of the biggest signings in world football. Wenger signed Fabregas after convincing the Spanish midfielder that his progress to the first-team would be quicker. Fabregas, now at Chelsea, made his first team debut for Arsenal in a League Cup game a month after he arrived at the club. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger aimed to make a triple swoop from Barcelona's academy in 2003 . A 16-year-old Cesc Fabregas scores for Arsenal against Wolves in the League Cup . Arsene Wenger talks to a young Cesc Fabregas back in July 2004 . At the time he was only 16 and he went on to make more than 200 appearances for the Gunners before he returned to Barcelona in 2011. Messi made his debut for Barcelona when he was 17 years, 114 days old under Frank Rijkaard, but he had to wait until the 2006-07 season before he really established himself as a first choice. By then Fabregas had started a Champions League final against Barcelona at the Stade de France. Messi was on the bench that night alongside Xavi and Andres Iniesta. Pique, meanwhile, moved to Manchester United in 2004. He played just 12 league matches in four years (which included a season on loan at Real Zaragoza) before returning to Barcelona, where he has become the focal point of the defence.

"Ed Miliband will today take one of the biggest gambles of his political career by placing at risk £9million of annual union funding to his party. The Labour leader, who is under intense pressure over his links to union paymasters, wants to tear up rules on their political levy. In what is billed as the most significant reform of his party for a generation, he will say union members will have to ‘opt in’ to hand over an annual £3 donation to Labour, which they currently pay automatically. Mr Miliband is desperate to regain credibility while police probe claims that members of the Unite union conspired to fix a Labour candidate selection in Falkirk. Ed Miliband (left) will take one of the biggest gambles of his political career calling for a ‘new direction’ with the unions which has been met with a furious response from Unite leader Len McCluskey (right) In a major speech today, he will also call for a ‘new direction’ with the unions, even though aides conceded this may ‘take years’ to achieve. The plan met with a furious response from Unite leader Len McCluskey last night, who has given £8.4million to Labour since Mr Miliband’s election in 2010, and who denounced the ‘opt-in’ as ‘unworkable’. At present, three million workers, including shop staff, nurses and train drivers, automatically have the cash taken from their union subscriptions, because their unions are ‘affiliated’ to Labour. But the levy has long been the source of resentment for some rank-and-file members, many of whom want to belong to a union but may not support Labour. Under Mr Miliband’s plan, members would have to ‘opt in’ to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to ‘opt out’. Under Mr Miliband¿s plan, members would have to 'opt in' to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to 'opt out' But last night it was unclear whether the plans would succeed in diluting union influence over Labour policy and elections. Supporters of his brother David said the plans were a ‘sticking plaster’ and warned he must go further. Sources close to Mr Miliband would not say if he plans to change rules on electing a Labour leader – a process in which where union members still have huge influence – or whether he will dilute their voting power at party conference, where the unions still enjoy a 50 per cent block vote. But in an article for The Guardian, Mr McCluskey wrote: ‘Switching to an “opt-in” for the political levy wouldn’t work – it would require Labour to unite with the Tories to change the law.’ This is a claim Labour officials deny but it remains unclear how the opt-in plans can work without union cooperation because its officials would have to administer it. But the move was hailed by Miliband allies last night as the most significant reform to Labour since the party moved to one member one vote 20 years ago. In a speech in central London today, Mr Miliband will seek to reclaim the initiative by condemning Unite’s activities in Falkirk as ‘a symbol of what is wrong with politics’. He will say: ‘That was a politics closed, a politics of the machine, a politics hated – and rightly so. ‘We need to set a new direction in our relationship with trade union members in which they choose to join Labour through the affiliation fee: they would actively choose to be individually affiliated members of the Labour Party and they would no longer be automatically affiliated.’ Mr Miliband will also announce that he plans to hold a primary election for Labour’s next London mayoral candidate, in which anyone who registers as a Labour supporter can vote, rather than just party members. He is also capping the amount that can be spent on selections, and instituting a code of conduct for candidates and constituency deals with unions ‘so no one can be subjected to undue pressure’. He will appoint a party grandee to oversee the changes. Aides admitted the party would ‘take a financial hit’ since the political levy currently raises £9million a year. But the plans are some way short of challenging Labour’s links to the unions. If, as expected, the number of union members formally affiliated to the party via the levy drops dramatically, union bosses could actually enjoy more power over Labour unless the leadership and conference voting rules are changed. If the unions keep their block vote they would be able to manipulate the party by influencing just a few thousand union members. One Miliband aide admitted union chiefs will continue to have influence. ‘The elected leadership of trade unions are extremely important. They have opinions we want to hear.’ In a fresh blow, the Tories yesterday asked Scotland Yard to launch an investigation into Unite activities in two other seats, Lewisham Deptford and Ilford North. The full extent of Unite’s influence over Labour was laid bare last night when a leaked document written by the union’s political secretary revealed that the union has privately boasted of changing Labour policies and dictated the subject of Parliamentary debates.","Labour leader is under intense pressure over his links to union paymasters .

"A Mexican family has been jailed for gouging out the eyes of their five-year-old relative with a spoon during a satanic ritual to bring about the end of the world. Fernando Caleb Alvarado Rios was ordered to close his eyes out of respect with his mother, grandparents, aunt and uncles as they danced in a circle and called on Satan to reveal himself. But when he was too scared to do so, his mother, Maria del Carmen Garcia Rios, grabbed a spoon and the entire group gouged them out. Scroll down for video .

Jailed: Maria del Carmen Garcia Rios has been sentenced to 30 years in jail for the attack on her son . They were caught when neighbours, who had heard loud chanting, came to investigate and saw the child screaming in pain. Today, more than two years after the incident in May 2012, a court has sentenced the group to 30 years each in jail. Fernando has since been given glass eyes and is now in care. The family, from the town of Nezahualcoyotl, believed the ritual would bring them closer to Satan who could claim them as his own and save them from a deadly earthquake. Neighbour, Joaquin Arguello, told the court, that he had always thought the family were devout and deeply religious, but had not realised that they were Satanists.

"Looking at these pictures it is difficult how imagine how anyone could fail to love Kecil the orangutan, but he had a troubled start to life after both his mother and surrogate mother rejected him. However the seven-month-old ape is now doing well having found love at the third time of asking after being given to Maggie, a 53-year-old Bornean orangutan housed at Brookfield Zoo, Chicago. Despite her advanced age, Maggie has proved the perfect parent, having taken care of a surrogate baby once before until 2002. Scroll down for video . Kecil, a seven-month-old baby orangutan, was abandoned by his mother Yasmin after a difficult birth, and rejected by surrogate mother MJ before being sent to Chicago's Brookfield Zoo . Kecil was given over to second surrogate Maggie, 53 (pictured), who is now taking care of him having already reared one surrogate child in the past . She has been caring for Kecil - whose name means 'little' in Indonesian - for more than a month now and zookeepers say the two have shown promising behaviour, with Kecil sleeping in the crook of Maggie's arm. Jay Petersen, curator of primates and carnivores for the Chicago Zoological Society, said: 'Although it has been only a short time and we have a long road ahead of us, we are extremely optimistic due to Kecil and Maggie’s progress so far. 'Maggie is an easygoing and gentle orangutan. The two have been together since Kecil’s arrival, and Maggie has provided care and attention that he needs to receive from an orangutan.' Kecil was born on January 11 at Toledo Zoo in Ohio to mother Yasmin. While she has raised her own young before, following a difficult labour she showed little interest in caring for Kecil. Keepers at Brookfield Zoo say the pair have shown promising behaviour since Kecil arrived a month ago, with him often sleeping in the crook of Maggie's arm . Kecil - whose name means 'little' in Indonesian - will now spend a few months bonding with Maggie away from prying eyes before being put on display . After four months of effort by keepers trying to get Yasmin to care for her baby, staff decided it would be better to place the infant with another mother, and sent him to Milwaukee County Zoo. He was given to an orangutan named MJ, but despite a month of work by staff, she also failed to bond with the youngster. As a last hope, he was moved to Chicago and the capable hands of Maggie, arriving at the zoo on June 20. Since then the pair have shown promising behaviour by playing together, with Kecil even riding around while clinging to Maggie's forearm. But despite their progress, keepers say it will be a long time before either of them are put on display, as they need to be given time to develop their relationship, while Kecil needs to become more agile in order to negotiate the exhibit. As well as playing together, Kecil has also been spotted catching a ride on his surrogate mother's forearm, leading keepers to believe there will be no more problems for the youngster . Staff at Brookfield Zoo say Maggie is the perfect surrogate mother, as she is relaxed and calm. She has taken care of a child once before, though that ended in 2002 when the child grew up . Orangutans once lived over much of Southeast Asia, but their range and population have been dramatically reduced, mostly thanks to a reduction in habitat. There are thought to be as few as 40,000 Bornean orangutans left in the wild, and the population has declined by 50 percent since 1990. Researchers predict that about 5,000 orangutans die every year meaning the species will be extinct in the wild in the not too distant future.","Kecil the orangutan was born at Ohio's Toledo Zoo on January 11 .

"Grown adults dressed as sexualised cuddly toys met at a gathering for ‘furries’ in Germany at Eurofurence, Europe’s largest furry fandom convention. Cats in tutus and stockings, bears in cleavage baring tops and a creature in a satin corset were some of the 2,000 people who attended the convention in Berlin for fans of animals with anthropomorphic qualities. The 20th anniversary of Euroference saw adults cuddling up in their figure-hugging outfits – which can cost as much as £5,000. But Liza, a 29-year-old graphic designer based in Brighton, denied the convention was a sex party for people with a furry toy fetish. She told the Independent: ‘We’re sick to death of reading that furry conventions are all about sex.’ Fans claim that adopting ‘fursonas’ to engage in animal roleplay by touching, petting, hugging and stroking each other is just harmless fun. Anthrozoologist and social psychologist Kathy Gerbasi, who studies the furry phenomenon and has a fur suit herself, agreed there was a sexual aspect. She said: ‘There is a sexual element for some people but I don’t think that applies to the majority.’ A bear in a figure-hugging outfit struts around at Eurofurence while a cat in a tutu and stockings walks past . Ms Gerbasi, 65, argues that most people are interested in animals from a young age. She said: ‘We grow up with teddy bears, stories and pets. But furries take this interest in animals further.’ Some take it so far – that they actually believe they are part animal. She said: ‘For most furries it’s just a fun hobby, but for others it’s an alter ego. Some think they’ve been reincarnated as an animal.’ New Yorker Ms Gerbasi, who is married to a pediatrician and has three children, got hooked on furry fandom nine years ago after coming across the underground movement on the internet. Bear chested: This person favoured a low-cut animal costume for the furry fandom convention . Peas in a pod: Two like minded souls enjoy a quiet moment at Eurofurence . She began studying the craze and ended up buying a dog costume based on her pet basset-springer spaniel for £180, which she wears every year to a festival called Anthrocon. She said: ‘Most people spend around £5,000 on their costumes but I opted for a cheaper one and decided to make the body myself. ‘The first time I wore it to a furry convention I was nervous, but after a while I relaxed and it was so much fun. ‘My husband and children think it’s ridiculous but they let me get on with it. ‘The only thing is that it gets very hot in the outfit.’ But Ms Gerbasi does not wear her outfit in public. She said: ‘I’ve toyed with the idea of wearing it out but I was worried I would scare the cats. 'I do know some furries who go bowling in their costumes, but I think most like to wear them at conventions where they are surrounded by like-minded people.’ Conventions are held around the world and the UK scene is reported to be very active, though there are no reunions currently held on the scale of Euroference.","Furry fandom convention, for people who dress as animals, held in Germany .

"David Cameron today held an extraordinary meeting with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani to seek help in defeating ISIS militants. It is the first face-to-face talks for 35 years between the leaders of the two countries which have been at loggerheads over Tehran's nuclear policy. However, Mr Cameron made clear that a global alliance is needed to tackle the rise of ISIS, as he prepares to recall Parliament on Friday for a vote on RAF air strikes in Iraq. British Prime Minister David Cameron meets with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the UN headquarters in New York, the first such meeting for 35 years . As Mr Cameron sought to enlist Mr Rouhani's backing for the international coalition against ISIS, the Iranian posted a picture of the two of them shaking hands on his Twitter feed. As the talks got underway, Mr Rouhani tweeted a photograph with a message urging 'constructive engagement'. Earlier it emerged the US told Iran of its plans to strike ISIS militants inside Syria in order to reassure them that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would not be targetted. The communication appears to signal a cooling in hostilities between the U.S. and Iran for the first time since a 1979 hostage crisis prompted Washington to sever ties with Tehran. Iran is said to have voiced concerns for the safety of Assad, who remains the Shia Islam-dominated nation's closest regional ally and the recipient of Iranian military support during a Syrian Civil War. Mr Cameron is also backing a sweeping new UN resolution tabled by the US, which would impose global travel bans on foreign fighters planning to join conflicts overseas. An IS militant fires a rocket propelled grenade  launcher during fighting near the Syrian Kurdish town of Ain al-Arab, known as Kobane by the Kurds . Barrage: An IS militant fires a heavy machine gun during the fighting. Some 140,000 mainly Kurdish refugees have now crossed the border into Turkey after the militants moved on the town of Ain al-Arab . An IS militant firing a cannon mounted on a truck during fighting near the Syrian Kurdish town of Ain al-Arab, . Hundreds of Britons are believed to be fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Interviewed on NBC News, Mr Cameron said the ISIS group posed a direct threat to Britain. 'These people want to kill us,' he said. They've got us in their sights and we have to put together this coalition … to make sure that we ultimately destroy this evil organisation.' The move comes amid growing Tory criticism of Britain's cautious response to the threat posed by IS, which has murdered three Western hostages and is threatening to kill kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning. Labour's shadow cabinet held an emergency meeting at its party conference in Manchester to agree a position on backing air strikes. Mr Cameron is desperate to avoid a repeat of last year's damaging Commons defeat over air strikes against Syria and will be looking for Labour support in the vote. As the talks on tackling ISIS got underway, Mr Rouhani tweeted this picture urging 'constructive engagement' With the shadow cabinet meeting in Manchester at the end of the Labour Party conference to discuss its position, Ed Miliband said he would consider any request from the Prime Minister 'very seriously'. 'Isil is a threat that cannot be ignored,' he told the BBC. 'If a proposition comes forward for military action by the UK, obviously we are open to it and will look at it.' Tonight Mr Cameron will hold talks with his Iraqi counterpart Haider Abadi which are likely to see a formal request from the Baghdad government for the UK to join the US-led military strikes on the terror group. With ministers making clear that Mr Cameron will honour his pledge to give MPs a vote before embarking on air strikes, it is thought they could be summoned back to Westminster as early as Friday. A formal request from the Iraqi government would give the Prime Minister - currently attending the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York - the legal cover he believes is needed to go ahead. Aerial warfare: British Tornado bombers could be hitting ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq this weekend. File picture . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned Parliament must 'step up' and authorise British airstrikes against Islamist extremists. In the Government's most forthright call yet for the UK to join the bombing campaign, the Cabinet minister said MPs must vote to help repel brutal jihadists rampaging across the Middle East. He said it was vital Britain helped defeat the terror threat in Syria and Iraq, which he described as the 'new Battle of Britain'. But he said crushing the so-called Islamic State, formerly called ISIL, which has carried out beheadings, crucifixions and massacres, would be a 'long haul' which could take 'years'. Mr Fallon spoke out during a visit to British troops running the new Afghan National Army Officers' Acadamy in Kabul – dubbed 'Sandhurst in the Sand'. His trip came as pressure mounted on David Cameron to act after US president Barack Obama launched air strikes against jihadist targets in Syria alongside a coalition of Arab countries on Monday. Until now, the RAF has limited its operations to delivering arms and equipment to Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, humanitarian aid and surveillance missions in the skies above northern Iraq. The guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea launches a Tomahawk cruise missile in the Arabian Gulf yesterday . Britain has six RAF Tornado fighter-bombers based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus armed with fearsome Brimstone missiles and Paveway IV bombs which can fly within minutes. Mr Fallon told the Mail: 'We want to help the international effort and the moderate Arab countries, we want to help support them to help the Iraqi government. 'The pressure is now on our Parliament. It is parliament that needs to step up and decide whether they are prepared to endorse military action and we will be testing that very soon.' Conservative MPs have warned that Mr Cameron's failure to launch air strikes in Iraq and Syria has left the UK weakened. More than 130 jihadists were killed in Monday's US-led attacks focused on the ISIL stronghold of Raqqa in Syria. Mr Fallon suggested British troops could be deployed in the Middle East to train Iraqi troops but warned the fight against IS could be a 'long-haul'. He said: 'It's not simply a question of helping the Kurds recover the ground and towns that they've lost but to drive ISIL out of Iraq is clearly going to take months and possibly years. 'But that has to be done with international help, with help from other Arab countries, and it has to be done on the ground as well as in the air, but on the ground it has to be done by Iraqi-led forces.' In comments to the Spectator magazine, Mr Fallon said: 'We've had attacks on the streets of London, on our transport system, at Glasgow Airport, the murder of Lee Rigby – how much more evidence do you need that this is a very clear and dangerous threat to our way of life and to all the democracies of the West? This is a new Battle of Britain.'","It is the first time leaders of the two countries have met in 35 years .

"Confusion: Known as the Italian Schindler, Giovanni Palatucci was credited with helping to save 5,000 Jews during the Holocaust . He has been honoured around the world, with squares and promenades named after him. For decades, Giovanni Palatucci has been known as a hero for helping to save the lives of 5,000 Jews during the Holocaust. The wartime police official's heroic exploits even led to the Italian being declared a martyr by Pope John Paul II.  Israel's memorial to the Holocaust even placed him on a par with Oskar Schindler. But, as reported by The New York Times, new evidence has now emerged which suggests that rather than helping to save the lives of Jews, he instead sent them to their graves. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington has removed stories of his heroics from an exhibition after it emerged that he may have been a Nazi collaborator involved in sending Jews to Auschwitz. The claims were made in a letter sent to the museum this month by the Centro Promo Levi at the Center for Jewish Studies in New York. It said a panel of more than a dozen scholars had studied almost 700 documents and concluded that Palatucci was for six years 'a willing executor of the racial legislation and — after taking the oath to Mussolini’s Social Republic, collaborated with the Nazis.' In the letter, the scholars said records from Germany and Italy provided no evidence that Palatucci, who died at the age of 35, helped Jews during the war. However, researchers came across documents which instead revealed Palatucci helped the Germans to identity Jews to capture. Feted: The wartime police official has squares and promenades named after him around the world . New evidence shows that Palatucci may have been a Nazi collaborator involved in sending Jews to Auschwitz . Palatucci was a police chief in Fiume, which is now called Rijeka and is part of Croatia, when he was said to have saved thousands of Jews between 1940 and 1944. Italy entered World War II as Germany's ally, declaring war on Britain and France in June 1940. However, despite this, the Fascist Italian regime generally refused to participate in mass . murder of Jews or to permit deportations from Italy or Italian-occupied . territory. This resulted in Italian-occupied areas being reasonably safe for Jews. Many escaped from German-occupied territory to the Italian-occupied zones of France, Greece, and Yugoslavia between 1941 and 1943. However, this situation changed radically in 1943 when Italy surrendered to the Allies. German forces quickly occupied northern and central Italy. For the remaining 43,000 Italian Jews this dramatically altered the situation, resulting in thousands being deported to Auschwitz. The city was occupied by the Nazis in 1942 and Palatucci was credited with destroying records to prevent Jews being sent to concentration camps. However, researchers now say Fiume had just 500 Jews by 1943. They said 412 of them ended up in Auschwitz - a higher percentage that any other Italian city. Experts now believe that the stories of Palatucci's heroics took hold because of the positive light it gave Italy following the war. As reported by The New York Times, Natalia Indrimi, the executive director of the Centro Primo Levi, said in her letter to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum: 'If anything, Giovanni Palatucci represents the silence, self-righteousness and compliance of many young Italian officers who enthusiastically embraced Mussolini in his last disastrous steps.'

"British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood used her packed London Fashion Week showcase to  pledge her undivided support of the Yes campaign for Scottish independence. Sending models sporting Yes badges down the runway, the designer left a statement explaining her views on every seat in the packed venue. Later brandishing Better Together campaigners as 'frightened and stupid', Dame Vivienne said tearing the 307-year-old union apart could be 'the turning point towards a better world'. Scroll down for video . Vivienne Westwood pledged her undivided support of the Yes campaign at her London Fashion Week show . The designer proudly showed off a Yes badge showing her passion for Scottish independence . Sending models down the runway sporting Yes badges, the designer said she hopes Alex Salmond's campaign wins on Thursday when millions of Scots turn out to vote . Guests at her show this afternoon found a small statement printed on each of their seats, explaining her views on the impending referendum. 'I am so excited. Fingers crossed they will win. Because if they do, it could be the turning point towards a better world. 'They could lead by example,' it read. Later, when asked by reporters why she felt Alex Salmond's campaign for an independent Scotland was best for the country, she said: 'I hate England.' 'I like Scotland because somehow I think they are better than we are. They are more democratic,' she said, later brandishing those voting to stay in the UK in Thursday's vote as 'frightened and stupid'. Westwood is renowned for using tartan in almost all of her collections. Although she was born in Glossop, Derbyshire to English parents, Westwood  created her own Scottish clan and tartan for her 'Anglomania' Autumn/Winter fashion line in 1993. Named MacAndreas after her third husband and collaborator Andreas Kronthaler, the clan's tartan was accepted by the Lochcarron of Scotland within months - despite the process of recognition traditionally taking about 200 years. As a result she is the only contemporary designer to have her work displayed at the Lochcarron Museum of Tartan. The designer has used tartan in almost all of her collections to date and was recently welcomed into the Scottish Fashion Awards Hall of Fame for her contribution to the textiles and fabric industry in Scotland . In a 1989 issue of Tatler, Vivienne Westwood appeared on the magazine's cover dressed in a suit she had made for then prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Her flame-hair conservatively coiffed, beneath the designer's image were the word: 'This woman used to be a punk'. The edition has been hailed as one of the best British magazine covers of all time. Years later, she sent a model down the catwalk yielding a sign in support of the prisoners of Guantanamo Bay. It read: 'Fair trial my a***! Justice for the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Reprieve' Slowing down climate change and preventing fracking are other causes dear to the designer's heart. Elsewhere she has been pictured at Occupy London protests and visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy.

A model at the 2008/2009 autumn/winter show carried a sign in support of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay . This 1989 issue of Tatler saw Westwood dress  up as then prime minister Margaret Thatcher . Sourcing the tartan patterns used in her designs from all over Scotland, she was welcomed into the Scottish Fashion Awards Hall of Fame earlier this month for her 'undeterred loyalty' to the industry. Receiving her award, she said: '[An independent Scotland could be] a model to us all. . . if it could become a people-friendly society. 'Surely you can still have the queen and be the United Kingdom, if we win, you can be our friends if you wanted, it’s up to you. 'I think it’s absolutely great that almost half, it would be great if even a half, were getting the other half, a half of Scottish people want democracy.' Speaking at the time, Tessa Hartmann, the founder of the awards, said: 'Vivienne has had an undeterred loyalty and unparalleled love and passion for Scottish textiles and fabrics, which she has consistently used within her collections throughout the years. 'She personifies the powerful and subversive originality of British fashion and has done more for Scottish textiles than probably any other designer of her generation. 'Her brand name is synonymous with the tartan pattern and her fascination for this iconic fabric is unrelenting. Pro-independence voters gathered at a concert in Edinburgh's Usher Hall to watch Scottish artists Amy McDonald, Franz Ferdinand and Frightened Rabbit . A boy wraps himself in a Saltire at the concert in Edinburgh where hundreds have gathered ahead of Thursday's vote . 'By using a mix of different tartans, her ensembles explore the rich depth of colour and diversity of the traditional checked pattern that is adored around the world.' Hundreds of pro-independence campaigners gathered in Edinburgh this evening for a concert. Scottish artists such as Franz Ferdinand, Frightened Rabbit and Amy McDonald will perform at the event. A combination of varying polls found the No campaign to claim a slight lead with 51 per cent today. However with an estimated 500,000 Scots still unsure of their vote, the race has been described as too close to call.","British designer sent models down catwalk wearing Yes badges .

"Reporter James Rosen was the target of a search warrant that enabled Justice Department investigators to secretly seize his private emails . The revelations that the Justice . Department targeted the emails of a Fox News reporter have become even . more disturbing as even his parents were targeted in the probe, . documents say. It was . uncovered on Monday that the network's Washington, D.C. correspondent . James Rosen - and two other staffers - had his phone records seized and . emails read by federal agents. The DOJ's actions have been blasted as a monumental violation of the freedom of the press, but the investigation went beyond the veteran journalist. Citing . federal documents on Tuesday, Fox News host Bret Baier referred to . 'seized phone records that relate to [Rosen's] parents' home in Staten . Island.' The Fox News . Channel is outraged over the revelations that Rosen and fellow reporter . William La Jeunesse - along with producer Mike Levine -  were targeted . by the U.S. Department of Justice in criminal investigations related to . their attempts to obtain information from government sources. Rosen has become a First Amendment cause celebre over his treatment by the Obama administration. Rosen, according to affidavits filed by FBI agents, was considered a possible criminal co-conspirator. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fox News's Shannon Bream (R) and Megyn Kelly (L) broke the news Monday that the DOJ had targeted three of their journalist colleagues in criminal investigations for seeking classified information from willing government sources . The Washington Post reported on Monday morning that Rosen was the subject of a Department of Justice probe in relation to his reporting about North Korea's likely reactions to new UN sanctions in 2009. Federal investigators read his personal emails, obtained his phone records, and tracked his comings and goings through government buildings. An FBI agent filed an affidavit in that case claiming that he thought Rosen had broken the law, 'at the very least, either as an aider, abetter and/or co-conspirator.' None of the three journalists targeted by the Obama administration was notified that the government was spying on his records and emails. 'All three of our colleagues say they were never contacted by the government,' Fox News Channel correspondent Shannon Bream reported on Monday afternoon. La Jeunesse and Levine were targeted in a separate Department of Justice investigation into leaks related to Operation Fast and Furious, a scandal-plagued DOJ program that sent illicit guns across the Mexican border to drug cartels in the hope of tracing the guns' path to the narcotics gangs. The federal government lost track of the majority of approximately 2,000 firearms that were allowed to cross the southern U.S. border. More than 300 deaths in Mexico, and the death of at least one U.S. Border Patrol agent, were linked to those weapons. La Jeunesse broke stories outlining . several key elements of the Fast and Furious scandal. Monday's Inspector . General report from the DOJ directly quotes his emails, as well as some . from Levine, the Fox News producer. 'What we don't know at this point,' Bream reported, . 'is if the sources within the Justice Department may have shared those . emails with investigators, or if the Fox employees' accounts were . directly accessed by investigators. It's simply a question we cannot . answer at this point.' Fox News Channel producer Mike Levine's emails were read by DOJ investigators, but his employer isn't certain whether it was the result of a subpoena, or of agents swapping information inside Main Justice . Fox News Channel released a pointed statement from executive vice president of news editorial . Michael Clemente. 'We are outraged to learn today that . James Rosen was named a criminal co-conspirator for simply doing his job . as a reporter,' Clemente said. 'In fact, it is downright . chilling.' 'We will unequivocally defend his right to operate as a member of what up until now has always been a free press.' The news broke as White House Press .

Associated Press. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney fended off questions about the press freedom scandal on Monday, claiming President Obama aims to balance the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution with the need to protect state secrets . Attorney General Eric Holder has denied having any knowledge of a probe in his agency that saw the phone records of approximately 20 AP employees turned over to federal investigators who sought to determine who had leaked information about the CIA's role in a foiled terror plot in Yemen. Holder claimed in a congressional hearing last week that he had recused himself from the investigation since he himself was interviewed as a possible suspect or witness. Carney has denied that Obama was informed about that probe, and said Monday that the president 'is committed to the press's ability to pursue information and protecting the First Amendment. Obama is 'also mindful,' he added, 'of secret and classified information needing to stay secret and classified for national security reasons.'","Documents reveal that federal agents spied on the phone records of his parents, who live on New York's Staten Island .

"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder faces hostile fire from Congress and the mass media since news emerged that his Justice Department spied on reporters from at least two press outlets while tracing the sources of national security leaks. The U.S. Constitution's First Amendment prohibits the federal government from interfering with the freedom of the press . As tempers flare among the Washington, D.C. press corps and Republicans sharpen their knives for Attorney General Eric Holder, the Department of Justice has scheduled a second sortie in its charm offensive meant to soften reporters' icy stares. The DOJ will host a 'policy meeting' on Tuesday for publishers and general counsels of news organizations, in the hope of stemming the tide of outrage from journalists angered over what they see as the federal government's intrusion into protected free-speech territory. The afternoon meeting, according to the invitation, is 'part of the Attorney General's . review of existing Department of Justice guidelines governing . investigations that involve the news media.' It is 'one of a series . of meetings with media and other organizations that the Attorney General . is conducting,' DOJ said, 'as part of the policy review directed by the President.' News emerged in May that Holder's agency secretly obtained phone records and emails from Associated Press and FOX News Channel journalists, in investigations targeting national security leaks. Neither news outlet was notified that the government was snooping on its personnel. Reactions from the establishment news media in Washington have ranged from annoyance to outrage, with the perceived threat to First Amendment press rights bringing a new level of aggression from many reporters about the other scandals facing the Obama administration. When MailOnline inquired about the Tuesday meeting, DOJ staff initially insisted via email that it would be an 'off the record policy meeting.' But Holder's chief of staff, Margaret Richardson, later softened that stand in a phone call with MailOnline. White House press secretary Jay Carney offered no direct defense of the Justice Department of Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, but quoted the White House chief of staff doing so in a New York Times article . Sally Buzbee (L), Washington bureau chief at The Associated Press, saw phone records from 20 of her employees fall into the federal government's hands. The DOJ also seized Fox News reporter James Rosen's private emails and some of his parents' private communications . 'I want to clarify a little bit,' she said. 'This ""off-the-record/on-the-record"" thing has taken on a life of its own.' 'We don't want to say it's on the record,' she explained, 'because we would have cameras rolling and we wouldn't have a candid exchange.' Two similar meetings, held May 30 and 31 with news editors and Washington bureau chiefs, were also originally framed as strictly 'off the record,' a journalistic classification that would prohibit reporters from writing or broadcasting about anything that happened, or even about who was in attendance. The first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, drafted March 4, 1789, are known as the Bill of Rights. What we know as the First Amendment was actually the third one listed. It includes the demand that 'Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...' But after pressure from some media outlets last week and a widespread boycott, the Justice Department adjusted that demand, permitting reporters to report generally on the substance of the Friday meeting, while still insisting that no participants could be quoted directly. That placed the Obama administration in the unconventional and potentially embarrassing position of promising to guarantee press freedoms during a meeting whose participants were essentially sworn to secrecy. Holder, The Washington Post reported . unironically, 'said officials would seek procedural and possibly . legislative changes to protect journalists’ First Amendment rights. ... The 90-minute meeting was attended by a small group of journalists after . several news organizations objected to the Justice Department’s . insistence that it be held off the record. The participants, however, . reached an agreement with the Justice Department under which they could . describe what occurred during the meeting in general terms.' 'We didn't want, especially last week when tempers were high, for there to be a transcription,' Richardson said Monday. Rep. Darrell Issa said Sunday morning on CNN that 'it would be kind to say [Eric Holder] misled Congress' about his agency's criminal investigations targeting journalists . About Tuesday's meeting, she counseled that Holder is 'okay with people reporting on their own participation' - but not in a self-promoting . manner. The attorney general, Richardson said, hopes not to 'lose the opportunity to have a meaningful . policy engagement.' 'We don't want to box anyone in,' she continued. 'But we . also don't want to create a big thing if someone reports on it and . writes, ""Can you believe that stupid question that was asked?""' 'I . know it's a gray area, this off-the-record description,' Richardson said. 'But that would . be our preference. We're trying to have some integrity in the policy . process with an idea exchange.' Tuesday's session is not going to be the same' as those held last week, she added. 'This is publishers and general . counsels, with the expectation that their perspectives will be different . from [those of] bureau chiefs.' Holder's hold on his position in Washington is progressively more tenuous with each week. He personally approved a search warrant application for emails and phone records belonging to Fox reporter James Rosen, telling a federal judge that his status as a potential criminal co-conspirator trumped the government's legal requirement to alert Fox News in advance or negotiate with the leading cable news network. The attorney general also, however, told the House Judiciary Committee during a May 15 hearing that, 'With regard to the potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material, that is not something I’ve ever been involved in, heard of or would think would be a wise policy.' The U.S. Department of Justice will be the scene of Tuesday's meeting, which MailOnline will attend. The agency is under fire for secretly obtaining two months of phone records of Associated Press reporters and both phone records and emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen . Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican who chairs that committee, has confirmed that he is investigating Holder's testimony to determine whether he committed perjury. Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Sunday on CNN that 'it would be kind to say he misled Congress.' 'It would be less kind and more accurate to say that would rise to be a lie by most people’s standards.' The Justice Department doesn't see it that way. 'The attorney general’s testimony concerning the potential prosecution of a member of the press,' a spokesperson said, 'was accurate and consistent with the facts' related to that leak case. Federal prosecutors, the spokesperson continued, never 'sought approval to bring criminal charges against the reporter.' Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has raised the specter of a perjury charge as one possible outcome of a congressional investigation into Holders testimony . White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough defended Holder in a statement Saturday to The New York Times. Holder, he said through a spokesman, “has the intellect, experience and integrity to efficiently run the Department of Justice and not get distracted by the partisans who seem more interested in launching political attacks than cooperating with him to protect the security and constitutional rights of the American people.' Asked Monday during a scheduled briefing for a comment on Holder's ability to remain in his job, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney referred reporters to McDonough's statement, which he said 'spoke for all of us' in the White House. 'I couldn't say it any better,' Carney said.","First meetings were targeted by angry boycotts after journalists were told they couldn't report on them .

"Stress-free Christmas: Justine Pattinson recommends making the most of your freezer . If you're feeling stressed about the thought of cooking Christmas dinner for the family on Wednesday than fear not. Food writer Justine Pattison can help you get a head start with her time-saving tips. Justine, author of recipe book Freeze, told MailOnline that with a little bit of forward planning, you can freeze your way to Christmas - so you can then relax and enjoy the day. From roast potatoes to stuffing and desserts, here she explains how you can prepare then freeze food for minimal fuss on Christmas Day... Cranberry sauce and bread sauce freeze beautifully for at least three months and can be thawed in the fridge overnight or reheated very gently from frozen, adding a little milk to the bread sauce if needed. Flat-freeze them both in zip-seal bags and you'll save heaps of space in the freezer. If you are worried that your Christmas bird won't give enough juice for a decent gravy, make a rich home-made stock with fresh chicken wings, onion, carrot, bay and thyme. Add a couple of rashers of smoked bacon, 3 tbsp redcurrant jelly and a glass of wine or port. Cover with cold water then simmer very gently for 45 minutes. After straining, pour into a rigid container and freeze for up to six months. Use as a base on the day and you’ll have a rich tasting gravy in no time. A slightly stale loaf can be whizzed into crumbs and made into a fabulous home-made stuffing. I add pork sausage meat – or squeeze the sausage meat out of my favourite herby sausages - sautéed  onions and leeks, ready-to-eat dried apricots, fresh cranberries and flaked almonds to mine. Freeze in a small roasting tin lined with foil then, once solid, take out of the tin, wrap in a second layer of foil and freeze for up to three months. Return to the tin and bake, uncovered, from frozen or thawed until nicely browned and piping hot throughout. Pigs in blankets can also be frozen ahead of time and cooked on the day. Roast potatoes can be frozen for up to three months while doing a large batch of braised red cabbage and freezing it means you'll have enough for the whole of the festive season . Forget the bought kind. Homemade roasties taste so much better. Peel, cut into large chunks and par-boil in a large pan of water for four minutes. Drain well in a colander, then return to the pan and add around 5 tbsp sunflower oil or melted goose fat, flaked sea salt and lots of ground black pepper. Shake about a bit to roughen up the edges then tip onto a large baking tray and leave to cool. Open-freeze (without covering) until solid. Transfer to a large freezer bag, press out as much air as possible, seal and freeze for up to three months. Roast from frozen in a hot oven for 50-60 minutes. You can do the same thing with parsnips or carrots too. And if you prefer mash to roast potatoes, you can freeze in bags and thaw overnight before reheating on the hob or in the microwave. Freezer essentials: Justine recommends always keeping milk, bread and butter on ice for emergencies . Braised red cabbage freezes very well, so make a large batch and it will see you through the whole of the festive season and beyond. I like to add star anise, a cinnamon stick and chunks of apple to mine - don't use cooking apples though or they'll turn to mush. Flat-freeze in zip-seal bags and thaw for three to four hours at room temperature before reheating. Frozen brussels sprouts can be heated from frozen in a large pan with lightly fried pancetta and chestnuts. I use the frozen diced pancetta and vacuum-packed chestnuts, which I break into pieces with my fingers as I drop them into the pan. A sprinkle of sea salt, a grind of black pepper and a knob of butter is all that’s needed to season and glaze at the end. Make an alternative to Christmas pudding, such as my Tutti-frutti ice cream pudding or try a chocolate torte or meringue pavlova. Whipped cream freezes quite well but you're better off keeping pouring creams in the fridge. Stash a box or two of mince pies, some brandy butter and good vanilla ice cream in the freezer and you'll never be short of a festive pud. Keep a couple of pints of milk in cartons, butter and a small loaf of bread to hand in the freezer. They all freeze well and can prevent a last minute panic. Cheese, bacon and sliced ham can be frozen for a month or two without spoiling and don't take up too much space either. Unbaked French pastries make a handy breakfast when you have family or friends staying and taste fantastic cooked from frozen and served hot from the oven.

"A Virginia inmate is one several people isolated at hospitals across the country under suspicion for Ebola. The unidentified female inmate incarcerated at a Loundon County jail was taken to Inova Loudon Hospital after coming down with a fever. Public officials are testing the woman for Ebola out of precaution since she traveled to West Africa in recent weeks. However, officials say there's a 'very low probability' she has the deadly virus. The inmate is just one of many potential Ebola cases across the nation including a Yale student and a Florida man. These new cases were reported as the CDC today conceded it is not entirely sure how to contain the disease. A Virginia inmate is being tested at Inova Loudon Hospital in Leesburg for Ebola. The unidentified woman had recently raveled from West Africa and was showing signs of the deadly disease, but officials say there a 'very low probability' she has the virus . Officials at Yale-New Haven Hospital today revealed the patient admitted last night was one of the university's student researchers monitoring the outbreak in Liberia. The Floridian man being examined in Jacksonville is under observation after coming into close contact with someone who recently traveled to west Africa. In California, Southwestern College was cordoned off for a few hours this morning following the news that a student had been on the same flight as Ebola-hit nurse Amber Jay Vinson - and her younger sister has since vomited. Connecticut fears: A patient who recently returned from Liberia is being tested at Yale-New Haven hospital . Florida: Memorial Hospital, Jacksonville, is testing someone who had contact with a person from west Africa . California: Officials posted this statement on the college's Facebook page this morning after closing . Congress today blasted the CDC for failing to put in place strict measures to block the spread of the disease, which has now infected at least eight people on US soil, disregarding the potential cases under review in Connecticut, Florida and California. Despite testing negative for the disease during the trip, the Yale student has been under voluntary isolation since returning to the United States on October 11. Last night, they contacted the hospital asking to be tested again. The tests have since come back negative. 'Yale-New Haven Hospital admitted a patient late Wednesday night for evaluation of Ebola-like symptoms,' the hospital said. 'We have not confirmed or ruled-out any diagnosis at this point. We are working in cooperation with city, state and federal health officials. There is no further information available at this time.' Officials will know more later today, WSFB reported. The other Yale University student researcher that was tested for the virus in Liberia is still in isolation. Staff at Jacksonville's Memorial Hospital believe it is 'high unlikely' that their patient has Ebola, a spokesman said. However, they are following the CDC's emergency guidelines while closely monitoring the case. The patient has been transferred to Baptist Health for testing. A spokesman at Baptist Health told First Coast News: 'We have admitted a patient with common flu-like symptoms (but no fever) who is being tested for Ebola on the basis of self-reported casual contact with a West Africa traveler. 'This patient is in isolation and is being monitored closely for their protection as well as the safety of our team members and the community.' Guidelines? Congress is concerned the CDC does not know how to control the disease after Dr Thomas Frieden accused Dallas nurses of wearing too much protective clothing when treating patient zero Thomas Duncan . The statement continued: 'There is no confirmation that this patient has Ebola; in fact, that diagnosis is highly unlikely. We are exercising extreme caution and are using CDC protocols to rule out the Ebola virus, for everyone's peace of mind.' In California, a nurse who examined the student claims she believes it is unlikely there is any risk of an Ebola diagnosis. In a statement released by Southwestern College, a spokesman said: 'A student and her family had been traveling to the Midwest last week. 'Upon their return, the sister exhibited flu like symptoms and has been hospitalized. 'The student is NOT exhibiting ANY flu like symptoms. 'The student contacted the instructor to inform the instructor why the student had not been in class.In an abundance of caution by some staff members, the 470 building was cordoned off.Our campus nurse has thoroughly examined the student and there IS NO EXPECTATION OF EBOLA.' All of the scares come as CDC officials struggle to deliver strict guidelines on how to control the disease. CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden initially blamed nurses for breaching the protection guidelines set out by the center. Today, he accused the medics of wearing too much protection which is difficult to remove, thereby 'increasing the risk of infection'. He will today be forced to explain the center's policy on Ebola and understanding on how to control it at a congressional committee. Outbreak: Amber Jay Vinson, 29, (left) and Nina Pham, 26, (right) have been infected with the disease despite wearing clothing while treating Duncan, the Liberian man who brought Ebola to the United States last month . Two nurses have now contracted the deadly virus despite wearing full personal protection equipment while caring for Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian man who died last week of Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Jay Vinson, 29, do not know how they became infected, and officials are investigating to try to find out. Pham has since undergone a blood transfusion in a bid to fight the disease. The recent diagnosis of Vinson has sparked fears across the nation after it emerged she spent time in Cleveland, Ohio, when she knew she had a fever. Vinson told the CDC she was ill but it has emerged the center said she could board a commercial flight from the Ohio city to Dallas, Texas. Schools and hospitals are now on lock-down across Cleveland, with nurses and teachers being sent home, and two schools closed.

"A three-year-old Colorado boy born without a brain has died after living what doctors called a miracle life. Nickolas Coke suffered from a rare condition known as anencephaly, meaning he was born with only a brain stem. While most children with this condition die shortly after their birth, Nickolas far exceeded that sentence. A miracle life: Nickolas Coke has died after living with only one brain stem . Surviving on little else than pain medication, Nickolas lived what his family called an incredible life. 'He was never hooked up to any machines, no tubes, no nothing,' Sherri Kohut, Nickolas’s grandmother, told KOAA in Colorado. 'He taught us everything, he taught the love, how to be family. He taught us everything.' Kohut, who was with Nickolas when he died, said the boy stopped breathing after having difficulties doing so all morning. Medical officials attempted to revive him using CPR, but after three failed attempt, he was pronounced dead. Surviving on little else than pain medication, Coke lived what his family called an incredible life . 'They told us ""no more, let him go"",' Kohut said. 'So he died at 12:40 today. Peacefully.' Nickolas was apparently in good spirits just days before his death. Recent photographs posted on Facebook show the boy smiling and laying in a pumpkin patch. 'He was laughing because he thought it was funny that we couldn't get him to stay still enough to roll off the pumpkins,' Kohut said. The family made an effort to get Nickolas out as much as possible, taking him on trips to the zoo and going camping. Incredible: Nickolas Coke lived until he was three years old and was pictured recently (right) in good spirits . Anencephaly occurs in about 1 in every 10,000 births, according to the National Center of Biotechnology Information. Children with anencephaly are considered unable to think or have emotions. Without a brain, Nickolas couldn’t speak, eat or walk and frequently suffered from debilitating seizures. Still his family believed the boy was growing both physically and mentally. 'He was our hero because he showed the strength if I can do this anything can be done,' Kohut said. 'He will always be remembered.'","Nickolas Coke suffered from a rare condition known as anencephaly which meant he was only born with a brain stem .

"Three missing suspected ISIS terrorists have given themselves up after officials in Turkey put them on a plane to the wrong French airport. The men are understood to have been jailed by ISIS on suspicion of spying after expressing a desire to return to France when they grew disillusioned with the group's campaign of terror in Syria and Iraq. Having escaped from their brutal captors, the men - who include the brother-in-law of Mohamed Merah, the man who murdered seven people at a Jewish school in Toulouse in March 2012 - handed themselves in at the Syrian border with Turkey. But despite them having agreed to justice in France, Turkish authorities managed to bungle the extradition - failing to put the men on an agreed flight to Paris and instead sending them to Marseille without informing the French police, allowing the suspected terrorists to simply wander off on arrival. Scroll down for video . Surrender: The three missing suspected ISIS terrorists gave themselves up at this village police station near Marseille after officials in Turkey put them on a plane to the wrong French airport . Having arrived in Marseille from Turkey on their still-valid passports, the men found there were no French police officers there to greet them - nor had the airport itself been informed of the situation. This allowed the men to simply pass through customs without causing suspicion and disappear, causing much embarrassment to French officials who had triumphantly announced in advance that the suspected terrorists would be arrested within minutes of their arrival at Paris Orly airport. Several hours after the men vanished, they once again handed themselves in - this time at a village police station the found after driving 105 miles north of Marseille. Lawyers defending the men say they handed themselves in because they want prosecutors at any future trial to take their evidence seriously. 'The three men handed themselves in because they want to be listened to by the authorities,' lawyer Apollinaire Legros-Gimbert said, adding the men had been in touch with French authorities for several months before their return. 'They were stunned not to have been questioned yesterday.' Embarrassingly for the government, the case has come at a time when France is already on high security alert after militant group Islamic State threatened French targets. France has joined a U.S.-led campaign of air strikes, hitting Islamic State targets in Iraq last week. Non arrival: French police were waiting for the suspected ISIS militants to arrive at Paris Orly airport (pictured). However bungling Turkish officials put them of a different flight to Marseille -  some 450 miles to the south . The mix-up in understood to have occurred after the pilot of the Paris-bound aircraft refused to let the men board the plane due to their status as suspected terrorists. Instead of reporting the problem, Turkish officials simply booked the men on to the next available France-bound flight - a passenger plane headed to Marseille, some 450 miles from Paris. One aspect that made the mix-up even more embarrassing for French authorities is that they were forced to backtrack on earlier claims the men were already in custody - admitting not only had they not yet been arrested, they had now disappeared without trace. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he had ordered an investigation of the case and said he would also travel shortly to Turkey to ensure the errors were not repeated. An interior ministry official said the three men had long been under surveillance by security services. One of them, Imad Jebali, has already spent time in a French prison after being charged for links to a jihadist network in Iraq in 2007. Another of the three, Abdelwaheb al-Baghdadi, is the brother-in-law of Mohamed Merah, who killed seven people including three Jewish children in Toulouse in March 2012 before police shot him dead. Christian Etelin, a lawyer advising Baghdadi's wife, said the men had originally gone to Syria to live in a religious society. They had escaped Islamic State to hand themselves over to Turkish officials because they had been terrified by the 'fanaticism' there, he said.","Suspected ISIS fighters deported from Turkey were to arrive at Paris Orly .

"Barack Obama took aim Wednesday night at Republicans who have blocked global warming legislation, saying they 'pretend' they 'don't read' science. But the president ignored the latest claims that threaten to destroy the U.S. climate change movement. In a speech to the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental activist organization, Obama mocked the GOP for playing dumb on global warming in order to evade the criticism of tea party groups and other elements on their right wing. Republicans have 'ducked the question and said, ""Hey, I'm not a scientist"",' Obama claimed, 'which really translates into ""I accept that man-made climate change is real, but if I say so I will be run out of town by a bunch of fringe elements, so I am just going to pretend like – I don't know – I can't read"".' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Obama told the League of Conservation Voters that Republican global warming deniers pretended they can't read in order to curry political favor on their right wing . Number-crunching: Allowing computers to fill in the gaps and replace actual temperature measurements has allegedly created a 'warming' that was never there in the first place . Obama last jabbed at climate skeptics during a speech at the University . of California Irvine, saying their arguments are akin to believing the moon is made of cheese. As he tries to rally public support around new White House rules aimed at coal-burning power plants, however, the president hasn't yet addressed a brewing scandal in the scientific community. Global warming specialists inside the scientific community are buzzing about revelations first made Friday, which show how the the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's official graph of historical surface temperatures has been quietly altered for years. Government scientists, it is alleged, have been tweaking some of the world’s most oft-cited climate records by replacing actual temperature readings in the United States, Iceland and Australia with hypothetical numbers derived from computer models. The result has been a distorted view of temperature trends, according to a blogger who first assembled the evidence, changing a steady temperature decline into an ominous-looking warming. The damning graphs published on the 'Real Science' blog by Steven Goddard, the nom de plume of a self-described 'lifelong environmentalist' with graduate-level scientific credentials. They show the impact of replacing the real measurements with computer-generated estimates, in an alleged scheme to de-emphasize temperature readings from earlier decades while giving added weight to more recent numbers. Obama spoke before an audience of more than 800 enthusiastic environmentalists in Washington during a gala hosted by the League of Conservative Voters . Not dying off: An American climate scientist was forced into retirement after being accused of falsifying data to show polar bears were drowning because polar ice caps had melted . They . are also tripped up by the changing list of temperature measurement . stations, Goddard writes, as more estimates are used instead of real . readings: 'As rural stations are lost, the infilling process . contaminates them with warmer urban stations.' This, . he says, is how the U.S. government has claimed the earth has been . steadily warming by 3 degrees Celsius per century, while the actual . measurements indicate that the planet has been cooling since the 1930s. Obama, . however, steered clear of science on Wednesday and accused Republicans . of ignoring global-warming evidence for political advantage. 'In Congress,' he said, . 'folks will tell you climate change is a hoax, a fad, or a plot – a . liberal plot.' 'If a bunch of doctors tell me that tobacco can cause lung cancer, then I’ll say, ""OK."" It’s not that hard,' he said to loud applause. 'Climate change' down under: This graph shows how replacing temperature data taken in Alice Springs, Australia with computer-modeled approximations has created the impression of warming . Even in Iceland: Discarding real temperature measurements from 50 or more years ago and replacing them with numbers from computer models has allegedly helped U.S. government scientists demonstrate nonexistent climate change . He said the future efforts to solidify a consensus about climate change will depend on the next generation, including his own daughters. 'You talk to Malia, you talk to Sasha, you talk to your kids or your grandkids – this is something they get,' said the president. 'They don’t need a lot of persuading.' Other controversial hiccups have cast the climate wars into disarray in recent years. In a 1999 email revealed following the 2009 hacking of an email server at the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, the institute's director Phil Jones wrote that he had altered the famed 'hockey stick' graph in order to 'hide the [temperature] decline' shown in scientific data. And in December 2013, an Alaska scientist whose reported observations of polar bears that had drowned in the polar Arctic helped motivate the global warming movement was forced into retirement. Charles Monnett, it was alleged by an official at the U.S. Department of the Interior, had colluded with another scientist to use false data in is research.","The president spoke to a partisan audience of environmental activists on Wednesday night in Washington .

"Attorney General Eric Holder personally signed off on the controversial search warrant that identified Fox News chief Washington correspondent James Rosen as a ‘possible co-conspirator’ in violations of the Espionage Act and authorized seizure of his private emails, an unnamed law enforcement official has claimed. Rosen, who has not been charged in the case, was the target of a search warrant that enabled Justice Department investigators to secretly seize his private emails after an FBI agent said he had ‘asked, solicited and encouraged … (a source) to disclose sensitive United States internal documents and intelligence information.’ The reporter's emails were seized, with a judge's approval, as part of the prosecution of Stephen Kim, a State Department adviser who is accused of leaking secret information about North Korea. Attorney General Eric Holder personally authorized the seizure of James Rosen's private emails, an unnamed law enforcement official has claimed . Reporter James Rosen was the target of a search warrant that enabled Justice Department investigators to secretly seize his private emails . Holder's approved the Rosen search in the spring of 2010 after senior Justice Department officials concluded there was ‘probable cause’ that his communications with Kim met the legal burden for such searches. ‘It was approved at the highest levels - and I mean the highest,’ said the law enforcement official, who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity on Thursday. He said that explicitly included Holder. The Justice Department is currently facing public scrutiny over its practices after it was also revealed that it has also obtained the phone records of 20 Associated Press reporters as it sought to determine who had leaked information about the CIA's role in a foiled terror plot in Yemen. In that instance, Holder denied any knowledge of the AP subpoena because he had been questioned as a witness in the underlying investigation into the leek. The disclosure came on the same day that President Barack Obama announced that the Justice Department is going to review the policy under which it obtains journalists' records in investigations of the leak of government secrets. Obama acknowledged he is 'troubled by the possibility that leaks investigations may chill the investigative journalism' that he says holds government accountable and said he has expressed his concerns to the Attorney General. But he said his administration would continue to try to find the government employees who are responsible for leaks. In recent weeks, the administration has acknowledged secretly seizing portions of two months of phone records from The Associated Press and reading the e-mails of Fox News reporter James Rosen in separate investigations about the publication of government secrets. The president said the government has to strike the right balance between security and an open society. President Obama announced on Thursday that the Justice Department is going to review the policy under which it obtains journalists' records in investigations of the leak of government secrets . He said Holder will meet with representatives of media organizations and report back to him by July 12. Obama re-stated his support for a media shield law that he said would 'guard against government overreach.' Such a law would require a federal judge to sign off before investigators could have a look at the records of journalists. 'Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs. Our focus must be on those who break the law,' Obama said. But the president also offered no apologies for his administration's aggressive pursuit of leakers. The six prosecutions since he took office in 2009 is more than in all other presidencies combined. 'As commander in chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field. To do so, we must enforce consequences for those who break the law and breach their commitment to protect classified information,' he said.","An unnamed sourced claims Eric Holder personally signed off the warrant to seize James Rosen's emails .

"CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden began his grilling Thursday on Capitol Hill with a stark admission that his agency is still searching for ways to combat the Ebola virus as it burrows into the United States. 'We're always open to ideas for what we can do to keep Americans safe,' Frieden said in his opening statement, in a startling departure from his prepared remarks in the face of a hostile and impatient panel in a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. 'We would consider any options to better protect Americans,' he said later during the hearing's Q&A period. Frieden's statements will not inspire already-shattered public confidence. The first Ebola patient identified on U.S. soil, Thomas Eric Duncan, was misdiagnosed. Two nurses caring for him have since contracted the body-destroying hemorrhagic fever – one of whom got on a flight with the CDC's blessing a day before she was hospitalized. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Taking on fire: CDC chief Thomas Frieden (center) has come to represent an agency labeled incompetent on Capitol Hill as Ebola takes hold and spreads . Circus: A Capitol Hill hearing room was overrun by photographers and reporters on Thursday as the CDC's top man faced questions . An uncomfortable Frieden parried with members of Congress for more than two hours, projecting little confidence and insisting at every turn that he was open to new ideas . The excruciating hearing came as three members of Congress and a sitting governor are calling for Frieden's resignation and the White House began the torturous process of throwing him under the disease-control bus on Thursday afternoon, saying that Frieden is 'taking responsibility' for his agency's screw-ups. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that the CDC director was responsible – implying that President Barack Obama is not. 'You have seen, at least in a couple instances, Dr. Frieden taking responsibility' for the CDC's widely panned response, he said. That plan included stepped-up Ebola screenings at five major U.S. airports – announced a week ago but only put in place on Thursday. Airports in New York, New Jersey, Atlanta, Chicago and Washington, D.C. are affected. Frieden was on the hottest seat in the hearing room after his agency's officials told one of the infected nurses that she could travel Monday on a commercial airplane – even though she treated the first patient and worked alongside the other nurse, who had already tested positive. The woman, Amber Vinson, traveled to Ohio to help with plans for her wedding and returned to Dallas on a Frontier Airlines plane. The news that she had spent time in Cleveland, and that three of her relatives work at Kent State University, sent the region into panic mode. Schools and hospitals are on lock-down across Cuyahoga and surrounding counties. And one store visited by her friends has been closed until it can be assessed. 'My understanding is that she did contact the CDC,' Frieden conceded Thursday, responding to questions from the House panel while saying he did not participate in the call. 'I have not seen the transcript of the conversation,' he added, casting blame on Vinson. 'My understanding is that she reported no symptoms to us.' It has been reported that she told the CDC she had a slightly raised temperature of 99.5F - but the CDC only classes anything above 100.4F as a fever. Frieden confessed the CDC is still not sure how Vinson and her co-worker, Nina Pham, contracted the Ebola virus. 'While we do not yet know exactly how these transmissions occurred,' he said, 'they demonstrate the need to strengthen the procedures for infection-control protocols which allowed for exposure to the virus.' 'She reported no symptoms to us': Frieden shifted blame for his agency's approval of an Ebola-exposed nurse to fly on a commercial jet . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Frieden is 'taking responsibility' for the flawed Ebola containment plan, suggesting that the Office of the President will be insulated from the backlash . Nurses Nina Pham (left) and Amber Vinson (right) cared for Thomas Duncan, whose case of Ebola was the first diagnosed in the US. They have both subsequently landed in isolation themselves with the viral infection . 'Protocol' problems: Dallas nurse Briana Aguirre told the TODAY show that she and other health care workers who came into contact with patient Thomas Duncan wore hazmat suits with large gaps near the neck . Dr. Daniel Varga, the chief clinical officer at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, also testified that his staff hadn't yet cracked the mystery. 'That's correct,' he said. Pham will be transferred soon from Dallas to a National Institutes of Health facility's special isolation unit in Washington, D.C. The nurses episode, along with the Obama administration's insistence that air travel must continue between the U.S. and the three hardest-hit African countries – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea – had Republican lawmakers hopping mad. 'People are scared. We need all hands on deck. We need a strategy,' barked Michigan Rep. Fred Upton, who chairs the full Energy and Commerce Committee. 'We need to protect the American people, first and foremost.' 'This is not a drill,' he said, 'a fact that the doctors and nurses working on the front lines understand. People’s lives are at stake, and the response so far has been unacceptable.' Pennsylvania Rep. Tim Murphy, who helms the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, said the stakes 'couldn't be any higher.' 'The number of Ebola cases in West Africa is doubling about every three weeks. The math still favors the virus, even with the recent surge in global response,' he added. 'With no vaccine or cure, we are facing down a disease for which there is no room for error. We cannot afford to look back at this point in history and say we could have done more.' Dr. Anthony Fauci, who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, provided little reason for enthusiasm. 'We are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented,' Fauci admitted in a written statement. 'People are scared. We need all hands on deck,' said Rep. Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican. 'This is not a drill' Horror: 9,000 west Africans have been diagnosed with Ebola and health authorities expect it to ultimately kill 70 per cent of those it infects . Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar demanded Frieden's resignation Thursday afternoon. 'CDC Director Thomas Frieden has failed to lead and has shown gross incompetence in his actions or lack thereof to prevent the spread of Ebola domestically,' Gosar said in a statement. 'We cannot afford such mistakes when American lives are at risk. That is why I am calling for the immediate resignation of Director Friedan (sic).' He joined fellow Republican Rep. Tom Marino of Pennsylvania, who said late Wednesday that the 'false sense of security' the CDC has offered 'is exactly the opposite of the CDC director’s primary responsibilities – to communicate clearly and honestly.' 'I have no ill will towards him personally but he should resign his position effective immediately,' Marino said. After Thursday's hearing, South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Florida Gov. Rick Scott both called on Frieden to get the axe. Their comments came during conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's Thursday broadcast. As of October 12 the World Health Organization reported 8,997 confirmed Ebola cases in Africa and 4,493 documented deaths. So far the U.S. has seen only three confirmed cases, one of which claimed the patient's life.That man, Thomas Duncan, was a Liberian national who traveled to Dallas in September. A clinician at Texas Presbyterian Hospital failed to note that he had come from an Ebola-stricken country, and he was sent home with antibiotics to treat his fever. Days later he returned and was placed in isolation until his death on Oct. 8. SHOCK: Dr. Daniel Varga (on video monitor), chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, said Thursday that Texas Presbyterian Hospital staff had no targeted Ebola containment training . Angry Americans responded Thursday to  Frieden's casual statement that the CDC is still looking for suggestions about how to tackle the Ebola crisis . 'All hands on deck': President Barack Obama said Wednesday after a two-hour cabinet meeting that the US government is fully engaged to battle the infection and stop it from spreading widely . Varga, the hospital administrator, admitted on Wednesday that his organization erred in turning Duncan away at first. 'Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes,' he told Congress. 'We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry.' Varga testified Thursday via video link. After acknowledging that he had distributed the CDC's Ebola protocol to the hospital's department in the early days of Ebola's African resurgence, he stunned the hearing room by admitting that his staff had no specialized training to prepare. Briana Aguirre, a Dallas nurse who helped treat Duncan, told NBC's Today show on Thursday that the CDC's Ebola protocols didn't help her and her coworkers cover up adequately in the hospital. Her and others' hazmat suits, she said, had large gaps between the bodysuit and the headpiece, exposing several inches of their necks. 'We never talked about Ebola,' she said. 'We were never told what to look for.' The hospital had hosted an optional seminar on Ebola, but there was no hands-on training included. When she realized her zipped-up hazmat suit didn't fully protect her, Aguirre said, 'I threw a fit. I just couldn't believe it, in the second week of an Ebola crisis at my hospital, the only gear they were offering us allowed our necks to be uncovered.'","Congressmen in hearing were hopping mad at CDC screwups and White House promises .

"Nike has suspended its endorsement deal with NFL star Adrian Peterson - just hours after the Minnesota Vikings deactivated him and ordered him to stay away from the team. 'Nike in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and has shared our concerns with the NFL,' the apparel giant said in a statement today. Nike is the latest company to distance itself from Peterson and the Vikings after the former NFL MVP was arrested over the weekend on charges he severely whipped his four-year-old son with a wooden switch - leaving wounds all over his body. On Wednesday, Vikings owners backtracked on their decision to allow him back on the field and admitted it was a 'mistake' to announce on Monday that he would be allowed to play again. Peterson must stay away from the team until after his trial on felony abuse charges - though he will still collect his $700,00-a-game salary. Scroll down for video . Nike has suspended its endorsement of Adrian Peterson, one of the NFL's biggest stars . Not . smiling now: Adrian Peterson stepped out Tuesday wearing entirely Nike gear - one day before the company dropped its sponsorship of the star . 'Made a mistake': Mark Wilf, co-owner of the Minnesota Vikings, offered up a mea culpa on Wednesday and announced that Adrian Peterson would be off the team until after his trial . 'We made a mistake. In the end, we are getting it right,' co-owner Mark Wilf said at a press conference today. 'We have to make sure that our reputation, and the team, was moving in the right direction.' The Vikings placed Peterson on the 'exempt/commissioner's permission' list, effectively booting him from the roster - finally bowing to pressure from outraged fans and fleeing sponsors. Nike stores in the Twin Cities pulled all of their Adrian Peterson jerseys from shelves on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Minneapolis-based Target announced its stores were pulling his jerseys, as well. Castrol Motor Oil was the first of . Peterson's major sponsors to drop him, announcing Tuesday that the . contract was suspended. On Monday, Radisson Hotels said it was . suspending its endorsement deal with the Vikings after owners allowed . Peterson back on the field following his arrest. At a press conference on Wednesday, Radisson's logo - normally ubiquitous - was noticeably absent. Some . of the NFL's top corporate sponsors like Anheuser-Busch, Visa and . McDonald's, had also voiced disapproval over the league's treatment of . its player scandals - including the decision to allow Peterson to . continue to play.

The . stunning reversal comes after a harrowing day on Tuesday that included . the Radisson hotel chains suspending its sponsorship with the Vikings. Castrol . Motor Oil, Special Olympics Minnesota and Mylan Inc., all severed ties . with Peterson, while Twin Cities Nike stores pulled Peterson's jerseys . from their shelves. In addition, Anheuser-Busch issued a strongly worded statement that said it was disappointed in the way the NFL was handling all of the negative attention surrounding former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice's assault of his then-fiancee. The rebuke could raise pressure on NFL . Commissioner Roger Goodell, who is already struggling to make amends after his . initial light punishment of former Baltimore Ravens star Rice for . punching his then-girlfriend, now his wife, in February.

'We fully support Adrian and he looks forward to watching his teammates and coaches being successful during his absence.' The Vikings said they had deliberations with the NFL over the previous two days and informed the league they were revisiting the situation. 'After giving the situation additional thought, we have decided this is the appropriate course of action for the organization and for Adrian,' the Wilfs said.

"A senior North Korean official has been executed with a flamethrower after Kim Jong-un branded him an 'enemy of the state', it has been claimed. O Sang-hon is said to have been brutally killed for his close ties to the communist leader's uncle Jang Song-taek, who was himself publicly tried and executed in December after being found guilty of corruption and 'counter revolutionary' activities. Mr O is thought to be the latest of 11 senior Workers Party figures to have been executed this year over their links to Mr Jang, with South Korean media reporting that Kim Jong-un has plans to execute or imprison hundreds more of his supporters and extended family members. Scroll down for video . Power: Kim Jong-un (pictured) branded O Sang-hon an 'enemy of the state' and had him executed by flamethrower, according to reports in South Korean media . Mr O had been Mr Jang's deputy at North Korea's ministry of public security, and his execution by flamethrower took place after being found guilty of helping his boss turn the state department into a personal security division and hide corruption, South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported. The ministry of public security has since been closed, with all 11 of the most senior officials said to have been either executed or sent to one of Kim Jong-un's concentration camps in a second wave of vengeance following conviction of Mr Jang. The first round saw Mr Jang's closest relatives and colleagues - including North Korea's ambassador to Cuba - executed for their links to the ministry. The second wave, which is currently underway, has seen the execution and imprisonment of senior officials who worked in the ministry, or in state departments affiliated with it. A planned third wave will allegedly target Mr Jang's extended family members , and his low ranking supporters in provincial chapters of the Workers Party - with reports this could result in the execution or imprisonment of up to 200 people. At the time of Mr Jang's removal a government statement was announced reading: 'The discovery and purge of the Jang group... made our party and revolutionary ranks purer.' Although the reports of Mr O's brutal end have not been officially confirmed, it would not be the first time Kim Jong-un had ordered unconventional execution methods. Links: O Sang-hon is said to have been brutally killed for his close ties to the communist leader's uncle Jang Song-taek (pictured in hat), who was himself executed in December after being found guilty of corruption . Just months after the death of his father Kim Jong-il in December 2011, the new leader ordered a vice minister of the army to be executed by mortar round after he was reportedly seen drinking alcohol and enjoying himself during the official period of mourning. A mortar round was said to have been chosen to execute Kim Chol as Kim Jong-un ordered 'no trace of him left behind, down to his hair,' according to sources in South Korea. Last August it was reported that the North Korean leader's former girlfriend was among a dozen well-known performers who were executed by firing squad for violating laws on pornography. It was even reported that Mr Jang himself had been executed by being fed to a pack of starving dogs, although this later turned out to have emerged from a satirical post on Chinese social media network. Analysts agree that Mr Jang was in fact almost certainly executed by firing squad, having been denounced as 'an anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional element' and 'despicable human scum' during an official state announcement of his death. There is concern in South Korea over the instability the purges are causing in Pyongyang, especially as it is coupled with renewed acts of belligerence by the North. Over the weekend a third unmanned reconnaissance drone from North Korea was discovered more than 80 miles south of the heavily fortified border.","O Sang-hon was reportedly killed for close ties to Kim Jong-un's uncle .

"Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Thursday that the president and his administration should reconsider putting a temporary moratorium on travel into the U.S. from West Africa. 'I think substantive actions need to be taken, and they may involve flight restrictions, they may involve moving all patients to specific hospitals in the country that can handle Ebola, and I think those would be wise decisions to make,' Carney, now a CNN contributor, said today. The former Obama flack noted that he's not 'an expert' on the issue before saying a more aggressive approach 'would demonstrate a level of seriousness in response to this that is merited at this point.' However, President Obama addressed the issue directly this evening when he said he had no 'philosophical objection' to an travel ban, but that he thought it would do more harm than good. Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said today that his former boss should reconsider putting a temporary moratorium on flights coming into the U.S. from Ebola hot spots . After holding a meeting on the health crisis, the president spoke to reporters and said 'a flat-out travel ban is not the way to go.' The president has ordered that heightened screening measures be put in place at the international airports where 94 percent of people coming countries afflicted with Ebola enter into the U.S. ‘Now, if we were to put in place a travel ban or a visa ban, it would provide a direct incentive for individuals seeking to travel to the United States to go underground and to seek to evade this screening and to not be candid about their travel history in order to enter the country,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said at an afternoon briefing. President Obama said Thursday that he has no 'philosophical objection' to a travel ban, but that he thinks it would do more harm than good . 'And that means it would be much harder for us keep tabs on these individuals and make sure that they get the screening that's needed to protect them and to protect more importantly the American public,’ he added. ‘And again, it's a relatively small number, about 150 a day that enter this country.’ It's also important to the administration, Earnest said, to keep this line of transportation open because commercial transportation 'is critical' to making sure supplies, equipment and personnel are able to enter the region. Earnest said as a 'practical matter' a travel ban would make it 'harder for the international community to respond to this incident' because commercial airlines don't want to fly people and items to West Africa just to fly empty planes, with no passengers or cargo, back. Probed by Fox News' Ed Henry for the White House's thoughts on Carney's suggestion that the administration needs to approach the Ebola outbreak with a higher level of seriousness than it has in the past, Earnest argued that the president and his team's response to the third Ebola diagnosis yesterday 'indicates that that we're deadly serious about this.' 'We're dealing with a deadly disease, and what you are seeing is the kind of tenacious response that the American people are countin' on,' he told Henry. As far as designating certain hospitals to serve as Ebola treatment centers, Earnest said that was a decision for the CDC. However, he revealed that it's something 'that CDC is examining right now.' Rep. Tim Murphy, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, questions top U.S. health officials about the Ebola outbreak on Capitol Hill today. Murphy endorsed a travel ban and charged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure' White House spokesman Josh Earnest was blitzed with questions about the Obama administration's handling of the Ebola crisis today. The Obama administration official said again today that the president would not slap travel restrictions on commercial travel from West Africa to the U.S. At least 42 members of Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner, have called on the president to halt flights coming out of West Africa. More than two dozen of them signed a letter last week begging the president to budge. At an emergency congressional hearing on the Ebola crisis today in Washington, D.C., Ohio Rep. Tim Murphy alleged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure.' 'Yet the administration continues to advance a contradictory reason for this failed policy that frankly doesn’t make sense, especially if ""priority one"" is to contain the spread of Ebola and protect public health,' he said at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing. Murphy, the chairman of the subcommittee, estimated that roughly 1,000 people coming from Ebola stricken countries are arriving in the U.S. each week. Any one of them could be an Ebola carrier, he suggested. John P. Wagner, the acting assistant commissioner for the Office of Field Operations at the Customs and Border Protection agency assured members of Congress today that 'there are no flights coming to the United States from the affected areas.' He admitted that 'there's hundreds of flights a day coming from Europe,' however, including flights that connect in Europe with airliners flying out of area's with high rates of Ebola cases. CDC Director Thomas Frieden explained that 'many of the people coming to the U.S. from Africa are American citizens.' 'People travel, and people will be coming in,' he explained. Friden wouldn't say whether or not his agency had discussed a travel ban with the White House, whie indicating that the CDC would be open to the idea. The CDC does not have the ability to restrict flights or visas, though he said. 'At CDC, our authority is to quarantine individuals or require the isolation of individuals.' Friden directed members of Congress to the White House for further questions on the possibility of new travel restraints. At today's hearing Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan questioned the wisdom of the White House's claims that it won't put a travel ban in place because of how hard it would be send equipment and personnel to West Africa in that scenario. 'Surely we can find other ways to get the aid workers and supplies in to these countries,' he said. 'From terrorist watch lists to quarantines, there are tools used to manage air travel to assure public safety. Why not here? 'We can no longer be reacting to each day’s crisis. We need to be aggressive and finally get ahead of this outbreak.' Upton said the administration needs a better plan to treat people who are sick and 'to stop the spread of this disease here at home and at its source in Africa.' 'This includes travel restrictions from that region beginning today.'","'I think substantive actions need to be taken, and they may involve flight restrictions,' former Obama spokesman Jay Carney said today .

"Forget teenagers pining over Taylor Lautner in Twilight, werewolves are hot in a whole new way in the world of fad dieting. A little-known diet is gaining popularity, with celebrities like Demi Moore and Madonna reportedly choosing to follow the 'Werewolf diet', Grazia reports. Also known as the Lunar Diet, it is based on the idea that the moon effects the water in our bodies in the same way that it determines the tides of the oceans, and that this power can be harnessed to help you lose weight. Some websites detailing the diet even claim it is possible to lose up to 6lbs in 24 hours. Demi Moore, left, and Madonna, right, have both apparently followed the Lunar diet . Though there are numerous variations of the diet, they essentially involve a liquid cleanse for a few days of the month; either at the full moon, new moon or beginning of a moon phase. Fans of the diet claim the moon exerts the same gravitational pull on the water in our bodies as it does on the world’s oceans. They claim this pull is biggest during a full and new moon, and undergoing a liquid fast during this time will enable the moon to flush toxins out of the body aiding weight-loss. Some people also claim the moon can affect your mood and that fasting during these points in the lunar calendar will reduce cravings. Advising only the consumption of water and juice, one website, Moon Connection, explains: 'It is critical that you start the diet on the very minute the moon phase begins. 'If the new phase begins during the middle of the day, you can eat or drink whatever you want up until that minute - then start your 24-hour timer.' The website, which echoes what most other Lunar and Werewolf diets say, explains that the moon will act with the water in the body to aid detoxification and weight loss. 'Consuming more fluids will call on the power of the moon, stimulate renal activity, and allow your body to lose its excess water. This flushes out the toxins that accumulate in the body due to unhealthy foods, bad digestion, and stress, and provides a detoxifying effect that will strengthen your immune system. ‘You can also lose up to 6lbs during this single day of fasting due to the lost water.’ Followers of the diet claim that the moon will act with the water in the body to aid detoxification and weight loss . Most websites recommend only following the diet for one to three days at a time, but others say you can follow it for up to six days - which is longer than most dieticians would say was safe. Worryingly, health experts fear this diet offers very little in the way of actual effectiveness. While a juice cleanse for 24 hours may help you feel lighter, you are unlikely to lose more than 1lb in weight. Added . to that, there is no reliable evidence at all that the moon affects the . water content in our bodies, nor that fasting at such a time would help . you to lose weight. The Warewolf or moon diet advocates juice cleanses at specific times in the lunar calendar . Speaking to the MailOnline about the 'Werewolf diet' British Dietetic Association spokesperson Jeanette Crosland, said: . 'There may be some evidence that fluid retention occurs at some points in the menstrual cycle, and therefore at other points in the cycle this fluid will reduce. However not every female will be at the same point in her cycle when a full moon occurs. 'If indeed the effect of the moon is to reduce the water content of the body, any effect is temporary and true ""weight loss"", the target of the weight reducer, is the result of losing excess body fat, not water. 'Any diet which restricts calories will normally result in weight loss, and this is yet another diet based on fasting for short periods, resulting in a reduced energy (calories) intake over a period of time. 'As with any period of fast, individuals should be careful of taking part if they have underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, and should also be aware of the reduced nutrient intake from abstaining from food. 'Overall, this is another ""diet"" designed to catch the attention of the public, written in a way that suggest a scientific basis which doesn't truly exist and basically boiling down to a short fast plus a (hopefully healthy) weight loss diet based on reducing calorie intake.'","Werewolf diet advocates juice cleanses at specific times of month .
Based on idea that moon affects water in our bodies in same way as tides .

"Barack Obama's former nanny has been revealed as a gay transgender man who made the future president laugh by trying on his mother's lipstick. 'Evie' cared for the boy she called Barry when his mother Ann Dunham moved to the Indonesian capital of Jakarta in the late 1960s. Openly gay, she would leave the house dressed in full drag - but was very careful that Barack never saw her. 'He was so young and I never let him see me wearing women's . clothes,' Evie said. 'But he did see me trying on his mother's lipstick, sometimes. That used to really crack him up.' Cared for: Barack Obama (left) was looked after by transgender man Evie (right) when he lived in Indonesia . Former life: Barack Obama's former nanny Evie, who was born a man but believes she is a woman, on the left of this picture . The nanny, who turned to prostitution after the family left and now lives in a slum, met the future commander-in-chief's mother at a cocktail party in 1969. Dunham, who had moved to the country two years earlier with her second husband Lolo . Soetoro, sampled Evie's beef steak and fried rice and was so impressed that she offered her a job. It . did not take long before she was also eight-year-old Barack's carer, playing with him and bringing him to and from school. Neighbours . recalled they often saw Evie, who believes she is really a woman, leave the house in the evening fully made . up and dressed in drag. But when the family left in the early 1970s, things started going downhill. Evie . moved in with a boyfriend. That relationship ended three years later, . and she became a sex worker. She said: 'I tried to get a job as a maid, but no one would hire me. I needed money to buy food, get a place to stay.' Poverty: Evie has suffered taunts and beatings throughout her entire life. She now lives in a tiny hut in a Jakarta slum . Young leader: Barack Obama (circled) as a child at his school in Jakarta, Indonesia . It . was a cat-and-mouse game with security guards and - because the country . was still under the dictatorship of General Suharto - soldiers. They . often rounded up 'banshees' or 'warias', as they are known locally, . loaded them into trucks, and brought them to a field where they were . kicked, hit and otherwise abused. Indonesia's attitude toward transgenders is complex. Nobody knows how many of them live in the sprawling nation of 240million, but activists estimate seven million. Because Indonesia is home to more Muslims than any other country in the world, the pervasiveness of men who live as women and vice versa often catches newcomers by surprise. They hold the occasional pageant, work as singers or at salons and include well-known celebrity talk show host Dorce Gamalama. But societal disdain still runs deep - when transgenders act in TV comedies, they are invariably the brunt of the joke. They have taken a much lower profile in recent years, following a series of attacks by Muslim hard-liners. And the country's highest Islamic body has decreed that they are required to live as they were born because each gender has obligations to fulfil, such as reproduction. 'They must learn to accept their nature,' says Ichwan Syam, a prominent Muslim cleric at the influential Indonesian Ulema Council. 'If they are not willing to cure themselves medically and religiously' they have 'to accept their fate to be ridiculed and harassed'. Many transgenders turn to prostitution because jobs are hard to find and because they want to live according to what they believe is their true gender. In doing so, they put themselves at risk of contracting AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The raid that changed everything came in . 1985. Evie and her friends scattered into dark alleys to escape the . swinging batons. One particularly beautiful girl, Susi, jumped into a . canal strewn with garbage. When things quieted, those who ran went . back to look for her. 'We searched all night,' said Evie, who is still . haunted by the memory of her friend's face. 'Finally ... we found her. It was horrible. Her body swollen, face bashed in.' Evie decided, then and there, to live . the rest of her life as a man. She ditched her tight, flowery dresses, . brocade vest and bras. Now . 66, she said: 'I knew in my heart I was a woman, but I didn't want to . die like that. So I decided to just accept it. I've been living like . this, a man, ever since.' Several longtime residents of Obama's . old Menteng neighbourhood confirmed Turdi had worked there as Barack's . nanny for two years, also caring for his baby sister Maya. Evie, who like many Indonesians goes . by a single name, now lives in a closet-sized hovel in a tightly packed . slum in an eastern corner of Jakarta, collecting and scrubbing dirty . laundry to pay for food. She wears baggy blue jeans and a white T-shirt advertising a tranquil beach resort far away in a place she has never been. She speaks softly, politely, and a deep worry line is etched between her eyes. As a child, Evie was often beaten by a father who could not stand having such a 'sissy' for a son. She said: 'He wanted me to act like a boy, even though I didn't feel it in my soul.' Teased and bullied, she dropped out of school after the third grade and decided to learn how to cook. She made her way into the kitchens of several high-ranking officials by the time she was a teenager. And then she met Obama's mother. Evie now seeks solace in religion, . going regularly to the mosque and praying five times a day. She said she . is just waiting to die. She . added that she did not know the boy she helped raise won the 2008 U.S. presidential election until she saw a picture of the family in local . newspapers and on TV. She blurted out that she knew him. As a child: Barack Obama seen riding a tricycle in his youth (left) and with his mother Ann Dunham, who moved him to Jakarta after her divorce (right) Her . friends at first laughed and thought she was crazy, but those who live . in the family's old neighbourhood confirmed it is true. 'Many . neighbours would remember Turdi. She was popular here at that time,' said Rudy Yara, who still lives across the street from Obama's former . house. 'She was a nice person and was always patient and caring in keeping young Barry.' Evie . hopes her former charge will use his power to fight for people like . her. Obama named Amanda Simpson, the first openly transgender appointee, . as a senior technical adviser in the Commerce Department in 2010. For . Evie, who's now just trying to earn enough to survive each day on . Jakarta's streets, the election victory itself was enough to give her a . reason - for the first time in a long time - to feel proud. 'Now when people call me scum,' she says, 'I can just say: 'But I was the nanny for the President of the United States!'","Evie, 66, cared for future Commander in Chief she called Barry in late 60s .

"Ebola-stricken NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is still fighting off the dreaded virus, but the 33-year-old was well enough Thursday to poke fun at a congressional hearing about the disease. '""Do dogs spread Ebola?"" this hearing is really something else,' Mukpo tweeted as he watched lawmakers grill the CDC chief from his Nebraska hospital bed. Earlier this week Mukpo, whose progress has doctors 'really, really pleased,' was well enough to return to social media just as the potentially deadly journey was beginning for two Dallas nurses. Scroll down for video . Well enough to tweet: Ebola-stricken NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is still fighting off the dreaded virus, but the 33-year-old was well enough Thursday to poke fun at a congressional hearing about the disease . 'Do dogs spread Ebola': The journalist and human rights advocate had some fun at the hysterical Congress's expense . Mukpo acknowledged the nurses, in a general way at least, when he tsked the Congressmen and their televised outrage Thursday. 'Settle down guys, health workers and people in west Africa r the ones at risk,' Mukpo tweeted. Mukpo continued: . 'So far the only people who have contracted Ebola and who weren't in SL, guinea, or Liberia recently are health workers.' Mukpo posted on Twitter on Monday afternoon: 'Back on twitter, feeling like I'm on the road to good health. Will be posting some thoughts this week. Endless gratitude for the good vibes.' His positive outlook appeared all the more impressive when it was revealed the freelance human rights advocate would be made to cover his own $500,000 medical expenses. A GoFundMe page was created in order to crowd fund the half-million dollar hospital bill. But then, as his health improved on Wednesday, Mukpo's financial outlook appeared to be improving as well when the GoFundMe page was updated to reflect the NBC decision to pay his mounting bills. This, despite Mukpo having only worked or the network a very short time. The fundraising goal has now been lowered considerably and 'will now be directed toward replacing all of Ashoka’s gear and possessions...covering his travel expenses and helping him to recover and rebuild his life.' Mukpo tweeted while members of Congress grilled CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden beat back criticism of the agency's Ebola response . Getting grilled: CDC Director Tom Frieden and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Anthony Fauci (R) beat back criticism at a congressional hearing Thursday . The NBC News cameraman who is infected with Ebola is the son of a renowned Tibetan monk responsible for bringing Buddhism to the West in the 1970s. His mother is an English aristocrat who was seduced at age 15 by the guru and married him at 16. When Ashoka Mukpo was just 8 months old, his father - Chögyam  Trungpa Rinpoche - announced that the boy was a 'tulku' - the reincarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist Lama. Mr Mukpo later traveled to Tibet, where he was enthroned and honored as the ninth reincarnation of Khamnyon Rinpoche, 'the Mad Yogi of Kham.' A further twist in the cameraman's life: Trungpa, who is considered his father, is not his biological dad. His biological father is actually Mitchell Levy - a Jewish doctor from New York who was Trungpa's personal physician - whom his mother Lady Diana Mukpo was sleeping with at the time. Ashoka's mocking tweets came Thursday came as--in the face of skepticism in Congress--health officials tried to assure the nation Thursday that they can head off an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. despite mistakes that let the deadly virus spread to two nurses and cleared one of them to fly. The revelation that one of the hospital nurses was allowed on a commercial airline the day before she was diagnosed raised new alarms about the U.S. response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Some lawmakers pressed for a ban on travel to the U.S. from the region - a course President Barack Obama is resisting. The death toll is expected to climb above 4,500 in Africa, all but a few within Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the World Health Organization said. Obama directed his administration to respond in a 'much more aggressive way' to the threat and, for a second day in a row, canceled his out-of-town trips to stay in town and monitor the Ebola response. He was calling foreign leaders and U.S. lawmakers to discuss what more must be done, the White House said, and bringing his Cabinet members together on the matter. But a ban on travel to the U.S. from the Ebola-stricken countries is not under consideration, spokesman Josh Earnest reiterated Thursday. Obama believes the U.S. already is taking the necessary steps to protect the public by screening passengers as they depart West Africa and again when they enter the U.S., Earnest said. Ashoka's mocking tweets came Thursday came as--in the face of skepticism in Congress--health officials tried to assure the nation Thursday that they can head off an Ebola outbreak in the U.S. despite mistakes that let the deadly virus spread to two nurses and cleared one of them to fly. The first nurse stricken in the U.S., Nina Pham, who contracted Ebola after treating a Liberian man at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, was being flown to the National Institutes of Health outside Washington on Thursday, while a second nurse has already been transferred to a biohazard infectious disease center at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The two nurses, Pham and Amber Joy Vinson, had been involved in providing care to Thomas Duncan, who died of Ebola last week. In a hearing on Capitol Hill, the chairman of a House committee cited 'demonstrated failures' in the government's response. Rep. Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania said the 'trust and credibility of the administration and government are waning as the American public loses confidence each day.' Seated before him were leaders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the NIH. Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, testified that despite the latest incidents, 'we remain confident that our public health and health care systems can prevent an Ebola outbreak here.' In his prepared testimony, the Texas hospital's chief clinical officer, Dr. Daniel Varga, admitted the facility had made mistakes in Duncan's initial treatment, he apologized for that. 'We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola,' Varga said. 'We are deeply sorry.' Duncan was initially sent home from the emergency room with antibiotics for his high fever, despite saying he'd come from Liberia. Varga testified to the committee by video conference.","Ashoka Mukpo, 33, told congressmen who grilled the CDC chief Thursday to 'calm down' as he recovers in a Nebraska hospital bed .

"The NFL announced some major changes to their performance-enhancing drug policy earlier today that will likely have a huge impact on the league's players. Under the new rules, players who test positive for banned stimulants during the offseason will not be suspended once regular season play commences, and will instead be referred to a substance abuse program. The league will also begin testing for human growth hormone starting next month. Fail: Wes Welker (above) was suspended by the league after tesing positive for amphetamine during the offseason . The NFL also lifted three players' suspensions under this new policy, among them Denver Broncos star and former New England Patriot Wes Welker, who tested positive for amphetamine during the offseason. A source told CBS Sports this was due to the wide receiver's usage of Adderall during the Kentucky Derby. He and the two other suspended players, Dallas Cowboys defensive back Orlando Scandrick and St. Louis Rams wide receiver Stedman Bailey, will return to the field this weekend, having sat out just two games of their four-game suspension. Back in action: Welker (left), Dallas Cowboys defensive back Orlando Scandrick (middle) and St. Louis Rams wide receiver Stedman Baile (right) had their suspensions lifted and will return to play this weekend . The league and union are also nearing an agreement on changes to the substance abuse policy. This new policy does get strict when it comes to some penalties however, laying out much harsher suspensions for players who test positive for any banned substance or stimulant during the season. According to CBS News, use of a diuretic or masking agent will result in a two-game suspension, steroids, in-season use of stimulants, HGH and other banned substances gets a player a four-game suspension, and any evidence of an attempt to manipulate a test is a six-game suspension. Second violations will result in a 10-game ban, and a third violation is at least a two-year suspension. This all comes as the league is under heavy scrutiny in the wake of two abuse scandals involving stars Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Many are upset with the punishments these two received, feeling the NFL was too lenient.

"Fox News host Sean Hannity unbuckled his belt and whacked it Monday night, while demonstrating how he was beaten as a child and defending Minnesota Vikings player Adrian Peterson. Hannity made the remarks while speaking to a panel on his program 'Hannity', which consisted of Mike Bako, Robi Ludwig, and Mercedes Colwin, Mediaite pointed out. Peterson, a star in the NFL, is accused of beating two of his children. 'I got hit with a strap, bam, bam, bam, and I've never been to a shrink, by my father,' Hannity said while starting the discussion. 'I would tell you I deserved it. I think he went too far, but I don't want to see this guy get a felony, I don't want to see this guy lose his job, I don't want to see this guy - he deserves parenting classes.' Scroll down for video . Defense: While thumping his belt, Fox News anchor Sean Hannity said he 'got it like this' from his father . Afte Ludwig, a psychotherapist, said Peterson's alleged child abuse 'took it to an extreme,' Hannity interrupted and said 'I had welts when my father hit me with his belt. Come on.' When Ludwig continued, remarking that 'Corporal punishment doesn't work,' Hannity responded 'I don't hit my kids. I don't have to. I take their iPhone away. It works perfectly.' After Colwin, a legal analyst, described the wounds Peterson's children suffered as a result of his alleged abuse, Hannity responded 'But all the people that have used switches over the years, and used belts, what are we going to do: arrest them all? We gonna arrest everybody that's ever hit their kid?' 'But it's a changing time,' journalist Bako said, asking if Hannity's father put leaves in his mouth, in a manner similar to Peterson's alleged abuse. Interrupting Bako, Hannity said 'My father punched me in the face when I talked back to him once, and I deserved it.' Corporal punishment: Hannity, who also snapped his belt on the program,  said he 'deserved' his punishment from his father and 'was a troubled kid' When Ludwig spoke about between spanking, child abuse and corporal punishment, Hannity unbuckled his belt from his trousers. 'I got it like this!,' he said, while whacking his belt on the table three tames. 'And I deserved it. I was a troubled kid.' 'We know better,' Ludwig said, while Colwin talked about how felony child abuse charges may be brought against a parent. As Colwin spoke, Hannity repeatedly snapped his belt. 'So a switch is always wrong in your view?' he asked after she finished speaking. 'Yes,' Colwin said. 'You should arrest every parent that uses a switch?' When Colwin and Ludwig spoke over one another, Hannity asked 'So my father should have been arrested, based on today's standards?' 'Maybe,' Ludwig said, while Colwin replied 'Yes.' 'That's nuts,' Hannity said. 'He went too far,' Hannity said at a later point in the program. 'Don't put this guy in jail, ruin his career. Give him Robbie Ludwig classes.' When Colwin and Ludwig spoke over one criticized Hannity's remarks, Hannity said 'I will tell you, I was not mentally bruised my father hit me with a belt.'

"A former police chief allegedly tried to commit suicide after being charged with the sexual abuse of a four-year-old female relative. Andrew Demers Jr, a 73-year-old married grandfather, reportedly tried to kill himself days before an investigation was launched into whether he engaged in unlawful sexual conduct with a child. The former chief of the Maine State Police confessed from his intensive care bed last week at the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston, according to the sheriff's office. Scroll down for video . Andrew Demers Jr, 73, the former chief of Maine State Police, was charged with unlawful sexual contact with a four-year-old female relative on Monday . Demers, who was named a Legendary Trooper ten years ago, turned himself in on Monday at the county jail. He was released on $5,000 cash bail. He was charged with a single count of unlawful sexual contact and faces up to ten years in prison. Demers, who served as an officer for 26 years, was chief of state police for six years from 1987 until 1993 when he retired. The investigation began after police were tipped off on March 10 about the allegations involving a female relative. The alleged abuse had been taking place at Demers' house in New Gloucester for several months, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce. No other victims have been named. The sheriff said it is unclear if the suicide attempt and the fact Demers was about to be investigated by police were related. Demers’ attorney, Walter McKee, told the Press Herald that it was wrong of detectives to interview his client in the ICU. He added: 'Is the ICU really the place you want to conduct a reliable interview involving serious allegations?' Due to new legislation, the former police chief will not lose his police pension if convicted. Demers came under fire in the 1970s when it was alleged that he turned a blind eye to allegations of abuse against several boys by the founder of the Cole Farms Restaurant in Gray, who was a close personal friend. Restaurateur Warren Cole was charged with sexually molesting a boy from 1986-7. He was jailed in 1992. Accused former officer Andrew Demers Jr, seen here in an old police tape, reportedly admitted to the abuse from his hospital bed .","Andrew Demers Jr, a 73-year-old married grandfather, reportedly tried to kill himself days before an investigation .

"The man who holds the secrets of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un’s finances was reported last night to be in hiding in China after fleeing for his life from Kim’s rule. The aide was responsible for managing the funds of Kim’s recently-ousted uncle Jang Song Thaek, and in turn is believed to have intimate knowledge of the 32-year-old leader’s finances. Two other aides to Jang were reportedly executed in recent months for corruption. It is believed the firing squad deaths prompted the unnamed defector to flee to China and make contact with the South Korean embassy in Beijing. Purges: Jang Song Thaek, left, was recently ousted from his position by his nephew North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, right. It has emerged that the aide responsible for handling Jang's finances has now fled to China . The defection was reported today by South Korean media who said its agents were holding the aide in a secret location in China. The news came as separate reports in South Korea suggested that Kim was preparing to purge his ailing aunt, Jang's estranged wife, Kim Kyong-hui. It is believed that Kim is planning to replace the 65-year-old, who plays a supporting role in his regime but is rumoured to be battling cancer, alcoholism and depression linked to the suicide of her daughter, with his younger sister. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, told The Telegraph: '[Kim] is trying to bring in a younger generation of decision-makers and has kicked out the older ones, which is causing a lot of problems in the elite in Pyongyang.' Mr Shigemura added: 'He has been able to do that in the party and the bureaucracy, but he does not have the power to do that with the military.' Kim's moves to replace many of the senior officials who served his father are apparently an attempt to shore up his rule with younger henchmen loyal to his regime. Cable news network YTN said the defector who escaped to China managed funds for ‘uncle Jang’, whose marriage to Kim’s aunt and proximinity to the leader of two years made him one of the most powerful men in North Korea. YTN said the aide’s defection might have led to the sacking of Kim’s uncle from his senior post in the North Korean leadership. The man not only had knowledge of the uncle’s finances, but also those of Kim Jong-Un and his late father, former leader Kim Jong-Il. North Korean watchers said if the reported defection was confirmed, it would be the first time in many years that a significant insider had managed to flee. The Kim family is feared throughout the country of 25million, where the current Kim, his father and grandfather Kim Il-Sung, have ruled with an iron fist. The family has shown its ruthlessness in protecting its privacy with a series of executions or banishment to labour camps, so a defection by a top aide would be regarded as a disaster. What secrets does he hold? The defector is believed to have been responsible for handling Jang's finances and in turn is believed to have intimate knowledge of the 32-year-old leader¿s financial affairs . The fleeing man will need extreme protection for the rest of his life if he succeeds in gaining asylum in South Korea - North Korean agents will have made him a number one target for assassination. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hong Lei, said: ‘We have noted the report but do not understand the situation.’ However, Beijing is a close ally of Pyongyang and rarely allows anyone fleeing from North Korea to move on to a third country. YTN said the aide fled to China some time in late September or early October and the ‘highly important catch’ would have been given immediate protection. However, he still has to be moved from China to South Korea, but the South’s agents have become experts at carrying out successful human smuggling operations. Initially, said the cable news network, the aide had tried to flee from China to Laos, a route used by other defectors, but his attempt was blocked by Chinese agents. According to YTN, it is not only South Korea which wants to sit down with the aide and listen to all he can tell them about the finances - and other matters - of Kim Jong-Un. The U.S. has also asked for custody of him - or at the very least access to debrief him.","Defector's job was managing finances of recently ousted Jang Song Thaek .

"The driver of the car from which a woman was either pushed or fell to her death on a busy Southern California freeway has been charged with murder. Ricardo 'Rick' Jimenez, 26, turned himself over to authorities yesterday over the tragic death of his lover Maria Josefina 'Josie' Jimenez, 22, about 1am on Thursday. Ms Jimenez was fatally struck numerous times by oncoming traffic after tumbling from the front passenger seat of the wildly careening car, being driven by Mr Jimenez, onto the Foothill (210) Freeway in Sylmar, Los Angeles. Victim: Maria Josefina 'Josie' Jimenez, 22, died after being hit by multiple cars when she was pushed or fell out a moving car on an LA freeway . Imprisoned: Ricardo 'Rick' Jimenez, 26, has been charged over the murder of his lover Josie Jimenez after turning himself in . Unfaithful: Rick Jimenez had reportedly been having an affair with Josie Jimenez who was estranged from her husband . Only one of the drivers that hit the heavily-tattooed victim stopped to help after her lover sped away in her red Toyota Corolla, according to Laist.com, while others said they tried in vain to avoid hitting Ms Jimenez. The Westlake resident was alive when she was thrown from the moving car. The pair, who were reportedly having an affair, had had an argument at a Sylmar tattoo parlor just before the tragic incident. 'We have multiple sources who have come forward putting Rick and Josie at a local tattoo parlor before midnight, with Rick causing a disturbance and berating Josie in front of others,' Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, Lieutenant Paul Vernon, told NBC 4. 'We know Rick was driving Josie's red Toyota Corolla when the two left the parlor.' According to the Los Angeles Times, detectives pieced together the night's events when a resident near the tattoo parlor reported to police that a woman had come to her front door about midnight asking for a ride downtown. Wild driving: Rick Jimenez was seen erratically driving Josie Jimenez's Toyota Corolla on Thursday morning on a LA freeway . Evidence: The LAPD tweeted that the large amount of blood where Ms Jimenez was sitting before being ejected from the car was a reason for Mr Jimenez's arrest . Arrested: The LAPD announce on Twitter that bail has been set at $1 million for Mr Jimenez, who is being held at Van Nuys jail . Ms Jimenez’s girlfriend confirmed that the victim had gone to the house out of desperation to get away from Mr Jimenez. It is not clear whether this was the . same friend who also attended the parlor but left when the couple's . argument got out of hand. Police said in a tweet that a key factor in deciding to arrest Mr Jimenez, from North Hollywood, was the amount of blood present on the passenger side of car, found abandoned in the northeast San Fernando Valley. The blood is now being tested. Police also believe the victim may have been physically abused the night before her death, Los Angeles Times reports. Ms Jimenez’s estranged husband reported her missing and is not believed to be involved in her death, police said. Bail has been set at $1 million for Mr Jimenez, who is being held at Van Nuys jail.","Ricardo 'Rick' Jimenez faces murder charge after his lover Maria Josefina 'Josie' Jimenez fell or was pushed of a moving car .

"Claims: Zacarias Moussaoui, who is serving a life sentence for terror charges, has said Saudi Arabia financed the 9/11 attacks in an extraordinary letter from his prison cell . The man who claims he was the 20th 9/11 hijacker has named two of the most senior members of the Saudi Royal family as being the ones who paid him to carry out the terrorist attack. Zacarias Moussaoui alleges that Prince Turki al-Faisal and Princess Haifa al-Faisal gave him cash and ‘channeled a large amount of money’ to another of the hijackers. He also claims that Prince Faisal ‘was assisting me in my Islamic terrorist activities...and was doing so knowingly for Osama bin Laden’. The extraordinary allegations are in a letter that Moussaoui wrote to a federal judge in Oklahoma and are likely to be seized on by 9/11 conspiracy theorists. The letter has been entered as a prisoner civil rights complaint and has been assigned to District Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange. Moussaoui’s letter has already been reported but the names were not made public until MailOnline saw a copy of the full letter. Moussaoui, 46, is currently serving life in jail after admitting his role in the 9/11 attacks, which the Saudi government has always denied involvement in. His credibility has also long been called into question as even Osama bin Laden has denied he had anything to do with his terrorist plots. Moussaoui wrote to the Western District Federal Court in Oklahoma because he was studying at a flight school in Norman, Oklahoma, in 2001 when he supposedly received the money from the Saudis. He wanted to testify in open court about what he knows but last week a magistrate recommended that his request be denied as it is not related to any ongoing case. The people that Moussaoui has named are among the most powerful in the Saudi royal family. Prince Turki al-Faisal, 67, is a former Saudi ambassador to the United States and a former Saudi intelligence chief. He ran its intelligence service for 24 years. He stepped down from the latter post on September 1st 2001, 10 days before 9/11. He was ambassador to London in 2003 before the invasion of Iraq and was ambassador to Washington from July 2005 until December 2006. Prince Faisal attended Lawrenceville, a boarding school near Princeton, followed by Georgetown University before rising up the ranks in the Saudi royal family, where his brothers dominate the top posts in the Arab nation’s government. Last year he took the unusual step of criticizing the US government and said that Saudi Arabia was sick of President Obama marking red lines then seeing them become ‘pinkish as time grew’. Accused: Prince Turki al-Faisal is named by Zacarias Moussaoui in a letter to a federal judge as a funder of the 9/11 terror attacks. The Saudi government has always denied any involvement in the attacks or their funding . Response: The Saudi Arabian government said it had nothing whatsoever to do with the September 11 attacks . He said: ‘When that kind of assurance comes from a leader of a country like the United States, we expect him to stand by it.’ His sister Princess Faisal, 63, is the wife of another former Saudi ambassador to the US, Bandar bin Sultan, with whom she has eight children. She has previously faced claims of involvement in 9/11 before and two of the hijackers, - Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi - supposedly received regular $3,500 a month payments from two friends who got it from an account in her name. The Saudi government angrily denied the allegations at the time and said that Princess Faisal ‘wants her name cleared’. In the 2004 9/11 Commission report said it had found no evidence of her having any involvement in the funding of the attacks. Among Moussaoui's other extraordinary claims in the letter was that he was involved in a plot to shoot down Air Force One with President Bill Clinton on board. He claims that World Trade Centre bomber Ramzi Yousef, who is in the same Supermax prison as him, tried to persuade him to keep quiet under a CIA deal to spare Al Qaeda mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed from the death penalty after his military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay, where he is being held. He also talks about how he handed over details of a plot to assassinate President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton during a trip to Cambridge in England whilst he was in office. Lawyers for the federal government have taken Moussaoui seriously enough to interview him over the claims at the maximum security Colorado prison where he is serving a life sentence without parole. They say he had 'relevant' material to contribute but he is problematic as a witness. 'Even if he somehow got to the point where he could testify, there would be a credibility issue,' said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law. 'Would his testimony be valuable? That's doubtful.' Another problem is that Moussaoui has repeatedly changed his account of his involvement in the Sept. 11 plot and has behaved erratically in court. Close relationship: President George W. Bush with Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the then Saudi Arabian ambassador, in August 27, at Bush's Ranch in Crawford, Texas. Prince Bandar was succeeded by Prince Faisal as ambassador . 'Nothing to do with me': A 2006 video message, above, purportedly from Osama Bin Laden, featured a voice saying Moussaoui was nothing to do with 9/11 . Husband: Prince Bandar al-Sultan is the husband of Princess Haifa. He was ambassador to the US from 1983 until 2005, when his brother-in-law Prince Turki succeeded him. He described . Moussaoui, who refers to himself in writing as 'Slave of Allah,' was first arrested on immigration charges in August 2001 after employees of a Minnesota flight school became alarmed that he wanted to learn to fly a Boeing 747 - even though he had no pilot's license. He was in custody on September 11, 2001, and pleaded guilty in April 2005 to conspiring with the hijackers to kill Americans. During his three-year legal fight, Moussaoui repeatedly insulted the judge and tried to fire his lawyers. At one point he was facing the death penalty, which jurors decided against. During the hearing he spontaneously declared that he had planned to pilot a plane into the White House on September 11. A psychologist called by his lawyers testified that Moussaoui had paranoid schizophrenia. Moussaoui mocked the testimony, shouting as he left courtroom: 'Crazy or not crazy? That is the question.' In 2006 a recording emerged online of Osama bin Laden distancing himself from Moussaoui. He said: 'He had no connection at all with September 11. I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers, and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission.' Although the audio was seen as ruling him out of the 9/11 attacks, it did not make clear if he was an al Qaeda operative. Last month, lawyers in a federal lawsuit against Saudi Arabia were permitted to interview Moussaoui in prison. What was said can't be shared publicly until the U.S. government finishes sifting through the transcript to ensure it contains no secret messages that could pose a threat to Americans. Verdict: the report of the commission into the attacks said it had found no evidence 'that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization' Jerry S. Goldman, a lawyer who interviewed him, said: 'I will say that we believe it was relevant and material to our case.' Moussaoui also wrote to the clerk in federal court in Brooklyn in September, saying he had seen a report on Fox News about another suit accusing the Jordan-based Arab Bank of helping finance suicide bombings in Israel. He said he was willing to testify, but the plaintiffs never took it seriously. The communication wasn't relevant to the Arab Bank case and 'don't make clear what his motives are,' said one lawyer, Gary Osen. 'I don't know his state of mind at all.' At Supermax, Florence ADX - known as the 'Alcatraz of the Rockies' - Moussaoui is subject to restrictions requiring screening of any attempt to communicate with the outside world. However, there are exceptions for court filings. MailOnline has reached out to the Saudi embassy to the US for comment. Previously Prince Bandar highlighted the findings of the 9/11 Commission report. When it was published in 2004 it concluded that it had found 'no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization' of the attacks. At the time Prince Bandar said: 'The 9/11 Commission has confirmed what we have been saying all along. The clear statements by this independent, bipartisan commission have debunked the myths that have cast fear and doubt over Saudi Arabia.’ The report directly addressed Princess Haifa al-Faisal. It said: 'We have found no evidence that Saudi Princess Haifa al Faisal provided any funds to the conspiracy, either directly or indirectly.'

"Barack Obama today continued to pile pressure on Congress to extend tax cuts for the middle class, saying a rates hike would be like getting a 'lump of coal' for Christmas. In the first of a series of campaign-style speeches designed to sell his solution for the 'fiscal cliff', the President argued that Republicans should extend existing Bush-era tax rates for households earning $250,000 or less, while allowing increases to kick in for the wealthy. However, Republican leader John Boehner described the state of negotiations as a 'stalemate' and criticised Obama for not making a serious offer on a deal. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Barack Obama went to a K'nex factory in the Philadelphia suburbs as part of a national tour . The President was touring a toy factory in the Philadelphia suburbs when he said the GOP and Democrats alike needed to 'get out of our comfort zones' to forge an agreement. He urged the public to pressure their local members of Congress to pass the middle-class tax cut extension as quickly as possible. Pointing out that every American family will face a tax hike on January 1 if no deal is reached, Obama said: 'I'm assuming that doesn't sound too good to you. That's sort of like the lump of coal you get for Christmas. That's a Scrooge Christmas.' He insisted he was ready to sign a deal straightaway, joking, 'There are no shortage of pens in the White House and I carry one around for an emergency, just in case.' Speaking out: The President said a middle-class tax hike would be like a 'lump of coal' for Christmas . The President was clearly in a comic mood as he quipped that he was 'keeping my own naughty and nice list' to determine which members of Congress would get sets of K'nex, the toy which is made at the factory in Hatfield where he was speaking. He also took a dig at Joe Biden, who was pictured shopping at Costco on Thursday, saying: 'He wanted to buy some of this stuff, but I told him he had too much work to do. I wasn't going to have him building roller coasters all day long.' Also on Thursday, an effort made on behalf of Democrats Thursday to avert the looming fiscal cliff turned out to be fruitless. The White House made an offer to House Republicans that aides familiar with the talks panned as ‘a joke’, ‘an insult’ and ‘a complete break from reality,’ according to CBS News. One Republican aide familiar with the offer that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House congressional liason Rob Nabors presented to Boehner confirmed the Democrat leaders said their proposed $4trillion package would raise $1.6trillion in tax revenue up front. House Republicans called that number too high and too extreme to be offering this late in the game with only a month left before the deadline. Joking: Obama was clearly in a comic mood despite the seriousness of the upcoming 'fiscal cliff' Democrats said they would give in on $400billion in spending cuts from entitlement programs like Medicare in exchange for the added tax revenue. Boehner slammed that number right after the meeting at a press conference though he would not say what the number should be. ‘No substantive progress has been made between the White House and the House, in the two weeks since Obama welcomed congressional leaders at the White House,' Boehner said. Democrats swiftly countered that any holdup was the fault of Republicans who refuse to accept Obama’s campaign-long call to raise tax rates on upper incomes. At the White House, presidential press secretary Jay Carney said, ‘There can be no deal without rates on top earners going up.’ Taking a confrontational, at times sarcastic tone, he said, ‘This should not be news to anyone on Capitol Hill. It is certainly not news to anyone in America who was not in a coma during the campaign season.’ Making a list: Obama promised to give K'nex to members of Congress who co-operate with the White House . With barely a month remaining until a year-end deadline, the hardening of positions seemed more likely to mark a transition into hard bargaining rather than signal an end to efforts to achieve a compromise on the first post-election challenge of divided government. Boehner suggested as much when one reporter asked if his comments meant he was breaking off talks with the White House and congressional Democrats. ‘No, no, no. Stop,’ he quickly answered. ‘I’ve got to tell you, I’m disappointed in where we are, and disappointed in what’s happened over the last couple weeks. But going over the fiscal cliff is serious business.’ Republican aides provided the first description of the White House’s offer, although Democratic officials readily confirmed the outlines. Under the proposal, the White House is seeking passage by year’s end of tax increases totaling $1.6 trillion over a decade, including the rate hikes sought by Obama. In addition to seeking tax increases totaling $1.6trillion over a decade, Obama also asked for approval by year’s end of $30billion to renew expiring jobless benefits, $25billion to prevent a looming January 1 cut in fees for doctors who treat Medicare patients and an undisclosed amount to help homeowners hit by the collapse in real estate values. Counterattack: John Boehner claimed that the Democrats had not yet offered a credible deficit deal . The White House also wants a new stimulus package to aid the economy, with a price tag for the first year of $50billion, as well as an extension of the Social Security payroll tax cut that is due to end on December 31, or some way to offset the impact of its expiration. In political terms, the White House proposal is a near mirror image of what officials have said Republicans earlier laid down as their first offer — a permanent extension of income tax cuts at all levels, an increase in the age of Medicare eligibility and steps to curtail future growth in Social Security cost-of-living increases. In exchange, the GOP has offered to support unspecified increases in revenue as part of tax reform legislation to be written in 2013. The GOP said the White House was offering unspecified spending cuts this year. Those would be followed next year by legislation producing savings from Medicare and other benefit programs of up to $400billion over a decade, a companion to an overhaul of the tax code. For the first time since the November 6 elections, partisan bickering seems to trump productive bargaining as the two sides maneuvered for position. Ready to make an offer: Timothy Geithner sat down for talks with congressional leaders on Thursday . At issue is a bipartisan desire to prevent the wholesale expiration of Bush-era tax cuts and the simultaneous implementation of across-the-board spending cuts. The potential spending reductions, to be divided between military and domestic programs, were locked into place more than a year ago in hopes the threat would have forced a compromise on a deficit reduction deal before now. Economists in and out of government warn that sending the economy over the ‘cliff” would trigger a recession. To avoid the danger, Obama and Congress are hoping to devise a plan that can reduce future deficits by as much as $4trillion in a decade, cancel the tax increases and automatic spending cuts and expand the government’s ability to borrow beyond the current limit of $16.4trillion. In the first few days after the elections, Boehner said he was willing to accept a deal that included new revenues, a long-time Democratic demand, and Obama has said he will sign on to savings from Medicare, Medicaid and other benefit programs that Democrats have long defended from proposed Republican cuts. At the same time, both sides have worked to tilt the bargaining table to their advantage. As part of that effort, Obama travels to Pennsylvania on Friday to campaign for his tax proposal. Boehner, who will begin a second term as House speaker early next month, has appealed to his rank and file to remain united. At a closed-door meeting this week, he displayed polling data that showed the public would rather see loopholes closed than rates raised as a means of raising revenue for the government. At the same time, there are tremors within the GOP ranks, with a small number of Republicans saying they are willing to let tax rates rise at upper incomes in view of the election returns, and others predicting legislation to that effect would pass the House if put to a vote.","Urged Congress to pass extension of tax cuts for the middle class .

"A Wisconsin high school graduate is reportedly in the Middle East with two other Americans, fighting ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). Jordan Matson of Wisconsin, a former American solder, has joined the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), who are mainly battling advances by Islamic State militants close to Syria's borders with Turkey and Iraq, a spokesman for the Kurdish group said on Thursday. YPG spokesman Redur Xelil confirmed Matson's presence with the group in an online note and said: 'He is fighting in the Jazaa area.' Jazaa is in northeast Syria and has seen heavy fighting between the YPG and fighters of Islamic State. Scroll down for video . American: Jordan Matson of Wisconsin, a former American solder, has reportedly joined the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), who are mainly battling advances by Islamic State militants . Matson's mother, speaking through a friend at her home in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, declined to comment. The U.S. army said that a Jordan Matson of Sturtevant was a private first class in the U.S. Army from May 2006 to November 2007. Though Xelil told CNN there are two other Americans fighting, their identities were not disclosed. U.S. officials say about 100 Americans have gone to Syria to join groups fighting there against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Those groups include the extremist Islamic State as well as a U.S.-backed rebel force and the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front. At a meeting last week chaired by U.S. President Barack Obama, the U.N. Security Council said all countries should make it a serious criminal offense for their citizens to fight abroad with militant groups. The United States has no specific law preventing individuals from joining such groups, but it has anti-terrorism laws that it has used to prosecute those associated with such groups. The YPG has not been designated by the United States as a terrorist organization but it has close ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey, which does have such a designation. The PKK has spent three decades fighting for autonomy for Turkey's Kurds. 'We have warned, as you know, U.S. citizens to defer all travel to Syria. We recommend any U.S. citizens remaining to depart immediately,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said at her daily briefing. Going overseas: A Facebook page for Jordan Matson says he attended Case High School in Racine, Wisconsin . 'We also, of course, remain concerned about any citizen traveling to take part in military operations,' said Psaki, who added she was aware of the reports about Matson having gone to Syria but declined to comment on his case for privacy reasons. The Kurds in Syria and Iraq have become de facto allies of the United States, which is leading an international coalition to fight Islamic State both in Syria and Iraq. The YPG said last month it had lost 35 of its fighters in a two-week battle for control of Jazaa and said Kurdish forces had killed hundreds of Islamic State fighters. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, citing Matson's LinkedIn page, reported he previously worked for a Madison bank. Xelil, who said he had met Matson, sent a link to online photos on a Kurdish news agency which he said were of the American. They show a smiling young man in an army shirt with a white and black scarf wrapped around his head. Xelil declined to give further details. A Facebook page for Jordan Matson says he attended Case High School in Racine, Wisconsin and is 28. A friend of Matson's said he told online gaming friends about two months ago that he was joining a 'private army' to fight Islamic State. 'He told us in the community that he was getting hired by a private army and he let us know two to three months in advance,' said Miguel Caron by telephone from Montreal. 'He sent me a personal Facebook message on the 16th of September saying ""hey boss, I'm heading to Syria.""' Caron added. Caron said Matson had posted on Facebook this week that he was in Syria. The post was disseminated via Twitter, but is visible only to Matson's friends on his Facebook page. 'For all who didn't know I'm in Syria fighting for the YPG against ISIS. I am ok, won't be able to get on the net very often. I was hit by a mortar a few days ago during a 6 hour firefight but i am fine,' Caron confirmed the post as saying.","A Wisconsin man is reportedly in the Middle East with two other Americans, fighting ISIS .

"Missing: Terror suspect Ibrahim Magag who was under close police surveillance has gone missing, it emerged this evening . Police last night launched a nationwide manhunt after an Al Qaeda-linked terror suspect went on the run. Somali-born Ibrahim Magag, 28, was being held under security measures because of the threat he poses to the public. He has not been seen since Boxing Day. Counter-terrorism detectives made the unusual decision to appeal for help to trace the extremist after he went missing. Home Secretary Theresa May had earlier asked the High Court to lift a ban on identifying him over fears he may try to meet other terror suspects or flee the country. The police appeal came as a second terror suspect and former associate of Magag appeared in court accused of breaching a similar order. Both men were being held under Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (T-Pim) notices, which were introduced in January 2012. Magag’s disappearance is a blow to the Government’s T-Pim programme, which critics have warned is a ‘watered down’ version of the previous control order regime. Magag is thought to be a member of a UK-based network that supports the Al-Shabaab terrorist group which controls much of Somalia and is affiliated to Al Qaeda. Police were alerted on Boxing Day that he had gone missing after he failed to return to his overnight accommodation. He was last seen in Camden, North London, wearing a khaki robe, navy Converse plimsolls and a black Berghaus anorak.’ Gone: The last sighting of Ibrahim Magag was in the Camden area of north London on Boxing Day . Magag had been forced to live in the . West of England under a control order imposed in October 2009. When . T-Pims were introduced last  year he returned to London because the law . no longer allowed ministers to relocate him. This was despite an earlier High Court . ruling that it was ‘too dangerous’ to allow him to return to London . ‘even for a short period’. The judge was told moving him from . London would disrupt his extremist activities and stop him planning or . carrying out terrorism. Ibrahim Magag is the first terrorist suspect to abscond while under a new monitoring regime called Terrorism Prevention Investigation Measures. These ‘T-Pims’ were introduced a year ago to replace the previous regime of  control orders at the insistence of the Lib Dems after a major Coalition row. Opponents of T-Pims say their introduction has weakened public protection. The shift to T-Pims cut the number of hours a terror suspect could be forced to obey a home curfew from 16 hours a day to ten. It also meant suspects could no longer be forced to change address and would be allowed restricted use of mobile phones and the internet. The changes mean the police and security services must wrestle with terror suspects spending an extra six hours a day on the streets. As a result of the new burden, ministers promised an extra £30million to spend on investigation and surveillance. Unlike their predecessors, T-Pims must lapse after two years unless there is new evidence of continued terrorist activity. There are now ten terror suspects under T-Pims, including Magag. In July it emerged that one suspected terrorist on a  T-Pim was found five times near the Olympic Games venue. He had been jailed after 15 breaches of his control order, including attempts to buy a computer and visiting an internet café. The former associate of Magag, known . only as ‘CC’, received terrorist training in Somalia and fought . alongside rebel soldiers. ‘CC’ also helped procure weapons for . terrorists and planned attacks in Somalia and overseas. He appeared amid . high security at Westminster Magistrates’ Court yesterday accused of . six breaches of his T-Pim. Magag travelled to Britain as a . refugee aged 12. His wife continues to live in a London council flat. High Court documents detail how Magag, a married former train conductor . and father of five, is closely linked to the Al-Shabaab group. He was arrested in 2007 after . returning from an Al-Shabaab terrorist training camp he attended with . Bilal Berjawi, a close friend. Magag was detained in Nairobi and . found to be carrying three new mobile phones and over £3,000 cash. While . being held he tried to destroy phone numbers by eating a piece of . paper. The following year, police in London . stopped Magag and found he was carrying £1,000 in cash. Detectives . believe the money was for terrorist associates. He was also accused of sending . associates to Somalia to join terrorist fighters by providing money, . false passports and other documents. Berjawi, 27, was killed in a US drone strike last which hit his car near Mogadishu. He had joined Islamic fighters after being stripped of his British citizenship 12 months earlier and deported. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said . Magag does not represent a ‘direct threat’ to the public. However, he . warned members of the public not to approach Magag. David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terror legislation, said no security measure is ‘foolproof’. He said experts believe there may be . 50 British fighters in Somalia, adding: ‘Worst case, there could now be . one more – an influential one.’ Speaking about T-Pims, he said: ‘The only sure way to prevent absconding is to lock people in a high-security prison.’ Security Minister James Brokenshire . said: ‘The Home Secretary today applied to the High Court for an order . protecting anonymity to be lifted in order to assist with their . investigation. We do not believe [Magag’s] disappearance is linked to . any terrorism planning in the UK. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Counter terrorism detectives today appealed to the public for help in tracing  Ibrahim Magag .

"Comedian Tracy Morgan is still recovering from a 'traumatic' brain injury - more than five months after he was critically injured in a highway crash that killed one of his friends. The 46-year-old was traveling back from a Delaware-based show in a limo van on June 7 when a 'speeding' Walmart truck slammed into the back of the vehicle on the New Jersey Turnpike. He was rushed to hospital with serious injuries, including a broken leg, a broken nose and broken ribs. His friend and fellow comedian James McNair was killed, while three others were also injured. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Comedian Tracy Morgan (pictured in April this year) is still recovering from a 'traumatic' brain injury - more than five months after he was critically injured in a highway crash that killed one of his friends . WReckage The 46-year-old was traveling back from a Delaware-based show in a limo van on June 7 when a 'speeding' Walmart truck slammed into the back of the vehicle (pictured after the crash) in New Jersey . Morgan, a former Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock star, was released from hospital on June 20, before undergoing several weeks of rehab for his injuries. He returned home on July 12. But more than five months on, the actor-comedian is still undergoing treatment for injuries to his brain, including daily speech, cognitive, vocational and physical therapies, it has emerged. Lawyer Benedict Morelli revealed Morgan's long-lasting brain injury during a scheduling conference in the star's lawsuit against Walmart, in which he is suing for punitive and compensatory damages. On Tuesday, Morelli and other attorneys met in federal court to settle on a schedule for the lawsuit, which was filed in late September following the deadly crash. Morgan was not present. Injured: Morgan (pictured mid-July), a former Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock star, was released from hospital on June 20, before undergoing several weeks of rehab for his injuries. He returned home on July 12 . Damaged: But more than five months on, the actor-comedian (pictured mid-July) is still undergoing treatment for injuries to his brain, it has emerged. Above, the limo van is pictured after the crash in New Jersey . Earlier this year, Walmart truck driver Kevin Roper, who is not named in Morgan's lawsuit, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in state court. Last Friday, he filed to have Morgan's lawsuit delayed while that case proceeds. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for mid-December. In response to Morgan's claims lawsuit, Walmart has claimed that the victim's injuries were partly due to the fact that the group were not wearing seatbelts. However, a preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board released in June found Roper was driving 65 mph in the 60 seconds before he slammed into the van. Tragic: Morgan's (pictured, right, with his wife Sabina) friend James McNair (left) was killed in the crash . Charged: Earlier this year, Wal-Mart truck driver Kevin Roper (pictured in court on June 11) who is not named in Morgan's lawsuit, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in state court . The speed limit on that stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike is 55 mph and was lowered to 45 mph that night because of construction. Earlier this year, New Jersey State Police Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said Roper could have also been dozing off at the time because he 'failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead.' He said: 'He observed at the last minute -- just prior to impact -- the limo bus carrying Morgan and his party.' The case continues.","Tracy Morgan, 46, was seriously injured in New Jersey crash on June 7 .

"A fox and a hedgehog have become the most unlikely of friends after they were caught enjoying a fine dining experience together. The animals were captured eating food on webcams set up by wildlife enthusiast Jason Alexander, at his home in Rushmere St Andrew, Suffolk. Mr Alexander said he expected the fox to see the hedgehog as prey but was surprised to see them feed side by side. Do you come here often? A wildlife enthusiast was stunned when he put up a secret camera in his garden - and caught a hedgehog sharing a meal with a fox . He said. 'I think there have been several of each using the feeding stations. They seem to tolerate each other.' Mr Alexander, 43, says he has 30 webcams set up in his garden 's feeding stations, which he uses to monitor nest boxes and his nightly visitors. He says the hedgehogs feed about 10 times a night and are joined by the fox between 1am and 3am in the morning - most likely after a night on the tiles. He also has another hedgehog, whose . behaviour has changed recently as it builds a nest - signalling that it might be a pregnant female. Yummy: The fox seems focused on devouring its meal - thankfully it is not the hedgehog . Fine dining: Have you heard the one about the fox and the hedgehog who dine out early in the morning? Wildlife experts suggest that foxes do not generally pose a threat to hedgehogs but there are rare incidents where foxes can prey on the spiky hedgehog. Some foxes will wait for a hedgehog to unroll from its defensive ball, before taking a bite at it. But this chummy pair appear to be more interested in feasting at the Hog Buffet Bar giving Mr Alexander delightful footage. The wildlife enthusiast reveals that he starts his day by sitting with a cuppa and taking a long look back at the footage from the night before.

"Doctors were unsure if they were going to make it past their first few days, but now the McCaughey septuplets are celebrating turning 16 - and planning driving lessons, college degrees and careers. Kenny, Kelsey, Natalie, Brandon, Alexis, Nathan and Joel, the world's first septuplets to survive infancy, are marking the milestone on Tuesday, November 19 at their home in Carlisle, Iowa. 'It's sad how quickly it's gone,' their mother . Bobbi told a local newspaper of the past 16 years. Bobbi and her husband Kenny famously . declined selective reduction after learning they were pregnant with . seven children following fertility treatment, saying it was 'in . God's hands'. Celebration: The McCaughey septuplets (with their parents, Kenny and Bobbi, center, and their big sister Milayla, back left) are turning 16 on Tuesday. They are the world's first surviving septuplets . Together: L-R, Nathan, Brandon, , Kelsey, Natalie, Brandon, Kenny (light blue shirt), Joel and Alexis (laying across laps). The septuplets generated world wide attention after they were born November 19, 1997 . 'I will always remember the day we found . out there were so many,' Bobbi told the Des Moines Register. 'It wasn't like ""yoohoo!"" There were so many . doubts. To a lot of people this might sound trite, but God . determined the outcome.' Learning they had septuplets on the way sparked international headlines that would chart the children's every move. After the babies were born nine weeks prematurely in Des Moines in 1997, joining their big sister, Mikayla Marie, news crews swarmed their modest one-floor home. Amid the media frenzy, President Bill Clinton personally called the family to congratulate the family, Oprah welcomed them on her show and companies and strangers scrambled to help out the couple. Early days: Bobbi McCaughey, pictured in 1998, used fertility treatment and had refused selective reduction . Babies' day out: She prepares to take out her nine-month-old babies with the help of friends in 1998 . Helping hand: Mikayla, who was nearly 2 when her siblings were born, is pictured helping her mother . Staying healthy: Bobbi takes one of her sons to the doctors. Doctors were stunned they were all healthy . Doting: Big sister Mikayla helps out her parents by caring for one of her little sisters in 1998 . At the time of the conception of both Mikayla and the septuplets, Bobbi McCaughey was undergoing treatments of an ovulation-stimulating drug called Metrodin, which primes a woman's eggs for successful conception. But while it often takes repeated doses to get pregnant, with the septuplets, Bobbi conceived the children on the first treatment. A Time article about the family noted that while doctors can carefully control the number of embryos they insert with in-vitro fertilization, fertility drugs are basically a roll of the dice. She had been warned that in around 20 per cent of cases, women had seen multiple births - but they were shocked to learn she was carrying seven babies. While septuplets had previously been delivered, none had lived beyond a few weeks. So the McCaugheys' doctors suggested they undergo 'selective reduction' - in which several of the fetuses are aborted so the others have a better chance at being healthy. But the couple are religious Baptists and opposed to abortion so did not even consider the procedure. Among the donations, they received a . 5,500 square foot home, a van, a year's worth of Kraft's macaroni and . cheese, diapers for the first two years and . full college scholarships for any state university in Iowa. During the early months, the septuplets drank 42 bottles a day and went through 52 diapers. But over the years, the media coverage has waned and the coupons for free food have run out - encouraging the family to be frugal. And from their early teenage years, the septuplets have been helping out the family by carrying out chores, such as their own laundry. The family still lives in the same house that was donated after the births and continues to use the same van. And while the four boys and three girls are looking forward to being 16 and driving, their father, who still works at a metal coating plant, warned that they can only have cars once they get jobs. He is also up against other teenage challenges. 'The biggest challenge is making sure . they keep up with certain things but not keep up with certain things, . trendy things,' Kenny said of his teenagers. 'Three of them have cellphones and a couple . have iPads.' The family has saved to cover braces for several of the children and the medical needs of Alexis and Nathan, who were born with forms of cerebral palsy.

Five have run cross . country, another wrestles, one plays soccer and another enters speech contests, while six . were on the honor roll, the Register reported. 'It's fun to see the work pay off,' Bobbi said of her children. As their lives have become busier, . they have fallen from television screens and magazines - from Time . magazine to Dateline NBC - that they regularly graced throughout their . childhoods. While Bobbi said she missed the media, the children are less bothered. 'It was kinda cool but in other ways I never liked it, all these cameras following you around everywhere,' Nathan said.

"Swapping stockings for kisses and teaching girls how to jive, American GIs were meant to be a welcome ray of sunshine in war-torn Europe. But a new book has revealed the dark side of Europe’s liberation after the Second World War. Professor Mary Louise Roberts, from the University of Wisconsin, said within months of D-Day ordinary French women came to fear their American ‘liberators’. American soldiers seen here (who are not related to the book's content) disembarking from Coast Guard landing craft at the shores of Normandy. In an explosive book, Roberts claims that some soldiers terrified French citizens . The professor said previous historical research on the subject paid little attention to this 'dark side' of Europe's liberation. The people in this picture are not related to the book's content . She tells how, by the summer of 1944, large numbers of women in Normandy filed complaints about rapes by US soldiers. And their arrival prompted a wave of . crime all over France, with American soldiers caught committing . robberies and petty thefts. Professor Roberts said: ‘My book . seeks to debunk an old myth about the GI, thought of as a manly creature . that always behaved well. The GIs were having sex anywhere and . everywhere. ‘In the cities of Le Havre and Cherbourg, bad behaviour was common. ‘Women, including those who were . married, were openly solicited for sex. Parks, bombed-out buildings, . cemeteries and railway tracks were carnal venues. ‘People could not go out for a walk without seeing somebody having sex. ‘But the sex was not always consensual, with hundreds of cases of rape being reported.’ The locals of Le Havre were shocked by the soldiers’ behaviour and wrote letters of protest to their mayor. One complaint, from October 1945, said: ‘We are attacked, robbed, run over both on the street and in our houses. The book, which was released in June, focuses specifically on the soldiers of World War II and their interaction with the French people, but problems of sexual assault in the military persist to today, though now the victims are those in uniform as well. The Pentagon is reeling from a series of sex-related scandals in recent weeks, including cases in which military advocates for victims of sexual assault were themselves accused of sex crimes. Figures from the Department of Defense show a 37 per cent increase in reports of unwanted sexual contact, from groping to rape, last year. About 26,000 cases were reported in 2012. 'Sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military are a profound betrayal - a profound betrayal - of sacred oaths and sacred trusts,' Mr Hagel said. 'This scourge must be stamped out.' His comments came a day after President Barack Obama delivered a similar message to graduates at the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland, saying sexual assault threatened to erode trust and discipline in America's armed forces. ‘This is a regime of terror, imposed by bandits in uniform.’ Le Havre’s mayor, Pierre Voisin, complained to Colonel Thomas Weed – the commander of US troops in the region. ‘Scenes contrary to decency are . unfolding in this city day and night,’ Voisin wrote, adding it was ‘not . only scandalous but intolerable’ that ‘youthful eyes are exposed to such . public spectacles’. The mayor suggested the Americans set . up a brothel outside the city to avoid public outrage and contain the . spread of sexually transmitted diseases. However although US officers . publicly denounced the behaviour they did little to curtail it. The book also claims the US army . ‘demonstrated a deep and abiding racism’, suggesting they pinned a . disproportionate number of rapes on black GIs. Documents show that of 152 troops disciplined by the army for rape, 130 were black. Professor Roberts said: ‘American . propaganda did not sell the war to soldiers as a struggle for freedom . but as a sexual adventure.’ She points out that The Stars and . Stripes, the official newspaper of the US armed forces, taught soldiers . German phrases like ‘waffen niederlegen’ meaning ‘throw down your arms’. However the French phrases it . recommended to soldiers included ‘you have charming eyes,’ ‘I am not . married’ and ‘are your parents at home?’ US magazine Life even . fantasised that France was ‘a tremendous brothel’ inhabited by . ‘40,000,000 hedonists, who spend all their time eating, drinking and . making love’. A cafe owner from Le Havre said at . the time: ‘We expected friends who would not make us ashamed of our . defeat. Instead, there came only incomprehension, arrogance, incredibly . bad manners and the swagger of conquerors.’ The author claims that when the first soldiers swarmed ashore at Omaha Beach in Normandy (pictured) on D-Day, it was 'a veritable tsunami of male lust' Controversial: Mary Louise Roberts wrote the book to uncover the reality about some GI soldiers . Controversial: Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto said that soldiers used 'comfort women' as ways to release tension during WWII . The book comes just one day after a Japanese politician sparked an international row after claiming the use of sex slaves during WWII was justified has tried to shift the blame by accusing other country's of using the same practice. Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, co-leader of an emerging nationalist party, argued Japan's wartime practice of forcing Asian women into prostitution was necessary to maintain military discipline and provide relaxation for soldiers. But following the public outcry over his comments, the mayor has attempted to deflect criticism by accusing America and Britain of using sex slaves for its own soldiers. He said: 'It is a hard truth that even these nations used local women for sexual reasons. This is a historical fact and there is hard evidence that proves it was true.' Historians say up to 200,000 women, mainly from the Korean Peninsula and China, were forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers in military brothels. While some other World War II armies had military brothels, Japan is the only country accused of such widespread, organized sexual slavery.","Book 'debunks myth that the GI were manly and always behaved well'

"An Iranian engineer today claimed how his country managed to ‘trick’ a US. drone into landing in Iran by electronically hacking into its navigational weak spot and 'spoofing' its GPS system. It's the latest development in this extraordinary tale of intrigue, with a Christian Science Monitor report citing a 2003 document suggesting the GPS weakness was long known to the U.S. military. The RQ-170 Sentinel has been seen on display by Iran's gloating military after it went missing along the Afghan-Iran border earlier this month - but a former Pentagon official said it seems to be a fake. On display: The captured RQ-170 Sentinel reconnaissance drone which Iran claims it tricked into landing in the country . However the engineer working on the CIA . drone’s system told the Christian Science Monitor that his country . fooled the aircraft into touching down in Iran - instead of its . programmed destination. The engineer claimed the electronic . attack made it 'land on its own where we wanted it to, without having to . crack the remote-control signals and communications' from the U.S. control centre. ‘The GPS navigation is the weakest . point,’ he told the C.S.

"A New Mexico man stopped for rolling through a stop sign earlier this year was subjected to a nightmarish 14-hour anal cavity search after police became suspicious that he was hiding drugs. David Eckert says he was subjected to three enemas, two rectal searches, two x-rays and even a colonoscopy - all in pursuit of non-existent narcotics. After it was done, the hospital that performed all the procedures against his will even billed him - and threatened to hire a collections agency if he didn't pay, he alleges. Lawsuit: David Eckert is also bringing legal action against Gila Regional Medical Center, where the medical procedures were carried out . Now, he is suing the police officers who held him against his will and the doctors who performed the invasion procedures. The hospital in question and police have refused to comment on the lawsuit. KOB-TV reports that Mr Eckert was pulled over on January 2 as he was pulled out of the Walmart in Deming, New Mexico. Officers say he failed to make a complete stop at a stop sign. They asked Mr Eckert to get out of his car. When he stood, an officer claims, he was clenching the cheeks of his buttocks - which the officer believed was a sign he was hiding drugs. That single observation kicked off the horrific cavity searches that kept Mr Eckert in captivity for 14 hours. 'If the officers in Hidalgo County and the City of Deming are seeking warrants for anal cavity searches based on how they're standing and the warrant allows doctors at the Gila Hospital of Horrors to go in and do enemas and colonoscopies without consent, then anyone can be seized and that's why the public needs to know about this,' Mr Eckert's lawyer, civil rights attorney Shannon Kennedy, told the TV station. Mr Eckert was pulled over after failing to stop at a stop sign in Deming, New Mexico . After officers noticed Mr Eckert's posture, they called a drug dog, which indicated a small on narcotics on Mr Eckert's driver seat. A search of the car revealed no drugs. So, officers held him until a judge issued a warrant authorizing a body cavity search. First officers took him to Mimbres Memorial Hospital in Deming, but doctors there said the procedures police were requesting were 'unethical' for them to perform, according to court documents. Then, the officers him across county lines to Gila Regional Medical Center in Silver City. Kennedy argues in the lawsuit that transporting Mr Eckert to another county violated the terms of the search warrant and made the entire search illegal. Doctors performed a colonoscopy, which involves inserting a camera up his anus and all the way into his large intestine. He had to be sedated for the procedure . Once at Gila Medical Center, according to the lawsuit, doctors put Mr Eckert through several hours of invasive, humiliating searches. The lawsuit claims that Mr Eckert vocally objected to each search, but doctors performed the procedures anyway at the request of doctors. At the hospital, doctors probed his rectum with their fingers. When they didn't find anything, he was given an X-ray. When the X-ray came up negative, he was probed again. Deming Police Chief Brandon Gigante said his officers always act within the bounds of the law . Then, he was given an enema and forced to defecate in front of the doctors and police officers and watch as they sifted through his stool. Doctors then performed a second and third enema. None of the enemas discovered drugs. He was then X-rayed for a second time. After the final, X-ray he was sedated and given a colonoscopy, a complex medical procedure that involved the doctors inserting a camera into his anus, rectum, colon, and large intestines. Finally, after 2am, when the colonoscopy came up negative, he was released without charges, according to the lawsuit.","David Eckert was pulled over for rolling through a stop sign in Deming, New Mexico .

"Abd al-Rahman bin Umayr al-Nuaymi has been added to a list of suspects targeted with financial sanctions and banned from doing business in Britain . An alleged terrorist financier has been added to a list of suspects targeted with financial sanctions in the UK. Abd al-Rahman bin Umayr al-Nuaymi, a Qatari national, has been banned from doing business in Britain, the Government confirmed. The move comes 10 months after the US authorities imposed sanctions on him, saying al-Nuaymi was a 'terrorist financier and facilitator who has provided money and material support and conveyed communications to al Qaida and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade'. The US Treasury said he was 'considered among the most prominent Qatar-based supporters of Iraqi Sunni extremists' and 'reportedly oversaw the transfer of over 2 million US dollars (£1.25 million) per month to al -Qaida in Iraq for a period of time'. In the UK, the Foreign Office is responsible for designating individuals for the sanctions list and the Treasury implements the regime. Al-Nuaymi's name was added to the list of those subject to financial sanctions last week. The  move by the Treasury will freeze any assets he has in the UK and prevent any banks with British offices from dealing with him.

"Not many people have narrowly escaped death by as thin a margin as this Taiwanese motorist who was almost crushed to death by a massive boulder crashing down onto the road just a few yards away from him. This extraordinary video, recorded by chance on a camera mounted on the dashboard of a second car following behind, shows just how lucky the first driver was. The boulder, weighing hundreds of tonnes and as almost as big as a house, rolled down the hillside near Keelung city in a landslide triggered by heavy rain. Scroll down for video . Yards from oblivion: This driver was nearly crushed by a boulder than fell onto the coastal road in Keelung, northern Taiwan . The car was heavily damaged by the falling debris that came before the rock landed in the road . Tropical Storm Kong-Rey pounded Taiwan earlier this week, leading to widespread flooding in the south that left three people dead, the government said. Floodwaters rose to a depth of 10 feet and the storm also disrupted air and rail traffic, as well as forcing offices and schools to shut. Several landslides have been recorded during the spate of wild weather, but this is the most dramatic to have been captured on camera. Rocks began moving at the top of the hillside as the wet earth made them unstable. The drivers below were apparently unaware of the danger - until the huge boulder smashed down onto the road causing a bomb-like explosion of mud and rock. Unaware: The white car moments before the death-defying accident . Explosion: A wave of dirt is thrown over the road after the earth-shattering impact . The front of the car is battered by soil and rocks and the driver slams on his brakes . The debris smashes into the car, pushing it to the side in the video, posted on YouTube. It shows the lucky motorist slamming on his brakes and having the presence of mind to switch on his hazard warning lights as the boulder rocked to a standstill beside his car. It even teeters alarmingly over the vehicle before finally coming to a standstill. He remains in the vehicle for a few moments, then steps out to stare at the boulder which had come so close to claiming his life. Amazingly, no one was injured. On the edge: Although the boulder had stopped moving, it still teetered alarmingly over the vehicle before finally coming to standstill . Taiwan has been lashed by heavy rainstorms this week . In another incident, 19 people were injured when a train was derailed in the bad weather. The six-carriage train, carrying around 250 passengers, hit the mudslides as it was approaching a tunnel in Pingtung county, the Taiwan Railway Administration said. In 2009 at least 63 Taiwanese villagers were buried alive by mudslides triggered by typhoon Morakot which ravaged the country.","The boulder plunged downhill following torrential rain in Taiwan .

"Google has revolutionised the way we use the Internet, quickly rising to almost complete dominance over the search market. But for all its unerring ability to find what you are looking for, it has - up to now - still used a fairly 'dumb' comparison program to match your search terms to pages stored in its database. But now, Google has unleashed its latest technology on the world - a 'Knowledge Graph' which can understand the relationships between real-world objects, and bring all this information back to the user. Instead of simply matching your keywords, Google's technology will try to understand your query, and bring back the information you are looking for on the right-hand-side of the traditional results. Google says this is a 'critical first step towards building the next generation of search, which taps into the collective intelligence of the web and understands the world a bit more like people do.' A search for 'Marie Curie' brings up this kind of search box, with suggested follow-up searches suggested in blue . Searching 'Taj Mahal' brings up a map of the Taj Mahal, while also offering other alternatives which the user may be looking for . Google said the search engine pulls the facts, figures and images from across the web - so it is not relying on the traditional search engine trick of pulling data from Wikipedia. Amit Singhal, Google's senior vice president of engineering, said: 'Search is a lot about discovery - the basic human need to learn and broaden your horizons. 'But searching still requires a lot of hard work by you, the user. So today I’m really excited to launch the Knowledge Graph, which will help you discover new information quickly and easily.' The redesign, which for now affects only U.S.-based English language users, is gradually being rolled starting Wednesday on desktop, mobile and tablet platforms. Google plans to eventually expand the new search features outside the U.S. - and many UK users have reported seeing the feature in the last few days. Many of the results will carry more graphical elements, compared to standard lists of search results, such as maps and pictures of related results. The offering is the latest example of search companies moving away from offering a list of text-based links as search results. Smarter on the right: The new look Google will bring in information from sources like Wikipedia if it thinks it knows what you want . Even Leo gets the treatment: The Titanic star also gets his own instant answer within the search results page . Close up: Details for Mona Lisa include the year of completion, a short description, links to related searches and to similar paintings. Leonardo DiCaprio's answer lists his films, similar searches, and a biography . Google is by far the leader in search, with 66 percent of the U.S. market, according to comScore. But it sees other sites such as Facebook as competition, as users there can poll their friends and acquaintances for information on various topics without leaving the Facebook ecosystem. Under the new system, many users will end their Internet search without leaving Google's pages, when in the past they might have continued to a site such as Wikipedia, which is collaborating with Google on the new search features. Google said it could actually drive more traffic to Wikipedia, which will be prominently linked to in the summary boxes. The new techniques are based in large part on work done at online data collection Freebase, Singhal said. Freebase was developed by Metaweb, a company Google acquired in 2010. Google is also working on being able to better answer more complex questions such as 'What are the ten deepest lakes in Africa?' that require its algorithms to factor in several different criteria. But it may never be able to crack some users' toughest questions, such as 'Does my hairstyle make me look fat?' which Singhal said was a real user query. He said: 'We are not magicians - we are just computer science geeks.' Similarly, Google yesterday revealed the 'Research Pane', which provides a similar service while writing in Google Documents . Explaining the concept, Singhal said: 'Take a query like [taj mahal]. For more than four decades, search has essentially been about matching keywords to queries. To a search engine the words [taj mahal] have been just that - two words. 'But we all know that [taj mahal] has a much richer meaning. You might think of one of the world’s most beautiful monuments, or a Grammy Award-winning musician, or possibly even a casino in Atlantic City, NJ. Or, depending on when you last ate, the nearest Indian restaurant. 'It’s why we’ve been working on an intelligent model - in geek-speak, a 'graph' - that understands real-world entities and their relationships to one another: things, not strings. 'The Knowledge Graph enables you to search for things, people or places that Google knows about - landmarks, celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, celestial objects, works of art and more - and instantly get information that’s relevant to your query. 'This is a critical first step towards building the next generation of search, which taps into the collective intelligence of the web and understands the world a bit more like people do.' He continued: 'Google’s Knowledge Graph isn’t just rooted in public sources such as Freebase, Wikipedia and the CIA World Factbook. It’s also augmented at a much larger scale - because we’re focused on comprehensive breadth and depth. 'It currently contains more than 500million objects, as well as more than 3.5billion facts about and relationships between these different objects. And it's tuned based on what people search for, and what we find out on the web. 'How do we know which facts are most likely to be needed for each item? For that, we go back to our users and study in aggregate what they’ve been asking Google about each item. 'For example, people are interested in knowing what books Charles Dickens wrote, whereas they’re less interested in what books Frank Lloyd Wright wrote, and more in what buildings he designed. Google Documents - which has now been re-christened Google Drive - got a similar 'knowledge treatment' this week. As you type into Google's online word processor, Google can return facts and images about your subject. Users can specify if they want Docs - which has recently been re-christened as Drive by Google - to search all of Google, or just keep searches restricted to images and quotes. Google software engineer Sarveshwar Dudd said: 'If you find something you like, you can add it by clicking the insert button or, for images, by dragging them directly into your document. 'From the research pane, you can search for whatever info you need to help you write your document. With just a couple clicks you can look up maps, quotes, images, and much more. 'If appropriate we'll automatically add a footnote citation so there's a record of where you found the info.' 'The Knowledge Graph also helps us understand the relationships between things. Marie Curie is a person in the Knowledge Graph, and she had two children, one of whom also won a Nobel Prize, as well as a husband, Pierre Curie, who claimed a third Nobel Prize for the family. All of these are linked in our graph. It’s not just a catalog of objects; it also models all these inter-relationships. It’s the intelligence between these different entities that’s the key. 'We’ve always believed that the perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want. And we can now sometimes help answer your next question before you’ve asked it, because the facts we show are informed by what other people have searched for. 'For example, the information we show for Tom Cruise answers 37 percent of next queries that people ask about him. 'We’ve begun to gradually roll out this view of the Knowledge Graph to U.S. English users. It’s also going to be available on smartphones and tablets. 'We’re proud of our first baby step - the Knowledge Graph - which will enable us to make search more intelligent, moving us closer to the ""Star Trek computer"" that I've always dreamed of building. 'Enjoy your lifelong journey of discovery, made easier by Google Search, so you can spend less time searching and more time doing what you love.'","Search engine has 3.5billion facts ready to weave into search results .

"The spokesman for ISIS who brazenly declared that jihadists would ‘raise the flag of Allah in the White House’ has been killed by a Syrian air strike, according to a message posted on social media. A pro-Isis Twitter account said of the gun-toting PR representative: ‘This brother Abu Moussa was martyred during missile clashes at the Taqba airbase.’ His death has not yet been officially confirmed. Scroll down for video . Reportedly dead: Isis spokesman Abu Mosa has been killed in an airstrike, according to a Twitter account that's sympathetic to the terrorists . Mosa recently granted a journalist access to Isis fighters and even took him to the frontline in Syria, where he astonishingly broke off an interview to take pot shots at government soldiers. In a video for Vice News, he said: ‘I say to America that the Islamic Caliphate has been established and we will not stop. Don’t be cowards and attack us with drones. ‘Instead send your soldiers, the ones we humiliated in Iraq. We will humiliate them everywhere, God willing. And we will raise the flag of Allah in the White House.’ Mosa recently granted a journalist access to Isis fighters and even took him to the frontline in Syria . The news follows the revelation that at least one in four of the estimated 2,000 foreigners fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq is British - and half of those are already back in the UK. Serious questions have been raised as to whether enough is being done to stem the flow of fighters after the Government revealed it has only seized 23 passports this year to prevent them travelling to the war zone. The Government says there are around 500 British among the fighters while a further 250 are thought to have already returned to the UK where the police and security services are attempting to watch them. That means there are now almost three times as many British Muslims fighting for Islamic State than there are serving in the UK military, an MP has claimed. Islamic State released a video purportedly of Iraq's minority Yazidis taking part in a conversion ritual at an unknown location . But Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, told Channel 4 News the lack of border controls meant the Government’s estimates of jihadi numbers were too low. ‘I think it’s about 2,000 people,’ he added. According to the Ministry of Defence, there are around 600 British Muslims currently serving in the Armed Forces - just 0.4 per cent of total personnel. This is far below the 4.3 per cent of the British population as a whole who are Muslim. Irish police also believe that 30 jihadists are using the country as a base while travelling to and from Syria and Iraq. The murder of James Foley apparently by 'John' - one of a gang of British jihadis known as 'The Beatles' - has raised fears the killing fields of Syria and Iraq are dominated by extremist Britons.

'He grew to love and admire the Syrian people and felt at home there. Our son's journey culminated in him embracing Islam. 'Sadly, he was taken captive and is not free to continue his life's work serving the people of the region. 'The driving force in our family has always been to serve others. Our son comes from two long lines of teachers and humanitarian workers. 'Our family deplores all human suffering and the loss of innocent life, no matter who is responsible. We respond by trying to persuade aid and assistance. 'Our son was living his life according to that same humanitarian call when he was taken captive. We know that the Syrians have suffered. We also believe violence is not the solution to the problems that trouble us all. 'There is so much that is beyond our control.

We know you were very worried about your friend who was taken with you. He was released and is well. Please know that we are all praying for you and your safe return. 'Most of all, know that we love you, and our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, the life of service to those in greatest need.'

"A gang of Russian thugs paid the price for picking on the wrong guy, after a verbal confrontation in a bar turned into a full knock-out. Nicolai Vlasenko, 29, returned from the bathroom to find a group of men harassing his wife to get her to join them at their table in a bar. Vlasenko, a professional boxer and martial arts expert, was caught on CCTV knocking out three of the thugs outside a bar in Starokorsunskaya, south-west Russia. K.O.: A group of thugs started on the wrong guy in a bar in Starokorsunskaya, south-west Russia . The men are said to be part of a local gang which has been blamed for a rise in petty crime in the small Russian town. When Vlasenko told the men to leave his wife alone, the self-declared leader, Leonti Yevdokimov, 33, suggested that he might want to continue the discussion outside. 'There were at least ten of them, led by the two who thought they were real big shots,' eyewitness Eldar Vinogradoff, 27, said. 'One of them took off his shirt and started squaring up to the boxer, and I don't think he even knew what hit him when he went down like a bowling pin. A second man tried to kick the boxer and he was floored instantly as well. 'Then a third man joined in, and he was left staggering and on the point of collapsing after taking three blows to the head and not landing once himself.' Smackdown: After professional fighter Nicolai Vlasenko defended his wife who was being harassed by the local gangsters, the group continued their beef with the boxer in the street outside the bar . Bad move: When members of the gang make a move on him, Vlasenko knocks them to the ground . Knocked out: The CCTV footage shows Vlasenko taking out three members of the gang with ease . Hero: The local gangsters complained about the incident, but after watching the CCTV, police have decided that they will not be taking any action against Vlasenko . CCTV cameras outside the bar show how the rest of the group back away after the first three are knocked out cold, instead rushing to the aide of the floored thugs. The gang later then hired a lawyer to file a complaint to the local police that they had been attacked. However police have said they are taking no action after the CCTV images showed that the man was clearly acting in self-defence and that he had been on his own against nearly a dozen people who were on the other side. The lawyer for Vlasenko said: 'My client wasn't prepared to allow them to harass his wife. 'He was prepared to discuss it in a reasonable manner, but when they resorted to force than he was forced to defend himself with inevitable consequences.'","Gang taken out by boxer when they tried to convince his wife to join them .

"British Special Forces hunting the killer of James Foley are using an array of sophisticated equipment to track him down – and possibly free other hostages being held. The Mail on Sunday has been given a detailed account of how elite troops from the SAS and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment (SRR) are conducting high-tech operations inside Syria and Iraq, which could lead to the capture of the extremists within days. It emerged as reports suggested that British intelligence services had identified the true identity of the terrorist who beheaded Mr Foley  – as seen in a video which shocked the world - known as 'Jihadi John'. Scroll down for video . The SAS team tasked with hunting down the ISIS terrorists will use hand-launched surveillance drones . Elite force: The SAS are experts in desert warfare having conducted operations in the Middle East for decades. Pictured are a heavily armed British Special Forces patrol in Afghanistan in 2001 . The Mail on Sunday has been told that in the past 48 hours a ‘significant force’ of SAS soldiers and signallers have deployed to northern Iraq, joining Iraqi and Kurdish units fighting IS. They have separated into four-man teams and are accompanying local troops in an attempt to capture British jihadis, identify them and establish links to Jihadi John. A key suspect is 23-year-old Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, who until a year ago lived with his family in their £1m home in the affluent London area of Maida Vale, but recently appeared on social media grasping a severed head, an anonymous government source told The Sunday Times. Once a British jihadi is in custody, samples will be taken of the suspect’s blood and DNA – vital in the case of UK extremists because the information can be matched to medical records. For identification purposes, a photograph is also taken of the iris – the visible coloured ring around the pupil – which is unique. One SAS source said: ‘It is possible to identify British jihadis on the battlefield by intercepting their radio messages. When they’re captured by the Iraqis or Kurds we’ll take a close interest in their questioning. ‘Gathering information such as their blood group and DNA, as well as voice recordings in either Arabic or English, will help us zero in on Jihadi John because it can be compared with existing data.’ Public Enemy Number 1: The SAS have been ordered to find out the British born terrorist 'Jihad John' From the battleground this information is sent via a portable satellite manned by a soldier from 264 (SAS) Signal Squadron, who beams it to a spy plane, such as the ‘Rivet Joint’ aircraft, circling overhead. Inside Rivet Joint, a 17-man team processes the information and sends it back to GCHQ, the Government’s secret communications headquarters at Cheltenham. Here it is analysed and matched against records of British jihadis believed to be fighting in Syria and Iraq, before ‘feedback information’ is sent to SAS teams. GCHQ’s library is believed to include recordings of thousands of voices taken from phone and radio intercepts. Meanwhile, on the Turkish-Syrian border, SRR soldiers fly drones into IS strongholds and give live details of their movements. Such a detailed study of their bases is intended to prevent a repeat of the US Special Forces mission last month which failed to find any hostages. American Delta Force troops raided an IS base at Uqayrishah in northern Syria, but were forced to retreat after a gun battle with terrorists. The SRR’s drones can fly for up to 24 hours, climbing to an altitude of more than 18,000ft. From here they are able to survey hundreds of miles of territory occupied by IS fighters, including the city of Raqqa, where it is believed several Western hostages have been held. Intelligence gathered will be used in the planning stages ahead of any incursion by SRR troops into Syria. A source added: ‘The SRR is using strategic drones, which provide an overview of the ground, and tactical drones which can look over the walls of buildings and provide sharp pictures of suspects’ faces. ‘The ground inside Syria and Iraq is well known to British Special Forces after the previous Gulf wars. In 2008, the SAS destroyed the Al Qaeda-Iraq leadership and we’re confident we can do the same to IS.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on Special Forces operations.’ The SAS are using a range of high tech surveillance techniques on the hunt for 'Jihad John' and his friends . James Foley’s last loving message to his family was memorised by a fellow hostage, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Danish photojournalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, 25, spent 13 months imprisoned alongside Foley and painstakingly committed to memory a lengthy final letter in which the American spoke hopefully about being freed in time to celebrate his sister’s wedding next year. When Ottosen was released in June, his first call was to Foley’s mum Diane, when he dictated the lengthy letter to her. His act of love and courage was revealed by the Foley family’s priest of 30 years, Father Marc Montminy, who said: ‘Jim was never allowed to send a letter like the other hostages because he was an American. Jim related the letter to the Danish hostage and he memorised it. James Foley, pictured,  vowed to a fellow hostage that he would make it home to his sister's wedding . ‘Jim mentioned every family member and how much he loved them. He mentioned his mother, his father and his grandmother, who he was very close to. ‘He mentioned his brothers and his sisters and his nieces and nephews. ‘He said he loved them all and he knew they loved him and were praying for him and fighting for his release. He ended on a hopeful note by saying he’d be there for [Foley’s sister] Katie’s wedding. ‘She had just got engaged when he left for Syria so he must always have had hope he would come home.’ James’s mother Diane flew to Copenhagen the week before her son was executed to meet with Ottosen, according to the boss of the Boston-based online news organisation Foley was working for when he was snatched in November 2012. Phil Balboni, CEO of GlobalPost, told how Diane developed a ‘close bond’ with the families of other hostages still in captivity and met up with released hostages from France and Spain who had been held by the same group of British jihadis dubbed The Beatles. ‘She went to Copenhagen to meet with the Danish journalist who memorised the letter. He provided new details of his time with Jim. All of the released hostages spoke of Jim’s courage. He was subjected to the most abuse and torture because he was American but they never broke his spirit. ‘Diane has become extremely close to the families of other Western hostages who are still in captivity. They share a special and very close bond.’ James Foley, pictured, was murdered by a masked  ISIS terrorist with a British accent called 'Jihad John' Balboni described Diane as ‘a woman on a mission’ to save her son from the moment the first email arrived from his captors on November 26, 2013. ‘The email was sent to me and to Jim’s brother Michael. It was brief. It said “We’re holding James. We’re prepared to negotiate for his release. We need money – FAST.” ‘They had all of Jim’s cellphone contacts which is how they got our email addresses. ‘There were more emails, five or six in all. They gave us the opportunity to ask proof-of-life questions, obscure family references impossible for anyone but Jim to answer. That was in early December, 2013. We felt great hope.’ In one email, the terrorists made their sole demand – for £80 million and the release of Muslim prisoners held by the US. Balboni said the family had raised almost £3 million in ransom money. But then the terrorists stopped communicating. After months of silence, the Foleys received a final email, dated August 12 – a hate-filled rant full of rudimentary spelling errors in which the jihadis vowed to execute Foley saying ‘You (America) and your citizens will pay the price of your bombings! ‘The first of which being the blood of the American citizen James Foley! He will be executed as a DIRECT result of your transgressions towards us!’ The email may have been written by ‘John’, the British jihadi who beheaded Foley, reports claim. A memorial service for James Foley will take place today at the family’s church, Holy Rosary, near their home in Rochester, New Hampshire.","The SAS and Special Reconnaissance Regiment have been deployed to Iraq .

"The Islamic State terrorist known as Jihadi John has been tracked by drones flying over the Syrian city of Raqqa – but British Special Forces chiefs fear a ‘kill or capture’ mission there would end in bloody failure, sources disclosed last night. Reaper drones deployed high above the terrorists’ strongholds are also believed to have identified hostages wearing orange jumpsuits but top brass are thought to have currently ruled out a rescue operation because IS defences are too strong. Special Forces bosses have advised the Ministry of Defence that a sustained bombing campaign lasting several weeks would be preferable. Scroll down for video . Eyes in the sky: Reaper drones are flying over terrorist strongholds in Syria. Above, file image of Reaper drone . A source said: ‘The imagery from the drones and satellites is instructive but IS infrastructure in Raqqa would have to be targeted over a sustained period to make any sort of raid a realistic possibility. ‘On the basis of our current advice there is very little chance of the Prime Minister signing off a rescue bid. The prospect of success has got to be 100 per cent or thereabouts, and at the moment it is nowhere near that. And for now there are not many other options on the table. 'While sightings of Jihadi John are useful, as was establishing his identity, we are still a long way off getting a hit on him. Right now a raid would be suicidal.’ Drones expert Mike Gething, editor of Jane’s Electro-Optic Systems, confirmed that a Reaper could pick out hostages’ jumpsuits ‘providing it knew where to look and its line of sight was not obscured’. No mercy: Jihadi John with British hostage Alan Henning, whom he later beheaded . He added that if terrorists looked directly into the sky they could be identified. The US Air Force has more than 100 MQ-9 Reaper drones at its disposal, though how many have been sent to Syria is unknown. The drone has a maximum range of 5,300 miles and can fly for up to 32 hours at 207mph.

"Arjen Robben has admitted it 'wasn't easy' to work under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea due to the injury problems that plagued the early stages of his career. Bayern Munich winger Robben spent three seasons under The Special One between 2004 and 2007, winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups. But despite his key role in Mourinho's first-era Chelsea side, the Dutchman says his frequent spells out with injury meant that things didn't always work out as he would have wanted. Arjen Robben's relationship with Jose Mourinho at Chelsea was complicated by his injury problems . The Dutch winger was often out injured but is now regularly fit for his current club Bayern Munich . Robben scored in Bayern's impressive 8-0 victory over Hamburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday . The 31-year-old winger praised the Portuguese coach's role in his development but felt that Mourinho's dislike for players who get injured made things difficult for them both before he eventually moved to Real Madrid for £24million in 2007. 'It was very good to work with him (Mourinho) at that age because I was young and with Mourinho you have to be mentally very strong,' Robben said. 'You have to jump on the train with him or you're off. So it was great for my development.' Mourinho and Robben walk from the pitch together at Anfield after a Chelsea defeat . Robben was an important player in Mourinho's first Chelsea spell but was constantly troubled by injury . Robben won two Premier League titles and formed a dangerous partnership with Damien Duff . Robben did not make his Chelsea debut until October in his first season at Stamford Bridge due to a broken metatarsal suffered in pre-season but he went on to form an impressive partnership with Damien Duff as Mourinho's men went unbeaten in the league for the rest of the campaign. 'It was hard at first because I came with an injury,' Robben told The Guardian. ' It was very difficult for me and also for him. Of course, he doesn’t like players who get injured. 'So it wasn’t easy but I always had the feeling I had his confidence. I played some great games for Chelsea but it was unfortunate I had injury problems and I couldn’t do it over a long period – like now.' Robben still retains good memories of his time in London though - and reserved particular praise for the much-maligned hectic festive period, although he added: 'playing four games in 10 days is crazy.'

"A British man who at one time was the fattest in the world is pleading with the NHS to remove unsightly flaps of flesh after he managed to lose more than half of his body weight.

However, NHS bosses have refused to perform cosmetic surgery, insisting that he needs to maintain a stable weight before it can be considered.

'I need this operation to . be able to get my life back, to be able to get back into society. It is . stopping me living a reasonable life.' The former postman, who weighed 70st - or half a tonne - at his heaviest, used to consume 20,000 calories a day, 10 times the normal for the average man. He said his binge eating was spurred by heartbreak in his twenties at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health. He quit his . job as a postman when his weight prevented him from completing his . deliveries. He was transferred to a sorting . office, where he worked until 1989 when he was sacked and imprisoned for . six months for stealing from customers' letters.

Mr Mason spent around £30,000 a year on food and sometimes went naked to avoid having to get dressed. Then in 2009, Mr Mason, from Ipswich, underwent a £30,000 operation on the NHS at Chichester Hospital which drastically reduced the amount he could eat. Now his frame has shrunk so much that he has been left with swathes of loose skin. Surgery can be used to remove the excess skin but as the treatment is for cosmetic and not clinical reasons, it is not automatically available on the NHS. Mr Mason has been left with rolls of unsightly excess skin on his arms, legs and stomach . It will cost Mr Mason around £1,500 to £6,000 if he wants to have the surgery privately depending on the amount of flesh that needs to be removed . Mr Mason will have to pay around £1,500 to £6,000 if he wants to have the surgery privately depending on the amount of flesh that needs to be removed.

But Mr Mason, who has a a new target weight of 23 stone, is angered by the NHS's decision. He said: 'My consultant says he's always seen . there is a skinny man waiting to get out but it is so frustrating to . have got so far and just be at the final hurdle. 'I have times when I just sit and cry but then I think ""I'm not going to let it get me down.""' Health bosses have remained firm about their decision, stating that Mr Mason, who also suffered a heart attack following his gastric bypass, must wait before he has further cosmetic surgery. An NHS Suffolk spokesperson said: 'Before a . patient has an operation it is important to take a balanced decision . that is in the best interest of that patient. 'In cases like this NHS . Suffolk has a panel of people - including clinicians - who decide . whether the patient should have such an operation. 'A patient must have a . stable weight before he or she is considered.' Mr Mason also claimed that the NHS failed to help him as his size soared and instead of receiving a treatment programme to manage his weight, he said he was told in 1996: 'Ride your bike more.' He now hopes to learn how to drive and to use his experience to help others with eating disorders, including anorexia. He has also set up his own craft company to produce Christmas tree decorations and birthday cards. The heaviest man of all time was American John Minnoch, who weighed 100.2 stone. He died in 1983 aged 42. Two female carers take up to four . hours to wash Paul Mason because his size makes it impossible for him to clean himself. The women, who visit him three times a day, have to apply cream to every inch of his bulging body to stop chafing. He manages to soap his upper body himself and the nurses wipe him down. They used to look after him from 8am until 8pm but Ipswich NHS were forced to axe the service because of cutbacks.

"A pair of identical twins, who were born deaf, have been killed by Belgian doctors after seeking euthanasia when they found out they would also soon go blind. In a unique case under the country's euthanasia laws, the 45-year-old brothers, from Antwerp, chose death as they were unable to bear the thought of never seeing one another again.

This means patients must play an active role in . the administration of the drug that ends their lives. In Belgium, some 1,133 cases of . euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011, about . one percent of all deaths in the country, according to official figures.

He said they were 'very happy' and it had was a 'relief' to see the end of their suffering. 'They had a cup of coffee in the hall, it went well and a rich conversation,' Mr Dufour said. 'Then the separation from their parents and brother was very serene and beautiful. 'At the last there was a little wave of their hands and then they were gone.' More to come?

"The founder of Tumblr is doing nothing to change his image as a boy wonder as he has revealed that he loves flying toy drones both in the office and in the open air of Brooklyn. David Karp, 27, is the CEO of the social media platform and sold the company to Yahoo for $1.1billion earlier this year but that doesn't stop him from acting like a kid in their company headquarters. 'I can have it over on the other side of the office, bothering people while I’m at my desk. Usually I send it straight over my lawyer’s head,' he told New York Magazine in an interview about his management style. 'I’m obsessed with drones right now. I . fly my drones all over Brooklyn. These things are amazing. These things . are not regulated. I keep destroying them. I’ve had five of them.' Man in charge: David Karp, 27, is the founder and CEO of Tumblr and apparently keeps a very relaxed atmosphere in the social media company's office in New York by flying around toy drones . Many automatically associate drones with the unmanned military aircrafts that have been used extensively by President Obama's administration overseas, but the smaller versions are available for personal use. Karp appears to be a big fan, and his latest hobby is an expensive and elusive one, but that is not much of a concern for the tech giant. His net worth is said to be in the area of $200million, and that helps him fund this newfound hobby. 'You get them from China, so they all . come HK Post, which means that you have to wait for them for, . like—you’re lucky if they come within two months. So I usually have a . few on order at any given time,' he told the magazine. Karp founded Tumblr in 2007 and became well-known throughout the business world when the site was purchased in May. Money to burn: Karp orders the drones from China and he has plenty to spend after selling his company for $1.1billion to Yahoo (seen here with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer in May) Some of the more astounding details of the deal were only revealed last month when the regulatory filings were made public, disclosing that he gets an additional $81million if he stays at the head of the company for the next four years. Though the slight man is described as being a rather unassuming CEO figure in the New York magazine profile, he has made one decidedly corporate decision since taking on the role. Shortly after being bought by Yahoo, Tumblr began running ads- first on their mobile site then on desktop-accessed versions as well. The move marked a 180-turn for Karp, as he previously said in 2010 that the thought of running ads on the free web service 'really turns our stomachs'.",The 27-year-old buys them from China and has multiple orders in at all times .

All natural: Kate Garraway says she wouldn't rule Botox out but is happy with a thick fringe for now . 'Lovely!' One interviewee who didn't get a grilling was White House Down actor Channing Tatum . 'Most people are nice really,' she adds. 'My job is all about meeting people who, whether they're the Prime Minister or Justin Timberlake, have all done something extraordinary.' Garraway is no slouch in the out-of-the-ordinary stakes herself. At 46, she's done and seen it all, from covering the signing of the Good Friday Agreement for the BBC to settling down on the GMTV sofa with Katie Price. It would, you'd imagine, be near-impossible to shake that determined calm, although Garraway says since she became a mother, things have become a little more challenging. 'There's good and bad [days],' she says, candidly. 'It's been a challenge this summer because the kids are off and I worked every day. 'It has taken extreme organisation, and that's something I'm really not good at! I wanted them to have good holiday but had to balance it with work too.' Garraway's children, eight-year-old Darcey and four-year-old Billy, are the axis around which her world revolves and she made headlines recently when she revealed that she wished she had had them earlier. Controversially, she also suggested that women should have children earlier, despite having her own at the ages of 38 and 42. Speaking to Jenni Murray on the BBC'S Woman's Hour, she added: 'If I'd discovered motherhood earlier I'd have a huge brood. But I fell pregnant at 38 and 42. It was easy. But then when I tried for a third child and they told me I was 44, and I realised I was ignorant as to how lucky I was the first times. 'We shouldn't get into a panic. Nobody wants women marrying the wrong man or having babies when they aren't ready, but you are hedging your bets if you leave it too late.' Despite the controversy, she seems content and is happy to regale with anecdotes, including a morning spent struggling into Spanx while her bemused brood looked on. Poised: Kate is known for always keeping her cool - even when dealing with Bruce Willis in his bedroom . 'I was getting ready them ready for school today and then I had to go straight off to meet the lovely Channing,' she laughs. 'I was in my Spanx though and all they [the children] were asking me was ""What's that?"" I told them that they'll understand they have two children. 'There a lot of tricks nowadays, thank the Lord! And luckily, most people don't expect you to look like a supermodel either.' Here, she's touched on an interesting topic. The TV world is notorious for shedding female presenters once they reach their 40s and 50s as former Countryfile presenter Miriam O' Reilly alleged when she took the BBC to court for unfair dismissal. So does she feel under pressure to look good? 'It's strange because friends tell me . there are these issues in TV but personally, I'm surrounded by women on and off . screen who are older so haven't come across it,' she says. 'You have got to deal with those things on a personal basis I think but then I look at the US where there are lots of amazing older women like [CNN's] Christiane Amanpour and it makes you more hopeful.' Most important: Kate says her much-wanted family is what really gets her up in the mornings . No surgery: Kate and her BBC counterpart Fiona Bruce, 49, have kept their complexions the natural way . Even so, there's surely still pressure to look good. Would she ever consider having Botox or surgery? 'I'd never . say never about any of those things. I have friends [who have had cosmetic work] who look amazing but I've also interviewed people who look terrible. '[Presenter] Fiona Bruce has said absolutely . no and still looks amazing. Sometimes natural is best, although I've got a really thick fringe which is the coward's way out!' She might be a 'coward' when it comes to cosmeceuticals but she's no softie when it comes to questioning the flow of politicians and A-listers that stream through the ITV studios. 'I hope I'm always fair and if they did ask me not to mention something . specific, I wouldn't do it,' she says of her sofa interviewing style. 'It's slightly different with politicians because . questions you're asking are about things that affect all our lives, so I sort of feel they . deserve tougher questions. 'Essentially, . the whole point is to get a sense of what makes someone tick. I just . want to get an answer and as long [the question] is fair then it's fine.' So what makes Garraway herself tick? 'Caffeine and patriotism, sir! I'd really like . to say that but it's from a film called White House Down. 'I think my family is obviously at my . heart, because I've always wanted to have one, and my wider family. That would always . be my first choice.'

"The co-founders behind the controversial gossip app Yik Yak are being sued by a former college friend who claims he was unfairly dumped from the highly lucrative business venture just as it was taking off. Douglas Warstler filed his lawsuit against Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington in Georgia State Court in Fulton County on Monday. All three previously attended Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, and were fraternity brothers at Kappa Alpha - where Buffington was Warstler’s ‘big brother’. Yik Yak founders Brooks Buffington, left, and Tyler Droll, right, are being sued by their former college friend who claims he was unfairly dumped from their business venture . Warstler and Droll were both computer science majors and became close after building an app together in class. The app didn’t take off but it prompted the three friends to form Locus Engineering, a development company that was divided evenly between the three of them. A second app called Dicho also flopped, but included the ability to post anonymously – a key feature of Yik Yak, which allows people to create and view posts in secret within a 1.5 mile radius. In his lawsuit, Warstler claims that he developed this key feature. By October 2013, Droll and Buffington had graduated and were living in Atlanta, while Warstler was still at school. The suit says he played a crucial role in marketing the app - now called Yik Yak - among other students at Furman, where it quickly proved very popular. Douglas Warstler, right, claims he was responsible for developing the technology behind Yik Yak, left, that allows users to post anonymously within a 1.5 mile radius . Just before Christmas, Buffington texted Warstler and offered to buy him out of the company. Days later, on December 28, Buffington emailed Warstler to tell him he was ‘not getting screwed out of anything,’ but that he needed to give up his part of the company. 'We need a fresh start with your name off of this [Yik Yak],' the email said, according to the suit. 'I spoke with my parents over the holidays. They are making me get this settled before continuing to fund it.' Warstler refused and by January 6, Buffington and Droll had dissolved the company without warning him. 'We have decided that our best course of action is to dissolve Locus Engineering and set up a new LLC for Yik Yak,' said Buffington via another email, according to the suit. 'Between Brooks and I, we jointly own all of the intellectual property of Yik Yak and Locus Engineering has no stake in it.' Since January, the app has proved hugely successful with users and investors alike. It is one of the most downloaded apps this year and used on more than 1300 college campuses. Former friends: All three previously attended Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, and were fraternity brothers at Kappa Alpha - where Buffington, right was Warstler’s, left, 'big brother' By June it had secured $10 million in venture capital funding, although recent reports suggest it may have raised around $75 million in new financing. Warstler's lawsuit asks for one-third of Yik Yak to be returned to him along with punitive damages, compensatory damages and attorney’s fees. 'He started this company together with them and with the understanding that they’d be developing and marketing different iPhone applications,' Warstler's lawyer Luan Tran told Forbes. 'Yik Yak was the second application that they started to work on together. The first one was not a success. He was responsible for Yik Yak going viral at Furman which was the Ground Zero or the testing area for this application.' Tran recently represented ousted Snapchat cofounder Reggie Brown in his lawsuit against the former fraternity brothers who ousted him from the messaging app, which is valued at $10 billion. Warstler's claims will be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the 'Wiklevii' in Facebook movie The Social Network . In September, Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Robert Murphy acknowledged that Brown had been integral to the birth of app. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Brown had been seeking a third and Tran had told Forbes that  he and his client were seeking 'over a billion dollars' in damages. The claims of start-up skulduggery will also be all too familiar to the Winklevoss brothers, who were dubbed the ‘Wiklevii’ in the Facebook movie The Social Network. It was in 2003 that they claimed they asked Mark Zuckerberg to write the code on their own social network, called Harvard Connection. They alleged that he then started his own rival called thefacebook.com which went on to become the biggest website of its kind in the world with more than one billion users. Whilst they were given their $65 million settlement Zuckerberg has gone on to become one of the richest men in the world. Warstler is currently a master’s student at Vanderbilt University.","Douglas Warstler filed his lawsuit against Yik Yak co-founders Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington on Monday .

"A Russian fighter jet made multiple, close-range passes near an American warship in the Black Sea for more than 90 minutes amid escalating tensions in the region, it was claimed today. The Russian Fencer made 12 passes and flew within 1,000 yards (900 meters) of the USS Donald Cook Navy destroyer on Saturday, U.S. military officials claim. The U.S. warship issued several radio queries and warnings using international emergency circuits but the Russian aircraft, which was flying at about 500 feet (150 meters) above sea level, did not respond. Scroll down for video . Growing tensions: The U.S. military has claimed a Russian fighter jet made multiple close-range passes by one of its navy ships, the USS Donald Cook, in the Black Sea on Saturday . Communications: The USS Destroyer Donald Cook, pictured at the Constanta shipyard in the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta on Monday, attempted to contact the jet but got no response . 'This provocative and unprofessional Russian action is inconsistent with international protocols and previous agreements on the professional interaction between our militaries,' said Army Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman. The fighter appeared to be unarmed and never was in danger of coming in contact with the ship, said the officials. The passes, which occurred in the early evening there, ended without incident. A second Russian fighter jet flew at a higher altitude and was not a concern, said Warren. A U.S. military official also said that a Russian Navy ship, a frigate, has been shadowing the U.S. warship, remaining within visual distance but not close enough to be unsafe. The official was not authorized to discuss the incident publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity. Warren said that he is not aware of any official communication or protests by the U.S. to the Russians about incident. Allegations: A U.S. military official described the action by the fighter jet as 'provocative and unprofessional' Official meetings: Romanian President Traian Basescu, left, boards the USS Donald Cook on Monday . The USS Donald Cook has been conducting routine operations in international waters east of Romania. The ship, which carries helicopters, was deployed to the Black Sea on April 10, in the wake of the Russian military takeover of Ukraine's Crimea region and ongoing unrest there. U.S. military officials have said the deployment is part of an effort to reassure allies and partners in the region. Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov on Monday called for the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping troops in the east of the country, where pro-Russian insurgents have occupied buildings in nearly 10 cities. The gunmen are demanding more autonomy from the central government and closer ties with Russia. The West has accused Moscow of fomenting the unrest. And European Union foreign ministers are meeting in Luxembourg Monday to consider additional sanctions against Russian officials because of Moscow's annexation of Crimea. The USS Donald Cook warship was deployed to the Black Sea in the wake of Russia's annexing of Crimea . Armed: Two U.S. Navy technical staff check a two barrel gun on board of the USS Donald Cook warship . The USS Donald Cook is now in port at Constanta, Romania. Romanian President Traian Basescu visited the ship Monday and said a second U.S. Navy warship - a frigate from the Navy's Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea - is also heading to the Black Sea. 'My visit to the ship is symbolic, which first of all shows our respect to our NATO allies' reaction who have strengthened their presence in the Black Sea after Russia's annexation of Crimea,' said Basescu, who is a former ship captain. He said the Russians 'had created a circle of fire around the Black Sea.' The U.S. frigate, which has not yet been identified, is expected to arrive in the Black Sea in the next two weeks. According to a U.S. military official, the frigate is likely to replace the USS Donald Cook, which is expected to return to the Mediterranean Sea.","Russian Fencer made 12 passes over the USS Donald Cook on Saturday .

"A Florida drug court judge is headed for rehab herself after an erratic performance at the bench last week. Broward County Court judge Gisele Pollack, 55,  resided over the court for an hour and a half before abruptly walking out and ending the Tuesday's court session. Audio of the incident recorded Pollack telling defendants they have to get clean in a slurred voice. Addiction issues: After a brief and erratic appearance in court last week, Judge Gisele Pollack abruptly ended the session . Addiction: The judge has made no secret of her struggles with drugs and alcohol . 'You have to be warned... being clean...' she mumbled to a defendant. 'What?' said the defendant, confused. According to the Orlando Sentinel, she was later seen yelling at her judicial assistant, demanding that her car keys be returned. Treatment program: Judge Pollack established the Broward County misdemeanor drug court to help people addicted to drugs avoid criminal records . Pollack did not appear in court Wednesday, but returned to work Thursday where she did not address the incident but told a packed court of graduates of the misdemeanor drug court program that they must 'remain vigilant.' She told Local 10 Thursday that she is suffering from depression. 'I have some health issues,' she said. 'I’m going into treatment for them. I have two weeks off starting [Friday]. I’m going to be in an intense outpatient program.''I'm a good judge and I'm going to ask you to please work with me,' she said.Pollack, who has never made a secret of her past alcohol and drug abuse problems, was elected to the bench in 2004.A year later, she established the misdemeanor drug court. 'Defendants prepared to go through a treatment program and six months worth of testing, supervision and staying clean would have the charges against them dismissed,' Pollack has said of the program.Attorney Eric Schwartzreich, who is advising Pollack after Tuesday's breakdown, says the judge has had issues in her personal life recently. A brief recess: Judge Pollack will be spending two weeks in rehab before returning to court in the new year . Personal issues: Pollack has recently lost her mother and her son is reportedly seriously ill . 'She’s had some severe personal tragedy in her life,' Schwartzreich told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Her mother recently passed away, and they were very close. It’s been really devastating for her.' According to News 10, Pollack's son is suffering a serious illness, which could also have served to tip her over the edge. Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein, a longtime friend of Pollack's, says he hopes people will be accepting of her struggle. 'If this causes the people to not have faith and not have trust in what goes on in that drug courtroom, then she will have to step aside,' he said. 'My hope is is people will wrap their ever-loving arms around Judge Pollack just as she has wrapped her arms around thousands of people.'","Judge Gisele Pollack spoke in a slurred voice before ending a court session abruptly after an hour and a half .

"Charles Saatchi has launched a furious attack on socialite journalist Taki Theodoracopulos after the columnist used his Spectator column to stand up for Nigella Lawson. The controversial billionaire told Taki that his ex-wife 'always found you toe-curlingly vile' in a bizarre open letter to the magazine which has now resulted in the 77-year-old offering to take on Mr Saatchi in a cage fight. The art dealer's outburst came after Taki wrote that Mr Saatchi, 70, was a 'coward' and a 'rogue', criticising the way he treated his celebrity chef ex-wife. Face-off: Charles Saatchi, left, and Taki Theodoracopulos, right, could take part in a bare-knuckle cage fight to settle their public feud . The advertising mogul, now one of the world's leading art dealers, made headlines last year when he was pictured apparently throttling Ms Lawson at a restaurant. The pair divorced shortly afterwards, and the chef has since accused her ex-husband of being controlling and jealous during their decade-long marriage. Mr Saatchi claimed that Ms Lawson was a habitual cocaine user, an allegation he later withdrew, during a court case which laid bare the tensions in their relationship and prompted David Cameron to come out in support of the TV personality. In his Spectator column last week, Taki compared Mr Saatchi unfavourably to notorious porn baron Al Goldstein, saying he was a 'coward' who had a 'bullying manner - against women, that is'. The columnist added: 'Expecting a pornographer to have a heart is like counting upon Charles Saatchi to act like a gentleman. 'The art world is full of rogues and pirates, and in my book the heroic man who grabbed Nigella by the throat is both of these things, and he is most welcome to come and try to grab my little throat anytime.' Mockery: The Spectator compared the feud to new film Grudge Match, which is about a pair of elderly boxers . Controversy: The row started when Taki stood up for Mr Saatchi's ex-wife Nigella Lawson . Dear Ms Taki, . Although the Spectator is a lovely read, I always skip your column, I’m afraid. I am simply not interested in your social life.  I know that you delight in telling readers that your friends of Prussian nobility find you hilariously entertaining company at their  swanky Europoncy parties. But it was very hapless of you to spring to Nigella’s defence last week, as she always found you toe-curlingly vile, and would have been aghast at having you as her valiant supporter. People tell me that in your unreadable column you also like to brag that you are a Black Belt at karate. Well, me too, old boy. But apparently your ‘fights’ are genteel affairs, against other soppy geriatrics rolling around the floor in crisp white outfits, in some bit of judokai nonsense. Mine take place in cages, 20 feet square, unofficial little events with no gloves, no rules, and the loser being carried out, usually battered to bits. You will understand why I laughed out loud at your schoolyard boast that I should try throttling a real hard case like you. Yours,Charles Saatchi . In response, Mr Saatchi sent an open letter to the magazine in which he claimed that Ms Lawson - whose brother Dominic and father Nigel both edited the Spectator - disliked Taki and would be 'aghast' to have him on her side. 'It was very hapless of you to spring . to Nigella's defence last week, as she always found you toe-curlingly . vile, and would have been aghast at having you as her valiant . supporter,' he wrote. He also mocked Taki's fighting ability and boasted about his own martial prowess. 'People tell me that in your unreadable column you also like to brag that you are a black belt at karate,' he wrote. 'Well, me too, old boy. 'But apparently your ""fights"" are genteel affairs, against other soppy geriatrics rolling around the floor in crisp white outfits, in some bit of judokai nonsense. 'Mine take place in cages, 20 feet square, unofficial little events with no gloves, no rules, and the loser being carried out, usually battered to bits. You will understand why I laughed out loud at your schoolyard boast that I should try throttling a real hard case like you.' Taki, a multi-millionaire with homes in New York, London and Switzerland, responded bullishly to Mr Saatchi's boasts. 'I am 77 years old, 5ft 9in and weigh . 185lbs,' he writes in his column this week. 'I am willing to face him . any time under cage-fighting non-rules, which will be a first for me. I . need three days' notice.' Links: Ms Lawson is pictured with her brother Dominic at a party held by Taki in 1991 . Spectator editor Fraser Nelson likened the feud to new film Grudge Match, which sees Sylvester Stallone and Robert de Niro play ageing boxers who are coaxed out of retirement to fight each other. He added: 'If Taki and Charles are serious, we'd be happy to stage the contest in the garden of the Spectator, with proceeds from the ticket sales going to The Boxing Academy in East London.' Political strategist John McTernan tweeted: 'Charles Saatchi seeks to correct his public image by offering to give a 77-year old man a beating. He should be in PR.' Taki, who runs his own magazine as well as writing for the Spectator, has attracted his own fair share of controversy over the past few decades. He has repeatedly been accused of racism, anti-Semitism and fascist sympathies, although his editors have always claimed that his outspoken views are what makes him popular with readers.","Spectator columnist, 77, accused art dealer of being a 'rogue' and 'coward'

"An Atlanta mother-of-two who was convicted of lying to police after her lover and then-boss gunned down her husband at their children's preschool, has been released from prison today. Andrea Sneiderman was released after serving less than a year of her five-year sentence for perjury and obstructing a police investigation into the 2010 murder of husband Russell 'Rusty' Sneiderman, 36. She received a year's credit for time service - some of it while on house arrest. Her former boss and lover, Henny Neuman, was convicted in March 2012 of the killing, though he was found mentally ill after he testified that an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John and a ghost who sounded like Barry White told him to shoot Mr Sneiderman. It is unknown whether Sneiderman will get back custody of her children now that she is released. Her husband's parents had been fighting her family to retain custody of them boy and girl, age 5 and 8. Andrea Sneiderman (right) served less than a year of her five-year sentence after she was convicted of lying about what she knew about the murder of husband Russell 'Rusty' Sneiderman, the father of her two children . Neiderman was arrested in August 2012 after she testified under oath that she did not have an affair with her former boss Henny Neuman . Mrs Sneiderman was initially arrested in August 2012 and charged with orchestrating the murder - though later those charges were dropped and prosecutors instead alleged that she lied to cover up her affair with Neuman. Mr Sneiderman's family testified that Mrs Sneiderman knew her husband had been shot - even before she was told by authorities. Her refusal to disclose the affair with Neuman meant that it took detectives nearly two months to learn the motive for the killing at the upscale preschool - which rocked Atlanta's tight-knit Jewish population. Prosecutors said she repeatedly lied to investigators and also lied on the witness stand at Neuman's trial - denying the the two were having an affair and refusing to tell the truth about when she learned her husband had been shot. Sorted affair: Henny Neuman (left) was convicted in 2012 of murdering his lover Andrea Sneiderman's (right) husband. He claimed an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it . In August 2013, a jury convicted Sneiderman of nine of 13 counts. She after the conviction, she pleaded with the judge for leniency - arguing that her two small children needed their mother after their father was murdered. A judge sentenced her to five years in prison, but gave her credit for one year served on house arrest and in jail awaiting trial. A parole board further reduced the sentence to 22 months, with a year's credit for time served. Authorities say she walked out of Lee Arrendale State Prison at 12.22am on Monday.","Andrea Sneiderman was convicted of lying about her affair with her then-boss Henny Neuman .

The distressed pet was found wandering the streets yesterday morning by a woman as she drove to church in Crawley, West Sussex, with its face poking out of the open end of a Felix tin.

When that didn't work we used a tin opener on the other end so that the cut could see and then used a ring cutter to cut the cat out of it. ‘The cat was a bit scared with the tin on its head and was scratching a bit but seemed alright once we had got it out.’ Safe: The cat, which was found in the Pound Hill area of Crawley at 8am, is now at a nearby vet's in the hope of locating a microchip and reuniting the animal with its owners .

Scroll down for video . Sarah Jones, 29, is seen here with her former students and current fiancee Cody York, now 19 . Rise to fame: Sarah Jones, now 29, filed the lawsuit against thedirty.com in 2009 for comments left by anonymous users claiming she had sexually transmitted infections . She was married at the time, but left her husband and claimed in her defense that she and the teen, Cody York were in love. She struck a plea deal that kept her out of jail, but barred her from teaching for life. The posts at issue in the lawsuit were not related to the criminal case. Ms Jones and Mr York, now a 19-year-old Northern Kentucky University student, are engaged. In July, federal Judge William Bertelsman rejected arguments from Richie's attorneys that the publisher should be immune from lawsuit. A jury later found the posts about Jones were substantially false and that Richie had acted with malice or reckless disregard by publishing them, and awarded Jones $338,000. In Monday's ruling, a three-judge appeals panel said Bertelsman should have granted Richie immunity, citing the federal Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law that gives websites immunity from liability for content posted by users. Judges and courts across the country have upheld the law hundreds of times, including other lawsuits involving Richie's website. Bertelsman did the opposite, finding that the very name of Richie's website, the way he manages it and the personal comments he adds to many posts encourage offensive content. The 6th Circuit's decision reverses Bertelsman's ruling and means Jones does not get the $338,000 award. Nik Richie, the founder and owner of Arizona-based thedirty.com, has fought the ruling and said he didn't write the comments that said nasty things about Ms Jones . 'I feel like one of those lawyers who . has a client that just got out of death row from DNA and he's been . sitting there for 20 years and we find out he was innocent all along,' said Richie's attorney, David Gingras, from his office in Scottsdale, . Arizona. 'You're happy that he's out of jail but you're really not happy it took so long to get there.' Jones' Cincinnati attorney, Chris Roach, said he is planning to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. '(Richie) is using those basic editorial functions and the Communications Decency Act to get people to submit defamatory material so he can post it,' Roach said. 'That just doesn't go with the spirit of the law.' Richie's website allows users to submit anonymous posts about anyone from the girl next door to professional athletes and politicians, often accusing them of promiscuity, criticizing their plastic surgery or picking apart their looks. Richie screens each post, decides what goes up and frequently adds commentary. Jones, seen here leaving her criminal trial in July 2012, struck a deal after her arrest that allowed her to stay out of jail but barred her from teaching for life . Internet heavyweights and free speech advocates had filed court briefs blasting Bertelsman's decision and warning that it could chill speech. ""If websites are subject to liability for failing to remove third-party content whenever someone objects, they will be subject to the 'heckler's veto,' giving anyone who complains unfettered power to censor speech,"" according to joint briefs filed by lawyers for Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Amazon, Gawker and BuzzFeed, among others. Jack Greiner, a First Amendment attorney who represented many of the Internet companies, said Monday that ""the consequences could have been very problematic"" if Bertelsman's ruling stood. ""The concerns that Amazon and CNN and BuzzFeed and the other clients were as much as anything, to try to avoid the uncertainty that would have resulted,"" Greiner said. ""Say a conservative website says, 'If you've got dirt on Obama, send it in,' would that make that website the creator of that content (and liable)? Under the trial court's ruling I think it could.""","Sarah Jones had won $338,000 against Nik Richie and his site thedirty.com for comments submitted by anonymous users .

"Kabir Ahmed was the first person in the UK to be convicted of 'distributing threatening written material to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation' A British ISIS fighter in Syria who told BBC's Panorama programme he wanted to be a suicide bomber has been twice convicted for spreading hatred against gay people in the UK. Kabir Ahmed, of Normanton, Derby, who claimed to be called Abu Sumayyah on Panorama, was the first person in the UK to be convicted of 'distributing threatening written material to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation'. He told BBC reporters that he wanted to be 'put up the (suicide bomber) list'. Ahmed, 30, was sentenced to 15-month in February 2012 after a trial heard how he handed out leaflets outside a mosque showing a mannequin hanging from a tree next to the words 'Death Penalty?' in relation to gay people. During the trial, the court heard how the group's activities intimidated residents and left gay people frightened to walk on the streets. The first leaflet, entitled 'Death penalty?' proclaimed that 'Allah permits the destruction' of gay people and that 'the only question is how it should be carried out'. The second, entitled ‘Turn or Burn’, featured a burning figure in a blazing lake of fire and warned that the decriminalisation of homosexuality was 'the root of all problems'.A third, entitled 'GAY - God Abhors You', warned of 'severe punishment' for homosexuals. A fourth leaflet linked to the group, which was never distributed, described homosexuality as a 'vile, ugly, cancerous disease'. It referred to 'queer sinners' and 'faggots' and posed the question 'Gay Today, Paedophile Tomorrow?' Later the same year, while still in jail, he was convicted of holding up homophobic placards and chanting 'we hope you die of Aids' to revellers at Derby’s Gay Pride procession. Community leaders in Derby say Ahmed was a 'maverick' one-off who was probably radicalised outside Derby when he moved away to study. Police confirmed that Ahmed is the same person who now calls himself the ISIS fighter Abu Sumayyah. In a short Skype interview broadcast on BBC’s Panorama, Ahmed said: 'Everyone’s got their name on the list (to become a suicide bomber) and everyone is asking the Emir (leader) to push their name up. Everyone wants to fight for the sake of Allah.' It has been reported that he left his wife and three children in Derby a year ago and is currently at a training camp in Syria. Ahmed has changed his name to Abu Sumayyah and fights with ISIS (stock picture taken of ISIS fighters in Syria in June). He told BBC's Panorama: 'Everyone’s got their name on the list . (to become a suicide bomber) The Mirror claims Sumayyah spoke to a pro-ISIS internet station last month, telling them life with the group is 'better than that game Call of Duty'. A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said: 'Derbyshire Police believe that Abu Sumayyah, who has appeared in the media in recent weeks, is also known as Kabir Ahmed who previously lived in Derby. We are monitoring the situation.' In his Panorama interview, Ahmed claimed about 500 British men had joined ISIS. He said: 'If the British commits terror against our people, is unjust towards our people, kills, murders and rapes our people then you can expect attacks on your soil. If you support our enemies against us then you can expect these attacks, and so can America and so can any other country.' Leader of Derby City Council Ranjit Banwait, who grew up in Derby, said the council and police were working with community groups and schools on educating young people about the dangers of radicalisation. No one at both Ahmed’s family home in Derby and the house in the city he shared with his wife and child, were willing to comment.","Kabir Ahmed claimed to be called Abu Sumayyah on BBC's Panorama .

"A former Scientology chief has sensationally claimed the church brainwashed Tom Cruise’s children and turned them against the star’s ex-wife Nicole Kidman. Marty Rathbun, who worked at the secretive church for 27 years before leaving in 2004, said he believed officials used Scientology doctrine to turn the Oscar winner’s adopted children against her after she divorced Cruise in 2001. His comments could shed more light on Scientology - and just why Katie Holmes was so keen to win sole custody of her young daughter as she filed for divorce from Cruise recently. Claims: A former Scientology chief said the church brainwashed Tom Cruise's adopted children Isabella and Connor (right)  to turn them against his ex-wife Nicole Kidman (pictured left) Mr Rathbun claimed that he had counselled A list star Cruise, 50, in countless sessions that the church refers to as ‘auditing’ at the Scientology celebrity center in California. Mission Impossible star Cruise has two children that he adopted with Miss Kidman, daughter Isabella, now 19, and son Connor, now 17. And when the children were with the father they were left in the grip of Scientology staff, according to Mr Rathbun. Insider: Marty Rathbun worked at the secretive church for 27 years before leaving in 2004 . Mr Rathbun told NBC’s Rock Center with Brian Williams: ‘...they were being indoctrinated, and they were reporting to Tom on how that was going in my presence. He claimed that church officials told Isabella, then nine, and Connor, then six, that their mother was a ‘suppressive person’, which the church’s website, , defines as ‘a person who seeks to suppress other people in their vicinity.’ He said: ‘It was more than implied....[Kidman] was somebody that they shouldn’t open up with, they shouldn’t communicate with, and they shouldn’t spend much time with,’ The Scientology website reads: ‘A suppressive Person will goof up or vilify any effort to help anybody and particularly knife with violence anything calculated to make human beings more powerful or more intelligent. ‘The ‘suppressive person’ is also known as the ‘anti-social personality’. Within this category you would find ‘Napoleon, Hitler, the unrepentant killer and the drug lord,’ according to the website. Mr Rathbun also insisted that the Church of Scientology closely monitors the communication of high profile members and orders members to sever ties with suppressive people, particularly those who are critical of the church. He said: ‘That person could be your son, it could be your daughter, it could be your father, it could be your mother. It doesn’t matter.’ Speaking about the Cruise children, he said: ‘They were being steered toward and indoctrinated toward coming to the conclusion that Nicole was a suppressive person. In 2007, Miss Kidman admitted: ‘My kids don’t call me mummy,’ as she said they referred to her as Nicole - while Miss Holmes said the children had started calling her mum. Mr Rathbun's comments could shed more light on . Scientology - and just why Katie Holmes was so keen to win sole custody . of her young daughter as she filed for divorce from Cruise recently . In the centre: The controversial religion has played a huge part in the couple's split . The actress went on to have two young . daughters with her second husband, singer Keith Urban, but still . maintains a relationship with her adopted children, as Isabella said in . May: ‘I love mom. She’s my mom. She’s great. I see her sometimes and I . speak to her.” Miss Holmes, 33, and Cruise this week . agreed to the terms of a deal of a divorce whereby their six-year-old . daughter Suri will live with her mother in New York. In a thinly veiled comment on . Scientology, the couple released a shared statement that read: ‘We want . to keep matters affecting our family private and express our respect for . each other’s commitment to each of our respective beliefs and support . each other’s roles as parents.’ Miss Kidman’s publicist did not comment. While Cruise’s spokesman Bert Fields told . the NBC show that Mr Rathbun was not a reliable source, calling him ‘A . bitter ex-Scientologist who spends most of his time attacking . Scientology and using Tom Cruise’s name to get attention for his bigoted . diatribe. If he “audited” Mr Cruise, he is violating the privilege of . that position by discussing it.’ Claims: Cruise and Kidman pictured in 1992. According to Mr Rathbun, the church was trying to turn their children against her . Hurtful: In 2007, Miss Kidman admitted: 'My kids don't call me mummy', as she said they referred to her as Nicole . Fields added: ‘It is absolutely false that Mr Cruise, or anyone else to his knowledge, did or said anything to lessen Connor and Bella’s communication or relationship with their mother. On the contrary, Mr Cruise did all he could to encourage that relationship.’ In a letter to NBC News, Gary Soter, a lawyer for the Church of Scientology, wrote that Mr Rathbun was an unreliable source and a liar. Mr Soter described Mr Rathbun as ‘a defrocked ex-communicated apostate.’ When asked about the allegations against him, Mr Rathbun replied: ‘Then why was I assigned by the Chairman of the Board to audit Tom Cruise during the last four years of my involvement at the Church of Scientology?’","Marty Rathbun worked at the church for 27 years before leaving in 2004 .

"The prosecution rested their case yesterday by playing a shocking 'sex tape' to jurors, which left some of them in tears before Warren Jeffs opened his defence with a lecture on religion and history. The explosive end contrasted sharply with the slow pace of Jeffs' opening statement and four-hour questioning of one of his followers regarding Mormon history and scripture. As the 'sex tape' was played, jurors were seen covering their mouths in horror while some were seen wiping their eyes. The alleged 12-year-old victim was . mentioned by name twice on the 21-minute tape, in which Mr Jeffs can be . heard breathing heavily and panting. Leader: Warren Jeffs' (left) official title in the FLDS Church was President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator, before he was convicted of two felony counts of child sexual assault in 2011 . The recording was allegedly made at the . Yearning for Zion ranch in Texas, owned by the FLDS. It begins with . Jeffs asking the girl how she feels. According to the transcript made and given to the court, the girl replies: 'Feels good.' Soon after Jeffs can be heard saying: 'Everyone else let go of me, back away a little. Please get on the other side of the bed. 'You shall learn the powers of the . spirit of God as a heavenly wife should,' Jeffs tells the 12-year-old. 'Let the heavenly comfort hear us. 'We bless you, by the Lord, at this young age. To come to know God and his power, and feel his presence.' According to CNN, many jurors lowered their heads and closed their eyes during the recording. The voice is also heard saying: 'You have to know how to be sexually excited and to help each other ... and you have to be ready for the time I need your comfort. 'This is your mission. This is how you abide the law.' At one point, he says: 'Take your clothes off. Do it right now.' The sounds of crying followed as he then says: 'Just don't think about the pain, you're going to heaven. The world's view of sexual relations is selfish, the celestial view is not.' In another part of the recording he can be heard saying: 'Do you feel ... your servant ... fill them with the Holy Ghost ... deliver these ladies.' The male voice can also be heard saying: 'You will be able to come into the heavenly session ... and see heavenly visions, the angels, this shall make to come to know God in his power and feel his presence.' Documents show earlier said that a child of the alleged 15-year-old victim was conceived in a 'heavenly session'. Worship: Temple of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in El Dorado, Texas, where the 'heavenly sessions' with the young girls are said to have taken place . Seized property: Texas Ranger Nick Hanna moves a computer from the back of a truck with the rest of the evidence for the trial against Warren Jeffs . As the session ends, Jeffs begins to . pray, saying: 'Behold father these three ladies, innocent and pure. We . thank you for these gifts and join in a prayer of oneness.' He then asks the 12-year-old for a hug. Just before the tape ends, Mr Jeffs is heard saying, 'in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.' Three female voices then reply: 'Amen.' The tape was taken by police from the car Mr Jeffs was riding in when he was arrested in 2006. After his 30-minute opening statement, Jeffs called his first witness, . JD Roundy, a member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of . Latter Day Saints, who read passages from Mormon scripture under Jeffs' questioning. Warning: Judge Barbara Walther, who limps after suffering from polio, was told by Jeffs that God had sent 'a crippling disease upon her which shall take her life soon' During the four-hour questioning - . which was focused solely on scripture and mentioned nothing of the . sexual assault charges - jurors are said to have appeared impatient. Prosecutor Eric Nichols objected . several times, saying that neither man’s religious beliefs were relevant . to the sexual assault charges. Judge Barbara Walther let Jeffs . continue, but admonished him to stay on topic, saying: 'I don’t believe . the pursuit of your defence should be trying to lecture or teach the . jury about your religion.' The topics included the 'everlasting covenant' of plural marriage, and the idea of a living prophet who is the voice of God. Jeffs, the head of the . Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is accused . of sexually assaulting two girls, ages 12 and 15, that he took as brides in . 'spiritual marriages.' During his 30-minute long opening statement, Jeffs compared the plight of the FLDS church to that of the American Civil Rights Movement. 'There has been a persecuting zeal . against a religion seeking religious freedom,' he said. Jeffs said he . wants there to be understanding of his religion before judgement comes, according to the Salt lake Tribune. On Tuesday, another jaw-dropping . audio tape revealed the 55-year-old church leader instructing his sister . wives that they must 'work together' to please him sexually. Mr Jeffs, who is representing himself after firing his high-powered legal team, vehemently objected before both of the tapes were played, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Judge Barbara Walther overruled him each time. Tuesday's 90-minute segment details how the young brides should become 'so natural as clothed as unclothed' and always shower before getting near him. Mr Jeffs is also heard instructing the woman on how to maintain their pubic hair, and a woman is heard showing the other wives how to properly shave their armpits. He says on the tape: 'No one sits around, everyone assists each other.' This came after a doctor and forensic analyst testified Mr Jeffs was the father of a 15-year-old's child. An excerpt from hundreds of pages of his personal journals said the child was 'pure and innocent and . willing to obey' and he summoned her parents and 'informed them of their . girl belonging to me.' Prosecutors played the tape of Warren Jeffs . talking to the girl when she was 14 after Texas Ranger Nick . Hannah testified about documents and electronic files seized during a . 2008 police raid at the church's remote compound in West Texas. Among the documents seized was a record of Jeffs' spiritual marriage 'for time and all eternity' with the 14-year-old in January 2004. The FLDS church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. Followers see Jeffs as a prophet who is God's spokesman on earth. Open door: Jeffs gets into a waiting  vehicle as he leaves the Tom Green County Courthouse on Wednesday . 'No one sits around': Warren Jeffs is accused of child sexual assault and bigamy . Hannah read from Mr Jeffs' journals, which said he took the 14-year-old the night after their wedding with him and another of his new wives on a car ride outside the church's headquarters along the Utah-Arizona border for 'training.' In writing about the session in his . journal later, Jeffs said he told his wives they were 'honorable . vessels, property of your husband's kingdom and the Kingdom of God on . Earth.' Excerpts of Mr Jeffs' journal described the Lord ordering him to visit Eldorado, . Texas, about 45 miles south of San Angelo, and the church purchasing . 1,700 acres of land outside the town for $1.2 million in 2003. He called . the area 'Place of Refuge 17,' or R-17. 'This will only be a place of . refuge if it is kept sacred and secret,' Mr Jeffs wrote, adding that his . followers should populate the area and let 'a community grow here more . in hiding before the neighbors find out.' He told followers to plant cotton . and raise animals and said they could build whatever they wanted thanks . to Texas' lax zoning laws. Construction teams working around-the-clock . erected dozens of buildings, including a sprawling, white-limestone . temple. Texas authorities raided the . compound in April 2008 after receiving a call to an abuse hotline that . turned out to be a hoax. More than 400 FLDS children who were placed in . protective custody were eventually returned to their families. But police saw underage girls who . were clearly pregnant and found Jeffs' journals and the other documents . in a vault at the end of a secret passageway in the temple. Testifying: Former sect member Rebecca Musser, outside court yesterday, said the church teaches young girls that pleasing men . 'pleases God' Evidence: Texas Rangers move boxes of evidence for the trial at Tom Green County Courthouse in San Angelo, Texas . Another . vault in an annex building provided still more records and files. Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men were . charged with crimes including sexual assault and bigamy. So far, all . seven who have been prosecuted have been convicted — receiving prison . sentences of between six and 75 years. Mugshot: Jeffs after being arrested following the 2009 raid on his church . Gasps were heard among jurors earlier this week when pictures were revealed showing him kissing and . cuddling a 12-year-old girl. The photographs show Jeffs with a young . redhead, who he is alleged to have raped, grinning and kissing the . girl. The images were said to have been taken July 27, 2006 – days after the girl’s 12th . birthday. Authorities . raided the Yearning For Zion compound, 45 miles south of San Angelo, . after receiving an anonymous call to an abuse shelter, alleging that . girls at the compound were being forced into polygamist marriages. The . call turned out to be a hoax, and more than 400 children who had been . placed in state custody were returned to their families. But police seized marriage records and thousands of pages of documents and eventually charged Jeffs and 11 other FLDS men. All . seven sect members who have been prosecuted so far were convicted of . crimes including sexual assault and bigamy and received prison sentences . of between six and 75 years. Jeffs has repeatedly called the raid . an illegal search and wants a separate hearing on whether authorities . violated his First Amendment rights to freedom of religion.

"Elle McPherson: Tabata built this Body . Our inspirational fitness columnist Ruby Warrington reports from New York on the fitness and lifestyle trends that have transformed her life - and could do the same for you. A workout that delivers maximum results in the minimum amount of time is the Holy Grail of fitness in New York. Manhattanites want to stay in great shape, but they also need time for all that working and playing hard – which is why the 5.45pm Tabata class at my gym is always packed. This is how it works: for 20 seconds, do an exercise as fast and hard as you can. Rest for 20 seconds. Repeat eight times. Essentially, that’s it. Just four minutes of this patented protocol will burn as many calories as an hour on the treadmill. Now that’s what you call efficient. But in a class, you then go on to do this routine for a total of 45 minutes. SCIENCE MEETS FITNESS . It comes as little surprise to learn that this futuristic-sounding workout was actually developed in a lab. It is named after Dr Izumi Tabata, the Japanese professor of sports science who invented it. Back in 1997, Professor Tabata was working as an Olympic training coach for the Japanese speed-skating team when he began analysing the effectiveness of a training regime that involved rotating short bursts of maximum effort with short periods of rest. Prof Tabata soon hit on High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which he believes is the magic formula for increasing both aerobic (cardiovascular) and anaerobic (muscle) fitness levels. It breaks down as 20 seconds on, ten seconds off, repeated eight times, for a total of four minutes. NO PAIN NO GAIN . Back in class, this translates into a boot-camp atmosphere and lots of shouting from the teacher – because, in the words of Prof Tabata himself, ‘it has to feel extremely difficult for it to be working’. ‘You should be pushing yourself so hard you are NOT PHYSICALLY ABLE TO FINISH THE SET!!’ our teacher shrieks above the pounding techno soundtrack. The idea is that you go to your absolute . edge in any of the given exercises, which are all designed to raise your . heartbeat as much and as quickly as possible. Exhaustion rotation: Tabata sees you do an exercise as fast and hard as you can for 20 seconds, rest for 20, and then repeat eight times . This might mean a punishing round of ‘spicy burpees’ – where you crouch down, place your hands on the ground and jump back into a plank, before performing two push-ups, jumping back to your hands and springing up so your feet come off the floor – or a bout of ‘sumo jumping jacks’, where on each jump in and out you land in a static squat and hold it for one agonising beat. IT’S ONLY 20 SECONDS . It all sounds pretty terrifying, I admit. But actually, because you know you’ll get ten blissful seconds of rest for every 20 seconds of effort, it’s easy to stay motivated. Which isn’t to say I’m not always gasping for air – not to mention feeling light-headed and sometimes like I might actually be sick – within minutes of the class getting underway. Oh, and you sweat buckets. Elle Macpherson and new Superman actor Henry Cavill are already fans – and classes will be starting in the UK this year. If you want to do it at home, there are masses of YouTube videos featuring variations on the workout. Whether or not you’ll be motivated to push through each and every set without an actual live drill sergeant barking at you is another question, however. But don’t be scared to give it a try – after all, you can do anything for 20 seconds, right?",Fit in the City columnist Ruby Warrington tries Tabata workouts .
"Hundreds of Yazidi women being held prisoner by Islamic State fighters in Iraq are being sold off as brides for as little as $25 or repeatedly raped if they refuse, it has been claimed. Survivors  have told how beauticians were brought in to put makeup on the women before they were attacked, and said some victims were forced to call their families after to explain what had happened. According to those who escaped Badush Prison, in Mosul, northern Iraq, the number of women held there could be in the thousands and include Christians and Turkomens - a largely Muslim group closely related to the Turks. Scroll down for video . Survivors of Badush Prison, in Mosul, northern Iraq, have said women arriving there are given two choices: convert to Islam and be sold as a bride, or refuse and be raped (file pic) While most Yazidi women fleeing  Mount Sinjar are now in refugee camps such as this one, hundreds are said to be being held by IS in Mosul . Following the capture of Mosul by IS (formerly known as ISIS or ISIL) in June, troops stormed the prison, took 670 Shia inmates from their cells, and executed them inside the compound. Since then the jail has been used to house women captured by the Islamic militants during their campaign across Iraq, including many Yazidis who failed to escape from Mount Sinjar. Nearly half a million Yazidis, a minority religious sect, were displaced after IS militants overran their ancestral home of Sinjar and began executing people for being devil worshippers. According to Pakhshan Zangana, an official in The Kurdish Regional Government, women arriving at the jail are given two choices: convert to Islam and be sold off  for between $25 and $150, or refuse and be subjected to rape and slow death. She told The Daily Beast that one girl called her mother from inside the jail and described being raped by dozens of men in the space of just a few hours. Others have told how some women have given birth inside the jail, only to have the babies taken away hours later, never to see them again. Some of the victims are as young as 14. Zangana is now trying to raise money to buy the girls back, but without international aid she has been forced to turn to crowd-sourcing, promising people their money back if they help. Hundreds of Yazidis are still fleeing Mount Sinjar (pictured) and are at risk of being captured by IS . Some escaped prisoners have said that IS fighters ordered beauticians to come and put makeup on the women before they were either attacked or sold to new husbands . She said: 'It’s complete psychological warfare. These families are already destroyed by the loss of their loved one’s, and now ISIS has them calling to tell them of the atrocities they have suffered.' She added that the crisis did not just affect Iraq or the Yazidis, but was caused by international fighters joining IS from Chechnya in Russia, Britain and Holland. Meanwhile, across the border in Syria, IS today posted a graphic video which apparently showed Islamist soldiers executing around 250 Syrian troops. An Islamic State fighter claimed the men were from the Syrian government's Tabqa air base which extremists seized on Sunday, potentially handing them warplanes, tanks, artillery and ammunition. The airfield was the last government-controlled base in the Raqqa region, which is now solely under the control of IS fighters. Human Rights Watch described shocking video as evidence of 'another ISIS war crime'. US airstrikes in Iraq have helped to stop the IS advance across the country for now, but jihadi fighters have also managed to repel government attempts at a counter attack. Meanwhile in Syria IS fighters claimed to have executed 250 Syrian soldiers captured from Tabqa airbase which fell to the militants on Sunday .","Hundreds of Yazidi women captured by IS while trying to flee Mount Sinjar .

As revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday afternoon, it is understood  it is an anterior cruciate ligament injury to the left knee and Bojan has been ruled out for the rest of the season. He will undergo surgery, either in Staffordshire or in his native Catalonia. The time-span of his absence is estimated to be between five and six months. Sources close to his family told Sportsmail that Bojan was devastated and taken aback by the news on Tuesday afternoon after he had revitalised his career this season under Mark Hughes. Bojan, pictured celebrating after scoring the opener, is checked on by Marko Arnautovic after going down . Bojan celebrates the opening goal as Stoke took a firm grip on the FA Cup tie right from kick off . The player believes that he has been in the best form of the career and it feels a particularly wicked twist of fate after Bojan had finally discovered consistency in his performances and opportunities at a club. He had scored five goals in his last 10 games and has widely praised as one of the signings of the season. Stoke confirmed that Bojan will miss the remainder of the season on Tuesday evening. Manager Hughes said: 'It's bitterly disappointing for the club but even more so for Bojan himself as he was making such a big impact in the Premier League and clearly enjoying his football. We wish him a speedy recovery.'","Bojan Krkic went off injured in Stoke City's FA Cup win against Rochdale .

"If a time traveller went back in time and stopped their own grandparents from meeting, would they prevent their own birth? That’s the crux of an infamous theory known as the 'grandfather paradox', which is often said to mean time travel is impossible - but some researchers think otherwise. A group of scientists have simulated how time-travelling photons might behave, suggesting that, at the quantum level, the grandfather paradox could be resolved . Scroll down for video . Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia have discovered that two photons travelling through time can interact. In the simulation a photon stuck in a closed timelike curve (illustrated) through a wormhole was found to be capable of interacting with one travelling through regular space-time . The research was carried out by a team of researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia and their results are published in the journal Nature Communications. Space-time . can be warped and distorted. It takes an enormous amount of matter or . energy to create such distortions, but theoretically, distortions are . possible. In the case of a wormhole, a shortcut is made by warping the fabric of space-time. Imagine folding a piece of paper with two pencil marks drawn on it to . represent two points in space-time. The line between them shows the distance from one point to the other in normal space-time. If . the paper is now bent and folded over almost double - the equivalent to . warping space-time -  then poking the pencil through the paper provides . a much shorter way of linking the two points, in the same way a . wormhole would create a shortcut. The problem with using wormholes to travel in space or time is that they are inherently unstable.  When a particle enters a wormhole, it also creates fluctuations that cause the structure to collapse in on it. A recent study suggests there are unusual-shaped wormholes than may be able to stay open longer than normal. The study used photons - single particles of light - to simulate quantum particles travelling back through time. By studying their behaviour, the scientists revealed possible bizarre aspects of modern physics. In the simulation, the researchers examined two possible outcomes for a time-travelling photon. In the simulation, the researchers examined the behaviour of a photon traveling through time and interacting with its older self. In their experiment they made use of the closely related, fictitious, case where the photon travels through normal space-time and interacts with another photon that is stuck in a time-travelling loop through a wormhole, known as a closed timelike curve (CTC). Simulating the behaviour of this second photon, they were able to study the behaviour of the first - and the results show that consistent evolutions can be achieved when preparing the second photon in just the right way. By definition ‘quantum’ refers to the smallest possible particles that can independently exist - such as photons. However, for macroscopic systems time-travel still faces problematic paradoxes. In 1991 it was first predicted that time travel would be possible in the ‘quantum world’ because quantum particles behave almost outside the realms of physics. Wormholes are theoretical tunnels that create shortcuts in space-time. A study in May from Dr Luke Butcher at Cambridge University argued that if a thin wormhole stayed open long enough, people could send messages through time using pulses of light, or photons . 'The . properties of quantum particles are ""fuzzy"" or uncertain to start with, . so this gives them enough wiggle room to avoid inconsistent time travel . situations,' said professor Timothy Ralph, one of the researchers on the latest study. The results also give a better understand to how two theories in physics, on the biggest and smallest scales, are able to relate to one another. 'The question of time travel features at the interface between two of our most successful yet incompatible physical theories ' Einstein's general relativity and quantum mechanics,' said PhD student Martin Ringbauer from the University of Queensland. 'Einstein's theory describes the world at the very large scale of stars and galaxies, while quantum mechanics is an excellent description of the world at the very small scale of atoms and molecules.' Einstein's theory suggests the possibility of travelling backwards in time by following a space-time path that returns to the starting point in space but at an earlier time - a closed timelike curve (CTC). This possibility has puzzled physicists and philosophers alike since it was discovered by Austrian-American scientist Kurt Gödel in 1949, as it seems to cause paradoxes in the classical world. These include the 'grandparents paradox', where a time traveller could stop their grandparents from meeting, thus preventing the time traveller's birth. This would make it impossible for the time traveller to have set out in the first place. But this new research suggests that such interactions might indeed be possible - albeit only on a quantum level.","University of Queensland scientists simulate photons moving through time .

The yogic . principal of ‘darana’ – or concentration – is also employed throughout, . while Loren encourages the use of a mantra, a sacred word or phrase of . encouragement, to help you stay the distance. ‘A lot of the time it’s the mind that gives up before the body,’ she explains.

"A devastated son whose father was beheaded and his mother abducted a week ago today said he now hopes she is dead to ‘ease her suffering’ as it is too unbearable to think of her in pain. Retired Russell Dermond’s decapitated body was found at his exclusive, lake-front home last Tuesday, but his wife of 62 years Shirley has vanished, in a suspected kidnapping. Investigators in Putnam County, Georgia are completely baffled by the gruesome crime and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved elderly couple. Nothing was taken from their $1m home, their car keys and cellphones were left behind. Scroll down for video . Unspeakable: Shirley Dermond, 87, has not been seen for more than a week after her husband's decapitated body was found at their home. Their son, Keith, said: 'If she is still alive, we can’t imagine . what she is going through… but it . has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just . to ease her suffering' Mystery: No-one has been able to think of why anyone would want to harm Shirley and Russell. Nothing was taken, their cellphones and car keys were left behind. Police have ruled out a mob hit and that Russell was in witness protection. And their family they can't believe it is linked to the drug murder of son, Mark, in 2000 . The police have been forced to deny they were taken out in a mob hit and their despairing family have also denied their is any link between the horror and the killing of one of the couple's son's in a drug deal gone wrong. Officers have been dredging a nearby lake and searching woods for clues, but as yet the local Sheriff says they have no leads. They still haven’t found 88-year-old Mr Dermond’s severed head. One of the Dermond’s three heartbroken children, Keith said the family had been wracking their brains to try to come up with any possible motive, but they say their parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world. He is still desperate for the safe return of his 87-year-old mother, but the idea of her suffering at the hands of a, ‘sick’ murderer is just too much for him to bear. Speaking to MailOnline, Keith, 55, from Jacksonville, Florida, said: ‘We are completely devastated, but our primary focus is finding our mother. The thought of her suffering is just unbearable. ‘Each hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never know what happened. ‘If she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering. ‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’ Sick: Keith, pictured center left with wife Kathleen and other family members, said: 'The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them.' He added it could have been the work of a cult . Russell Dermond was last seen May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta. Shirley Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox.  That same day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s Kentucky Derby party. According to Putnam County Sheriff, Howard Sills, financial and phone records have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target of criminal activity. Since the murder speculation about a potential motive has been rife. Sheriff Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have been killed by mobsters. He has also said there is no evidence that the brutal crime was in some way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone wrong in 2000. Mark was gunned down in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. He was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied. And Keith says that while his brother Brad, his sister Leslie and him have considered a possible link between their brother’s slaying and their father’s murder, It just doesn’t make sense. Isolated: Keith reckons they may have been targeted not because of their wealth - as they have richer neighbors either side, but because they live at the end of a cul-de-sac with no other houses that close . Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman . He said: ‘People have tried to link this to my brother’s murder. We have obviously thought about that, because it is a violent connection to my parents, but that doesn’t make sense either. ‘The individual is still in jail and anyway, my parents weren’t really involved in the case at the time. They didn’t attend court, so if this was some kind of revenge, they would not be obvious targets. ‘It is a complete mystery as far as we are concerned. We have been wracking our brains trying to think of anyone who may have wanted to do this, but we have no idea. ‘My father hadn’t been in business for 20 years. He just spent his time relaxing and playing golf. He just didn’t have any enemies. ‘The more we think about it, the more it makes sense that this was just some sick individual who randomly targeted them. ‘My parents live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so they have no neighbors either side. Maybe that’s why they were targeted? ‘It could have been anything, something to do with a cult, we just don’t know. There were definitely people in that neighborhood who would be more obvious targets if it was a robbery. My parents were comfortable, but they definitely weren’t wealthy.’ Keith and his siblings initially flew to Georgia to try to help with the investigation, but they have not been allowed in the house - where many happy family parties were held over the years - because it is still a crime scene. Now they have returned home where they are playing an unbearable waiting game, desperately hoping for news about their mother one way or the other. And heartbreakingly, Sheriff Howard Sills has said he is not optimistic she’ll be found alive. Speaking on Tuesday, he said: ‘I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty.’ There was speculation that an elderly woman who turned up dazed and confused Monday at a Tampa hospital was Shirley Dermond, but that has been completely dismissed. Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party . And Sills said rumors of organized crime involvement are unfounded. He said: ‘No, the man wasn’t in witness protection. He wasn’t going to testify. There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.’ On Tuesday, they enlisted the aid of a Department of Natural Resources submarine robot to scour the deep peninsula off Lake Oconee outside the couple’s home. So far, they’ve turned up nothing. Sills said he had also dispatched deputies to a wooded area near the crime scene in the hope they would discover some kind of clue. Keith – who like his late father, manages a chain of restaurants - said: ‘The Sheriff is keeping us informed as much as he can. I spoke to him yesterday. He is holding back some information as it is important to the case. ‘The house is still a crime scene, they are looking for finger prints and dredging the lake, but there just doesn’t seem to be much in terms of leads.’ He added: ‘My parents were married for 62 years. Family was everything to them. Their happiest times were spent with us, that’s what they loved doing. We just pray someone who knows something comes forward and puts an end to all of this.’","Retired Russell Dermond’s headless torso was found at his exclusive, lake-front home last Tuesday .

"Geared up: Ruby Warrington wears a jacket, £200, and top, £75, both Hussein Chalayan for Puma at my-wardrobe.com . One of the first things I noticed when I moved to Manhattan was how many people walked around town in their gym kit at any given time of day. Before I arrived in New York, I had assumed that the city’s numerous bars, restaurants and art galleries would be populated entirely by couture-wearing Glamazons. How wrong I was. Yes, New York women are arguably the most groomed in the world when they need to be. But none seems to be deterred from turning up for casual post-work coffees in sportswear if they are heading to an exercise class afterwards. Many British women still suffer flashbacks to our school days when we had to suffer PE lessons in navy blue nylon knickers, and thus spent our adult lives working out in old kit until it disintegrates. In contrast, Americans are prepared to invest a lot more in their gear. Cult yoga label Lululemon is up there with Louis Vuitton on most women’s fashion wish-lists. And just the other day, I read on Twitter that Vera Wang, who is probably best known for show-stopping Oscar frocks and high-society wedding gowns, is getting in on the act with a fitnesswear line. Realising my ageing grey tracksuit bottoms would no longer pass muster, I decided to invest in some new fitness togs. And I discovered there is even an item of clothing here called the ‘To-and-From’ – as in you wear it to and from your workout session. It is a lightweight, zip-up jacket designed to be worn over your workout clothes, and it doubles up as a cosy running top for when temperatures plummet. I bought a black quilted, hooded version – and have been wearing it non-stop ever since. At a recent breakfast meeting with . some of the Lululemon staff, they were all dressed head-to-toe in the . brand’s comfortable and colourful creations – just for the office. But . the truth is these clothes are smart enough to wear wherever and . whenever you want. The same goes for lots of New Yorkers’ other . favourite fitness kit.

Casual: Ruby would would be just as likely to wear her 'To-and-From' jacket, £90, lululemon.com, for a run on a cold day as a skirt and biker boots for a leisurely brunch . When I wore my fluorescent orange Nike Free Runs to a show during New York Fashion Week last month, I could hardly keep count of the compliments I received. Perhaps that’s not altogether surprising really, when sporty looks have been all over the catwalks this year, from Isabel Marant’s hip wedge trainers to Alexander Wang’s famous sweater dresses. And then there are the designers collaborating with various sports brands, from Stella McCartney at Adidas to Alexander McQueen and Hussein Chalayan at Puma, to create some of the coolest pieces around. So now when I look around, I’m wondering if I got it all wrong. New Yorkers might all dress as if they’re en route to a sweaty session in the gym, but the chances are they’re making a fashion statement with their fitness outfits too.",Our columnist Ruby Warrington sports her pick of the designer workout gear wowing New York - and is on its way here .
"One of the victims of Friday's fiery hot air balloon crash was burned alive while the two others died of blunt force trauma, according to the medical examiner's office. The causes of death for the victims of the crash in Virginia on Friday were released ahead of a memorial service at the University of Richmond, where two victims worked, on Wednesday. The autopsy revealed that the university's director of basketball operations Natalie Lewis, 24, died of acute thermal injury - a term used to described severe burns, according to the News Journal. Associate head coach Ginny Doyle, 44, died of blunt force trauma to her neck and torso, while the pilot, Daniel Kirk, died of blunt force trauma to his head, torso and extremities, it found. Scroll down for video . Victims: Natalie Lewis, left, died of acute thermal injury in the balloon crash in Virginia on Friday, while her colleague at the University of Richmond, Ginny Doyle, right, died of blunt force trauma . The report added that the deaths were accidental. Funeral services for Kirk will be held at 1pm on Saturday at the Hartly United Methodist Church in Hartly, followed by a reception at the Hartly Volunteer Fire Company. At 10am on Wednesday, the University of Richmond held a public memorial for Doyle and Lewis at the Cannon Memorial Chapel, days after students paid tribute to them at graduation ceremonies. The balloon was among 13 that lifted off Friday on a preview night for the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival. It left Meadow Event Park and headed northeast to a landing zone two miles from the park. 'Experienced': Pilot Daniel Kirk, pictured left and right, also died of blunt force trauma, the autopsy found . Terrifying: The balloon hit a power line as it tried to land on Friday and burst into flames, killing its occupants . Horror: At some point, the basket detached from the balloon and the bodies were found in a wooded area . As others landed safely, it struck a power line, burst into flames and fell into a heavily wooded area about 25 miles north of Richmond, said Corrine Geller, with Virginia State Police. On the ground, 'it was complete silence,' spectator Nancy Johnson said. 'There were people praying. It was horrible.' Corinne Geller said another pilot interviewed by investigators described how the pilot tried to open vents to release extra-hot air in an attempt to keep the balloon from rising faster. At one point, the balloon and its basket separated and the balloon took off, state police said. 'Based on witness accounts, he did everything he could to try to save the passengers' lives,' Geller said. She added that it may never be known if the victims jumped or fell out as the basket and balloon came apart. Excitement: Lewis and Doyle are pictured on the morning of their flight on a test run with a different pilot . Loss: The women were remembered at a memorial service at the university on Wednesday morning . The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating. Doyle, 44, was hired by Bob Foley at Richmond in 1999 and stayed on through coaching changes. Lewis, . 24, was a four-year letter-winner in swimming who just completed her . second season with the basketball program. Her job required organization . skills as she made travel, hotel and bus arrangements for the team, . planned for meals and handled day-to-day basketball business. In the grind of a season, broadcaster Matt Smith said, she was a shining light. 'Sometimes when you work in sports, coaches can be so high strung and so focused on the next game or what's going on that you feel almost uncomfortable when you go into the office, but her being the first one that you would see, she always had a smile on her face,' Smith said. The University of Richmond on Monday released statements from the women's families expressing thanks for the support they've received. Loved: Student Laura Jordan wore a red ribbon with her hat decorated with initials of Natalie Lewis and Ginny Doyle before the University of Richmond's Commencement Ceremony on May 11 . 'Natalie loved people. She was our constant source of happiness and joy,' Lewis' family said in the statement. 'She used genuine words and selfless actions to gently help others be more successful and more fulfilled.' Doyle's family recalled Ginny as a 'daughter, sister, aunt, cousin, niece, athlete, teammate, coach, teacher, colleague, friend and storyteller' who 'touched the lives of many and lived life to the fullest.' Kirk, of Delaware, was known by fellow pilots as 'Capt. Kirk,' the hammy commander of the USS Enterprise on the TV series Star Trek. Steve Hoffmann, who said he taught Kirk to fly and built the balloon he was piloting, called him 'one of the nicest guys in the world' and a consummate professional. 'He was not a hot dog, not a risk taker,' Hoffmann said.

"Our inspirational fitness columnist Ruby Warrington reports from New York on the fitness and lifestyle trends that have transformed her life . . .  and could do the same for you: . Fit in the City: Columnist Ruby Warrington has found a workout companion . When I met Francesca, I thought she was fabulous. Another British expat in New York, she was funny, intelligent and extremely well-connected – her ex-husband owns one of the coolest nightclubs in the city. Over lunch at a fashionable Mexican diner in SoHo, we chatted away like old friends, bonding over everything from our love of Heinz Baked Beans to our favourite jeans – and discovered a shared obsession with Leandro Carvalho’s Brazilian Butt Lift Workout DVD. He trains the Victoria’s Secret models and I’d recently interviewed him for a newspaper article. We were both after a way to target our pear-shaped British bottoms, or ‘boom-boom’, as Leandro refers to it (this is funny, not creepy – honestly). Before I knew it, we were scheduling a workout date at one of his classes and I was wondering what one wore to such a thing. My very best spandex leggings? Should I do my hair? And then I realised: I had made my first FFF. Don’t LOL. For those not au fait with text acronyms, it means fitness friends forever – a play on BFF, or best friend forever. We’ve all heard about love, or at least lust, blossoming on the gym floor. But this is different. Bromances and girl crushes are burgeoning all over New York, based on a shared passion for exercise. The term FFF was coined by Amanda Freeman, creator of a yoga-fusion workout called SLT (Strength, Lengthen, Tone), when she heard that two regulars at her Upper West Side studio had ended up in a Hamptons house-share together last summer. ‘Their relationship began in class, as they attended the 6.30pm session together four times a week,’ she says. ‘Before long they were hanging out on Facebook, and the last I heard they went on holiday together at Christmas.’ It may sound rather toe-curling to us reserved British, but there’s plenty of research that shows working out with friends makes exercise more enjoyable and effective. Not only do we produce more feelgood endorphins, we’re more likely to show up for class once we’ve committed to being there with a buddy. Research last year showed that if your friends are overweight, it’s likely you’ll find it harder to shift the pounds, too. Virgin Active claim a third of their members exercise with a partner, mainly because it makes them work harder, and the gym chain is introducing group personal training this year – so FFFs make financial sense too. In New York, where working out often . takes priority over socialising, the gym is a place to forge new . relationships. If you meet people at a class, you’re likely to have . certain personality traits in common. And, once you have a regular . routine, you don’t have to worry about scheduling get-togethers. ‘Friends who always take the same class together will go off for brunch . straight after,’ says Amanda. Motivation: Ruby, right, on a night out on the town in New York having fun with her new FFF, Francesca . I have another FFF, Kate, who approached me to be her personal Mrs Motivator when she heard I was writing about fitness. Most of our bonding has been done in our favourite boutiques on the Lower East Side and over bottles of sauvignon blanc in trendy bars in the Meatpacking District. But she said recently: ‘I need to get in shape. Can we provide each other with a bit of moral support as we try to get our acts together? Even if it’s just checking in on Facebook every now and then?’ So we’ve agreed to commit to doing some physical exercise every day and report back with any funny stories along the way: like the woman who lets her dog run beside her on the treadmill at the gym in Kate’s building, or the mother and daughter wearing full make-up in my Bikram yoga class, only to sweat it all off by the end. Social media is another great way to find FFFs. If you are worried that striking up a conversation with a stranger after class might seem desperate or a bit stalker-ish, the internet offers safer, neutral ground. I know people who will simply tweet when they are looking for a jogging partner that weekend, and on fitness websites such as zest.co.uk there are forums dedicated to helping people find training buddies. There is a Facebook group for just about every type of exercise, from bodybuilding to marathon training (especially at this time of year). I found my latest FFF on Twitter. When I tweeted that I was planning to start the 30-day Bikram challenge last week (where you do a class every day for 30 days straight), an old friend in London decided to take up the challenge. You can keep up with our progress on Twitter using the hash tag #fitinthecity. Or why not join us, wherever you are in the world? As for my Brazilian Butt Lift sessions with Francesca, we have yet to make it happen. But in the meantime, she’s invited me on a yoga weekend in the Hamptons with a gang of her equally fabulous friends. Where do I sign up?

"A former Montana Catholic school teacher who was fired for being pregnant and unmarried is suing the school district. Shaela Evenson, who gave birth to a boy in March, filed the lawsuit Thursday alleging the firing violated federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination based on pregnancy, the Montana Standard reported. She had taught literature and physical education at Butte Central Catholic Schools for grades 6 through 8 for nine years until she was fired in January. At the time, Superintendent Patrick Haggarty said that Evenson had ‘made a willful decision to violate the terms of her contract,’ which requires her to respect the moral and religious teachings of the Catholic Church in both her professional and personal life. Shaela Evenson (left pregnant and . right with her partner Marilyn Tobin) has filed a lasuit against the Montana catholic school that fired her in January for being pregnant and . unmarried . ‘The Catholic moral teaching is that the sacrament of marriage is a holy union between a man and a woman,’ Haggarty said. ‘And we certainly believe and we teach our children who attend our schools about the sacrament of marriage,' he added. 'That's as old as our church. 'Not only do we teach that to the children kindergarten through 12th grade, but we're held to that standard as well.’ Schools officials began to look into Evenson in January, after the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena received a letter about her pregnancy. Her boss, Principal Kerrie Hellyer, said Evenson 'was an excellent teacher.' Evenson, who is not Catholic herself, became pregnant through artificial insemination and gave birth to a boy on March 7, the first child for Evenson and her partner, Marilyn Tobin. Evenson (right) and Tobin (left) welcomed their baby boy on March 7 . Her attorney, Brian Butler of Ohio, filed a discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier this month. He argued an employer can't require employees to waive their rights under anti-discrimination laws — including a woman's right to bear children. Schools officials denied the firing had anything to do with Evenson being in a same-sex relationship. 'They told her she was fired for being pregnant and unmarried,' Butler said. 'Nobody was hiding anything. (Shaela) never denied the fact that she’s in a relationship with Marilyn.' Evenson's attorney won a $170,000 jury award in a similar case in Ohio. Officials at Butte Central Elementary School say Evenson was dismissed after nine years of teaching because she didn't follow the church's teachings .","Shaela Evenson was fired in January after becoming pregnant through artificial insemination .

"Revealed: Just 77 out of 7,963 allegations of racism made against the police have been upheld since 2005 . Less than one per cent of racism complaints are upheld against the police, new figures reveal. Out of 7,963 allegations levelled against forces in England and Wales, just 77 have been followed through since 2005. And 43 officers singled out for their alleged discrimination have not been disciplined. The revelations, uncovered by a Channel 4 Dispatches programme using Freedom of Information requests, will cast doubts over the police's repeated pledges to rid the force of racism. The Metropolitan Police, Britain’s largest force, upheld just 20 out of 4,730 allegations of racism (0.4 per cent) between 2005 and 2012. Greater Manchester, North Yorkshire and Lancashire upheld none of the allegations reported to them at all. It is a damning account of police activity over the past decade despite numerous pledges to stamp out racism. Since 1999, and the release of the Macpherson report exposing institutional racism in the Metropolitan Police Force, bosses have repeatedly vowed to tackle the issue as a priority. But . when presented with the new figures, Dame Anne Owers, chair of watchdog . the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), admitted the force . was failing to act on complaints. She told the programme: 'What we’ve found when we’ve dug into the way that forces handle complaints of race discrimination and indeed discrimination in general is that they don’t do it well and the evidence seems to be that those complaints are less likely to be upheld than other kinds of complaints.' Stephen Lawrence's brother, Stuart, condemned the statistics more than 20 years after the racist murder, which sparked the Macpherson report. Calling for serious action to be taken, he tells the documentary how his complaint was upheld by the Independent Police Complaints Commission - only to be dismissed by the police themselves. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Action: Stuart Lawrence (left) tells how his racism complaint was upheld by the IPCC but dismissed by the police. He urges the watchdog to take action 21 years after the racist murder of his brother Stephen (right) Mike Cunningham, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: 'There is no place for racism in the police service. 'That is a fundamental requirement of being a member of the British police service and if an officer fails short of those high expectations... they ought to be dismissed.' Since filming the programme, due to screen tonight, three police officers in England and Wales have been dismissed. One of the officers who was accused in a civil court of taking part is still employed by the police, according to Dispatches.","Figures reveal just 77 out of 7,963 allegations follow through in 2005-12 .

"If you’ve ever found yourself browsing for online bargains in the middle of the night then don’t worry, you’re not alone. Because according to John Lewis, Britain’s 24-hour culture has created a new breed of ‘inshopniacs’, with the store reporting a 31 per cent surge in the number of people shopping online during the small hours. The retailer has found that an increasing number of parents kept awake by a crying baby, late-night gamers and shift workers are shopping online after dark. The trend was revealed in their How We Shop, Live & Look report, which charts changes in spending habits over the past year using data from its stores and website. It shows how major events shaped which products became bestsellers. In came lap trays, the sort used by families eating in front of the TV on Channel 4’s Gogglebox series, while the Prince George effect started a trend for children’s sailor suits. The wet winter prompted a surge in searches for wellies, while the spring heatwave led to a run on barbecues. On their way out in 2014 were adult onesies, napkin rings and black socks, in favour of pink socks – a change apparently inspired by the Wolf of Wall Street. Changes in technology also saw the demise of camcorders and photo albums as people use their phones to record videos and store images on their computer hard drives or Apple’s ‘cloud’. And it seems those who are struggling to get to sleep have given up on counting sheep and are using their smartphones or tablets to go shopping instead. The managing director at John Lewis, Andy Street, said: ‘Sales through our website between the hours of midnight and 6am have increased by 31 per cent over the past year, thanks in no small part to the fact that more customers are choosing to do their shopping using a smartphone or tablet.’ He went on to say: ‘The change also reflects the need for instant gratification. For example, late-night gamers who might be sitting up at 1am are no longer thinking about buying something when they go into town in two days’ time. ‘Instead they look to buy things online, there and then. And we see that parents who have woken up at some unearthly hour thinking I need that for my son or daughter. When they can’t get back to sleep, they just go online and order it.’ The report also revealed that Sunday is the busiest day of the week for purchases on the John Lewis website. Mr Street said: ‘You are seeing families spending the weekend thinking over what they might buy and then sitting down with their iPad on Sunday evening and making the commitment.’","John Lewis says Britain’s 24-hour culture has created ‘inshopniacs’

"Rejected: Suspected mass-murderer James Holmes, 24, was rejected from joining a Colorado gun club just weeks before his horrific shooting spree . Suspected mass-murderer James Holmes was rejected from joining a Colorado gun club just weeks before his horrific shooting spree, because the message on his answering machine was 'bizarre and freaky'. The 24-year-old who killed 12 people and injured scores more when he opened fire at a midnight screening of 'The Dark Knight Rises' on Friday, applied for membership to the Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 but owner Glenn Rotkovich banned the man from the club after being unnerved by his 'incoherent, rambling' message. 'I called to see if he could come down for an orientation and I got his answering machine and the message was just bizarre, freaky,' Mr Rotkovich told MailOnline. 'I thought it was weird and strange. I called a couple more times and then decided not to call again because of the nature of his answering message. 'I gave my staff his name - James Holmes - and told everyone here to get me if he shows up at the range. I wanted to know who he was before we considered doing anything with him, let alone make him a member. He was flagged.' MailOnline got hold of the application form that Holmes sent through to the Range, which detailed his residential address, email address, his marital status as single and birthday. It also lists his mother, Arlene, as his emergency contact. Mr Rotkovich said he initially thought the gunman was drunk on the answering message because he was slurring his words, but on subsequent listens realised the creepy voice was deliberate. Application form: James Holmes submitted the application form, pictured, to become a member at Lead Valley Range on June 25 . Sinister: The range's owner had misgivings about allowing Holmes, pictured, to become a member . 'The message was guttural, spoken with a deep voice, incoherent and rambling,' he said. 'I could make out that he said his name was James but not a lot else. On first listen I thought he might have been drunk but after I'd heard it a few more times I realised it was deliberate. He meant it to sound that way.' Mr Rotkovich called Holmes on June 26, 27 and 28 but the unemployed student never got back to him or showed up at the range, which has just over 400 members. Gun club: Lead Valley Range, pictured, in Byers, Colorado rejected the gunman because of his sinister answering message . Weapons of choice: He had a Colt AR-15 Tactical Carbine and .40 caliber glock handgun (file pictures) Power: He also had a Remington 870 Marine Magnum (pictured) with him, and another glock in his car . The chilling encounter came back to Mr Rotkovich after one of his staff members recognised the man's name on Friday morning. Then other pieces of the puzzle fell into place. 'They said 'remember that guy you told us about, James Holmes? I wonder if he's the one who did the shooting?' he said. 'I . pulled up the application and as I did the reporter was already . standing at the apartment, which matched the address on the form in . front of me. 'That . was the first coincident. Then I looked at the emergency contact number . and he had put his mother Arlene in San Diego. At that point, I knew it . was him. Range: Staff at Lead Valley Range, which has just over 400 members, recognised James Holmes' name on Friday as news of the chilling massacre spread . Orientation: Mr Rotkovich of the Lead Valley Range, pictured, was unnerved by the phone message . 'I thought 'OK, that is who he is'. Thank God that God kept him away from us.' The killer dyed his hair red, wore full body armor and a gas mask, carried an assault rifle, shotgun, two handguns and, after being arrested in the parking lot, told cops he was the Joker, according to police. Holmes had been receiving packages and deliveries of weapons and ammunition for months as he planned the deadly attack.","Applied to become a member at Lead Valley Range in Byers on June 25 .

"A Brooklyn man who spent 24 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of murder plans to sue the city for $162 million. Jonathan Fleming's lawyers told the New York Post that the hope was for the city to quickly settle the suit. Attorney Taylor Koss said that was a reasonable expectation given the city's history with suits like the one from David Ranta, who spent 23 years in prison after he was wrongfully convicted of murdering a rabbi. Jonathan Fleming, who was exonerated of murder after almost 25 years behind bars, has filed suit against the city for $162 million . Both Ranta and Fleming's cases occurred on the watch of Charles Hynes, Brooklyn's former district attorney. Ranta got $6.4 million in a settlement from the city two months after filing suit for $150 million. In Fleming's case, the 51-year-old was finally set free after prosecutors admitted they had a receipt placing Fleming at a Florida hotel not far from Disney World at the time of the 1989 murder of Darryl Rush in Williamsburg. Jonathan Fleming hugs attorney Anthony Mayol while his other attorney Taylor Koss applauds in Brooklyn's Supreme court, after a judge declared him a free man . He was convicted that year and spent the following 24 years and 8 months incarcerated.

"Neymar carries the hopes of the Brazilian nation on his shoulders — and is delivering some sublime football. Ahead of Brazil’s game against Chile, Sportsmail publishes a fascinating extract from his autobiography in which Neymar, 22, and his father chart the rise of a boy the family call Juninho. VIDEO Scroll down to watch World Cup poster-boy Neymar produce an outrageous skill . National icon: Neymar is leading Brazil's World Cup charge as the poster boy of the tournament . THE DAY I FEARED HE'D DIED . (by his father, Neymar Snr) IN June 1992, four months after the birth of my son, we went to Santos to visit some relatives. I had played for Uniao FC on that day. I was driving with my wife Nadine at my side and our son Juninho was sleeping soundly, strapped to the baby seat at the back of my red car. Driving down the mountain on a rainy day is always dangerous — especially on a road with a single lane and  two-way traffic. A car came in our direction. I swerved to the left. The other car crashed into us and went through my door. My left leg ended up above my right leg. My pubis and pelvis dislocated. I was in shock and yelled to my wife ‘I’m dying, I’m dying’. It all happened very fast and confusion settled in. The feeling that came next was even worse than pain and fear: Where was my son? Me and my wife couldn’t find Neymar Jnr. I thought he had been thrown out of the car. We were almost certain we had lost our son. In the middle of the despair and with the pain in my pelvis, I can only remember  praying to God to take me instead of my son. The car stopped on a cliff. There was a stream below. We were hanging just above it. Nadine had to get out through the back window. I was trapped by the seatbelt. Juninho was missing. The people who came to our rescue found Juninho under the back seat. Thank God! When they took him out, he was covered in blood and taken to a hospital. All that blood was from a small cut in his head made by a shard of glass. Lucky to be here: Neymar's father feared his son was dead just four months into his life after a car crash . Firepower: Neymar curls a freekick towards goal as he limbers up ahead of the knockout stages . Quiet reflection: Brazil's talisman takes  a moment out from the session, hidden behind a static 5-man wall . Samba magic: Neymar has scored four goals at this World Cup to fire Brazil into the last 16 . SNUBBING CHELSEA . IT was August 23, 2010. My father and I had a meeting with president Luis Álvaro at the Santos headquarters, inside the Vila Belmiro. Chelsea had made a huge transfer bid. In the middle of our conversation, the president turned off the lights and pointed at an empty chair. ‘This is the chair of the great national sports hero. Since Ayrton Senna’s death, this chair is vacant. If Neymar Jnr stays in Santos and refuses Chelsea’s proposal, he will give his first step to sit in this chair.’ That made us think. That decision would be a turning point in my life. Even Pele called me. Can you imagine how important I felt? The King of Football called and asked me to stay. He reminded me of his entire career with Santos, his five world titles with the national team and the club, and all the recognition he received. It wasn’t easy but it was the right decision for us. We did the right thing for our family, friends and my career. Call from the top: A call from Pele, considered the greatest ever player, stopped Neymar joining Chelsea . Praise: Neymar celebrates a goal for Brazil - a year after leaving home club Santos for Barcelona . Master ball: Neymar stands over one of eight Brazuca balls - a tactic which could help him to the Golden Boot . Man of many talents: Neymar leaps to head a ball towards goal in training . HIS JOY CAME BEFORE CASH . (by Neymar’s father) When Neymar Jnr was 13 years old, my son and I went on a plane for the very first time. We spent 19 days in Spain. Real Madrid made a proposal similar to what Barcelona had made with Messi when he was a kid. They would take Neymar Jnr to Madrid and he would grow up in Spain, as a man and athlete. The payment was very good — and he was just a teenager! After 19 days, he scored 27 goals at the training sessions. Within the first three days, we had agreed on everything. The contract was written. Juninho and his sister, Rafaela, were to receive scholarships. The only thing missing was his mother’s signature. Nadine had a ticket to go to Europe with me and Juninho, but preferred to stay at home with our daughter. After less than a week, Juninho didn’t seem well. He started to feel homesick. He missed our family, our friends, his school, his city and Santos. He missed everything. The food was all right, but we really wanted to eat our good old rice and beans. No money can pay for that. I saw Neymar Jnr become sadder each day that passed. Even with everything Madrid were doing for us, I felt the moment wasn’t right. And Juninho agreed. So, we decided to fly back to Santos. I didn’t care we were abdicating from so much money. All I wanted was for him to continue to play with joy. And there was no joy on those days. No money could ever change that. All pays off: Neymar is now the hero of millions as Brazil seek to win the World Cup on home soil . Full package: Brazil's number 10 has four goals so far, making him this World Cup's joint top goalscorer . All smiles: Neymar during his Santos days - in 2012 - before the young striker's big move to Barcelona . TRAINING TO IMPROVISE . Improvising is essential in football. I learned this early in life. You might have some play in mind and train for that a lot. But it’s in the heat of the game that you’ll know if it works or not. The secret is that it’s possible to ‘train’ how to improvise. How many times did I do that at home? I used to get the ball, set up the furniture and go around dribbling anything that popped up in front of me. That’s how I spent my childhood at my grandfather’s house, where I lived with my parents. We shared a small room: me, my sister and my parents. From the door, there was a mattress to the left, where we all slept. In front of the mattress there was a trunk and a wardrobe. There was a small space between the mattress and the  wardrobe and it was in this narrow corridor that I used to play with the ball. I used to love to kick the ball around there and also liked to throw myself at the mattress as a goalie. My cousins also played. I mean — they were part of the game. Jennifer was one of the goalposts. Rafaela, my  sister, was one of the posts for a long time. Lorrayne and Rayssa were the opponents (actually, more like training dummies, with all due respect). They stood as obstacles and sometimes even wore sports jerseys so I could pretend it was a real match. Later, at the little house my father was able to build, the ‘pitch’ was very simple. One of the goals was on the back door. I played, narrated and cheered. ‘And then Neymar scored! Neymarzinho!’ Me! I miss all that. There were even ‘fouls’. When I  dribbled and hit the sofa, I  complained to the imaginary  referee. But I played like it was for real. The other day, I did a photo shoot for an ad campaign. When we finished, I asked for the ball we used. I went to the elevators doing freestyle ‘kick ups’. I continued for the whole trip down. At the lobby, a couple of kids asked for autographs. After a few pictures I continued to play with the ball all the way to my car. I’ll tell you, I can’t live without the ball. Looking up: Arguably only Pele and Garrincha now stand ahead of Neymar in the list of Brazilian greats . Mixing it up: Bernard can't quite get to the ball quick enough ahead of the nimble-footed Neymar . Poise: Neymar readies himself to score Brazil's opening goal against Cameroon in their 4-1 World Cup victory . MOBBED AT THE SHOPS . I realised things had changed on a Tuesday afternoon, right at the beginning of my career in 2010, when I left after a training session. I decided to go to the mall to buy a music player. I parked my car and, when I stepped out, there were about 10 people asking for autographs and pictures. I started to give the autographs and a big line formed at the parking lot. Suddenly, it was a real crowd. I thanked everyone, put my cap on and entered the mall fast. But people followed me. When I entered the store,  a full commotion was formed. The mall security and the manager had to  create a security operation. I don’t even know how I got out of there. At first, I didn’t understand all that. It was a bit scary. Some girls would cry so much when they saw me. And there were a lot of kids with the hairstyle I had. All this affection is rewarding, but it did scare me.

"I wrote my first column for this newspaper last January, inspired  by a year of New York City life that had transformed my body. Despite eating out in restaurants most nights, at 36 I found myself in the best shape ever. After all, working out is a way of life in Manhattan, where the city’s thrusting, competitive spirit means not having a six-pack is a sign you’ve seriously let yourself go, and where people spend as much on gym kit as on designer handbags. I discovered FFFs – Fitness Friends Forever – to inspire me along the way; I kitted myself out  in trendy Lululemon gear (the cult US line that launches in the UK  this spring); I discovered online workouts that were tougher than any personal training session; and  I even put myself on a ‘juice fast’ – the craze for surviving on cold-pressed greens for days at a time that’s still sweeping the city. Healthy life: Fit in The City columnist Ruby Warrington has found a new and healthy lifestyle since moving to Manhattan . But one report in particular paved the way for the next phase of my New York fitness journey. In June, I wrote about a class called IntenSati, my latest workout obsession, which combined a vigorous cardio workout with spoken affirmations and a mini sermon on the power of positive thinking from the programme’s creator, Patricia Moreno. In class, Patricia talked about how mind and body are one, and of the importance of practising positive self-talk – using phrases beginning with ‘I can’ and ‘I am’ – if we want to make our dreams a reality. It’s a message I started  to hear everywhere as I began tapping into a whole other side to the city’s wellness scene – where  I have found a more spiritual approach to health and fitness. And once again, at the start of another year,  I feel transformed. Feeling fit used to be all about the physical for me, but I now understand that true wellbeing – that is, a healthy and happy mind, body and soul – is about a holistic approach. After discovering IntenSati, I wrote about what I described as my ‘yogic awakening’ – having embraced the ancient practice at a yoga festival in Vermont with very emotional results. This showed me in no uncertain terms how the mind and body truly are linked, and since then I’ve been working on this side of my health as hard as I used to work on my abs. Way to wellness: Ruby has found inner peace (stock image) This has meant regular meditation, increasingly proven by scientists as a way to reduce stress and tackle a range of ailments, from insomnia to high blood pressure. It’s been a way to start listening to what my body really needs – from what workouts I do, to the food I eat. This is one of the key messages in Deepak Chopra’s new book, What Are You Hungry For?, aimed at tackling the huge problem of weight control in the US. He describes ‘awareness eating’, saying there is a groundswell of people choosing to eat less meat, and cut out sugar, dairy, gluten and processed foods – not because we’re turning into a population of anxious do-gooders, but because people are starting to realise that eating this way makes you feel better and that, once you feel better, it’s easier to make healthier choices in all areas of life. It’s a message that the flower power brigade peddled 50 years ago, and which science and mainstream society are finally catching up with. In New York, I’ve found myself surrounded by high achieving ‘type-A’ individuals who all embody the concept, believing  that looking good and feeling good are intrinsically linked, and I’m happy to say I’ve fully embraced my inner hippie too. As well as yoga and meditation,  I follow a mainly vegan diet, have massively cut down on the amount of alcohol I drink, go for regular energy healing sessions and even visited a shaman to have my chakras realigned recently. The results? I can honestly say I’ve never felt healthier or happier. My outlook on life is the most positive it’s been in years, which I can directly attribute to beginning to think of fitness as looking after every aspect of my overall wellbeing. I’ve even started my own website, thenuminous.net, which covers all areas of what I like to call ‘now age thinking’ when it comes to health and wellness. And I’m not alone. A whole tribe of trendy wellness bloggers has emerged, with names such as Food Babe, Healthy Crush and Granola Glamour. These sites are run by hip, switched-on New York women  who might have been writing about fashion in another life, and through their eyes things like checking food labels for chemicals and whipping up raw, vegan, gluten-free desserts seem aspirational and cool. It’s just another part of Deepak Chopra’s groundswell movement towards the holistic mind-body wellness approach that I believe will shape fitness in 2014.",Columnist Ruby Warrington on her new 'hippy' life of wellness .
"Upset: Taki Theodoracopulos was thrown out of Claridge's in Mayfair . One of Britain's most exclusive hotels has been accused of throwing out a visitor - for being white and English. Claridge’s in Mayfair, central London, has been a favourite venue for the rich and famous and is often referred to as 'an extension of Buckingham Palace'. But socialite and writer Taki Theodoracopulos has accused the establishment of favouring rich Arabs who spend frivolously over British aristocrats. Theodoracopulos said that he was with a group of friends at the hotel's bar when he was asked to leave because the staff 'were hoping for Gulf people'. 'We were neither drunk nor obstreperous but we were refused a table although the place was less than one third full,' Theodoracopulos wrote in his Spectator magazine High Life column. Theodoracopulos said that he had dined nearby with his group of friends, including the Marquess of Worcester and his brother Lord John Somerset. The 74-year-old Greek-born writer said that he wanted a table but was asked to leave. Theodoracopulos, who has homes in London, New York and Switzerland, is demanding an apology and calling for a boycott of the venue. 'Harry Worcester had the brilliant idea to go to Claridge’s bar for a drink,' he wrote. 'After politely suggesting that the management should give us one, the maitre d’ came over and asked us to leave. 'Lord Worcester protested, as did his brother Lord John Somerset. I was at the bar and unaware we were being given the heave-ho. Once I caught on, it was too late. My party was out the door. 'So here’s what I think happened and why I am outraged. We were speaking English, we were white and we had not demanded myriad bottles of champagne. Exclusive: Claridge's in Mayfair, central London, is a favourite venue for the rich and famous and is referred to as 'an extension of Buckingham Palace' 'The staff were obviously hoping for Gulf people, whose moolah (slang for money) derives from the theft of their countries’ resources. 'The idea that four English-speaking European gents with four ladies in tow are asked to leave Claridge’s is as outrageous as it’s foul.' The hotel has denied any knowledge of the incident and rejects the idea that they prefer wealthy Arabs as guests. 'We have checked. There is no record of such an incident. I think he is being deliberately provocative and mischievous,' a spokesman told the Daily Telegraph. But Theodoracopulos said he stands by his story is 'still very upset by what happened.' The hotel was founded in in 1812 as Mivart's Hotel in a conventional London terraced house. It grew steadily over the years and expanded into neighbouring houses. Claridge's flourished after the First World War due to demand from aristocrats who no longer maintained a London house. Well-known guests include Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn,  Alfred Hitchcock, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, U2 and Mariah Carey. Typical rooms at the five star hotel around £400 per night. Claridge's is owned by Maybourne Hotel Group, which also has two other five-star luxury hotels in London, The Berkeley and The Connaught.","Staff wanted to serve wealthy Arabs instead, claims socialite Taki Theodoracopulos ."
"Prince George might have a rival in the cute junior royal stakes: his third cousin Savannah Phillips - the daughter of Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn, and granddaughter of Princess Anne.

"An asteroid the size of a bus came to within 186,000 miles of Earth - a close shave in cosmic terms - on Saturday morning. The recently-detected asteroid HL129 was closer to Earth than the Moon - which is on average 238,855 miles away from our planet - on its closest approach at 4.13am. The asteroid is about 7.6 metres wide, according to NASA's Asteroid Watch project based at the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Looming: This Nasa video shows HL129 on its approach to Earth. The bus-sized asteroid came closer to Earth than our own Moon . Hair's breadth: The asteroid closes in on Earth, eventually passing by to within just 186,000 miles of us . An asteroid of that size would cause significant damage if it impacted a major city, potentially hitting with the impact of a nuclear bomb roughly half the size of the one that hit Hiroshima in 1945. The asteroid was discovered on Wednesday, April 28, by astronomers with the Mount Lemmon Survey team, according to an alert by the Minor Planet Center, an arm of the International Astronomical Union that chronicles asteroid discoveries, reports Space.com. NASA scientists and researchers around the world constantly monitor the sky for asteroids that could hit the surface of the planet. Startling new research has revealed just how vulnerable our planet is to asteroid impacts. A trio of former astronauts has announced we’re up to ten times more likely to be hit than previously thought - and warn the only way we’ve avoided disaster so far is through 'blind luck'. Stark reminder: A meteorite contrail is seen over Chelyabinsk in Russia in February. It caused sharp explosions and reportedly injured around 100 people, including many hurt by broken glass. However, the majority of the impacts occurred either high up in the atmosphere, or in unpopulated areas including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Despite the majority of impacts occurring in water and high up in the atmosphere, a number have taken place on land. The Chelyabinsk meteorite flew above the Russian city in 2013. The impact injured hundreds of people and served as a reminder of how deadly incoming space rocks can be. Asteroids hitting the Earth caused 26 nuclear-scale explosions between 2000 and 2013, a new report has revealed. Some were more powerful, and in one case, dozens of times stronger, than the 15-kiloton atom bomb blast that destroyed Hiroshima. Despite the majority of impacts occurring in water and high up in the atmosphere, a number have taken place on land. Pictured, an illustration of an asteroid on its way to Earth . Three former astronauts supporting the B612 Foundation - a private company devoted to protecting Earth from asteroids - presented the data. The impacts were recorded by the Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation which operates a global network of sensors listening out for nuclear weapon detonations. Most occurred too high in the atmosphere to cause any serious damage on the ground. But the evidence is a sobering reminder of how vulnerable the Earth is to the threat from space, say scientists. The most dramatic impact by an asteroid or comet in recent times occurred when an object exploded over Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908 with an energy yield equivalent to between 5,000 and 15,000 tons of TNT. An area of forest covering 770 square miles (2,000 square km) was flattened by the blast. The horrifying prospect of an asteroid hitting the Earth was the subject of the hit movies Armageddon, starring Bruce Willis, and Deep Impact, starring Morgan Freeman.","HL129 came to within just 186,000 miles of Earth .

"A 20-year-old Texas man who was convicted of raping of a teenage schoolmate but sentenced to only five years' probation must also undergo the standard probationary conditions, including evaluation for sex offender treatment, a Dallas district court judge ruled Thursday. Sir Young pleaded guilty to the attack on a 14-year-old girl at a Dallas high school in 2011. Judge Jeanine Howard, who sentenced Young last week, did not impose the standard probationary conditions. She said he was 'not your typical sex offender' and questioned whether the girl had embellished her story. He was ordered to spend 45 days in jail. A district court judge has reversed a previous order and imposed a series of probationary requirements for Sir Young (pictured in court on Thursday) The sentence and the judge's comments sparked outrage and Howard recused herself from the case. On Thursday, Judge Carter Thompson imposed all of the standard terms of probation, meaning Young may not have any contact with children, must be evaluated for sex offender treatment and must stay away from pornography. Thompson told Young that he must adhere to the probation measures. 'Your previous court gave you a second chance, don't expect a third chance from this court,' he said. Thompson made 'in our estimation the right ruling, he did the right thing,' Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins said after the ruling. Dallas Judge Jeanine Howard (pictured) has stepped away from a rape case after sparking outrage by saying the 14-year-old victim 'wasn't the victim she claimed to be' Sir Young, 20, pictured as he is led into court before a hearing in Dallas Thursday, May 8 . Watkins' office had asked Thompson to tighten the probation conditions. Young's attorney, Scottie Allen, said he and his client were disappointed by Thursday's ruling. Judge Jeanine Howard caused further outrage after the light sentence, by telling The Dallas Morning News: 'She wasn't the victim she claimed to be. He is not your typical sex offender. 'There are rape cases that deserve life. There are rape cases that deserve 20 years. 'Every now and then you have on of those that deserve probation. This is one of those and I stand by it.' Prosecutor Josh Healy said Young's victim, who is now 17, had been left in tears by the ruling. He said she and her family told him they were 'shocked'  and 'extremely disappointed'. But Judge Howard told the newspaper she gave the sentence because medical records indicated the girl had three sexual partners and had given birth to a baby - something the victim's family denies. Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said his prosecutors had pushed for five years' prison time. The initial punishment for Young sparked a backlash when a prior judge in Dallas sentenced him to five years of probation and declined to impose standard conditions of probation for sex offenders .

"At three years old little girls can’t quite tie their laces or read a story, but they’ve picked up one thing – that being fat is not good. Presented with dolls of different shapes, girls in a study aged between three and five consistently preferred the thin version. And it wasn’t just a case of them having a ‘better’ figure. Researchers found three-year-old girls felt fat dolls had no friends, as opposed to slimmer toys . The bigger doll was thought of as being sad, tired and having no friends. She was also least likely to be chosen to play with. Researcher John Worobey said it is likely the girls were reflecting their mothers’ anxiety about weight and desire to be thin. ‘I think that what they hear in the home – mothers’ griping, fathers’ sniping – sets the stage for them thinking that being fat is undesirable,’ he said. Weight anxiety: Researchers felt the girls were projecting their mothers' concerns about slimming . Others warned that such attitudes can help fuel eating disorders such as anorexia. The US researchers created three Barbie-style dolls for the study. Each had the same face and similar clothes but had different body shapes. The dolls were shown to 40 girls, who were asked questions such as which doll looks happiest or has the most friends. They were also asked which doll they would most like to play with. The thin doll was the clear favourite, scoring highest on four out of the six positive traits. This included being considered the prettiest – despite all three dolls having the same faces. The larger doll scored highest for all the negative attributes, from being friendless, to being tired and sad. And, while 70 per cent of the girls said they’d like to play with the thin doll and 20 per cent the average-size, just 10 per cent wanted the chubby doll. Writing in the journal Body Image, the researchers, from Rutgers University in New Jersey, said their results prove an aversion to fatness evident in preschool-age girl. Susan Ringwood, from British eating disorder charity Beat, said: ‘[It’s] crucial that young people learn as early as possible that there isn’t just one size that means you are going to be successful and happy and popular.’","Bigger doll thought of as having no friends, according to 3-year-olds .

"For months archaeologists have speculated about who lies within an ancient burial mound in northern Greece. Now analysis of the skeleton discovered in an underground vault has revealed that the person who was buried there was male and was probably an important general. He was of medium height with pale skin and brown or red hair, they said, suggesting that the remains could could well belong to blue-eyed king. Analysis of the skeleton discovered in an underground vault has revealed the man buried there was of medium height, with pale skin and brown or red hair (illustrated) Alexander the Great was reputed to have had blue eyes and golden or red hair. Further examination of the remains are expected to confirm that the man originated in the Thrace region in north east Greece, according to The Greek Reporter. Skeletal remains show the man buried in the Amphipolis tomb was of medium height with pale skin and brown or red hair. He must have been of high social status, based on his opulent final surroundings. Archaeologists say he was probably an important general, although because the tomb was looted in antiquity, no shield or sword have been found, which were typically buried with Macedonian warriors. Experts are studying the bones to reveal what the man died of and what he ate. Last week, Greece's culture ministry said the opulence of the tomb indicates that a 'distinguished public figure' was buried there. One contemporaneous account says his hair was 'xanth' - meaning 'golden' or 'auburn' - and a mosaic at Pella shows the warrior king with red hair. However, other Roman writers said it was dark blonde, such as Roman rhetoric teacher Aelian, who wrote: '...his hair curled naturally and was yellow'. Another expert said that the bones will reveal details about the man’s health and his diet. Katerina Peristeri, head of the Amphipolis Tomb excavation believes that the man was an important general, although because robbers have removed valuable items in antiquity, no weapons or precious objects remain in situ. But experts have hypothesised about how the grave would have looked at the time of burial. Solving a mystery: Last week, archaeologists found skeletal remains inside a  grave in the innermost chamber of  an ancient tomb in Amphipolis, north Greece. There has been great speculation in recent months whom the opulent burial belongs to . Chrysoula Paliadeli, Professor of Classical Archaeology at the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, said: ‘Thanks to the elements we [have obtained] from other Macedonian graves, in which there was no human intervention after the burial, we can assume that we would have found armaments - a shield, sword, chest armour, helmet, shin guards and other items - and ceremonial containers made of gold or copper, chaplet and probably earthenware pottery.’ Some commentators sill hold out hope that the skeleton belongs to Alexander the Great himself, based on the warrior king's symbol being found inside the tomb. However, The Greek Culture Ministry hasn't mentioned the symbol or the chances of the bones being the legendary warrior's. Alexander died in Babylonia, present day Iraq, but his burial site remains unknown. Some written accounts of the ancient leader's appearance say that he had red, or strawberry blonde hair, raising hopes that the skeleton may be his. One contemporaneous account says his hair was 'xanth' which means golden or auburn and a mosaic at Pella shows the warrior king with red hair. However, other Roman writers said it was dark blonde, such as Roman rhetoric teacher Aelian, who wrote: '...his hair curled naturally and was yellow'. Experts will analyse the bones and attempt to see if DNA of the man matches that of the Phillip II, Alexander the Great’s father. However, this may be difficult because the king’s DNA is said to be ‘overworked’. There is conjecture on Twitter about whether a 1999 geological survey indicates there are many more burial chambers in the grand complex, perhaps hiding more remains, meaning that even if the remains do not belong to Alexander the Great, the legendary leader may still lie in the mound. A new study of Kasta Hill is said to be under way to determine if experts have revealed all the site's secrets. Further tests will determine whether the man was a member of the ancient royal family of Macedonia. Lina Mendoni, Secretary Culture Secretary, warned it will be hard to determine this and such an investigation could take around eight months. Scientists will compare the DNA of the bones to that of Phillip II, who was buried at Vergina, but this will be difficult because the genetic material is 'overworked,' she told Iefimerida. The bones of Phillip II - father of Alexander the Great - were burnt and because DNA tests were carried out some 50 years ago, it is feared the results may have been contaminated. There is much conjecture on Twitter as to whether the tomb might belong to Alexander the Great or whether it is a massive complex, of which only one chamber has been discovered. Some Twitter users have spotted a symbol in the tomb that they say is the mark of the ancient leader, while others are pointing to the results of an old geological survey that hints the mound hides many underground stone structures. Last week, Greece’s Ministry of Culture revealed that the body had been placed in a wooden coffin, which disintegrated over time. The skeletal remains were found both inside and outside the rectangular stone-lined cist, under the floor of the cavernous, vaulted structure that is 26 feet (eight metres) tall . Iron and bronze nails as well as carved bone and glass decorations from the coffin were also found scattered in the grave. Findings: Greece's Culture Ministry said the skeleton was strewn in and around the stone-lined cistern, pictured, under the floor of the cavernous, vaulted structure that is 26ft tall . Opulent: There has been speculation that the tomb could be that of Alexander the Great (a mosaic depicting the king is shown). Examinations of the remains have established they belong to a man who was  a general . New find: surviving fragments of carved bone and glass coffin ornaments found in the tomb at Amphipolis, but no helmet, shield or military objects which would be expected in the tomb of a Macedonian soldier . Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt, but it is thought his body was moved to prevent looting. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. Archaeologists in . the past have said the grave likely belonged to a prominent . Macedonian and some had hoped it might have been built for Alexander the Great's mother or wife, while others predicted it belongs to a military man. Last week the Culture Ministry said in a statement: 'It is probably the monument of a dead person who became a . hero, meaning a mortal who was worshipped by society at that . time. 'The deceased was a prominent person, . since only this could explain the construction of this unique . burial complex.' ‘It is an extremely expensive construction, whose cost, clearly, is unlikely to have been borne by a private citizen.' Michalis Tiverios, a professor of archaeology at the University of Thessaloniki who has not been involved with the dig, said the human remains should provide valuable information on the occupant of the tomb, which at about 49 ft (15 metres) long and 15 ft (4.5 metres) wide is one of the biggest ever found in the country. He believes one possible candidate could be Nearchos, one of Alexander's closest aides who led his fleet back from India to modern Iraq, and who grew up in Amphipolis. The ministry confirmed fears that the tomb had been thoroughly and repeatedly plundered during antiquity. ‘Whatever objects of value the first thieves missed was taken by others later,’ Professor Tiverios said. Excavations at the site in northeastern Greece near the city . of Thessaloniki began in 2012. They captured global attention in . August when archaeologists announced the discovery of vast tomb . guarded by two sphinxes and circled by a 497-metre marble wall. Since then the tomb has also yielded a mosaic made of . coloured pebbles depicting the abduction of Persephone, the . daughter of Zeus, as well as two sculpted female figures also . known as Caryatids. The tomb dates to 300-325 B.C. Alexander the . Great died in 323 B.C. after a military campaign through the . Middle East, Asia and northeast Asia. Experts believe the ancient mound, situated around 65 miles (100km) from Thessaloniki (shown on the map) was built for a prominent Macedonian in around 300 to 325 BC . Clockwise from top right shows two headless, marble sphinxes found above the entrance to the barrel-vaulted tomb, details of the facade and the lower courses of the blocking wall, the antechamber's mosaic floor, a 4.2-metre long stone slab, and the upper uncovered sections of two female figures.

"Increasing exposure to selfies is pushing more Americans to go under the knife, according to specialists. A poll conducted by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery earlier this year found that one in three surgeons said they noticed more patients noted social media when asking for surgical procedures in 2013 compared to 2012. Individual surgeons have noticed the growing trend of selfies driving plastic surgery. Selfie-conscious: Increasing exposure to selfies is pushing more Americans to go under the knife, according to specialists. 'There has been a 25 percent increase over the past year and a half to two years,' Dr Sam Rizk told Reuters. He's even had to turn away patients from his Manhattan practice who were troubled by how they looked in self portraits on social media - and encountered anger for his efforts. 'I refuse a significant proportion of patients with selfies because I believe it is not a real image of what they actually look like in person,' he said. Distortion can occur when a mobile phone or other digital device is held too close to the subject, resulting in an image that does not reflect the person's look. 'They come in with their iPhones and show me pictures,' Rizk stated. 'Selfies are just getting to be so crazy.' 'Too many selfies indicate a self obsession and a certain level of insecurity that most teenagers have. It just makes it worse,' he said. 'Now they can see themselves in 100 images a day on Facebook and Instagram.' Demand: Dr Sam Rizk said he's had to turn away patients at his Manhattan office because he felt the procedures they wanted were unnecessary  - and encountered anger for his efforts . Though the AAFPRS poll did not specify how many respondents were surveyed from among its 2,700-member organization, it found doctors noted an increasing demand last year. The poll revealed a 10 percent increase in rhinoplasty procedures - also known as nose jobs - along with a 7 percent increase in hair transplant procedures and a 6 percent increase in eyelid surgery. 'Social platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and the iPhone app Selfie.im, which are solely image based, force patients to hold a microscope up to their own image and often look at it with a more self-critical eye than ever before,' said AAFPRS President Edward Farrior in the press release. 'These images are often the first impressions young people put out there to prospective friends, romantic interests and employers and our patients want to put their best face forward.' Bullying was also said to be a factor, as respondents noted that children and adolescents were looking for the surgery after being bullied by others.","A poll was conducted by the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery that found social media had increased importance .

"A Texas mother of two and her boyfriend were gunned down on their front yard by her ex-husband hours after twice calling the police for help. Grand Prairie officers confirmed that Jenea James, 37, had contacted them in distress on Saturday to complain that Dashun Atkins, 39, was making threatening phone calls and repeatedly driving past her home. However, the only action police took was to provide her with information on how to obtain a restraining order and to contact Atkins personally to ask him to stop harassing his ex-wife because his two children with James, aged three and five, were at home. But, at 2 a.m. on Sunday, three hours after James' last plea to police for help, neighbors phoned police to report gunshots and officers arrived to find her and boyfriend James Doyle, 41, dead while the two children were discovered unharmed inside their home. Scroll Down for Video . Tragedy: Jenea James lost her life while her two young children (pictured) were inside the family home when their father arrived to shoot James and her boyfriend dead on Sunday night . Officers later found Atkins dead at his own home after apparently killing himself with a self-inflicted gun-shot wound. It is unclear if the young children witnessed the murders and police officers are currently working to place them with relatives in the area. 'At no time leading up to the shooting did officers have legal authority to arrest Dashun Atkins,' police said in the statement provided to NBC DFW. In addition to the pleading phone calls . from James, police in Grand Prairie admitted to receiving a phone call . shortly before midnight on Saturday from an individual who claimed to be . a relative of Atkins.

"A police force is suing its former chief constable for nearly £500,000 after he was sacked for gross misconduct. Cleveland Police is trying to reclaim salary and bonuses paid to Sean Price, who was dismissed last October after being found guilty of asking a colleague to inquire about a job for the former police authority chairman’s daughter and subsequently lying about it. Mr Price was the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years. Legal action: Sean Price, former chief constable of Cleveland Police, who became the first chief constable to be sacked for 35 years, could be sued for £500,000 . Months later his wife, Heather Eastwood, 41, resigned as a detective chief inspector with the same force after failing to tell superiors she had been arrested on a drunk and disorderly charge. Now court papers reveal that  Mr Price, 55, is facing a claim that some payments he received after  his appointment in 2003 until his suspension in 2011 were unlawful. They say some parts of the salary package were, in effect, illegal because they breached Home Office guidelines on police pay. Gone: Deputy chief constable of Cleveland Police Derek Bonnard who was sacked for gross misconduct in March . When Mr Price started the job, Cleveland Police Authority – which has since been disbanded – approved a salary of £125,000, making him  one of the country’s highest-paid police chiefs. By the time he was suspended,  Mr Price’s remuneration had risen  to nearly £200,000, with allowances including a £50,000 ‘retention package’ and a £24,000 ‘honorarium’ for cutting crime. When he was fired, he took a pension pot thought to be worth about £60,000 a year. The force is seeking to claw back £330,000 from wages and bonuses paid, plus interest amounting to more than £100,000 from when the claim was first submitted to the High Court in Leeds. Mr Price, who has strongly denied the claims, is currently on police bail as inquiries continue into corruption allegations linked to the former police authority. In March, Cleveland’s former deputy chief constable Derek Bonnard was dismissed for gross misconduct on six counts, including obstructing a criminal investigation and misusing public funds.

"'Working the system': Sinead Clarkson, 36, got pregnant at 15 and has never had a job. She says the benefits system doesn't makes it financially worthwhile to work . A jobless mother has provoked anger by urging her teenage daughter to get pregnant for an easy life on benefits. Sinead Clarkson, 36, has no qualifications, has never worked and rakes in £1,200 a month from the State. She has now admitted encouraging her 19-year-old daughter Melissa to follow her shameless example and ‘work the system’ by having a baby. Melissa became pregnant six months ago, and is now in line for an extra £400 a month courtesy of taxpayers when her baby is born, as well as a two-bedroom council house. Her mother, who has another daughter, Amie, aged 12, said: ‘I am better off on benefits. I refuse to work for a pittance and struggle. ‘I don’t have any qualifications so it is easier to claim money than persuade an employer to give me a job. ‘I told Melissa to work the system and have a baby so she could claim more benefits, get a house of her own and have a better life. ‘I don’t want her to work for peanuts in a low-pay job.’ Yesterday Robert Oxley, campaign director at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, called for the benefits system to be overhauled. ‘It is a deeply depressing waste of taxpayers’ money and human potential for someone to aspire to live their life on benefits – worse still to promote the same for their children,’ he said. ‘The welfare system should never be an alternative to work. A system that allows people to see having a child as a pay-cheque is fundamentally flawed and needs further reform.’ Miss Clarkson, from Rochdale, dropped out of school after becoming pregnant at the age  of 15, and has been receiving  government handouts since  she was 16. She said: ‘It wasn’t planned but I was happy to leave school because I didn’t like it – I had no career aspirations.’ She first began claiming £260 a month in income support. And nine months after having Melissa in July 1994, Miss Clarkson – whose boyfriend left her –  was given her own two-bedroom council house, along with £68 a month child benefit. Following in her mother's footsteps: Ms Clarkson (pictured left) admits to encouraging her eldest daughter Melissa, 19, (pictured right) to have a baby so she can live an 'easy life on benefits'. Melissa is now pregnant . In an interview with Closer magazine, she said: ‘I was thrilled to get my own place. It was a nice house with lots of space.’ Miss Clarkson, who claimed as much as £328 a month while her daughter was a baby, said she felt lonely when Melissa started school. She gave birth to Amie in 2001 after a brief relationship. And to her delight, her handouts increased to £1,020 a month, including her rent, child tax credits and other benefits. She was also given a three-bedroom house. ‘Amie was not planned, but I was excited about being a mum again,’ Miss Clarkson said. ‘Plus I knew my benefits would increase and the extra money would come in handy.’ She added: ‘Being on benefits suits me. I don’t have the stress of working like some of my friends. I spend a lot of time cooking and cleaning, or I will watch TV or have friends round. Ms Clarkson, from Greater Manchester, claims living on benefits brings a stress-free life . ‘I know people will be angry with my choices, but they should not judge. It is the system’s fault that I can choose not to work. ‘What is the point of having a job if I can’t earn much more than I get now? People decide to have babies so they can get benefits because this country allows it.’ Miss Clarkson said her 12-year-old daughter Amie ‘talks about having a baby’ too – and if she did she would support her decision. ‘Amie is still in school and hopefully will get some qualifications,’ she said. ‘But if she did decide to go down the same route as Melissa, I would support her.’ Clinical psychologist Dr Sharon Lewis warned yesterday that it is crucially important for parents to set a good example – and that those who aspire to a life without work may prevent their children  from reaching their full potential as adults. She said: ‘Children are more influenced by what their parents do, rather than what they say. ‘If a parent is not showing a responsible attitude to their role in society, their children will follow suit. ‘Individuals need to work to thrive. 'Otherwise it can hamper their future development and prevent them reaching their full potential.’","Sinead Clarkson, 36, fell pregnant when she was 15 and has never worked .

"Hillary Clinton's new book has drawn praise from an unexpected corner: Tea Party darling and walking soundbite Sarah Palin. Palin, who admitted she has only read the chapter in Clinton's Hard Choices about herself, said she admired Clinton for describing tactics used by the Obama camp during the 2008 election. In an email interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Palin also discussed her reality series Amazing America, her eagerness to join the panel on The View and her thoughts on the state of 'incorrigibly disastrous' politics. Scroll down for video . High praise: Palin said she admires Hillary Clinton for a revealing chapter in her memoir . Hard choice: Palin has read one chapter in Hillary Clinton's memoir about herself . When asked about Hillary Clinton's memoir Palin said, 'I appreciated her boldness in explaining that behind-the-scenes campaign tactic of Obama’s,' referring to a chapter in which Clinton detailed how she refused to engage in an attack on Palin based on her gender. She said she'd read the chapter because her attorney sent it to her - which doesn't bode well for the likelihood that she'll read the rest of the book. In language replete with gun metaphor, Palin explained that she has recovered from her election defeat, 'reloaded' and is ready for new challenges. Palin indicated she believes a show like The View would benefit from her 'real-life groundedness [sic], candor and commonsense.' Successful: Palin's Amazing America series has been renewed for another season . 'I hear everyone recently got canned from The View, maybe a show like that needs a punch of reality and a voice of reason from America's heartland to knock some humble sense into their scripts,' she told the Hollywood Reporter. 'You know, someone willing to go rogue.' Representatives from The View have not commented on whether or not Palin will be considered for the panel, but the former Alaska Governor's approach is working on her new series that screens on the Sportsman Channel.

"Taking paracetamol has no effect on lower back pain despite being the treatment most widely recommended by doctors, according to a study. Paracetamol is the first-line treatment for GPs dealing with acute attacks of the most common form of back pain, while the NHS Choices websites advises patients to take it. But a major trial shows the painkiller does not help sufferers recover more quickly, reduce their pain levels or improve their sleep or quality of life. Taking paracetamol has no effect on back pain, according to a new study by Sydney University . The research suggests advice and reassurance can do as much good for back pain patients as regular doses of paracetamol. This could include advising patients to rest and to improve their posture and reassuring them that they will get better. Lower back pain is thought to affect two in five people at some point in their lives, being triggered by bad posture, bending awkwardly or lifting incorrectly. In many cases it gets better within 12 weeks, with sufferers taking painkillers and keeping mobile. Despite universal advice to doctors about prescribing paracetamol to alleviate low back pain, there is no high-quality evidence which shows it works, according to Australian researchers. They carried out their study on 1,652 people with acute lower back pain in Sydney. The volunteers, who had an average age of 45, were split into three groups. One group received regular doses of paracetamol three times a day for up to four weeks. They were given up to 3,990mg per day. Another group received up to 4,000mg of paracetamol per day when required, and the third were given a placebo (dummy pills). The study found little difference in the number of days it took to recover between the treatment groups, with the placebo group having an average recovery  time of 16 days, a day faster than the other two groups. Paracetamol also had no effect on short-term pain levels, disability, function, sleep quality or quality of life,  says to a report in The Lancet medical journal. Paracetamol is the first-line treatment for GPs dealing with acute attacks of the most common form of back pain . According to study leader Dr Christopher Williams, from Sydney University, paracetamol was effective in treating some acute pain such as tooth extraction and post-operative pain. But the study findings threw into doubt its role in treating low back pain. ‘Simple analgesics such as paracetamol might not be of primary importance in the management of acute lower back pain,’ he said. ‘The results suggest we need to reconsider the universal recommendation to provide paracetamol as a first-line treatment for low back pain, although understanding why paracetamol works for other pain states but not low back pain would help direct future treatments. In view of the quick time frame in which participants in our trial improved compared with other cohorts, it would be interesting to see whether advice and reassurance, as provided in our trial, might be more effective than pharmacological strategies for acute low back pain.’ But Dutch experts Bart Koes and Wendy Enthoven, from Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, also writing in The Lancet, said it was too early to change clinical guidelines. They said: ‘Although the findings from this high-quality trial are clear, the content of guidelines should not be changed on the basis of a single trial; more robust and consistent evidence, including verification of the results in other populations, is needed.’ Paracetamol works by blocking prostaglandin enzymes in the brain and spinal cord involved in the transmission of pain. In addition to paracetamol tablets, the drug is available in many cold and flu remedies. In 2011 the NHS spent £61million on paracetamol for GPs’ patients.","Major trial shows the painkiller does not help sufferers recover more quickly .

"For anyone who has marvelled  at the ease with which the Duchess of Cambridge has taken up her  royal role, it seems the skill simply runs in the family. Her mother Carole Middleton appeared happy and relaxed as she laughed and talked with the Duke of Edinburgh at Royal Ascot yesterday.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do not plan to attend as they are . otherwise occupied celebrating William's 30th birthday.

The Ribblesdale Stakes was named in honour of the 4th Baron Ribblesdale, who was Master of the Buckhounds from 1892 to 1895. When it was established in 1919, it was a one mile race open to three and four-year-olds of either gender, but after a break during World War II, the race returned in as a one and a half mile race. In 1950, entry was restricted to three-year-old fillies only.The Ribblesdale Stakes is now held on day three of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting. The Queen's filly Momentary was today ridden by Hayley Turner who had been bidding to be the first female jockey to win a race at Royal Ascot since 1987 - Hayley was just 5 years old at the time when Gay Kelleway rode to victory on Sprowston Boy. The last time the Queen won the Ribblesdale Stakes was in 1995 with Phantom Gold ridden by Frankie Dettori. 'She's fresh and well, there's no reason why she shouldn't win, said Hayley of the Queen's filly, Momentary ahead of the race. It's a huge honour to be riding today. I'm hugely grateful, she added. 'It's nice to go out there into the paddock to meet the Queen. 'I've met her a few times now so we have a routine.

"Free: Matthew VanDyke has escaped a prison in Libya where he was held, his mother said . A U.S. writer who had been held captive in Libya after being captured in the early months of the conflict has escaped from prison, his mother said. Matthew VanDyke, 32, travelled from his home in Maryland after seeing the battles unfold on TV when unrest began in February. He was captured and held in solitary confinement in Abu Salim prison in Tripoli with his relatives at home fearing that he might not be released. The notorious prison was the scene of a massacre in 1996 when 1,270 prisoners were claimed to have been killed after guards opened fire on them on them with machine guns. But Mr VanDyke's mother, Sharon, said her son called her on a borrowed phone after being helped to escape by fellow prisoners. 'He was in the cell and heard men coming. He thought they were coming to execute or torture him,' Sharon VanDyke told CNN. But the men smashed open the door and invited the fearful prisoner out of the building and took him to the home of a wealthy man. He is currently being looked after there. 'He had a great respect for the people and the country, not the politics. I've always known he was OK.' 'He said he was in good physical health He was sorry we did not know for sure he was OK.' Mrs VanDyke  said that her son was freed alongside six other U.S. civillians who had been held in the prison. Mr VanDyke, a freelance journalist, first travelled to Libya on a six-week trip in 2008. While there he made friends with locals. He wanted to return to the country when he saw the trouble erupting earlier this year. But VanDyke disappeared after telling his mother and Fischer that he'd take a daytrip to the eastern Libyan oil town of Brega from Benghazi in mid-March. Initially, Libyan officials denied that VanDyke was being held, but they acknowledged during talks with Hungarian officials late last month that he was in custody. U.S. State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland confirmed that all U.S. citizens who were known to be detained in Libya have been released. She added: 'The families of those detained individuals have been notified of their freedom and welfare. A group of rebels flash the victory sign as they wait for their instructions at a checkpoint in Tripoli . On patrol: Groups of armed rebels stalk the streets of Tripoli yesterday as they continue the search for Colonel Gaddafi . 'We remain concerned about the welfare and safety of those U.S. citizens who remain in Tripoli. For safety and privacy reasons we are unable to provide additional details.' News that Mr Van Dyke had been freed came as suspected regime loyalists kidnapped four Italian journalists and killed their local driver in Libya as the group traveled down a highway to Tripoli on Wednesday. The Italian foreign ministry said the four were abducted on a stretch of highway between Zawiya, a town 30 miles west of Tripoli, and the Libyan capital. The kidnapped reporters included two reporters from Milan daily Corriere della Sera, one from Turin's La Stampa and one from Avvenire, the daily of the Italian Catholic bishops Conference, the ministry said. Catch me if you can: On-the-run Colonel Gaddafi has a £1m bounty on his head to be caught dead or alive . Information also emerged on Wednesday that two French journalists were wounded in the fighting around Moammar Gadhafi's compound in Tripoli. Corriere della Sera said on its website that the four Italian journalists were stopped by a group of civilians, who then 'handed them over to military men faithful to Gaddafi who brought them to a private house,' and that first contact from the Avvenire journalist came hours later. Avvenire's foreign news editor, Fabio Carminati, said its reporter, Claudio Monici, called to say all four journalists were OK and had been taken to a house. 'Monici said ''We're OK. Call our families. Call the foreign ministry. Call our papers'',' Carminati said, adding that Monici's voice sounded strong. Carminati added: 'Monici told us ''We were roughed up, they stole our possessions, our money, our phones''.' The Italian journalists have now been released. Fighting around Tripoli erupted yesterday, hours after the dictator who ruled Libya with an iron fist for 42 years vowed to fight on ‘until victory or martyrdom’ and called on Tripoli’s residents to free the city from the ‘devils and traitors’. An an address from an unknown location and broadcast on the pro-Gaddafi Al-Ouroba TV, the ousted despot asked: ‘Why are you letting them wreak havoc?’ Sounding subdued and without his usually fiery rhetoric, he made no reference to the storming of his compound, stressing he would fight ‘the aggression with all strength until either victory or death’. Much of the latest fighting was centred in the neighbourhood of Abu Salim, near the Gaddafi compound and home to a notorious prison. Fierce fighting also raged in the area of the Rixos Hotel, close to the seized compound, where 35 journalists are effectively hostages of the regime. The rebels are now using Bab al-Aziziya as a staging area for their operations, loading huge trucks with ammunition and discussing where they need to deploy despite coming under fire from rifles and rocket propelled grenades. Rebels claimed to be in control of 95 per cent of Libya and 90 per cent of Tripoli last night and declared Gaddafi’s rule effectively over. Abdul Ati al-Obeidi, Gaddafi’s former foreign minister, said the regime had come to an end and rebels were now responsible for restoring law and order to Libya. Crucially, rebel chiefs made their first moves to set up a new government in the capital. ‘Members of the council are moving one by one from Benghazi to Tripoli,’ said Mansour Seyf al-Nasr, the Libyan opposition’s new ambassador to France.","Matthew VanDyke travelled to Tripoli when he saw fighting on TV .

"For something that seems so harmless, paper is surprisingly capable of cutting through skin. Now one designer has decided to use this ability, by harnessing the power of paper cuts for shaving. San Francisco-based Nadeem Haidary has designed an origami razor concept that could one day be used in place of plastic disposal razors. San Francisco-based Nadeem Haidary (pictured) has designed an origami razor concept that could one day be used in place of plastic disposal razors . ‘Paper Cut Razor takes a seemingly outrageous idea and makes it real,’ writes Haidary on his website. The razor concept is constructed out of a sheet of water-resistant paper. It has three slits that the designer believes could act like metal blades. The razors would be sold as a flat pack with users having to put them together by making a few origami folds. As the razor is made from paper, it can be recycled far more easily that its plastic equivalent. ‘It’s a fictional product that playfully challenges two notions: that paper cuts are inherently evil, and that current disposable razors are truly disposable.’ The result is a razor concept constructed entirely out of a sheet of water-resistant paper that can be recycled after use.

As the razor is made from paper, it can be recycled far more easily that its plastic equivalent. The artist has even created paper origami designs for other products including glasses, scissors and a toothbrush.

"Created: . 03:32 EST, 14 July 2014 . Imams with links to extremist Muslim groups are helping to turn Britain’s prisons into ‘state-funded breeding grounds for extremism’, an expert has warned. The Prison Officers’ Association described the threat of inmates being radicalised as a ‘real problem’. There are 11,683 Muslim prisoners in Britain’s jails and the government has deployed imams to help steer them away from extremist paths. Concern: The Prison Officers’ Association described the threat of inmates being radicalised as a 'real problem' However, the Prison Officers’ Association has sounded an alarm about this process, saying that some extremist imams had ‘slipped through the net’, The Times reported. Professor Anthony Glees, head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of Buckingham, told the paper: ‘Our prisons have turned into a state-funded breeding ground for extremism. It is completely unacceptable that imams with extremist views are allowed to preach in prisons.’ Professor Glees, in an email to MailOnline, said: 'What these 'preachers' do is put extreme views to prisoners - for example gays should be hanged, the Jews/CIA carried out 9/11, adulteresses should be stoned to death. They foment resentments and when you add extremism to resentment you get radicalisation and ultimately terrorism. Not every radical is a terrorist but every terrorist has been a radical.' The solution, Professor Glees said, has many layers. He added: 'We should vet imams much more carefully than we have done in the past; we should stop confusing 'preachers' with 'chaplains', their religious qualifications should be properly checked, they should be required to preach in English and told they must keep clear of all political issues.' The Times names three imams who are either working in British jails, or have done in the past, who warrant concern. Prison Officers' Association head Steve Gillan has said that an increasing number of prisoners are becoming 'convenience Muslims' leading to heightened tensions with guards and fuelling extremism . West Bromwich prison chaplain Shaykh Yusuf Az Zahaby is a senior member of the Islamist organisation Al Hikma Media, which has among its ranks a preacher called Shady Suleiman, known for condoning the killing of women who have sex before marriage. Another in the group, Abdur Raheem Green believes that beating women will ‘bring them to goodness’. A red flag has also been raised against Azadul Hussain, who has mentored prisoners in Bedford. He has shared material on his Facebook page from MPAC, an extremist group that advocates killing adulterers. Sahib Bleher, meanwhile, worked for several years at Woodhill high security prison in Milton Keynes. Whilst Mr Bleher denies that he has ever held extreme views, he nevertheless was general secretary of the Islamic Party of Britain at the same time. This political party allegedly supported anyone displaying homosexuality in public being put to death. Earlier this year the Prison Officers’ Association warned that rising numbers of prisoners are becoming 'convenience Muslims' leading to heightened tensions with guards and fuelling extremism. Union general secretary Steve Gillan said that many prisoners were turning to Islam to win benefits, and to gain the status associated with being part of a gang. He said prison staff were coming under threat from groups of Muslims on a daily basis, and warned that young prisoners were at risk of being radicalised while behind bars. In 1991 there were 1,957 Muslims serving prison sentences in England and Wales, but numbers had risen to 11,683 by 2013. Mr Gillan said that many converts, who are known as 'convenience Muslims', changed faiths because it meant they were entitled to more time outside of their cells and offered better food. Muslim prisoners are also excluded from work and education on Fridays so they can attend prayers. Mr Gillan said that others wanted the status and security of being part of a particular group while in prison, and that it was relatively common for prisoners to leave Islam upon their release. 'Some people also believe that it is better to have a cult status and belong to a particular gang . 'What we've got to guard against is the real threat of the extremists and the radicalisation of young, disaffected prisoners,' Mr Gillan told The Times. 'They are the extremists of tomorrow.' However, Michael Spurr, Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service, robustly denied that extremist imams had infiltrated the prison system. He said: 'These accusations are inaccurate, unfounded and undermine the incredibly important work currently taking place to tackle extremism in prison. Prison Muslim Imams have a critical role in challenging distorted and inappropriate views - to suggest otherwise is simply wrong. 'Muslim chaplains are subject to rigorous security vetting and checks, as are all prison staff. Any member of staff giving cause for concern will be dealt with robustly. 'The challenge staff face should not be underestimated but we have a dedicated unit and specific programmes focused on stopping radical extremists from achieving their aims.' Professor Anthony Glees, head of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of Buckingham, told MailOnline that Britain should be worried about its Muslim prison population becoming radicalised through visiting imams. He said: 'Since 2011, 330 people have been convicted of terrorism and sent to prison in the UK, currently more than 120 are in prison - not to mention others convicted of terrorism related offences but not terrorism itself. Three-quarters of these are UK citizens. 'The Director General of MI5 said last year there were 'thousands' of Islamist terrorist in the UK. So far in 2014 we've seen four major terrorist trials, one an attempted re-make of the 7/7 attacks, two plots to kill UK soldiers, one plot to kill EDL members. We can expect two serious plots each year for the foreseeable future. 'So it makes no sense to add to the list of recruits to the Islamist cause. 'And remember those in prison, even where they're not in prison for terrorist offence but just ordinary crime, are people who have already broken the law. We know that those who have broken one law have demonstrated their contempt for our way of life and will be easy to convince that they should do it again.' Some of the preachers visiting Muslims in jail are 'fomenting resentments' and 'putting extreme views' to them, Professor Glees explained. He said: 'What these 'preachers' do is put extreme views to prisoners - to example gays should be hanged, the Jews/CIA carried out 9/11, adulteresses should be stoned to death. They foment resentments and when you add extremism to resentment you get radicalisation and ultimately terrorism. Not every radical is a terrorist but every terrorist has been a radical.' The solution, Professor Glees believes, has many layers. He said: 'First, we should not be letting extremist preachers into the UK in the first place. This has nothing to do with the EU, I should add, but with those in government who give visas to extremists like Shady al-Suleiman from Australia. Many EU countries ban these people. 'The Islamic Education and Research 'Academy', which got almost £1m in donations last year arranges for extremists from all over the world to come to the UK and traipse around prisons, mosques, campuses and even gyms. They should be dealt with.' So why are they let in? 'This government finds it hard to stand up for strong security policies because it is divided on the issue,' Professor Glees said. 'We're told by the Tory Libertarians like David Davis and Lib Dems that we are a free country that values free speech. But speaking freely in order to incite others to kill women who commit adultery, or extol the virtues of Isis is not about free speech, it's about its opposite. Civil liberties and lawful security are two sides of the same coin. 'Second, we should vet imams much more carefully than we have done in the past, we should stop confusing 'preachers' with 'chaplains', their religious qualifications should be properly checked, they should be required to preach in English and told they must keep clear of all political issues.'","Government deployed imams to help steer prisoners from extremist paths .

"Tommy Robinson, who dramatically quit the English Defence League this week,  has vowed to help police tackle racism within the organsation and has apologised for causing fear among British Muslims. Mr Robinson, 30, said he would work with police to help them investigate racism in the organisation - known for its thuggish street protests and extremist followers. Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also said he was sorry for creating a 'us and them' culture and for causing fear among British Muslims. Scroll down for video .

Mr Robinson, who co-founded the group four years ago with Kevin Carroll who also left the group this week, said: 'I apologise for [creating] that fear.' When asked about his claim that 'every single Muslim' was to blame for 'getting away' with the July 7 bombings, he also said 'I'm sorry'. Mr Robinson said that his past inflammatory statements had often been fuelled by alcohol and the adrenaline . rush of 'leading the biggest street protest movement in Europe.' Giving reason for his decision to leave the group, Mr Robinson . said he had been sobered by his 18-week stint in prison and by the . experience of being shunned by parents when picking up his children at . school. Different direction: Robinson will now work with Maajid Nawaz, Chairman and co-founder of the Quilliam Foundation (right) and Usama Hasan, also of the group (left) He will now work with  Maajid Nawaz, a former prominent member of the radical Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir and who heads the deradicalisation thinktank, the Quilliam Foundation. Mr Nawaz, who is also a prospective Lib Dem MP, said he had refused to sit with Robinson after being approached during the filming of a BBC documentary last week. 'I shook his hand and said ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to sit with you ... until you're ready to talk about leaving the EDL. I can't give legitimacy to the EDL.""' In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Nawaz said that Mr Robinson indicated that he was willing to leave after filming finished and so the paid began a series of conversations.

On Tuesday, Quilliam held a press conference where Mr Robinson announced his departure. Speaking at the time, Mr Robinson said he could no longer control members of the group. He told the BBC: ‘When some . moron lifts up his top and he’s got the picture of a mosque saying . “boom”, and it’s all over the national newspapers, it’s me – it’s when I . pick up my kids from school, the parents are looking at me – judging me . on that.’ He added: ‘I have been considering this move for a long time. Whilst I want to lead a revolution against Islamist ideology, I don’t want to lead a revolution against Muslims. ‘I believe that the revolution needs to come from within the Islamic community and they need to stand up.’ Mr Robinson said the move would be a ‘massive problem’. He added: ‘Do I feel English Defence League members are going to plant bombs and target my family? No I don’t. [But] I feel there will be a backlash.’ In the Guardian interview, he said he now aims to ‘counter Islamist ideology . . . not with violence but with better, democratic ideas’. Mr Robinson said his future work would . involve taking on radicalism on all fronts, although he could not . support anti-fascist groups because they also subscribed to 'communism' or were 'anarchists'.

"Roy Hodgson has confirmed he will pick Harry Kane for his next England squad, but that Wayne Rooney remains his favoured striker in the international set-up. Kane has burst on the scene this season, scoring 23 times for Tottenham in all competitions, and Hodgson revealed last Thursday he was willing to bring the England Under 21 striker into the senior set-up. By contrast Wayne Rooney has been frozen out of his favoured attacking position for Manchester United for much of the campaign, and in the 3-1 FA Cup win at Preston on Monday he scored his first goal since Boxing Day. England boss Roy Hodgson (centre) watches Manchester United take on Preston at Deepdale on Monday alongside Phil Neville (left) and Gary Lineker (right) Hodgson was in the BBC studio a a pundit for the FA Cup fifth round clash . But Hodgson, who was speaking on the BBC as a pundit for the FA Cup fifth round tie at Deepdale, admitted that he admires the quality of strikers he now has at his disposal compared to when he took over from Fabio Capello in 2012. Hodgson said: 'We think back two or three years when I started but up front we didn’t have enormous depth. 'We saw quite a few youngsters but not that many. Charlie Austin? He's done very well. You have to wait until the 19th to see if I pick him, as well as Berahino. I really do admire them all. Hodgson indicated he will pick Harry Kane for the England squad. Here Kane celebrates scoring against Liverpool for Tottenham last Tuesday in a Premier League clash at Anfield . Kane is already a big player at Under 21 level for England and his form has caught the eye of Hodgson . 'Harry Kane? He is an all-round centre forward, can play right up there against a centre back, or come off and see a pass. 'He's got technique, he’s always looking to get on the end of crosses, that header against Arsenal was a really classy header. I thought that was a wonderful. 'If all goes well and he stays fit I’m pretty sure he’ll be in the next squad. Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring United's third goal in a 3-1 win at Preston - his first since Boxing Day . But despite playing midfield for much of the campaign, Hodgson has stated Rooney is still his first choice England striker.

Even though Hodgson admitted his pleasure at seeing strikers showing form to earn a call-up, the England boss added that Rooney was still key to the Three Lions playing as a striker. 'At the moment I'd like to see him [Rooney] as a key figure for us as a centre forward, it would take a lot before I’d start to think along those lines [Rooney as a midfielder]. 'He’s our captain and nearly the record goalscorer.

"It promises to be some wedding. Carolyn Bourne, 60, launched the first salvo by sending her future daughter-in-law an email criticising her ‘staggering uncouthness and lack of grace’. Yesterday the father of bride-to-be Heidi Withers hit back, branding Mrs Bourne a ‘snotty Miss Fancy Pants’. In the stinging repost, Alan Withers, . 64, said the renowned horticulturist ‘has her head stuck so far up her . own a*** she doesn’t know whether to speak or f**t.’ Family-to-be at war: Alan Withers (left) has said his family call Carolyn Bourne (right) 'Miss Fancy-Pants' and say they do not like her 'snotty' attitude saying 'she thought she was better than us' Heidi Withers still wants to marry Freddie Bourne, pictured today, despite his step-mother's ranting email . And although Mrs Bourne appears fastidious about social mores, it emerged yesterday that she may have become pregnant some months before her first marriage in 1974, according to public records. She is also now on her third marriage. The astonishing war of words began after . Miss Withers, 28, and her fiancé Freddie Bourne, 29, spent the weekend . at the home of his father Edward and stepmother Carolyn in April. Incensed by her future daughter-in-law’s . apparent lack of manners, Mrs Bourne sent her an email listing all her . faults. She then sent it twice more to ensure it arrived. In the attack she told Miss Withers she should attend a finishing school in ‘utmost haste’ to get rid of her ‘bad manners’. She went on to describe her as ‘an ideal candidate for the Ladette to Lady television series’. Happy couple: Heidi Withers and her fiancé Freddie Bourne are reeling after the venomous message sent by Mrs Bourne bemoaning Heidi's manners . Stunned Miss Withers, a PA for a London recruitment firm, sent it on to a select group of friends. However, the email was forwarded to others and has now been read by millions on the internet. Speaking from the £450,000 family home in Ledbury, Herefordshire, Mr Withers, 64, said he would never forgive Mrs Bourne for sending the email. ‘Heidi was very upset and the two of them obviously don’t see eye to eye,’ he added. ‘I met Carolyn and her husband Edward for dinner at a pub in London last year. ‘Edward was a jovial chap but Carolyn was quite snotty. She had a look about her which made us think she thought she was better than us. She kept talking about her five horses and how it made her part of the Queen’s set. Sitting outside their home in Dawlish, Devon, yesterday when the Bournes said they were 'well aware' of the criticism by Heidi's father . ‘Ever since that meeting we call her . Miss Fancy Pants. I don’t care if she apologises. You can’t take back . what has been said once it’s said.’ In the email, Mrs Bourne accused Miss . Withers of poor table manners, insulting the family in public and . failing to send a handwritten card to say thank you after her stay. She even said her behaviour had left their pet dog Bomber  ‘profoundly upset, depressed and anxious’. Freddie . Bourne is getting married to Miss Withers in an £18,000 ceremony in the . great hall of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire in October. Mrs Bourne . told Miss Withers that her decision to get married in a castle smacks . of ‘brash, celebrity style behaviour’. She went on to criticise Miss Withers’ parents for failing to ‘contribute very much’ money towards the wedding. Mr Withers said: ‘The reason we have been unable to contribute as much money was because we both lost our jobs. I doubt Carolyn was aware of that when she sent the email. We were unceremoniously got rid of without warning in January and have been searching for jobs ever since.’ His wife Sylvia, 60, has since found work as a matron in a care home but he is still looking for work. ‘I have no desire to meet Carolyn or Edward again before or after the wedding,’ Mr Withers added. ‘They don’t know us and we don’t know them. Of course at the wedding we will shake hands and toast Heidi and Freddie.’ The young couple met three years ago through mutual friends and soon became close, enjoying a trip to America in 2009. They live in a flat with a shihtzu dog called Whisky in the affluent district of Parsons Green in South-west London. Freddie has an office nearby where he runs an online bike shop. A source close to the couple said: ‘It’s not going to be a Jordan wedding with all that kind of pumpkin carriages and tack. They are middle-class people with middle-class respectabilities. ‘It’s not like they’re taking over the entire castle in some vulgar show of excess. There’s a great hall that’s available and that’s where they’re having it. ‘They wanted to have as much of a . dream wedding as possible. They heard about Berkeley Castle and it was . available to book, so why not? It’s such a lovely setting.’ The . source added: ‘Freddie is an absolutely charming guy and Heidi is an . absolute sweetie. I’ve never heard a bad word said about either of them. None of their friends can believe what’s been said about Heidi. ‘Rude . and unpleasant are the last things you’d say about her. The view of . people who know them is that the problem lies with the mother in law.’ Enlarge . Mrs Bourne, 60, sent the e-mail to after she was less than impressed with her etiquette when she visited her Devon home in April . The couple declined to comment on the row yesterday. Mrs Bourne and her husband Edward confirmed they were ‘well aware’ of the criticism by Heidi’s father but still planned to go to the wedding. When asked if she thought it may be awkward, Mrs Bourne laughed: ‘We will see.’ It is high time someone explained to you about good manners. Yours are obvious by their absence and I feel sorry for you. Unfortunately . for Freddie, he has fallen in love with you and Freddie being Freddie, I . gather it is not easy to reason with him or yet encourage him to . consider how he might be able to help you. It may just be possible to . get through to you though. I do hope so. If . you want to be accepted by the wider Bourne family I suggest you take . some guidance from experts with utmost haste. There are plenty of . finishing schools around. Please, . for your own good, for Freddie’s sake and for your future involvement . with the Bourne family, do something as soon as possible. Here are a few examples of your lack of manners: . I . understand your parents are unable to contribute very much towards the . cost of your wedding. (There is nothing wrong with that except that . convention is such that one might presume they would have saved over the . years for their daughters’ marriages.) If . this is the case, it would be most ladylike and gracious to lower your . sights and have a modest wedding as befits both your incomes.","Carolyn Bourne told Heidi Withers she was 'an ideal candidate for Ladette to Lady television series'

"Though women are more likely to be the victims of rape in the military, male-on-male rape is still a serious problem sweeping the U.S. armed forces.

I try to make love to my wife, but I can't - I'm triggered. I'm traumatized by that sound.' This is problematic since men are much less likely to report these incidents, leaving their attackers in positions of power and keeping the pain inside to boil over into other relationships. The power structure within the military also makes these attacks more prevalent, because men in lower ranks may find it hard to report their attackers if they are superiors. 'When a gunnery sergeant tells you to take off your clothes, you better take off your clothes. You don't ask questions,' former Marine Sam Madrid (name changed) said. Before 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' was repealed, it also meant the possibility of a dishonorable discharge for engaging in homosexual behavior. When Kole Walsh was assaulted during his time in the Army in 2007, he decided not to report the incident for fear it could harm his military goals. Kole Welsh, Army, 2002 - 2007: 'I had actually let the assault go, because I didn't want it to interfere with my career. I wanted to be an officer, and I just said, ""Bad experience, won't let that happen again."" But there was some residual damage. A month and a half later, I was brought into a room with about nine officers and told, ""You've tested positive [for HIV]."" I was removed from the military and signed out within a day. It was a complete shock.' Heath Phillips, Navy, 1988-1989: 'I just couldn't handle working around men. I've done masonry work, but I'd last only a couple weeks. I would have outbursts. Sometimes sexual jokes would trigger me. I'd be like, ""Listen, you perverted scumbag..."" When things upset me, I yell [my attackers'] names out to people. The guys would just look at you like, This guy is crazy.' 'I had actually let the assault go, because I didn't want it to interfere with my career. I wanted to be an officer, and I just said, ""Bad experience, won't let that happen again."" But there was some residual damage. 'A month and a half later, I was brought into a room with about nine officers and told, ""You've tested positive [for HIV]."" I was removed from the military and signed out within a day. It was a complete shock,' Walsh told GQ. And when the men aren't silencing themselves, the military is doing it for them by discharging victims for misdiagnosed personality disorders and letting their attackers continue to serve. From 2001 to 2010, nearly 31,000 servicemen were involuntarily discharged for personality disorders with many being denied free VA treatment since many of these illnesses are considered pre-existing conditions. But even for those who are able to receive therapy through the VA, many don't get the kind of help that they need since the programs are mainly designed for women. 'When I first got out, I tried to seek treatment with the VA. It became an issue where every time I came back, it was a different person; they had interns filling in. Every time, I had to relive telling the story again. It just became too much. It's a joke,' Army vet Ted Skoranek added. 'One of the doctors said to me afterward, ""Son, men don't get raped,"" former Navy sailor Terry Neal said. Trent Smith, Air Force, enlisted 2011: 'He was a senior aide—he had a direct line to the top. Being invited over to his house, I just took it as I should go. Looking back, I ask myself, Why didn't you do anything? It wasn't like he held me down or tied me up. I didn't want to cross him. I really didn't feel like I had any choice. I had just turned 19. It could be my career. I froze and went along with it.' Another issue is the military justice system that has only convicted an 7 per cent of all MSP cases that go to trial, which is why an estimated 81 per cent of victims never even report. New York Senator Kristin Gillibrand fought to change this by proposing the Military Justice Improvement Act that would strip commanders of the power to prosecute sexual assaults, and give that decision to independent military prosecutors. While the bill won a majority in the senate, it was not enough votes to beat the threat of a filibuster. Meanwhile, the victims continue to suffer in silence. 'I'm terrified of men. I'm gay and I'm terrified of men,' former Army soldier Gary Jones (name changed) said. 'I can't even get an erection, especially since I got sober. I isolate. I don't go to movies, I can't handle concerts. I have horrid nightmares. 'Last Christmas, I went to dinner with some friends, and at one point I started panicking so bad I had to get out of the restaurant. I was shaking. I never even told anybody about this until last July. Do you know what it's like to live with this for thirty years?'",Men who enlist in the U.S. armed forces are ten times more likely to become victims of sexual assault .
"An 11-year-old with severe tinnitus is finally able to get a good night’s sleep after discovering listening to birds relieves his symptoms. Leo Bamford has suffered from the condition - which leaves him with a constant high-pitched ringing in his ears - since he was a toddler. Every night the noise kept him awake for hours and left him tired and groggy in the morning. Leo Bamford (pictured with his mother, Antonella) has had tinnitus since he was a toddler and struggled to sleep because the ringing in his ears disturbed him . But scientists at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge, have developed a special birdsong box which drowns out the noise, helping Leo to finally get some rest. His mother Antonella, 36, said since putting the recording in his bedroom Leo has become ‘a much happier little boy’. She said: ‘When he was little Leo was very sensitive to loud or unusual noises, would wake frequently, crying in the night and he used to hold a pillow to his ear. ‘At first we thought it was an ear infection or something he’d eventually grow out of. But it just seemed to get worse as he got older. Dr David Baguley (right), at Addenbrooke's Hospital, gave Leo a 'bird box' (left) which plays . recordings of birds singing. This gives his brain something other than . the tinnitus to focus on meaning it is easier for him to sleep . ‘Before the bird box, he would just . lie in bed just listening to the screeching for hours on end. It’s so . worrying as parents seeing your son like that. ‘But now he actually looks forward to going to bed, which was unheard of. It’s given him extra life. Tinnitus is a term that describes any sound a person can hear from inside their body. It is often described as a ringing in the ears but the sounds that can be heard include buzzing, humming, grinding and hissing. Sometimes the sound beats in time with the person's pulse. The condition can cause sleeping problems and depression but, in itself, it is not harmful. The underlying cause is not known but it can be caused by earwax, an ear infection, stress, a head injury or exposure to loud noise. There is no single cure for tinnitus but sometimes it can be addressed by treating the underlying cause - for example, through removing earwax build-ups. Tinnitus is often worse in quite environments so some people benefit from listening to soothing sounds, such as the sound of the ocean. The condition is most common in people over the age of 65 but it can affect people of all ages. About 10 per cent of the population are thought to have the condition, though most have it mildly. Source: NHS Choices . ‘He’s got so much more energy and his schoolwork has really improved. ‘After using it, he was able to sleep through the night for the first time in 11 years.’ Leo, from Luton, Bedfordshire, was referred to Addenbrooke’s by his GP. At the hospital he met hearing specialist Dr David Baguley who prescribed the sound box. The device is a small box with a digital recording of common garden birds singing which Leo can play and control as he wants. He has also been taught techniques to help manage the condition, like focusing on a particular sound so that his brain learns to ignore the tinnitus. Leo said: ‘It’s very high pitched and it’s always the same noise. It’s very annoying but most of the time I ignore it. ‘But there’s no other sounds at night, so I used to just lie there listening to it. ‘Now I turn on my bird box and I can get to sleep. I don’t have to listen to the noise at night anymore - it really helps. I’m so happy it’s working.’ Tinnitus is the sensation of a sound in the ear, often a hissing, whooshing or ringing noise. There is no known cure for the condition. It is not common in children, but experts are reporting a steady increase in the number of youngsters with the condition. Medics still don’t know what causes tinnitus. There are some contributing factors like . ageing, earwax, respiratory and ear infections, exposure to loud noise . and high blood pressure but the underlying cause is often unknown. Leo (pictured with his mother, Antonella) says he has now had the first good nights' sleep of his life and his mother says his school work has improved dramatically as a result . Dr Baguley said: ‘A third of people I see have some hearing loss and tinnitus is strongly associated with that. ‘In another third of cases, the tinnitus appears to have started at a time of great stress, bereavement, redundancy, illness, or some other major life event. ‘In another third we don’t know the specific cause.’","Leo Bamford has heard ringing in his ears since he was a toddler .

"Senator John McCain accidentally made Hillary Clinton 'leader of the free world' - if only for a second. The senior senator from Arizona and former GOP presidential nominee was responding on CBS' Face the Nation to a compliment from Clinton calling him her 'favorite Republican.' He uncomfortably laughed it off before mistakenly elevating her to the job she's expected to campaign for in 2016. Scroll down for video . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton embraces Senator John McCain as Senators Jeff Flake and Ron Johnson look on at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Capital Hill in 2013. In a slip of the tongue, McCain elevated Clinton to the highest job in the land, before taking it back . John McCain shares a laugh with Hillary Clinton before Senator John Kerry's nomination hearing to replace her as secretary of state in January 2013 . 'I hope this part of the program is blacked out in Arizona - please cut,' he joked as he made a slashing gesture over his neck. 'I respect Secretary, Senator Clinton. I respect . her views. We have had disagreements on a number of issues.' He then acknowledged Clinton's frontrunner status in a rather unorthodox way. 'I think it's my job to work with every president,' McCain said, before quickly adding while comically contorting his face with mock fear, 'If she is - regrettably - if she attains the presidency.' He then went on to describe his experiences working with her and other Democrats in the Senate in efforts to solve important issues. 'How do you do that? You got to reach across the aisle and work together . on certain issues,' he said. 'And I’m not only not embarrassed about that, I’m proud of it and I respect Hillary Clinton though I may not agree with her.' The Face the Nation incident was certainly a gaffe, but it may in some ways have been a Freudian slip. A few hawkish Republicans are beginning to warm up to a Hillary Clinton presidency as their own party takes an isolationist turn, according to The New York Times. And Clinton herself is considered by some so-called Neocons to favor a muscular US foreign policy. Hillary Clinton, President Barack Obama and Senator John McCain share the stage as candidates during the ABC/Facebook New Hampshire debates in Manchester in 2008 .","The Arizona senator was responding on a Sunday news show to Hillary Clinton's comment that he's her 'favorite Republican'

"Kentucky Senator Rand Paul's wife, Kelley, is his chief cheerleader and 'secret asset' to winning political power, according to a new Vogue magazine profile of the Republican rising star.

"Michael Phelps ended a months-long streak of social media silence that followed a rehab stint after a September DUI arrest with a photo that featured him and an old flame. The 29-year-old Olympian snapped a Thanksgiving dinner table family selfie on Thursday after two-months in recovery and included in the shot was none other than Miss California 2010 Nicole Johnson. The two have dated on-and-off going all the way back to 2007. They've reportedly been an item once again for weeks. Back at home: Recently out of a rehab stint that followed a September 30 DUI arrest, Michael Phelps has broken months of social media silence with a family Thanksgiving selfie that also includes his on-and-off girlfriend and former Miss California, Nicole Johnson . 'Out with my grizzlyman': Johnson also posted shots of herself with the scruffy-looking Olympian . Phelps, the winner of a world record 22 Olympic medals, had been totally silent on his social media since taking to Twitter on October 5 to apologize for his September 30 DUI arrest in Baltimore. While he remained silent, rumors swirled that he'd just begun dating a woman named Taylor Lianne Chandler just before his arrest. That self-proclaimed girlfriend claimed the two had met on Tinder and that Phelps is the one who pursued her. The buxom, blond 41-year-old then announced that she'd been born neither a man nor a woman, but intersex. ‘He pursued me [on Tinder],' Chandler told the Daily Beast. 'It felt real with him. I’ve been to his house four times, we talk everyday, and I’ve slept with him more than once.’ Johnson also posted this photo with Phelps and his family during Thanksgiving festivities . While Phelps remained silent and in rehab, rumors swirled he'd been dating this woman--41-year-old Taylor Lianne Chandler--just prior to his DUI arrest. Chandler made headlines when she claimed she was Phelps' lover and that she was born intersex . Phelps has not responded to Chandler's claims, but his re-emergence from rehab with Ms. Johnson at his side appears to be as good a response as any to the rumors. He and Johnson dated for three years up until a 2012 breakup, according to the Washington Post. According to TMZ, they are officially back on and went on a date to a movie last week. Also last week, the swimmer returned to training according to one of the Olympian's trainers. 'Michael is in Baltimore, happily back in the pool, working toward his goals for next year,' Keenan Robinson, director of athlete services at North Baltimore Aquatic Club, announced last Monday while accepting an award on behalf of Phelps, who was suspended for six months by USA Swimming following the September 30 DUI arrest, which was his second.","The Olympian has not been seen spotted since he went to rehab following a Maryland DUI arrest in September .

"Russia's top boxing expert has dismissed Mickey Rourke's 'victory' in the ring against Elliot Seymour as a public relations sham. Alexander Belenky, a former amateur boxer and veteran commentator, said the mach was 'just good PR action,' echoing claims the fight had been fixed. Others suggested the match had been put together an opportunity for the 62-year-old to make money by defeating 29-year-old Seymour. Scroll down for video . Sceptics have suggested Mickey Rourke's 'victory' was not genuine and that the actor's opponent surrendered the match . The actor, famed for his role in The Wrestler, beat his opponent in two rounds yesterday after a 20 year absence from the sport. Speaking of the match held in Moscow this week, Mr Belenky said: 'Mickey Rourke boxing - I'm too old for going to the circus.' 'This 'performance' is just a good PR action,' he added, describing Seymour as 'a born loser' who has 'won only once in the last ten years'. His accusations were echoed by other industry insiders including Andrey Bazdrev, former press secretary to the Russian Professional Boxing Federation, who dismissed it as 'open clownery'. 'The promoters won't speak about it openly, because if they do they would not have sold the tickets,' he said. Others suggested the fight had been planned as an opportunity for the actor to make money. Seymour, who was 33 years younger than the 62-year-old actor, went down in the second round of the match . Seymour jabs with his left during the bout in Moscow, Russia, on Friday night. Critics suggested the 29-year-old was chosen as he would be easily defeated by Bourke . '(His participation) was first of all a performance, The Wrestler movie in real life. 'And don't forget about the financial background of his come-back,' said commentator Dmitry Klipin.

"If expanding the guest list to include Michelle Obama at graduation for high school students in the Kansas capital city means fewer seats for friends and family, some students and their parents would prefer the first lady not attend. A furor over what the Topeka school district considers an honor has erupted after plans were announced for Obama to address a combined graduation ceremony for five area high schools next month an 8,000-seat arena. For some, it was the prospect of a tight limit on the number of seats allotted to each graduate. For others, it was the notion that Obama's speech, tied to the 60th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education outlawing segregation in schools, would overshadow the student's big day. Michelle Obama agreed to speak at Topeka High School which many consider an honor but others feel it will detract away from their graduation . A high school senior started a petition  against Michelle Obama speaking at Topeka High School's graduation and it ended up garnering more than 1,200 signatures . 'I'm a single mother who has raised him for 18 years by myself,' said Tina Hernandez, parent of Topeka High School senior Dauby Knight. 'I've told him education is the only way out. This is one of the biggest days of their lives. They've taken the glory and shine from the children and put on Mrs. Obama. She doesn't know our kids.' Hernandez was among the parents and students who spoke Thursday at a school board meeting and urged district officials to reconsider their decision to invite Obama. Ron Harbaugh, spokesman for the Topeka school district, said Friday discussions were under way to work out the logistics and planning for the event, including how many tickets each family would be allotted. 'We will have a clearer picture of what's going on,' Harbaugh said. Harbaugh said officials asked the president or first lady to speak at graduation as a tie-in with the anniversary of the Brown decision, which outlawed school segregation. The district plans to place a priority on seating students and their families, and could broadcast the event to an overflow room at a hotel adjacent to the graduation arena for those unable to find a seat inside. That's not good enough for Taylor Gifford, 18, who started an online petition on Thursday evening to urge the district to reconsider its plans. She and the more than 1,200 people who had signed it expressed concern that Obama's visit would limit the seating options for family and friends. 'I really would like it to have a peaceful solution, but there is so much misinformation going on,'Gifford said. Gifford said her initial reaction to the news was excitement, saying she was 'freaking out' about the prospect of the first lady speaking at graduation. When rumors of limited tickets surfaced, Gifford felt like the focus was being shifted from the students to Obama. Michelle Obama's speech would commemorate the Supreme Court decision of Brown versus the Board of Education outlawing segregation in schools . Symbolic: District leaders asked Mrs Obama to speak in Topeka, Kansas because it coincides with the 60th anniversary of the landmark school integration case, Brown vs. Board of Education . 'People think it's a great opportunity, but it's the graduates' time. They are getting that diploma that they worked so hard for,' Gifford said. 'Families are feeling that they are being cheated out of the loved ones special day.' Abbey Rubottom, 18, a Topeka High senior, described herself as a 'die-hard Democrat' but doesn't like the idea of Obama sharing the stage with graduates. 'No disrespect for the first lady, and it's amazing that she wants to come speak, I just think it doesn't belong at graduation,' Rubottom said. Rubottom suggested separate ceremonies with Obama speaking at one and the address being replayed at the other. Some people have said bringing in the first lady politicizes the graduation. Others have suggested that if she wants to mark the Brown anniversary, she could just visit the historic site that commemorates the decision, which is just few blocks from the graduation venue. The Brown site is housed in a former all-black school where the lead plaintiff's daughter and another plaintiff's child in the desegregation case were students. It tells the story of the 1954 Supreme Court decision. Messages seeking comment from the first lady's office in Washington were not immediately returned Friday.","Taylor Gifford, 18, started an .

"Fall from glory? Last year's number one store, Apple, has plummeted to 13th place due to 'bad service' Apple may be the darling of the tech geeks but ordinary shoppers have fallen out of love with the US giant. The chain’s high street outlets have dropped from first place to 13th in a league of the nation’s favourite retailers compiled by the consumer champions at Which? Its stores look beautiful and minimalist with glossy white walls and tables, where the sleek and stylish iPads, iPhones, iPods and MacBooks are displayed like precious pieces of jewellery. Staff float around serenely, full of American ‘have a nice day’ bonhomie, and are happy to help customers to spend £500 plus on the company’s latest piece of tech wizardry. But woe betide the poor individual who doesn’t know their FaceTime App from their Safari browser – for getting help can be extremely frustrating. People who want help in setting up, fixing or understanding the operation of their device can go to the store’s so-called ‘genius bar’, where Apple’s experts can work their magic. However, forget simply rolling up when on a shopping trip into town, for these ‘geniuses’ are often so busy that it can take days to get an appointment. The fact that so many people are waiting for help raises a question as to whether Apple’s devices are as simple and intuitive to use as the company and its British design chief, Sir Jonathan Ive, claim. Many tech industry experts have made the point that smart phones are actually far too smart, given that most people hardly ever use all the myriad of functions and Apps that are built in. It is this very complexity which confuses consumers and sends them to the Apple geniuses for advice. Which? said: ‘Last year’s winner Apple slipped down to 13th place after seeing nine per cent slashed off their customer score. Several customers complained about it being difficult to book an appointment with its ‘genius bar’ service, which helps consumers with technical problems.’ Customers are frustrated by the disorganised 'genius bar' service which is often booked up, Which? revealed . 1 Lush . 2 Disney Store . 3 Richer Sounds . 4 John Lewis . 5 Waterstones . 6= Clarks . 6= JoJo Maman Bebe . 6= Lakeland . 6= Screwfix . 10 White Stuff . 11= Bonmarche . 11= The Perfume Shop . 13 Apple . 14= Independent electricals . 14= Jones Bootmaker . 14= Maplin . 14= Sony Centre . 18 Dunelm Mill . 19 Wilkinson . 20= Early Learning Centre . 20= The Body Shop .

Ahrendts, who has been given a golden hello of shares worth around . £40million, was previously head of the luxury British fashion label . Burberry, where she was one of the UK’s highest paid women executives. Top of the high street poll this year is the natural beauty products chain Lush, where staff were praised for their personal service, ahead of the Disney Store, Richer Sounds, John Lewis and Waterstones. For the second year in a row bottom place went to WH Smith with shoppers complaining of ‘crowded stores with limited stock’. Other poor performers were Homebase, HMV, EE the mobile phone chain and the 99p Stores. The Which? magazine editor, Richard Headland, said: ‘We’ve seen time and again that people won’t settle for bad customer service and this is supported by the results of our high street shops survey. Stores giving people the care and attention they want have happy customers who return.’ The results are bad news for Apple which is under pressure to reinvigorate its reputation for innovation and delivering gadgets which quickly become lifestyle essentials. In recent years, following the death of Apple founder Steve Jobs, the tech giant’s success has been built on small innovations to existing products, such as the thinner and lighter iPad Air. There have also been new versions of the iPhone, including a plastic version that was billed as a cheaper option but turned out to be more expensive than most smartphones. The company has been rumoured to be . launching an iWatch with built-in health functions for the past two . years, however in the meantime rivals such as Samsung and Sony have been . allowed the space to launch their own.

Contrast: Lush, the beauty product store, topped this year's list as customers praised their good service . Apple said it had no comment on the findings. A WHSmith spokesman said: 'This exercise is very misleading as WHSmith does not fit into any of the survey categories, while products like newspapers and magazines are not those that customers would ‘recommend’ a retailer for. 'The 104 customers that commented on WHSmith in this survey are not reflective of the 12 million customers that visit our stores each week, where our own independent survey of over a thousand customers continues to rate us highly.'","Which? survey said customers frustrated by disorganised help service .

"It was three decades since they last appeared on stage together, and tickets cost upwards of £75 a head, but the Monty Python crew had no trouble packing the O2 with fans last night. Monty Python Live (mostly) - so named because one of the original group, Graham Chapman, died 25 years ago - was organised, as the septuagenarian comedians happily admitted, to 'make a lot of money' for them.

Cutting to the chase: This Twitter user referred to the comedians' admission they needed more money . 'Once they were the sharpest thing in satire.  Last night, quite often, they looked and sounded like a dodgy tribute band.' He described Cleese as 'all implausible teeth and pot belly', while Gilliam, who was 'wearing one of those irritating ponytails old groovers of a certain era like to sport, 'seemed barely gripped by proceedings.' The Mirror said the show's appeal lay in the fact that there was nothing new. 'It's not something completely different but that's exactly why fans will love it,' said Mark Jeffries, whose only criticism was not seeing enough of the Pythons onstage compared with the dancers. The Express understood that the comedians, who range in age from 74 (Cleese) to 71 (Idle and Palin), needed time to 'recover from their exertions'. How they were: From left, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, and Graham Chapman who died in 1989 . Enthusiastic review: The Twitter verdict wasn't all bad - this fan said last night's show was 'amazing' The way they were: The dead parrot sketch, originally aired in 1969, was brought back to life at the O2 . 'It's a tall order for a bunch of old men and I think we can cut them some slack,' writes Neil Norman, who said they have 'embedded themselves in the cultural memory'. But the i lamented the lack of new material, calling the show 'a lazy production' that relied on television footage and 'the whooping adulation of an audience who know all the words'. Reviewer John Walsh admitted that some of the old sketches were 'still very funny' but said it became a little tiresome. And comedian Russell Kane conceded it was a show for existing fans, rather than new converts. Tweeting after the show he wrote: 'Witnessed legends in action.' Someone enjoyed it: Actor Stephen Fry, who made a brief appearance, tweeted about last night's show . The Guardian was less enthusiastic, concluding that the show 'isn't bad'.  'This live show won't make any converts. But it sends the faithful away happy,' said Peter Bradshaw. Most enthusiastic, perhaps not surprisingly, given his brief on-stage appearance last night, was actor Stephen Fry, who tweeted afterwards: 'Oh my days. Just seen @montypython @TheO2 - in fact I made a little surprise appearance. Felt like being on stage with the Beatles *sigh* !' Five tuxedo'd old geezers, necks like tortoises, creaked and croaked through a patchy night of their greatest hits. The Monty Pythons were back, courtesy of their vitamin quacks and John Cleese's ex-wife's divorce lawyer. Once they were the sharpest thing in satire. Last night, quite often, they looked and sounded like a dodgy tribute band. We're . ok: The Lumberjack Song took its inspiration from a discussion Palin . had with an assistant cameraman, in which the subject was, the . cameraman’s former jobs. One of the jobs was revealed to be that of a . lumberjack . But . the show finally reached something worthy of the hype and the high . prices (some tickets on the black market were going for close to £200) when they gave us such old favourites as the Spam sketch, the dead . parrot sketch and best of all 'I Want An Argument'. Messrs Cleese, Gilliam, Idle, Jones and Palin were appearing without Graham Chapman, deceased. Hence the title for the show. Age . has not been kind to Cleese who is all implausible teeth and pot belly . these days - he is too lame to do the silly walks these days. Gilliam . was wearing one of those irritating ponytails old groovers of a certain . era like to sport. He seemed barely gripped by proceedings. Palin . and Idle were the busiest, the most enthusiastic. Palin has the milky . gaze of a retired geography teacher but he still looks perfect in a . brown shop assistant's coat. Python fans filled the vast O2 and some of them had turned up in costumes - hankies on heads, braces, Viking helmets, etc. One . the menu: Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce, served . in a Provençale manner with shallots and aubergines, garnished with . truffle pate, brandy and a fried egg on top and Spam . Eric Idle bursts into song on the opening night of Monty Python Live (Mostly) at the O2 . They . shouted along to the best-known sketches and cheered as soon as they . heard familiar cues. Yet some ardent Pythonites in front of me kept . yawning. No . opportunity was missed to milk this loyal public. Shops flogged Python . merchandise, from £50 hoodies to £15 romper suits for babies. Several punters could be heard complaining about the cost of the programme (20 quid to you guvnor for 48 pages). Argument clinic: Michael Palin plays a man who pays to have an argument with a very contrary John Cleese . In . the interval an oh-so-jokey 'Merch-o-meter' was flashed up on screen to . mock the idea of the Pythons' greed. Ho ho! But laughing at yourself . does not necessarily expunge the rapaciousness. Stephen . Fry made a brief appearance on stage to talk about getting a lightbulb . getting stuck up his back passage. Better was a cameo by Stephen Hawking . - was it really him? We saw him in a film clip driving his wheelchair . into TV's Prof Brian Cox and pushing him in the River Cam. The Chancellor, George Osborne, was also in the audience, perhaps collecting tips for his next raid on the super-rich. The . Python humour, at its best (and last night that mainly meant old film . clips such as the 100 Yards Race for People With No Sense of Direction), . is genius. At . its less good it has aged. Inuendo no longer buys many spuds. Gags . about the mentally deficient, gays and people with stammers are not much . cop - but I did quite enjoy the camp judges. What . would the old Pythons have made of these sad old chaps? They might have . taken the rise out of them. Maybe we should we more merciful and just . thank them for the old memories.","Monty Python Live (mostly) opened a ten-night run in London last night .

"Ed Miliband was ridiculed yesterday after laying a wreath honouring the First World War dead with a scruffy message that read: 'From the Leader of the Opposition' . The note, scrawled with a black marker by an organiser, was left at the Cenotaph in Glasgow yesterday and has been branded 'pathetic' and 'distasteful'. But the Labour leader's team say he was denied the chance to write his own message and was only handed the wreath moments before he put it down. Scroll down for video . Contrast: A row has erupted online after David Cameron left a handwritten note on a WW1 wreath but Ed Miliband's just said his title and was written with a black marker . Incident: Political leaders were asked to lay tributes by Mr Miliband's team say he was handed his seconds before he put it down and was not allowed to write his own message . In contrast David Cameron's message read: 'Your most enduring legacy is our liberty. We must never forget' and was signed personally by the Prime Minister. The Prince of Wales also wrote his own note, which said: 'In everlasting memory, Charles'. Nick Clegg also put down a wreath with a note in the same handwriting, which only said: 'From the Deputy Prime Minister'. The incident has led to a row online with some calling Mr Miliband 'pathetic' and others claiming he had been 'stitched up'. Sarah Cochrane wrote: 'I think Ed Miliband's message on the wreath is pathetic. He couldn't even be bothered to write his own name'. Marion Armer said 'he must have put a lot of thought into that tribute'. Defence: Labour supporters say that Mr Miliband has been 'stitched up' over the incident . Similar: The wreath put down by Nick Clegg also had a note containing his job title . This tribute from the People of Scotland was also written in the same black marker . Commemorations:  Prince Charles, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband were taking part in a series of events being held 100 years to the day after the start of the First World War . Others, including former Tory MP Louise Mensch, compared the incident to accusations former Labour leader Michael Foot wore a donkey jacket at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 1981. Mr Foot denied the claims and said the coat was an expensive gift from his wife. Ms Mensch . added: 'I am stunned by Ed Miliband's WWI centenary wreath message, . which is arrogant, disrespectful and just plain rude.' Gordon . Brown's former spin doctor Damian McBride said in a blog post: 'Did Ed . Miliband’s team really forget to have that conversation with the . ceremony organisers? 'Was the first any of them knew about the message on . the wreath really when it was handed to their leader 30 seconds before . he had lay it.

Government-organised ceremony and 'Ed was handed the wreath seconds . before and had not chance to write his own message.This was essentially a . label being used by the organisers to give him the right wreath'.

"Quizzed: Former News of the World executive Neil Wallis leaves Hammersmith police station yesterday . The head of Scotland Yard was given a dressing down last night for employing a News of the World phone hacking suspect as a £1,000-a-day consultant. Sir Paul Stephenson also faces being dragged before MPs to explain himself after sensationally admitting Neil Wallis, former executive editor of the Sunday tabloid, worked for the force for 11 months. Wallis, 60, was employed to advise Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul and Assistant Commissioner John Yates on a part-time basis from October 2009 to September 2010. But it was only yesterday, hours after Wallis was arrested in a dawn swoop over phone hacking allegations, that Sir Paul informed London Mayor Boris Johnson of the lucrative deal which netted Wallis £24,000. Last night Home Secretary Theresa May and an angry Mr Johnson both demanded answers from Sir Paul about his relationship with Wallis. Critics said it proved the relationship between the paper, closed down last Sunday, and Britain’s biggest police force ‘stank to high heaven’. Earlier this week Sir Paul briefed the Prime Minister at Downing Street on the hacking scandal. But last night stunned sources at No 10 said the Met chief made no mention of the Wallis appointment. He has now been summoned to explain himself before the Home Affairs Select Committee next week. Sir Paul’s admission deepens the controversy over the Met’s handling of the hacking case. Critics claim some senior officers had been ‘too close’ to Wallis and former News of the World editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks. Sir Paul has dined with Wallis on at least eight occasions since 2006, according to official records. Mr Yates has admitted knowing him for 12 years. Wallis, nicknamed the ‘Wolfman’ during his Fleet Street days, landed the lucrative Scotland Yard consultancy in October 2009, five months after he left the News of the World. Under pressure: MPs want  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson to explain how Scotland Yard came to employ Neil Wallis . He worked for the Yard two days a month. Because he was a consultant working from home, he was not vetted for the job, which involved advising the Commissioner on speeches. Sources said he had to ‘provide strategic communication advice and support’ and did not advise on operational matters. He did not have a security pass at New Scotland Yard, where he was ‘escorted at all times’. He was appointed by the director of public affairs at Scotland Yard, Dick Fedorcio, following consultations with Sir Paul and Mr Yates. Summons: Rupert Murdoch will appear before a Commons committee next Tuesday, and Sir Paul Stephenson may also be joining him . Last night Theresa May wrote to the Commissioner asking him to provide a ‘full picture’. A source close to Mr Johnson said he was ‘very cross and concerned’ about the revelations. The source said the Mayor had summoned Sir Paul ‘to explain himself’ during a 90-minute showdown at London’s City Hall. Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘This all stinks to high heaven. I have been saying for some time that the relationship between the Met and, in particular, the News of the World has been so close as to frankly smack of  collusion. Concern: Critics claim that Scotland Yard officers were too close to Former News of the World editors Andy Coulson (left) and Rebekah Brooks (right), who will both come before MPs on Tuesday, with Rupert Murdoch . ‘Some people may think we have got to the bottom of this – I think we are only halfway down.’ Earlier Sir Paul was forced to defend his relationship with Wallis when he appeared before the Metropolitan Police Authority. The Met chief, who has been widely praised for his leadership of the Yard since succeeding bungle-prone Sir Ian Blair, insisted his integrity was ‘completely intact’. Wallis, who works in PR, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to intercept mobile phone messages in a dawn raid on his Chiswick, West London, home at 6.30am. He spent ten hours in custody before being released from Hammersmith police station. His contract to advise the yard ceased four months before the new phone hacking probe was launched in January this year. Coulson, 43, who was Downing Street communications chief until January this year, was himself arrested by detectives last Friday over alleged phone hacking and illegal payments to police. He was released on bail until October.","Former executive editor Neil 'Wolfman' Wallis was paid £1,000 a day .

"The ultimate gentleman: Sir Winston Churchill (pictured in 1943) has been voted the greatest British gentleman of the last century . Sir Winston Churchill has been named the greatest British gentleman of the last century in a new poll. The former Prime Minister, who inspired the nation to stand in defiance of Hitler during World War Two, topped the survey of 4,000 people to uncover the greatest gentlemen in modern memory. Runner-up went to Sir David . Attenborough, Britain’s best-known natural history film maker who . brought the hidden secrets of the world to living rooms across the . country with programs like Life, The Blue Planet and Frozen Planet. Churchill will forever be remembered . for embodying the strength and spirit of Britain in one of its darkest . periods, rousing the public with stirring speeches and broadcasts that . gave hope to millions. Bronze . went to Stephen Fry, whose intelligent and amusing contributions to our . TV screens and Twitter feeds have made him a national treasure. A . spokesman for Austin Reed, which carried out the poll, said: ‘Sir . Winston Churchill showed unprecedented courage and strength to lead this . country and is a worthy choice as the greatest British gentleman. ‘In fact, Austin Reed made Winston Churchill’s famous siren suits during the war. ‘There were plenty of great contenders . for the role, and the results are a pleasing reminder of the number of . great characters and personalities that inspire the general public. ‘It’s nice to see modern men in the list such as David Beckham, Jenson Button and David Tennant. ‘They all epitomise effortless style and have a real flair for fashion - which is an essential trait for any gentleman.’ It was a regal finish for Prince William who came in fourth, with this year’s Royal Wedding coverage evidence of the place the young Prince holds in the British public’s hearts. What a charmer: Sir David Attenborough, who came in second place, pictured on his BBC show Frozen Planet with a polar bear . The gents: Stephen Fry (left) came in third place, while David Beckham (right) was voted ninth place in the poll . And it was screen royalty that rounded off the top five in the shape of Colin Firth, who wowed us with his Oscar-winning portrayal of King George VI in The King’s Speech. Actor David Niven took sixth spot, while it was 007 for former Bond star Roger Moore, with Michael Caine coming in eighth. Sporting superstar David Beckham could only manage ninth place, while Saturday night sensation Bruce Forsyth completed the top 10. Other men to feature included newsreader Trevor McDonald at number 11, actors Hugh Grant at 12, David Jason at 14 and pop star Cliff Richard at number 17. The front runners: Oscar winner Colin Firth (left) came in fifth spot, while fellow actor Hugh Grant (right)was number 13 . Younger gentlemen: Young men to make the list were Robert Pattinson (left) at 44 and Prince Harry at 25 . Former Doctor Who star David Tennant was voted the 22nd greatest gent, and Sir Ian McKellen came in at 23rd. And there may be arguments at the palace as Prince Harry finished a place above his father, Prince Charles in 25th. A surprising appearance for Simon Cowell placed the usually sharp-tongued pop guru as the 35th greatest British gentlemen. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton overtook his fellow driver Jenson Button to land 40th spot, while vampire heartthrob Robert Pattinson made number 43. Men in the spotlight: Lewis Hamilton came in 41st spot, while media mogul Simon Cowell was voted number 36 . A spokesman for Austin Reed added: ‘Everyone has a different view on what makes a proper English gentleman whether it’s manners, sense of humour or even accent and it’s good to see a diverse range in this list from Hugh Grant to Michael Parkinson or Trevor McDonald. ‘A man’s dress sense is a huge part of his persona and British classic style has always been what one associates with the concept of a gentleman. ‘Classic, heritage style is on the rise, and with that, we hope for a resurgence of the gentleman too.’ 1.

"A 20-year-old woman has been left brain dead - after she was Tasered by police and smacked her head on the ground. Danielle Maudsley had been taken to a Florida Highway Patrol Station after being arrested for a suspected hit-and-run in September. Handcuffed, she ran out of the door. But as footage from a police cruiser dashboard camera reveals, Trooper Daniel Cole, who this week was cleared of any wrongdoing, fired a Taser's electric probes into her back. Scroll down for video... Impact: The moment Danielle Maudsley, 20, was Tasered by Trooper Daniel Cole after she tried to escape the police station . Then and now: Danielle Maudsley before the Tasering (left) and unconscious in her hospital room (right) She spun, fell backwards and hit her head on the ground. Bleeding and crying she tried to get up. She then blacked out and has remained unconscious ever since. Doctors say Danielle, who was found to have cocaine and oxycodone in her system at the time, is unlikely to ever wake up. Her mother Cheryl has slammed the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and Florida Department of Law Enforcement for its reports that both cleared Cole. She told the Tampa Bay Times she was suing FHP, and added: 'Tell me that's not excessive force. I'm not saying she was an angel, but she didn't deserve that. 'He couldn't reach out and grab her? He was an arm's length away. My daughter is dead because of this. She won't come back.' Danielle, . who had a suspended driving licence, was arrested earlier that day for . allegedly leaving the scene of two traffic accidents. Brutal: Danielle Maudsley pictured after hitting the ground (left), and trying to sit up (right) Cuffed: Danielle Maudsley pictured in the patrol car shortly after her arrest . At the station, she tried to escape. Cole, worried she would be hit by a car as she ran towards the direction of U.S. 19, gave chase. He said that because of the immediacy of the situation, and the fact he feared one or both of them would be injured if he tackled her, he went for his Taser. When asked if he would have done anything differently, he said: 'No, I would not have.' Experts have now questioned the use of the Taser. Greg Connor, professor at the University of Illinois Police Training Institute who specialises in use of force, said: 'It just doesn't make any sense. I don't see where it's going to be that hard to apprehend her.' And nationally known use-of-force expert Dave Klinger, a retired Los Angeles police officer and professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said it was an an 'inappropriate' police tactic. But Sgt Steve Gaskins said: 'The Florida Department of Law Enforcement conducted an independent review.

It was Manchester 2002 when the people who ran Scotland’s biggest city and Commonwealth Games council started believing they could put on their own show. But . the work really began towards the end of 2007 when the west of Scotland . city was confirmed as the host for the 2014 Games, beating Abuja, the . Nigerian capital. Since then the London Olympics has given Glasgow further inspiration, but a lot to live up to. Michael Cavanagh, the Commonwealth . Games Scotland chairman, said: ‘What we are about to deliver in Glasgow, . I think, will be the best ever Commonwealth Games, for sure. ‘We have learned from Manchester and particularly London 2012, but we are ready to deliver something spectacular.’ The road to Glasgow 2014 has had some hitches along the way. A . plan to demolish five unoccupied tower blocks - the city’s iconic Red . Road flats - during the opening ceremony was scrapped after a furore . over the message it was sending out and the impact on the sixth tower’s . residents. But Glaswegians and Scots in general . look set to embrace the prospect of the first Commonwealth Games in . their country for 28 years, with more than 1.1 million tickets sold. First Minister Alex Salmond believes the impact of the Glasgow 2014 Games will be felt in Scotland for generations to come. He said they will ‘showcase the great . strengths of modern Scotland’ as he pointed to their ability to serve as . a catalyst for greater international trade, investment and tourism. With a nod to Glasgow’s renowned warm spirit, he said: ‘The Commonwealth Games traditionally are known as the friendly Games. ‘The whole of Glasgow, the whole of Scotland, is determined to ensure that these Games live up to that billing and that they become recognised as the friendliest Games and the finest Games ever.’ When the sporting action gets under way tomorrow, more than 4,500 sports men and women will compete in events across 17 sports until August 3. On the move: Scotland football manager Gordon Strachan carries the Queen's Baton through Mount Florida in Glasgow last week . The Queen's baton will reach its final destination at the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games after a journey of more than 120,000 miles. The baton has travelled through 70 nations and territories since it was sent on its way by the Queen at Buckingham Palace last October. The unique hand-crafted baton, made of titanium, wood and granite, has been carried by tens of thousands around the globe during its epic 248-day tour around the Commonwealth. It visited Asia, Oceania, Africa, North and South America, the Caribbean and Europe before returning to the UK and finally to Scotland. Baton-bearers have included top athletes and celebrities such as Britain's most successful Olympian Sir Chris Hoy, diver Tom Daley and singer Susan Boyle. But thousands more ‘local champions’ have also held aloft the symbol of the Glasgow Games on its journey. Its final lap took the baton the length and breadth of Scotland for 40 days, with 4,000 bearers joining in the nation's biggest ever relay in more than 400 communities. The baton arrived in Glasgow on Sunday, and will be handed back to the Queen at the opening ceremony at Celtic Park tonight. There the Queen will officially begin the Games by reading aloud her message of support to Commonwealth athletes, which she placed inside the baton at the start of its journey. The secret note was written during a summer stay at her Scottish retreat of Balmoral and was housed in a transparent cylinder within the baton's pure titanium lattice-work frame. The relay is a tradition that started in 1958, and symbolises the gathering of people from across the Commonwealth. It shares similarities with the Olympic torch relay, but there is only one baton rather than the hundreds of torches used to carry the Olympic flame.","Spectacle at Celtic Park is described by organisers as the most prestigious live event ever seen in Scotland .

"A fish caught close the the Fukushima nuclear plant is over 2,500 times the legal safe radiation limit for seafood, the plant's operator has revealed. The company Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) caught the fish, dubbed 'Mike the Murasai' online, in the bay close to the Fukukshima . Daiichi main reactor. It was confirmed by Tepco to have amounts of radioactive . cesium equal to 254,000 becquerels per kilogram, or 2540 times the limit . of 100 becquerels/kg set for seafood by the government. The Murasoi caught by Tokyo Electric Power which had over 2,500 times the legal limit of radiation for seafood due to Fukushima fallout . A Becquerel (BQ) is a . unit of radioactive decay equal to one disintegration per second. The . Becquerel is the basic unit of radioactivity used in the international . system of radiation units, referred to as the “SI” units. 37 billion . (3.7×1010) becquerels = 1 curie (Ci). The maximum level of radiation allowed in foods for human consumption is 100 becquerels/kilogram. Scientists in the region are increasingly worried . that other fish in the area are feeding off these and other contaminated . species. However, the murasoi specimen caught . near Fukushima did not seem to show any major abnormalities in terms of . its physical appearance. Tepco is installing a new series of nets beneath the surface . of the water around the 20 kilometer perimeter in hopes of restricting . the migration of the contaminated fish outside of the region. A report in October last year found radiation levels in most kinds of fish caught off the coast of Fukushima haven't declined in the year following Japan's nuclear disaster in March 2011. An earthquake knocked out nuclear plant's cooling system, causing three reactor cores to melt and spew radiation into the ocean. Researchers believe that deposits of the chemical cesium on the seafloor or leakage from the damaged reactors is continuing to contaminate the waters - and has the potential to threaten fisheries for decades. The levels in the fish are also 10 times higher than the radiation measured last August in scorpion fish caught near Fukushima. The crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant is seen in Okumamachi, Fukushima prefecture, northern Japan. Experts have found a fish in a nearby port over 2,500 time the legal limit for radioactivity in seafood . On 21 August last year, Tepco announced that rockfish caught in the Pacific Ocean within the circular area of ​​20 km around the plant, which is closed to all human activity, had a level of 25,800 becquerels of cesium per kilogram . The fish is a murasoi, which typically lives in shallow waters near reefs in the region.

"Crackdown: David Cameron will unveil plans to stamp out the 'scandal' of binge drinking . David Cameron will declare war on the scourge of cheap alcohol today. As part of a series of measures to stamp out what he condemns as the ‘scandal’ of binge drinking, the Prime Minister will make clear the Government wants to introduce a minimum price for alcohol and put higher taxes on strong lagers. He will throw his weight behind plans to emulate Scotland where supermarkets and pubs are forced to charge a minimum of 45p per unit of alcohol to prevent the cut-price selling blamed for fuelling the orgy of public drunkenness. His wide-ranging crackdown will also include plans for: . On a trip to a hospital in the North East, Mr Cameron will announce that treating patients with alcohol problems and victims of drunken attacks costs the NHS £2.7billion a year, or £90 for every taxpayer in Britain. Last year there were 200,000 hospital admissions with a primary alcohol-related diagnosis, 40 per cent higher than in 2003. The number of patients admitted with acute intoxication has more than doubled to 18,500 over the same period. Mr Cameron will say: ‘This is one of the scandals of our society and I am determined to deal with it. This is an area where the drinks industry, supermarkets, pubs and clubs need to work with government so that responsible drinking becomes a reality and not just a slogan. Booze Britain: There were 200,000 hospital admissions for alcohol-related conditions last year - up more than 40 per cent since 2003 . ‘Whether it’s the police officers in A&E that have been deployed in some hospitals, the booze buses in Soho and Norwich, or the drunk tanks used abroad, we need innovative solutions to confront the rising tide of unacceptable behaviour.’ Senior sources say the plans will be published in full in the Government’s long-awaited alcohol strategy due next month, but final decisions could be delayed until the Budget on March 21 since decisions on duty would have to be announced to Parliament by the Chancellor. The plans are bound to provoke scepticism as to whether raising prices will be enough to change the behaviour of young drinkers, but they are supported by groups like Alcohol Concern. Tory MPs have also expressed concerns about minimum pricing, amid fears that voters would be angered by paying extra for alcohol during a time of austerity. But Mr Cameron is willing to overrule embattled Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, who fears minimum pricing will hurt the poor, because it would be popular with many in the medical profession who are fighting the Government’s NHS reforms. Mr Cameron will say: ‘Every night, in town centres, hospitals and police stations across the country, people have to cope with the consequences of alcohol abuse. And the problem is getting worse. End of cheap alcohol: The Government could impose a minimum price for alcohol. In Scotland there is a minimum price of 45p per unit . ‘Over the last decade we’ve seen a frightening growth in the number of people – many under-age – who think it’s acceptable to get drunk in public in ways that wreck lives, spread fear and increase crime. ‘As figures today show, the NHS is having to pick up an ever-growing bill of £2.7billion a year, including £1billion on accident and emergency services alone. That’s money we have to spend because of the reckless behaviour of an irresponsible minority. ‘Across the country hospitals, ambulance crews and the police are rising to the challenge. We must help them to do so and will be setting out how through the forthcoming Alcohol Strategy. ‘This isn’t just about more rules and regulation. It’s about responsibility and a sense of respect for others.’ A recent official study found that setting a minimum price of 30p a unit would prevent 300 deaths a year, 40p about 1,000 deaths, and 50p more than 2,000 premature deaths. The new measures will be accompanied by an ‘aggressive’ public health campaign and a more draconian approach to curtailing the sale of alcohol in shops, pubs and clubs. In America, police keep cells aside as ‘drunk tank’ holding pens for binge-drinkers to be incarcerated until they sober up. For the past two years an alcohol recovery centre has been set up in Soho, London, over the Christmas period. Drunken revellers are given advice on alcohol abuse as they recover from their nights out and wait to be collected by friends or family. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘A final decision is to be taken on the alcohol strategy, but this is an idea the Prime Minister has said publicly that he is interested in.’","Alcohol-related disorder costs NHS £2.7bn a year .

"A new survey of retired NFL players' brains has found signs of a degenerative disease in what is heralded as the first evidence of early detection in former players while they're still alive. Until now, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) had not been spotted in the brains of players until after their death. Such was the case with former NFL linebacker Junior Seau, who was found to have the disease - which can lead to dementia and behavioral problems - months after he committed suicide in May. NFL players who suffer repeated head injuries in the course of their professional careers could be more prone to CTE, but it has been reported in other athletes and members of the military. Scroll down for video . Study: Brain scan imaging shows a normal brain, left, and the brains of two of the five former NFL players who have shown signs of having CTE from hits they took in their careers . Loss: Former linebacker Junior Seau, in Dec. 2008, committed suicide in 2012. An autopsy showed he suffered from a degenerative brain disease after 20 seasons in the NFL . Scientists at UCLA used a new image . technique to analyze the impact of head trauma on the brain health of . five retired NFL players. Results . from the scans, known as positron emission tomography (PET), show the . accumulation of abnormal tau protein, which can indicate the onset of . future brain disease. The tau proteins are believed to be connected to CTE and Alzheimer's disease. 'This is the first time we have done these PET scans in NFL players who are retired,' Dr Gary Small, UCLA’s Parow-Solomon Professor on aging and a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA, told FoxNews.com. Degeneration: Another recent study of CTE shows a comparison between normal brain tissue, left, compared with that of an NFL player, center, and a 70-year-old former boxer, right . Dominating: Seau, right, was one of the most feared linebackers in football . 'So it's the first time to show what . we think are these tau protein deposits. What's extraordinary about that . is the patterns of the deposits were identical to patterns in CTE, . which is only diagnosed through autopsy. The logical conclusion is . that's what we’re seeing - suggestive this is the first time we're . visualizing CTE.' Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with cognitive and behavioral problems later in life and can eventually cause dementia. Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions. In recent years, CTE has been shown to exist in other athletes, including professional and college football players and pro hockey players. Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later. To test . the brain imaging scan, Dr Small injected a chemical biomarker called . FDDNP, which attaches to the tau proteins, into the brains of the five . former athletes. This allowed scientists to identify which sections of the brain had higher levels of FDDNP. Scans revealed that the more concussions the athlete had experienced, the higher levels of tau protein were discovered. Seau was a star linebacker for 20 NFL seasons with the San Diego Chargers, Miami Dolphins and . New England Patriots before retiring in 2009. He died of a self-inflicted shotgun . wound. An autopsy on the athlete showed he suffered from the brain disease. He joins a list of several dozen football players who have had CTE. CTE often impacts a person's behavior with symptoms including depression, suicidal thoughts and memory loss. 'There are other connections here that are relevant,' Small said. 'Recent studies have found that NFL players have a four times greater probability of dying from Alzheimer's than the general population. 'In other studies, if you look at people, not just athletes, but people in general who’ve had a concussion that has led to an hour of unconsciousness - it doubles their risk of Alzheimer’s.'

"A mentally ill grandfather died after police officers strapped him naked to a chair, smothered him with a 'spit hood' and pepper-sprayed him 10 times during a 43-hour ordeal, it has been claimed. Nick Christie, 62, was allegedly tortured in the 'Devil's Chair' at Lee County jail after being detained by Florida police officers in March 2009 following a 'mental breakdown'. The hood, designed to stop him from spitting at officers, meant he could not escape the noxious spray's fumes - and he was never allowed to clean the residue from his body. His family is now suing Lee County Sheriff's Department for 'wrongful death'. Scroll down for video... Tortured: Nick Christie was placed in a 'Devil's Chair' and repeatedly pepper-sprayed during a 43-hour ordeal, it has been claimed . The retired boilermaker had suffered from heart disease and emphysema, put down to his years as a smoker and of continual exposure to asbestos . The incident has raised concern about the behaviour of U.S. police officers, especially as no-one has ever been charged in connection with the alleged crime. It is not clear who exactly took the shocking photograph, which was later handed to FOX 13's news team, of Christie strapped into the chair with a hood over his face. The retired boilermaker, from Ohio, had suffered from heart disease and emphysema, put down to his years as a smoker and of continual exposure to asbestos. He was being treated for depression when he decided to take some time out and visit his brother in Fort Myers. Prior to the trip, his doctor moved away, leaving no-one to manage his emotional state or possible side effects of his drugs. His wife Joyce was so worried about his trip that she contacted Lee County police to ask them to keep an eye out for him. She also asked a captain from the . Girard, Ohio, police to urge his Florida counterparts to take him to . hospital if they found him. Christie . was first arrested on March 25 for being drunk in a public place. This . has subsequently been contested as he may merely have been in a severely . confused state. He was . released after telling jail attendants of his various medical . conditions. Two days later, on March 27, he was arrested for trespassing . at the hotel where he was staying. Shocking: Nick Christie, pictured in the restraining chair at Lee County jail . Moved: Nick Christie was eventually taken to hospital, after 43-hours of what has been claimed was 'torture' at the hands of deputies . Nicholas DiCello, whose Cleveland firm Spangenberg Shibley & Liber has filed a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of his estate, said it was a 'minor' offence. He said: 'He was having another mental episode. He was bewildered, acting crazy, and so the hotel got fed up and asked him to leave. When he didn't go, they called the police.' Worried: Joyce Christie said she had been concerned about her husband's trip to Florida . DiCello said jail staff did not screen Christie's mental health before he was jailed, even though they had the list of his conditions from his first arrest, and locked his medications in a truck. He was never given any drugs during his 43 hours in custody, he also claimed. The trouble started when Christie, who was uncooperative from the time of his arrest, became angry. Deputies responded by directly spraying him or fogging his cell with pepper spray at least 10 times. He was never allowed to wash the spray off. Other inmates in the jail told Fort Myers News-Press that the blasts were so strong the secondary effects caused them to gag. Christie was then placed into a restraining chair to bind inmates at both wrists, both ankles, and across the chest. Inmates, along with a deputy trainee named Monshay Gibbs, have already testified that Christie was sprayed at least two more times after he had been strapped to the chair. He was also stripped naked, and outfitted with a spit mask, a hood designed to prevent inmates from spitting on jail personnel. But the mask kept the pepper spray close to his nose and mouth, meaning he kept inhaling it for six hours. Christie, whose wife Joyce flew to Florida on hearing of his arrest, is said to have pleaded with officers by saying the mask made it difficult for him to breathe. DiCello added: 'She was actually relieved to hear he had been arrested She thought they had responded to her pleas for help, that they would take him to a hospital to be treated.' Unaccounted for: No one at Lee County Sheriff's Department has ever been charged over the horrific incident . Mrs Christie was not allowed to see her husband who, on March 29, went into respiratory distress and was taken to the Gulf Coast Medical Centre in Fort Myers. It was there that doctors had to repeatedly change their gloves because of the amount of pepper spray on his body, hospital staff said. Christie suffered multiple heart attacks over the next two days before being declared brain dead and his life support switched off on March 31. Deputy Medical Examiner Dr Robert Pfalzgraf later noted in his autopsy report that, two days after his death, brown-orange liquid pepper spray was still all over Christie's body. Pfalzgraf ruled the death a homicide, as Christie's heart gave out due to stress from his exposure to pepper spray. An internal investigation concluded there no wrongdoing on the part of any Lee County deputy. None of the deputies involved were disciplined in any way  and Florida State Attorney Stephen Russell declined to press criminal charges. The wrongful death case is expected to go before a judge later this year.","Nick Christie, 62, was detained by Florida police in March 2009 .

"Dozens of balloons were released at the Vatican as a sign of peace today - a year after two doves were viciously attacked by other birds at the same ceremony. The bloody conclusion to the peace service in 2014 appears to have forced the Pope's officials to cancel the tradition, replacing the age-old symbols with a more modern alternative. Animal welfare groups were outraged by last year's disaster - claiming the Vatican did not do enough to protect the doves used during the ceremony. Scroll down for video . Colourful: Dozens of balloons were released in St Peter's Square today as a sign of peace . Ceremony: The Pope was taking part in a service devoted to peace alongside young children . After today's weekly service, children joined the Pope at the window of his studio overlooking St Peter's Square and released a large bunch of balloons. Francis said, 'Here's the balloons that mean peace,' as the youngsters let go of the colourful toys. One of the balloons was filled with hot air and contained messages promoting global peace, while a child read out a speech on the same theme. The Vatican announced last week that balloons would replace doves for this year's ceremony, but did not explain the reasons behind the switch. Contrast: Last year the Pope released two doves in St Peter's Square during the equivalent ceremony . Attack: One of the doves was set upon by a crow as thousands of worshippers looked on in January 2014 . Pope John Paul II started the tradition of releasing doves on the last Sunday of January every year, as the first month is traditionally dedicated to the Catholic Church's message of peace. But the ceremony became controversial last year, after the pair of doves were set upon by a crow and a seagull to the shock of thousands of onlookers. The two birds apparently escaped - but still aroused the fury of animal rights activists, who claimed that the Vatican should have anticipated the likelihood of the doves getting in trouble. St Peter's Square has a large population of gulls living on its colonnade - one group said that taking a smaller bird into the square was equivalent to issuing a death sentence. Brutal: The other bird was attacked by a seagull, leading to an animal rights controversy . They appealed directly to the Pope, pointing out that he chose the name Francis after the patron saint of animals, Francis of Assisi. Earlier this week, the pontiff courted controversy when he appeared to criticise the murdered journalists of Charlie Hebdo, saying that freedom of speech should not extend to the mockery of religion. He insisted that people 'cannot insult the faith of others', adding that he would punch someone if they offended his mother.","Doves are traditionally released in St Peter's Square at the end of January .

"New Yorkers with musophobia - the fear of rats - should look away now. The irrational fear of rats, in New York City where there are an estimated two times as many rats are there are people, may not seem so crazy after a look at the New York City Health Department's Rat Information Portal, or RIP. The dense human population means rats thrive in New York, roaming city streets by night, hanging out in subway tunnels and feasting on curbside garbage. Ratted out: New Yorkers can check the rat infestation of any part of the city with RIP . In the red: This area around East Houston Street has some rodent issues . To discover the extent to which any neighborhood or building is infested, residents and businesses can look at raw data gathered by the city's Health Department. Rat Indexing is an inspection process carried out by the Health Department as a part of the Rat Initiative. Inspectors look at all the properties in a given area for active rat signs and conditions conducive to rats. Rat rank: Around lower Manhattan is relatively slim pickings for rats . Midtown: The area between 31st Street and 38th Street is a sea of yellow - indicating it passed inspection . Once the information is collated, the Department generates maps of neighborhoods to identify rat hot spots. Residents can check their neighborhood's infestation level by plugging their address into the RIP. The rat-phobic will want to stay away from blocks and buildings marked in red, which indicate active rat signs. Clicking on an area of the map will then reveal inspection dates, actions and results. The interactive heat map of rat inspection data can be used to look up the rat history, going back to 2009, of any address within the five boroughs. Overrun: New York's rats have been known to overtake restaurants at night . Humans and rats have been living side-by-side for thousands of years in a kind of uneasy truce, but Animal Planet has named New York City the worst rat city in the world. Rats in New York have been known to overrun restaurants after hours, crawl up sewer pipes and enter apartments through toilets. They have also attacked homeless people, eaten cadavers in the city morgue, and bitten infants to get food off their faces, according to author Robert Sullivan. For those interested in rat management, the Health Department's Rodent Academy offers two courses in rat control - a half day class and the three-day course.","New York's Health Department provides an interactive map for residents to view rat infestations on RIP .

"Proposed changes to the official Body Mass Index mean tall people may not be as overweight as they thought, while those under 5ft 7ins could find themselves with a few extra pounds to shift. Researchers at Oxford University say the formula currently used to calculate the BMI is flawed and renders tall people too fat and short people too thin. Up until now BMI has been calculated simply by dividing a person's weight by their height to give a rough estimate of amount of fat they are carrying as a percentage. Fatter: Actor Danny DeVito .

It means superfit but stocky athletes such as Britain's Olympic hero sir Chris Hoy would no longer be classified as overweight while the little but large like actor Danny DeVito would have to lose more to reach their ideal weight. But the research team points out that . it does not take into account the fact that people's weight tends to . grow with their height to the power of 2.5 giving taller people more . room to expand. It means a strapping person of 6ft . 2ins tall would now need to hit 14st 10lb as opposed to just 13st 13lb . to be classified as overweight and a hefty 17st 9lb as opposed to 16st . 10lb to be obese. At the other end of the scale, . someone standing 5ft tall would now be classified as overweight at just . 8st 10lb compared to the old limit of 9st 3lb and would be obese at 10st . 6lb compared to 11st. Study: Researchers at Oxford University say the formula currently used to calculate the BMI is flawed and renders tall people too fat and short people too thin . Lead researcher Professor Nick . Trefethen told the Times: 'BMI divides the weight by too large a number . for short people and by too small a number for tall people. 'So short people are misled into . thinking that they are thinner than they are and tall people people are . misled into thinking they are fatter.' According to the The Obesity Management Association charity people should measure their body mass . index (BMI) every three months and should know their own BMI and that of their family members. The charity said the NHS is struggling to cope with the rising tide of obese patients. 'We cannot go on letting our National Health Service pick up the pieces as weight balloons in both children and adults,' said OMA trustee Robert Houtman as he launched the charity's My Weight, My Future campaign. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, added: 'Everyone should make a point of checking their BMI to see if they are keeping within a healthy weight range. If they are not, that should be the time to do something about it. It is quite easy unconsciously to put on extra pounds and, once you have, put yourself at risk of acquiring the nasty diseases associated with obesity. 'If you have children, ensuring that their BMI stays safely within a healthy range is arguably even more important.'",Researchers at Oxford University say current BMI formula is flawed .
"Diego Costa didn’t deserve to be dismissed on Saturday and Kevin Friend called both incidents involving the combative centre forward correctly. In the first, Costa over-reacted to a strong challenge from John O’Shea, pushing his legs and boots out towards the Sunderland centre half. O’Shea ignored the act and merely jogged back into position rather than make a meal of the clash. This reaction must be applauded as, if Friend had considered disciplining Costa, O’Shea made it easy to ignore the misdemeanour. In the second half the Chelsea forward was a little unlucky after his trailing arm caught Wes Brown in the face during an aerial challenge. Diego Costa catches Sunderland's Wes Brown with an arm while battling for a header during the second half . Costa had earlier been involved in a clash with John O'Shea with the striker appearing to kick out at him . It was not a deliberate act – a player will clench his fist to give power through the elbow if he wants to hurt the opponent – but worthy of a yellow card as he should have been more aware of the consequences of his movement. While Friend did well with these two incidents it was very disappointing to see him ignoring the open, and blatant, grappling by Sunderland’s defenders at Chelsea set pieces. They clearly saw Gary Cahill and John Terry as dangers and, in what looked like pre-planned tactics, held them at almost every set piece. Elsewhere we saw an excellent performance from new referee Graham Scott making his Premier League debut at Turf Moor. His quick reactions to a poor and late Dean Marney sliding challenge on Ciaran Clark stopped the Aston Villa man from retaliating more than he did, which would have probably resulted in a red card. Kevin friend could have punished Sunderland's defenders who employed questionable tactics at set pieces .

Scott was then absolutely right to award the home side a penalty when Villa defender pulled down Burnley’s Lukas Jutkiewicz just inside the penalty area. Two offside decisions caught the eye – one very good and one not so good. First a superb one from World Cup final assistant Mike Mullarkey who was spot on in allowing Joe Cole’s goal for Aston Villa. The bad one came at the Hawthorns with the score at 0-0. Saido Berahino was flagged offside when clean through but replays showed he was just onside. Finally, too often we blame referees for poor decisions but Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko must take all the plaudits for his actions at West Ham. He left Mike Dean with no option but to caution him when he whacked the ball miles away after giving a clear free kick away. Then just under 50 seconds later he trod on an opponent to get his second yellow card. Saido Berahino was wrongly flagged offside when through on goal against Arsenal at the Hawthorns . Moussa Sissoko was sent off by referee Mike Dean after picking up two bookings in one second-half minute .","Some fans felt Diego Costa deserved to be sent off against Sunderland .

"Holidaymakers have been warned to be vigilant this Summer as Britain's coastal seas could to be turned into 'jellyfish soup'. Pollution, over-fishing and climate change are among the theories being used to explain the increase in the stinging creatures, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said. The warning comes after the temporary closure of the Torness nuclear . power station in Scotland last month when swarms of moon . jellyfish blocked its water intake cooling systems. Surge: Aurelia Aurita - or moon jellyfish - swarmed the Torness nuclear power station in East Lothian, Scotland last month . Jellyfish: The nuclear plant, pictured, closed both their reactors to allow the filters to be cleared of jellyfish . The MCS is now asking beach-goers to . take part in its crowd-sourced survey of jellyfish numbers in the seas to learn more about them. 'There is strong evidence that jellyfish numbers are increasing around the world, including UK seas, and these increases have been linked to factors such as pollution, over-fishing and possibly climate change,' said MCS biodiversity programme manager Peter Richardson. 'We should consider jellyfish populations as important indicators of the state of our seas, and the MCS jellyfish survey helps provide some of the information we need to understand more about them.' Species usually seen in British waters are the barrel, moon, compass, blue and lion's mane jellyfish. Those brave enough to get close to the jellyfish are being urged to 'look but not touch'. Most of the species have only a mild sting but some, like the lion's mane, which usually comes as far south as the Irish Sea and Norfolk, have a strong - but none-fatal - sting. UK-bound: Marine experts have suggested some species of jellyfish could come as far south as the Irish Sea or the Norfolk coastline (pictured) The nuclear power station Torness was shut down for two days after jellyfish inundated the seas near the site. Local fishermen on three trawlers helped to clear the moon jellyfish from the seas around the station. EDF Energy, which operates the plant, said reactors were shut down as a precautionary measure and there was no danger to the public at any time. Jellyfish are the staple diet of the critically-endangered leatherback turtles, seasonal visitors to British waters who migrate from their tropical nesting beaches to feed on the jellyfish blooms. Examinations of dead leatherbacks stranded on UK shores have revealed that they feed on several species. By comparing the distribution of jellyfish with environmental factors such as sea temperature, plankton production and current flow, scientists hope to understand what influences the seasonal distribution of jellyfish and leatherbacks in UK waters. This year there have been three confirmed leatherback sightings since June, all spotted in waters off western UK where jellyfish blooms have been reported. 'Most jellyfish bloom in summer, but some species can survive the cool winter months too,' Mr Richardson added. 'This year, we received our first reports of the huge but harmless barrel jellyfish off North Wales back in early January, and this species has occurred in huge numbers in the Irish Sea and beyond ever since, with reports received from north Somerset to the Firth of Clyde. 'Since May we have also received reports of large numbers of several other species of jellyfish from various coastal all sites round the UK.' Dr Matthew Witt, of the University of Exeter, who analyses the survey data, said the study, which has been going since 2003, had yet to throw up any 'shocking' revelations but that there were signs of a link between jellyfish numbers and the North Atlantic Oscillation, a climatic phenomenon which affects the flow of warm air between the tropics and northern regions.

"Low socio-economic status: The woman was buried in a grave covered with tiles called tegulae - a common form of burial in the Roman era . The body of a Roman woman with a tumour in her pelvis embedded with four deformed teeth and a bone has been uncovered by archaeologists. The 30-something woman, whose body was interred in a necropolis near Lleida, in the Catalonia region of Spain, died some 1,600 years ago, researchers believe. An examination of the corpse revealed she suffered from a condition known to doctors as an ovarian teratoma - a Greek-derived term meaning, roughly, a 'monster swelling in the ovaries'. Such tumours stem from mutations of . the germ cells which form human eggs; they have the potential to create . hair, teeth and bone - or even more complex organs like eyes. It . is understood that it is the first time scientists have found this type . of teratoma in human remains dating back to ancient times. 'This is an extraordinary case, not . only for its antiquity, but also its identification in the . archaeological record,' wrote the researchers in a study published . recently in the International Journal of Paleopathology. Despite . its gruesome contents, it's possible that the bizarre tumour, which is . about 1.7 inches in diameter at its largest point, never caused the . woman any symptoms, the researchers note. However, they add, its also possible . that it was the ultimate cause of her untimely death, since 'sometimes . the development of teratomas results in displacement and functional . disturbances of adjacent organs'. Other . possible fatal effects of the tumour could have been infections, . hemolytic anemia and pregnancy complications, the team noted. Paleopathology: A close-up of the pelvic region of the skeleton discovered in the Roman necropolis in Catalonia. The arrow points to the calcified tumour embedded in her pelvis . 'Monster swelling in the ovaries': This look inside the woman's ovarian teratoma reveals the inner protuberance with two teeth attached - a further two teeth have been removed . The . tumour would not have been outwardly obvious, however, and researchers . admit they can't tell for certain what effect it had on the woman. Lead researcher Núria Armentano, of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, told LiveScience: 'We suppose that, at least during a long part of her life, she was completely unaware of this tumor.' She . said that 'depending on the eventual complications, she could have . suffered' but that there is no evidence of that. 'She could have died . because of many other causes!' Ms Armentano added. The owner of the tumour lived in a period . when the Roman Empire was in sharp decline as barbarian invaders . flooded in from the north, eventually overrunning France, Spain and . other territories. 'Extraordinary case': A CT scan image of the tumour (0.3 mm) confirming the presence of complete teeth and several calcified septa. The tumour is about 1.7 inches in diameter at its largest point . She was gound in a necropolis with only a few artefacts buried with her. Tiles known as tegulae had been put over her to give her grave a kind of gabled roof . 'Tegulae graves were the most common Roman burials,' said Ms Armentano. 'She was not an important or rich person. She had a low socio-economic status.'","Body of 30-something Roman woman with an ovarian teratoma uncovered in a Catalonian necropolis .

"Jose Mourinho has levelled strong criticism at Mohamed Salah and Andre Schurrle, among others, for failing to produce performances that trouble his team selection for Saturday. The Chelsea manager was angry his reserve players did not impose themselves over League Two opponents Shrewsbury and said they were shown up by Didier Drogba’s display. Salah and Schurrle were handed rare starts, while Nathan Ake, Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen also got game time.

Petr Cech started in goal as first-choice keeper Thibaut Courtois was given the night off . Click here to read Laurie Whitwell's match report from Greenhous Meadow . Drogba, called the Special Drog by Mourinho, played 90 minutes for a second time in 48 hours and scored the opening goal, causing a menace throughout in the slender 2-1 win. Mourinho said he was disappointed by certain performers and knew his team to face Queens Park Rangers at the weekend, adding: ‘If players that played 90 minutes two days ago were fantastic, I expect people who are not playing a lot to raise the level to create me problems. ‘I love problems of choices, and it is easy to choose my team for Saturday.’ Asked specifically if Salah and Schurrle had disappointed him, Mourinho replied: ‘Yes.’ Shrewsbury equalised through Andy Mangan before Mourinho made two substitutions immediately, replacing John Obi Mikel with Nemanja Matic and Salah with Willian. Willian produced the cross that Jermaine Grandison diverted into his own net under pressure from 36-year-old Drogba. John Obi Mikel played 80 minutes of his side's win before being replaced by Nemanja Matic . Didier Drogba captained his side to victory in the absence of unused substitute John Terry . Didier Drogba has scored in each of his last three matches - in three different competitions. He found the net against Maribor in the Champions League, Manchester United in the Premier League and Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup. ‘When you have the possibility of extra time you have to control the emotions as a manager,’ Mourinho said. ‘I had to make two changes to give a new blood and new kind of qualities to the team.’ He added: ‘I was worried when they equalised but we go through and Didier played a massive part in that. ‘Hopefully he will be good for the weekend but we will have to see because right now his character is stronger than his body. ‘Maybe what he has done  is through his character – not his body. ‘That’s what makes players special and if I was a kid player and I play with this guy on my side, 18, 19, 21, 22, what can I wish more? For the kids it is a privilege and they have to learn by example.’ Asked whether he was the Special Drog, Mourinho said ‘Yes’ and gave a thumbs up.

"A baby who was diagnosed with cancer before she was even born has survived a dangerous operation and a gruelling round of chemotherapy, and has beaten the disease. Doctors spotted a tennis ball sized tumour on Jenna Smith's neck when her mother was 32 weeks pregnant and operated to remove it days after she was born. Now enjoying her first Christmas, the baby's cancer is finally in remission following weeks of chemotherapy. Brave: Baby Jenna Smith, now nine months old, was born with an enormous tumour on her neck . Her mother Lisa, 38, who lives in Penrith with husband Anthony, 38, said: 'It was such a massive shock to us both when we were told that Jenna had this neck cancer. 'She was still inside me and hadn’t even been born yet, yet I was being told that my baby had cancer. It was terrifying. 'When I saw the massive tumour on her neck when she was delivered, I couldn’t believe just how big it was. 'She was such a tiny baby and yet she had this massive tumour on her neck. I just had to pray that she would be able to survive.' Mrs Smith, 38, suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage two years before becoming pregnant with Jenna but her joy soon turned to terror. Cancer: The tumour was spotted when her mother was 32 weeks pregnant and cancer diagnosed after birth . Harrowing: Her parents Mark and Lisa Smith from Penrith feared their daughter might not survive . 'I was overjoyed that I was pregnant again,' remembers Mrs Smith. I went for my scan at 12 weeks and doctors said there was a good strong heartbeat that that was a relief. 'Then on the 20 week scan everything looked fine too so I was just looking forward to becoming a mum at last.' After developing diabetes during the pregnancy, Mrs Smith had another scan at 32 weeks to make sure her daughter was developing normally - but was horrified when doctors spotted the tumour. ‘We were devastated when we were told what was the matter with our baby,' she says. 'We didn’t know whether she was even going to survive.’ Mrs Smith was referred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and when her waters broke at 34 weeks in March, she was rushed straight into the operating theatre. The birth proved equally traumatic, with doctors forced to cut a hole in Jenna's throat to insert a breathing tube midway through the delivery. Beating the odds: The little girl had her first operation during birth and another a few days later . All gone: The tumour was successfully removed but baby Jenna had to begin a round of chemotherapy . ‘It was so scary,' remembers her mother. 'They were operating on Jenna literally as she was half way through being born.’ After her birth, the tiny baby was taken straight to the intensive care unit. She had an operation to remove the tumour and initially tests came back showing that it was benign. ‘We were so relieved at first because we were told it wasn’t cancer,' says Mrs Smith. 'We thought we could just take her home and get on with our lives and put all this behind us.’ But a few weeks later, the couple got a call from the hospital to say that further tests had shown that the tumour was cancerous. Jenna, who is now nine months old, had to be taken back into hospital to begin months of gruelling chemotherapy treatment to stop the cancer spreading. Survivor: The nine-month-old girl has beaten off the disease and celebrated her first Christmas last week . Happy: Despite the chemotherapy, Jenna's mother says she remains a happy and smiling baby . She has scans once a month at the hospital to check her progress. ‘She has been tired and exhausted with the chemotherapy treatment,' says her mother. 'But in-between her chemotherapy she is still a happy and smiling baby.’ With just two more weeks of chemotherapy treatment to go, the future looks brighter and there is no sign of the tumour returning. ’We are very proud of her,' added Mrs Smith. 'Luckily when she grows up, she will be too young to remember everything that she has been through. ‘We will tell her when she’s old enough about how lucky she has been - to survive being born with cancer.’","Jenna Smith was diagnosed with neck cancer while still in the womb .

"It can take humans years to learn how to catch a wave and surf elegantly into shore. But a pod of dolphins has made surfing look incredibly easy after more than 100 of the marine mammals rode a wave together. The amazing overhead footage, which was only able to capture 30 of the creatures at any one time,  was captured off the coast of Western Australia using a drone. Scroll down for video . Gone surfing: A pod of dolphins have made surfing look incredible easy after over 100 of the marine mammals rode a wave together. A still from the film (pictured) shows around 30 of the marine mammals catching a wave . Scientists from the University of Cambridge said that dolphins have been documented riding waves created by the bows of boats by the ancient Greeks. 'They've been doing it for ages and it’s the kind of thing that we don't actually know for sure why they do it.' The experts think the move gives the animals a 'power boost' and reports of dolphins riding waves to shore, or racing in front of boats for hours, suggests that there is little energetic benefit to them, so they might just enjoy it. 'They might just be having fun - they are deeply intelligent creatures, we know that.  So why not just have some fun and hang out, and you can hear them talking and whistling to each other as they're going.' Other theories as to why dolphins catch waves are so they can choose a mate and ensure a good catch of food - as they are speeding towards sources of food. Wildlife photographer Dave Riggs filmed the scene from above using a remote controlled quadcopter with a camera mounted on it. He initially set out to film great white sharks, but instead spotted the pod of sociable, playful dolphins surfing near by the city of Esperance. The filmmaker told Grind TV there were ‘well over 100 in the group,’ but he was only able to get around 30 in shot in his footage. While dolphins have been photographed surfing together before - even alongside human surfers - this is thought to be the first time their antics have been captured using a drone. The video shows the dolphins lining up in the water to wait to catch a wave, much like human surfers. The amazing sight of the surfing dolphins was captured off the coast of Western Australia, near the town of Esperance (pictured) using a drone . Waiting for the swell, the animals then start to swim and sometimes head back into a wave to jump into the air, before going with the flow again and turning back before they reach the shoreline. Fellow filmmaker Jennene Riggs said: ‘Huge pods of bottlenose dolphins cruise the shoreline, surfing, playing and teaching their young how to forage amongst the crystal clear turquoise waters. ‘[They are] such intelligent and playful animals - we have a lot to learn from their lifestyle.’ No-one is certain why dolphins 'surf' and ride waves (stock image) but some experts think it is for fun . According to experts from the Dolphin Communication Project, dolphins are known to ride the crests of waves to head into shore. ‘Just before the wave crashes into shore, the dolphins will turn around and rush back into open water. They can even be seen leaping clear out of the water from the top of a wave.’ 'The waves and the currents that they create help to push the dolphins along in the water, allowing them to attain fast swimming speeds with minimal effort. This is similar to the way that newborn dolphin calves stick close to their mother’s side in order to help them swim.' Some scientist think that dolphins 'surf' for pure enjoyment, although this is difficult to prove. Scientists from the University of Cambridge said dolphins have been documented riding waves created by the bows of boats since ancient Greece. 'They've been doing it for ages and it’s the kind of thing that we don't actually know for sure why they do it.' The experts think the move gives the animals a 'power boost,' but reports of dolphins riding waves to shore, or racing in front of boats for hours, suggests that there is little energetic benefit to them, so they might just enjoy it. 'They might just be having fun - they are deeply intelligent creatures, we know that.  So why not just have some fun and hang out, and you can hear them talking and whistling to each other as they're going.' Other theories as to why dolphins catch waves are so they can choose a mate and hunt for food. Say cheese!

"Mark Webber managed to remarkably escape without serious injury after a huge crash in the season finale of the World Endurance Championship left his Porsche dismantled and in flames. The 38-year-old, who used to race in Formula One, collided with the Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni on the 14th corner at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo before his car slammed into the safety wall.

Any fears of either the Porsche driver or Cressoni being in serious condition were allayed by the FIA in a statement on its official website. 'The race ended under the safety car after a serious accident between the Porsche of Mark Webber and the AF Corse Ferrari of Matteo Cressoni,' said the FIA statement. 'Both drivers were taken to the circuit's medical centre and, after initial examination, to the local Hospital Bandeirantes for further checks, their condition has been reported as satisfactory.' A subsequent statement on Webber's official Facebook page said he was okay and had been taken for medical checks. 'After his accident in the six hour race in Sao Paulo, Mark is awake and alert,' the statement said. '(He) has been taken to the medical center for further checks.' A statement on Webber's website said he would stay overnight at the Sao Paulo hospital for precautionary checks.

"Crawling with rats, sticky with mud and vibrating to the sound of guns booming day and night, life in the trenches was both dangerous and unpleasant. But there were some light-hearted moments as these rare photos reveal, with singers, can-can girls and concerts all laid on in a bid to keep spirits up. And it wasn't just the army who benefited. One rare 1917 shot shows officers attempting an 'Egyptian dance' during a naval revue on their ship. Scroll down for video . Creative: British Naval officers attempt an Egyptian dance during a Navy revue on board their ship in 1917 . Jolly: Leslie Henson (left) created a show called 'The Gaieties' which was shown to soldiers in the trenches . But while impromptu performances weren't uncommon, some recruits managed to turn entertaining the men into a full time job. One such soldier was Leslie Henson, a West End actor and comedian, who was signed up by the Royal Flying Corps in 1917. But generals, mindful of the morale-boosting impact of concerts and performances, soon pulled him off frontline duties, asking him instead to put together a stage show to entertain the troops. The resulting performance was known as The Gaieties and included a mixture of slapstick comedy, vaudeville and music house tunes - all of which proved enormously popular with the men serving at the Front. Amusing: A group of soldiers enjoy a performance by actress and singer Marie Lloyd behind the lines in 1918 . Off duty: Soldiers taking a break from the frontline dance with WAACs at the Old Casino in Le Touquet in 1916 . Highbrow: Penelope Wheeler was among the actresses to take to the stage in Le Havre . But Henson wasn't the only West End star to relocate to the Western Front for the later stages of the war. Joining him on the frontline was Marie Lloyd, an enormously popular comedienne and singer dubbed the 'Queen of the Music Hall' by her legion of fans. She too spent much of her time in France and Belgium, amusing off-duty soldiers with her repertoire of risqué songs, which included such ditties as Now You've Got Your Khaki On - a huge hit with frontline troops. Not every act to appear in British army messes had their roots in the music halls, however. Others boasted a far more ancient pedigree, in particular the theatrical touring companies. Many set up shop in French coastal towns such as Le Havre and Le Touquet, bringing actresses of the calibre of Penelope Wheeler to France to appear in performances of plays by Shakespeare among others. More performers still came from London's opera houses and concert venues, although for many troops, just getting away from the Front was entertainment enough. Others, as a simple shot of soldiers and volunteers from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps waltzing their way around a Le Touquet casino, reveals, just wanted to relax. For sadly, many, although they didn't know it it at the time, were dancing their last dance as the war that cost the UK a million young lives ground on. Fame: Marie Lloyd, a singer, was particularly popular with soldiers and made regular frontline appearances . Marie Lloyd was the Queen of Music Hall. She had made her debut as a table singer at the Eagle, but soon she was the naughty phenomenon of the age. In her distinctive trill she warbled innocent-seeming lyrics with titles like Oh! Mr Porter, What Shall I Do? and She’d Never Had Her Ticket Punched Before that were loaded with double entendres – innocent enough today, but shocking to the Victorians and Edwardians. When the moralists protested about her song I Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas she amended it to I Sits Among the Cabbages and Leeks – to howls of appreciation from her admirers. Marie had a colourful private life; she was refused entry to the US at the start of a tour because she had shared a cabin on the voyage over with a man to whom she was not married. Unlike fellow performer Vesta Tilley, her ending was a sad one – she took to the brandy and fell over drunk on stage. The audience thought it was part of the act and roared with laughter, but she was mortally ill and died a few days later aged just 52. 100,000 people came to her funeral.

"The last time he moved to  Panama he was exposed as a fraudster, disowned by his  children and jailed. But back-from-the-dead canoeist John Darwin has now told friends he plans to return to the central American country. Under his parole conditions the conman is banned from travelling abroad, but says he will leave Britain when the authorities return his passport to him in March. New life:  John Darwin is said to want to return to Panama, where he went with his wife Anne 11 years ago after he faked his death in a North Sea canoe accident . Scam: John Darwin's canoe was found floating on the water off this beach in Seaton Carew, Cleveland, but he wasn't dead at all . Darwin, 62, fled to Panama after he faked his own death in 2002, in a . bid to claim almost £1million in life insurance and  pension payouts. He and wife Anne, 61, were only exposed when a photograph emerged of them together in Panama City. They were sentenced to six years in jail and stripped of their assets. Now, his eagerness to return to the  country has raised suspicions that Darwin may have a secret stash of money there. ASSETS WHEN JOHN AND ANNE DARWIN WERE CONVICTED IN 2008: . Panama bank accounts: $539,000 held in cash . Panama City apartment: $56,000 value . Land for business venture: $389,711. Plus more than £3,000 in bank accounts in Britain and Jersey . BEFORE JOHN DARWIN FAKED HIS DEATH IN 2002: . £64,000 debt on 13 credit cards, costing £1,700 a month . Mortgage and bills: £5,639 per month . Mortgages of 14 different properties: £2,500 . TOTAL OUTGOINGS: £6,700 . TOTAL INCOME: £2,047 . Meanwhile, the Mail can reveal that his son, Mark Darwin, is promoting a high-risk investment scheme in Panama. Mark, 37, and his brother Anthony, 34, were convinced their father was . dead and cut contact with their parents after their devastating lie was . exposed in 2007. However they are now believed to have reconciled. Mark has launched a website advertising a high-risk foreign investment . scheme attached to LifeClub International, which is registered in the . tax haven of Panama. The members-only club encourages clients to invest in risky foreign . currency market schemes (Forex), which are unregulated in the UK. His website, Markdarwin.com, tells prospective investors: ‘Relax knowing . that your money is now working very hard for you even when you sleep!’ But even LifeClub admits there is a high level of risk, noting some consider Forex trading as ‘close to gambling’. It states: ‘As a rule, you should only trade in Forex with money that . you can live without.’ Members must invest a minimum of £10,000. John . Darwin, a former teacher and prison officer, convinced police he had . drowned when his canoe was found in the North Sea near Seaton Carew, . County Durham. He initially lived behind a wardrobe in the family home, but later . obtained a passport using the identity of a dead baby and joined his . wife in Panama. When he returned to Britain in 2007, claiming he was suffering from amnesia, their lie unravelled. The Darwins came up with the plot after their property empire failed and . they racked up £60,000 in credit card debt. Despite his parents’ failed . business, Mark has launched a secondary career as a ‘property investor’ on his website. Brothers Anthony Darwin (front right) and Mark Darwin (rear left) leave Teeside Crown Court after their mother Anne Darwin was jailed for six and a half years and their father John Darwin was jailed for six years . He declined to comment when approached at his £200,000 semi-detached . home in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which he shares with his . wife Felicia, 35, and their two-year-old son. The Crown Prosecution service has already recovered more than £500,000 – . including a flat in Panama City – from John and Anne Darwin. But his money problems will apparently not stop him from returning to . Panama. A source close to Darwin said: ‘He reckons he will get his . passport back in March and he intends to go abroad. ‘I joked “Are you going back to Panama then?”. He smiled and said “I just might do that”. ‘His problem is financial – he hasn’t got any money.’ Plot: The house where John Darwin lived in secret through a wardrobe door before he took on a new identity . Speaking from his £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew, Darwin said: ‘I’ve got nothing to say.’ When asked if he had money problems he said: ‘It would be the same if . you asked 90 per cent of the population.’ Darwin, who survives on a . state pension, is estranged from his wife and claimed two . years ago that . he planned to divorce her. A neighbour said: ‘John was very open about his past when he first moved in, he seemed to revel in his notoriety. ‘He is constantly talking about the women in his life, and carries a . picture of his girlfriend, who he says is 32. You would think he was . God’s gift to women. ‘He is full of himself, and reckons he is going back to Panama when he . can.

"A British woman charged with stalking and shaking down New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman has said he got her phony identification to use in getting an abortion after she became pregnant with his child. Mr Cashman's spokesman Chris Giglio said on Wednesday that the allegations amount to 'more fiction' from a woman already facing stalking, perjury and other charges. 'When I informed Mr. Cashman that I decided to terminate the pregnancy he demanded that I provide him with two passport size photographs so he could obtain a fake ID,' Louise Neathway, who also goes by Meanwell, claimed in papers filed Monday in a Manhattan civil court according to the New York Post. Abortion aid: Louise Neathway, 36, seen in court on charges of extortion and stalking has accused Yankees boss Brian Cashman of making her a fake ID so she could have an abortion . Mr Cashman returned to her, she claims, with an ID that showed her with the name 'Rosalita Gonzalez.' The accusations made without an attorney come as a prelude to a possible lawsuit, although it's yet not clear whom she might sue. She is currently facing criminal charges of stalking Mr Cashman and extorting thousands of dollars from him, harassing her ex-husband and another man and lying to a grand jury. She has pleaded not guilty and is jailed on Rikers Island on a $300,000 bond. Accusations: Prosecutors say Neathway stalked Cashman and got him to pay her $6,000 by threatening to damage his reputation . The Manhattan district attorney's office says Ms Neathway deluged Mr Cashman with calls and text messages, demanded money for a medical procedure and threatened to harm his reputation if he didn't pay. In response, he paid her $6,000, according to a court complaint. She was arrested in February. '[Mr Cashman] provided emotional support and was quite decent to me in the days after the procedure,' she wrote adding that he 'seemed to struggle with his religious convictions in opposing abortion yet being party to a pregnancy that was terminated.' Ms Neathway, a 36-year-old medical sales worker originally from Britain, said in the sworn statement she filed Monday that she and the then-married Mr Cashman were friends for about six years before they began a nine-month affair in April 2011. When told she was pregnant with his baby in June 2011, Cashman said he wouldn't participate in raising the child, she said in the document. Pregnancy scare: Ms Neathway emailed Cashman a photo of an ultrasound, pictured, telling him to pay for her 'abortion' or she would go to the press with the affair . She said she decided on an abortion, and he then insisted on providing her a fake ID. 'He also took care in finding a clinic to provide the abortion service and car service for me on the day of the procedure,' she said in the papers, which she filed without a lawyer. She's been in the process of changing lawyers in her criminal case. While prosecutors accuse her of barraging him with phone calls, Ms Neathway said her phone records show she got more than 100 calls from him between mid-December and the end of January. Mr Cashman's wife of 16 years filed for divorce in February. The couple with two children had been separated for a year, according to a person familiar with the family, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the matter. In March Neathway was also indicted on a second count by the Manhattan court for harassing an ex-boyfriend, Wall Street banker Thomas Walsh. Promises: On a drunken night together at the Louise Neathway's apartment, Cashman allegedly bragged to her that he could use his power as Yankee's manager to help her in her custody battle . Mr Walsh had a protection order against Neathway after she bombarded him with text messages in the wake of their split, according to the New York Post. The case took another twist in March when photos emerged that allegedly show Mr Cashman drinking at a bar with the woman he claimed is his stalker - before sneaking out of her apartment the following morning. Surveillance photos obtained by the Daily News appeared to show the Yankees general manager leaving Ms Neathway’s New York building at 5.41am after the couple spent a night together. Ms Neathway claimed the pictures of the pair enjoying a meal together at a Manhattan restaurant were captured on January 19 – just twelve days before she was charged with harassing and stalking the Yankees manager. The New York Yankees team has vowed to stand by Mr Cashman as the embarrassing . stalking case continues to make headlines. Secret meetings: This picture allegedly shows Brian Cashman meeting Louise Neathway in her hallway at 7.31pm on January 19 . Having a giggle: This surveillance image seems to show Cashman and  Neathway enjoying food and drinks together just twelve days before her arrest . The trove of emails sent to Mr Cashman . and his lawyer by Ms Neathway, who claims she had an affair with the . father-of-two and allegedly blackmailed him for $6,000, were obtained by . the New York Daily News. Neathway allegedly bombarded Mr Cashman . with emails and even attached an ultrasound scan of their alleged unborn . to one of the messages. 'What Brian Cashman has done to me is . both incomprehensible and unforgivable,' Ms Neathway reportedly wrote in an email . sent with the scan on January 29. 'I am going to the press and . informaing [sic] them of the preganacy [sic] and the abortion. And . everything else,' she writes in the typo-littered message, reported the Daily . News. 'So you can have a . little gloat at my agony here is my ultra sound picture. . . I guess its . ok for me to just push this aside right? Men!!!' Prior accusations: Cashman is not the first man to accuse her of stalking and making threats . Second sting: Cashman's wife has since filed for divorce requesting joint custody of their two children and share in their $3.7 million Darien mansion with this latest sting being his second affair during their marriage . Ms Neathway, . in a separate email sent a day later, threatened to make Mr Cashman’s life . hell unless he paid for her 'abortion'. Prosecutors said Ms Neathway harassed Mr Cashman with hundreds of . text messages, and demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for an . unspecified medical procedure. She . allegedly threatened to contact the press and his family with claims . that would hurt his personal relationships and professional standing, . according to a court complaint. Mr Cashman made two payments, one for . $4,000 and another for $2,000. Mr Cashman moved out of the family mansion . after Ms Neathway was charged with stalking and harassing him. Mr Cashman is the latest in a line of men . who claim she has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking . and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former . friends claim, according to the Post.","Louise Neathway, 36, is currently jailed on stalking and extortion charges .

'It's a measure of how far we have come that he has come out but it's also a measure of how far we have to go that it' s a media story.' Mr Koonin said it was particularly hard for male athletes to deal with their sexuality. 'We would never say that a sportsperson has to come out, or any individual, and certainly we understand the pressures on athletes given his particular role in Australian sport and culture,' he said. 'Things are changing but at the moment the number of openly out male athletes is very small.' The Olympian was reported to have pocketed up to $500,000 for the tell-all .

'You not only see communities improve, but individuals as well - they become stronger, more independent. I hope my photographs have captured their spirit, pride and determination.' Leslie’s colleague at Tiger Nest Films, Clementine Malpas, has also created a documentary on the impact of Afghanaid’s work, voiced by Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, which can also be viewed at the Gallery Different exhibition. Mr Snow said: 'This sensitive film reveals the Afghanistan we rarely, if ever, see in news reports. We meet an intricate society which Afghanaid is enabling to prosper and develop despite the backdrop of war. It speaks powerfully of Afghanaid's remarkable ability to work so supportively as equals with the people of the country.' Afghanaid started working in Afghanistan in 1983 and despite 30 years of conflict and war it has never left and has no plans to do so.

He said: 'It is not all about the Taliban, foreign troops or war. This is a diverse and fascinating country, Afghans are people living their lives just like you and me – they want to feed, clothe and educate their families, improve their homes and progress their careers. They are just as aspirational and ambitious as you and I with many of the same concerns and problems. 'So much is being written and said about the withdrawal of UK and US troops, but frankly there was conflict between different groups of Afghans before they arrived and it will continue after they have left. Our work, and the day to day needs of the local communities we work hand in hand with will not be affected by the withdrawal – their and our key concerns are issues such as clean water, sufficient food, small community engineering projects, education and healthcare.' MP, writer, former British Army officer and one-time governor of an Iraqi province Rory Stewart OBE famously walked across Afghanistan alone in the winter of 2001. Rolling hills: The Afghanistan landscape is also shown in the exhibition . Beekeeping: The charity works with local communities in some of the most remote and poorest rural areas . Industrious: Bridge building in Afghanistan . Staying in over five hundred village homes and sharing the reality of the lives and needs of the people he met during his trek, he holds Afghanaid in great esteem: 'One of the greatest things I found in that country was Afghanaid. I was sceptical, I was doubtful about charity work in Afghanistan, but you just have to see one of their projects, talk to one of the villages where they work, meet their incredibly professional, dedicated, focused staff to see that . Afghanaid represent the very best of British charities – they are the absolute blue chip of organisations.' His sentiments are echoed by many of the subjects photographed and interviewed for the Thirty years, Thirty stories project. Abdul Hafiz says his life was transformed when Afghanaid came to his village and showed him and his neighbours how to irrigate drought-ridden land and plant saplings. The resultant crops of alfalfa and fruit had a transformative effect on his life and he says: 'Now I dare to dream, and I hope to expand my land, my garden and my business.' The happy face of Ustad Ghulam Saki beams from behind the gauze veil of his beekeeper’s hat. 'Before Afghanaid introduced honey bees to Afghanistan we had no idea where honey came from. It was sold in pharmacies, rather than in the market.' He said. Dusty plains: Farming in Afghanistan is also documented through the series of pictures .

With his village, Baharak, isolated by the then ongoing war with the at that time named Soviet Union, Ustad says that the concept of saving their lives through honey production was 'like a bright light shining through a dark tunnel.' Trained by another local man, Ustad was helped by Afghanaid to establish his own small colony of bees. That soon progressed to more than 70 hives and today he is renowned for his honey. He says, however, it isn’t all about the honey: 'Afghanaid’s crucial interventions have helped us to stand on our feet and give us the tools to build our future.' He has set up a school from the funds he raised from his sales and works as a part-time teacher, passing on his knowledge to local children. 'I saw an opportunity to make change in my life. I was trained and provided with a room to weave in and a small almond garden to tend.' Prior to this life-changing involvement with Afghanaid, Sohira and her family had been struggling to survive in the province of Samangan. With a disabled husband and several children to support, she had been trying to make a living as a cumin harvester, barely earning the equivalent of £24 a year. 'We were so poor it was hard to believe that things could get worse. When our house was washed away in a flash flood, I prayed to God to take me away. I was the sole breadwinner. We existed on nothing and now we had no roof over our heads,' she explains. Taught the skills of Afghanistan’s ancient tradition of weaving fine carpets, Sohira’s life and that of her family is markedly different today: 'I am making 28,000 Afs (£305) every six months and can afford medication for my husband and my son.

"If you've taken up running to lose weight but have found you've gained more pounds than you've shed, a personal trainer has the reason why. Fitness fanatic Julia Buckley has helped hundreds of people get into shape after they have failed to lose weight despite following a tiring exercise regime. Writing on her blog, Julia explains that the problem is many people are doing the wrong kind of exercise to shed fat. Her motto is to 'go harder, not longer'. She believes that if people only do long, steady exercise - like slow marathon training runs - they won't lose weight. In fact, their bodies will cling to fat to help them keep running for miles. Scroll down for video . Toned up: Personal trainer Julia Buckley shifted her 'stubborn fat' by doing less running and more weights and high intensity training . She explains: 'Any type of long, slow endurance . exercise, when done regularly will cause the body to become more . endurance-focused. It will then want to store energy as fat to ensure it . has plenty of reserves to get through all the miles it is used to.' People often also reward themselves after . a run by over-eating and consuming more calories than they burnt off . making their fat burning efforts futile. Of course, Julia agrees that running is a great form of exercise with numerous health benefits and many people take pleasure from the sport for reasons beyond dropping a dress size. Raising the heart rate: Julia demonstrates a jumping exercise that involves moving from side to side of the step . No need to join a gym: Using weights at home have helped Julia get into shape . But Julia said if your primary goal for running is to lose weight, then long, slow runs are not the best way to shed fat. You may drop pounds initially, but then find your weight stagnates. The 37-year-old has learnt this from her own experience. When training for marathons and ultra marathons, she spent hours pushing herself to run long distances but didn't lose any weight. She thought the answer was to put even more time-consuming miles in - which eventually led to illness and injury - and she still didn't have the body she wanted. She says: 'I've never been obese but I certainly had some stubborn . extra pounds I just couldn't seem to shift. And for a fitness writer, . that is not a good a look.' But now Julia has a healthy lean and toned physique without an inch of fat, and she says it's all thanks to high intensity exercise and pumping iron. Hold it: Core stability moves like this one help Julia get her flat stomach . Join in: The personal trainer has recorded her workouts so clients can follow the routine . She said: 'When I . switched from long steady exercise to short, high-intensity sessions and . added more variety and strength training into my training mix, my body . changed. A lot. The fat came off, my energy levels soared and I became . healthier, stronger and fitter.' Now Julia spends less time working out than she did when she was going for 50 mile runs but is in much better physical shape. Her workouts - which she is sharing in a new online programme, Extreme Inferno, that begins next week - includes weight lifting, core stability exercises and short bursts of efforts which raise the heart rate. She said these 20-40 minute workouts are much more effective for weightloss because of the “afterburn” effect. She explains: 'Your metabolic rate goes through the roof and stays elevated even after you finish training while your body adapts and recovers. This will cause you to burn more fat for 24-48 hours after exercising, depending on how intense the training was. Of course, you also get the health and fitness improvements that come as a result of working your heart, lungs and muscles harder.' On top of her workouts, Julia still runs but instead of doing long, slow plods, she does shorter, faster ones. She recommends her clients stick to running no more than 30 minutes at a time if their main aim for exercising is fat loss. One of Julia's clients, Becca Jones, 40, from London, said it certainly worked for her. She explains on her blog how she lost a stone after swapping long slow runs for weight lifting and high intensity training. New fitness regime: Becca has lost weight, left, even though she doesn't run as much. She was a stone heavier before she did weights and high intensity training, right . Slimmer: Becca before, left, and after she followed Julia's advice on exercise . She said: 'I'm not saying that running makes you fat or that it's impossible to lose some fat through long distance running. However, there are other forms of exercise that give much greater bang for the buck in terms of torching fat. So if fat loss is your top priority then in my experience your time would be better spent on lifting weights or exercising at high intensity for short bursts.' Becca explains that when she trained for her first marathon, she over indulged on the wrong foods as the endurance-based training made her hungry. She said: 'When I was training for my first marathon I ate ALL the carbs. I fuelled my runs on pasta, rice, bread, porridge, pizza, sweets, chocolate, cake.' She added: 'It's so easy to reward yourself with a carby sugary treat after a long run. ""Go on, have that slice of cake, you've run for miles - you deserve it"". All fine, except that if fat loss is your priority then rewarding yourself with cake and chocolate probably isn't going to help your progress too much in the long run.' Since taking advice from Julia, Becca has learnt to eat carbs on moderation, re-fuel with protein-based snacks instead of sugary ones, and eat more vegetables. As a result, she's found not only has she lost weight, she's also become a faster runner, gaining personal best times over 5k to marathon since swapping her long-distance jogs for Julia's strengthening exercises and high intensity training.

Jenny, 34, a divorcee who fell pregnant when she was just 13 years old, also agrees that dating in Kodiak 'is not like the rest of the world.' Along with a low population, the weather is 'cold', 'wet' and 'rainy' and it stays dark for up to six months of the year.

"The Duchess of Cambridge and Scarlett Johansson's breasts are scientifically perfect, according to a formula which stipulates the ideal position of the nipples which is backed by a public poll. Megan Fox, Miranda Kerr, Katy Perry and Kelly Brook are also blessed with the 'perfect' proportions, having an ideally placed 'nipple meridian', a new study has revealed. The ideal proportions are 45 per cent of the breast above the line of the nipples and a generous 55 per cent below. This means her nipples point upward at an angle of 20 degrees, creating what is dubbed a 'beckoning breast' according to the research by London-based plastic surgeon Patrick Malluci and reported today in the Sun. Scroll down for video . 'Beckoning breasts': This is the term given by researcher Patrick Malluci to the kind of breasts that the Duchess of Cambridge and Scarlett Johansson have, where the proportions mean her nipples point upwards at an angle of 20 degrees . Transformers star Megan Fox is also said to have the 'perfect' proportions . Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr and singer Katy Perry are also said to be blessed with the 'perfect' pair . Kim Kardashian's top heavy chest is deemed to have the ratio 55:45 - the third most popular in the survey . According to Dr Malluci, of the Royal Free and University College London Hospitals, it is the relative size of the upper and lower halves of breasts that holds the secret of the perfect bust. He believes the most-appealing female breasts should be only slightly smaller above the nipple than below. To support his hypothesis, he asked more than 1,300 people to rank four breast types with different proportions. The poll found that 87 per cent of respondents ranked breasts of the same 45:55 ratio as Kelly Brook as their favourites. Dr Mallucci, said: 'In the past, most women have walked into a clinic thinking they’re going to get a couple of round footballs because fullness is a desired look in clothing and women tend to picture themselves dressed. 'But this doesn’t equate to attractiveness in the naked breast. Most surgeons give women what they think they want. 'And hey presto, plastic surgery gets a bad name for promoting a fake and distorted image. 'I’m not saying women must conform to this ‘ideal’ that works both clothed and naked, it merely gives surgeons around the world a technical and aesthetic roadmap for any women choosing to have breast enhancement to get the best results.' Dr Malluci, of the Royal Free and University College London Hospitals, said it is the relative size of the upper and lower halves of breasts that holds the secret of the perfect bust . Second best: Britney Spears's breasts have an equal 50:50 ratio, the favourite of 9 per cent of respondents . Joint last: Lindsay Lohan's top heavy 55:45 ratio breasts, were the favourites of just 2 per cent of respondents, as were Rihanna's pert 35:65s, shown here in a daring awards ceremony gown . It is estimated that between five and 10 million women across the world have had cosmetic breast surgery . Breasts like those of Britney Spears, with an equal 50:50 ratio, were rated top by 9 per cent; 55:45 ratio breasts, like Lindsay Lohan's and Kim Kardashian's, and 35:65s, like Rihanna's, were each the favourites of just 2 per cent of respondents. The survey also revealed that more men prefer natural looking breasts than women - in stark contrast to the cliché that men prefer oversized or ‘fake’ breasts. Other women whose breasts fit Dr Malluci's 'perfect' template include Caprice Bourret, the underwear model. But Dr Malluci has said previously that Victoria Beckham's surgically enhanced bust had often been pointed out to him by clients as an example of what they didn't want to end up looking like. Dr Mallucci first identified the formula for perfect breasts in 2007 when observing the commonalities of topless models, chosen for their naturally attractive breasts. Since then he has championed the adoption of this aesthetic and has urged other surgeons to use the 45:55 ratio as a template for design in breast surgery. This golden ratio for breasts is not just a modern phenomenon. Throughout history, from the earliest representations of woman to the statues of antiquity, from Renaissance masters to modern photographers, artists have chosen the same proportions. Throughout history, Dr Mallucci, said artists have chosen the same proportions . Venus and Bardot, Aphrodite and Moss, society’s leading ladies have always had 'Beckoning Breast's'. 'Just like beautiful landscapes, everyone agrees on what beautiful breasts look like,' Dr Mallucci added. 'Identifying the 45:55 ideal proportions now gives women the opportunity to tell their surgeons what they really want. 'I am increasingly seeing women who have finished having children and want to take control of their bodies again. 'And this is the look that gives them the best results and most satisfaction.' Separate research has shown recently that breasts are the third thing a man notices in a woman he is meeting for the first time, and that men with more sexist views prefer bigger-breasted women. Nearly 70 per cent of 1,000 men who took part in the former study insisted that eyes are the first feature of a woman they gaze at.","Scarlett Johansson, the Duchess of Cambridge, Megan Fox, Katy Perry and Kelly Brooks's breasts chosen as favourite by 87 per cent in poll .

"When U.S. House of . Representatives Speaker John Boehner, a  Republican, jolted . Washington this week by inviting Israeli prime minister Benjamin . Netanyahu to address Congress, his office said it had been done . 'on behalf of the bipartisan leadership.' In reality, it was among the most partisan moves so far by . America's newly Republican-controlled Congress. Officials told Israeli newspaper Haaretz the Israeli leader had 'spat' in President Barack Obama's face. 'We thought we've seen everything,' the newspaper quoted an unnamed senior US official as saying. 'But Bibi managed to surprise even us. Furious: The White House is said to be outraged over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to speak before Congress in March — a move he failed to coordinate with the administration . 'There are things you simply don't do. He spat in our face publicly and that's no way to behave. Netanyahu ought to remember that President Obama has a year and a half left to his presidency, and that there will be a price,' he said. Fuming . Democratic leaders in Congress have said they were not . consulted, raising questions over whether Boehner had accurately . characterized the nature of his invitation. The invitation was worded that way, a Boehner spokesman said . on Friday, because 'Boehner is the Speaker of the whole House, . elected by the whole House.' Boehner was re-elected as the . chamber's leader on Jan. 6 with 216 votes, all from Republicans, . out of the 435 voting members of the House of Representatives. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, and Nancy . Pelosi, his counterpart in the House, said they had not been . told in advance of Boehner's plan to invite Netanyahu. Unwavering: In his address the Israeli leader is expected to speak about stalled US-led nuclear negotiations with Iran, and to urge lawmakers to slap Tehran with a new round of tougher sanctions . The White . House also said that President Barack Obama, a Democrat, had not . been told ahead of time and were said to be 'completely blindsided'. 'The Speaker of the House has awesome power. I know that. I've been there,' Pelosi told her weekly news conference on . Thursday. 'The fact, though, is that power is not to be . squandered.' In announcing the invitation on Wednesday, Boehner called . Netanyahu 'a great friend of our country.' 'In this time of challenge, I am asking the Prime Minister . to address Congress on the grave threats radical Islam and Iran . pose to our security and way of life,' he said. Democratic congressional staffers called Boehner's action a . blatant political ploy. Netanyahu is expected to back Republican moves to pressure . Obama to take a tougher line in talks on a nuclear deal with . Iran. The prime minister is due to address Congress two weeks . before Israel's general election on March 17 in which he is . vying for a fourth term. Obama and other world leaders negotiating with Iran over its nuclear program have firmly argued against a sanctions bill from Congress, which they say would unravel a delicate international coalition and tank negotiations. 'We asked the Israelis in private and public to sit tight and the President made clear if a deal wasn't reached he would be the first in line advocating for more sanctions,' the official said. That's what makes Netanyahu's decision to address Congress a 'pretty big deal,' the official added. The flap added to a growing perception that Netanyahu's . government has become a partisan Republican player in U.S. politics, despite historically close ties to lawmakers in both . parties. Republicans were unapologetic. Own agenda? House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu to speak to Congress without consulting the Obama administration . Netanyahu's continued expansion of Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem has angered U.S. officials, prompting one senior White House official to call Netanyhau a 'chicken****' Arizona Republican John McCain said the party was giving . Obama a taste of his own medicine. In a hallway interview at the . Capitol, he termed the invitation 'a great idea' after Obama's . announcement that he would push ahead on policy without waiting . to compromise with Congress. 'He basically said, 'I'm going to do my thing, you do your . thing.' We got it, we got the message,' McCain said. The White House announced that Obama won't meet with Netanyahu during his visit because of the proximity to Israeli elections. The visit could play well for Netanyahu at home as he presents himself as the best protector of Israel's security. 'The last thing we want to do is hurt Israel, but if he is able to stiff the U.S. President like that and we still offer him a meeting -- that invites him and anyone else to do that over and over,' a senior administration official told CNN.","Administration has said it is unhappy with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address Congress .

"Temper tantrums aren’t much fun for anyone within earshot as young children scream themselves hoarse because they aren't getting their own way. But one couple recently decided to film themselves making the best of a bad situation - when their six-year-old daughter refused to stop screaming at the top of her lungs. The hilarious results were posted on YouTube by mother Kathy Sterner, who wrote: ‘My six-year-old daughter had been in her room wigging out for about an hour, and there was no talking her down. Watch below... When everything else had failed, the unnamed dad decided to make light of his six-year-old daughter's non-stop tantrum by lip-synching along . ‘I was getting fed up, so my husband decided to lighten the mood.’ The video consists of Ms Sterner’s husband standing in their kitchen reacting and lip-synching along to the screams of his daughter in the next room. The unnamed daughter can be heard screaming ‘Mom listen to me!’ while her father seeks to lighten the mood for the rest of the family by reacting to her squeals of annoyance. The lip-synch is well done, and the father even adds some accurate facial features to go along with the tantrum. Two boys – perhaps older brothers – wander into shot and are clearly enjoying his performance. But all this hilarity isn’t the reaction that the young girl had hoped for, so she decides to turn things up a notch by screaming ‘Stop laughing at me’ at an even higher volume. Dad’s movements and mannerisms become even more exaggerated as his daughter completely losses her cool. After starting out merely winey, the girls decides to turn things up a notch after hearing the rest of the family make light of her tantrum and dare to laugh at her . Before you jump to the wrong conclusions about the family and their offspring, Ms Sterner is quick point out that her daughter is not typically a beastly child. ‘She's actually a pretty awesome little kid who was having a rough day,’ she wrote. One commentator on YouTube asked how come her husband was able to so accurately mimic his daughter’s screams. Ms Sterner explained that because the girl had been screaming the same thing over and over for an hour, it wasn't exactly too that hard to anticipate what was going to come next. ‘We could hear her take a breath when she was about to start up again,’ she explained. ‘The ""Stop laughing at me!"" was a new and unexpected twist, and he went with it. He's a pretty good actor, and was big into improv when he was younger.’ The video has already been watched more than 560,000 times since it was posted on October 11 and has attracted over 3,800 likes. The dad's improv skills proved a hit with the rest of the family and with YouTube viewers .","After everything else has failed, an unnamed dad decides to make light of his young daughter's non-stop temper tantrum .

"'Disgusting': Daniel Orrell is trying to make up for urinating on a war memorial in Bolton by selling poppies at his local Asda . A thoughtless reveller who drunkenly urinated on a war memorial is trying to atone for his crime by selling poppies for the Royal British Legion. Daniel Orrell pleaded guilty to outraging public decency when he committed the 'disgusting' act in Nelson Square, Bolton, on July 27. A judge labelled his actions 'despicable' and the case sparked public outrage. The 24-year-old now wants to put things right and is participating in collections with Legion members for the Poppy Appeal, in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Sunday. Orrell, who has been selling poppies at Asda in Burnden, Bolton, said: 'I put myself forward because I really wanted to show how sorry I was. 'It's important to me that I clear my name in any way that I can. Nothing can change what I did, so I wanted to do this on behalf of myself and my family. 'The Royal Legion members I have been out and about with have been so supportive of me, they're really forgiving of what I have done.' Police on foot patrol in Bolton town centre found Orrell at just after 1am on 27 July, close to the memorial in Nelson Square. Officers could see his trousers were undone and a 'large volume of urine running down the stone wall' of the memorial. At the time of the offence, The Bolton . News reported that chairman of the bench at Bolton Magistrates Court, . Norman Morlidge, branded Orrell's actions 'despicable' He . said: 'To urinate in a public place is an offence in that it offends . people. However, to do it on a war memorial is incredibly offensive to . all those veterans who gave their lives for this country.' He was fined £250 and ordered to pay £85 court costs. Memorial: Police found a drunken Orrell urinating against the monument to fallen soldiers last July . 'Not been out': Orrell says he hasn't been to the town centre since last July and he says urinating against the war memorial was 'the worst decision' Following Orrell's shameful actions, there was a public outcry with people taking to the internet to slam him for what he did - something he said he completely understands. He said: 'This was the worst decision I have ever made and I completely get why people feel the way they do. The memorial represents the people who sacrificied themselves for others and it's been a really big learning curve for me. 'I have been congratulated on what I'm doing and welcomed into the Legion, which means so much to me.' Orrell, who works in Salford Quays, has admitted to being drunk when he committed the offence. 'I've got to take responsibility and learn from this, learn to know my limits,' he added. He has not been out into Bolton town centre since the incident. After Orrell was sentenced, the Royal British Legion branded his actions 'disgusting' but they are now helping him make amends. Orrell contacted the Bolton branch of the Royal British Legion and volunteered to help out as part of the Poppy Appeal, which supports members of the Armed Forces and their families. He said: 'I was talking with my dad about what I could do and when we thought of working with the legion it made complete sense. Amends: The 24-year-old is selling poppies at his local Asda to try and make up for what he has done . Welcomed: The Royal British Legion originally branded his actions 'disgusting' but are now calling the decision to sell poppies for them 'brave' 'I'm not saying it will make up for what I have done, but hopefully it's a start and I will be able to do more things in the future.' And his willingness to atone for his error has been welcomed by members of the Royal British Legion in Bolton. Chairman Glynnis Knapman said: 'This is a very positive move and it shows that Daniel knows that what he did was wrong. Maybe he didn't realise what he was doing at the time. 'It is brave to put himself back out there.' Orrell added: 'I'm fitting in as many days I can volunteer as possible, as much as I can do I will.' Greater Manchester Police heard about his idea on Twitter and have helped to organise the initiative. PC Carol Winrow, of Farnworth police, said: 'We are keen to promote the idea of restorative justice and, when we saw the negative reaction that Daniel was getting on Twitter, we thought this would be a good idea - but he had already contacted the Royal British Legion himself, so we helped facilitate the day.'

"The only surviving ship from the First World War Gallipoli campaign is to be opened to the public for the first time thanks to £1.75million of lottery cash. Portsmouth's National Museum of the Royal Navy has received the grant to restore HMS M.33 in time for the centenary commemorations next year. The Gallipoli campaign, fought between April 1915 and January 1916 in what is now Turkey, claimed more than 500,000 lives of personnel. Surviving: The National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth has received the grant to restore First World War ship HMS M.33 . Up close: It is a 'Monitor' ship which, at 568 tons and with a shallow draft, was able to get close in to shore and fire at targets on land . Project director Matthew Sheldon said: ‘HMS M.33 is a small ship but has a big history. It will be wonderful to open the ship to visitors next year. ‘Finally we'll be able to share the story of her part in the Gallipoli Campaign, and reveal what it was like for the 72 crew who were crammed on board.’ HMS M.33 is a 'Monitor' ship which, at 568 tons and with a shallow draft, was able to get close in to shore and fire at targets on land. It carried two powerful and oversize 6in guns but has been described as ‘a basic metal box lacking in comforts’. The museum said: ‘The 72 officers and men who sailed for the Gallipoli campaign were crammed inside and away from home for over three years.’ After the war in 1919, the M.33 was refitted and returned to action in the Russian Civil War. Inside: HMS M.33 carried two powerful and oversize 6in guns but has been described as 'a basic metal box lacking in comforts' Unique: The M.33 will be the only British warship from the First World War that will be open to the public . There, it covered the withdrawal of Allied and White Russian troops from north Russia during the Dvina River Campaign. Following its return from Russia, the M.33 spent the rest of its active life in Portsmouth Harbour. The M.33 will be the only British warship from the First World War that will be open to the public. The project has received funding from Hampshire County Council to help meet the full £2.4million cost of the project.

Anzac Cove: The Gallipoli Campaign, fought between April 1915 and January 1916 in what is now Turkey, claimed more than 500,000 lives . The ship sits in No 1 Dock next to HMS Victory in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard and visitors will enter through a new entrance on board. There will be an ‘immersive’ battle experience bringing to life the ship's history as well as the history of the Gallipoli Campaign. Carole Souter, Heritage Lottery Fund chief executive, said: ‘The role of the Royal Navy in the First World War deserves to be much better known. ‘Now, thanks to lottery money, visitors to M.33 will be able to the learn more about the crucial part it played during the war, particularly at Gallipoli, alongside experiencing first-hand something of the conditions in which sailors lived and fought.’ Professor Dominic Tweddle, NMRN director-general, said: ‘Next year HMS M.33 will be the only British warship of the First World War that the public can get on board. ‘We are delighted that the Heritage Lottery Fund has made this grant to the NMRN to conserve and restore the ship. 'She will be a permanent commemoration and a reminder that the First World War took place at sea just as much as on land.’ The background to the Gallipoli landings was one of deadlock on the Western Front in 1915, when the British hoped to capture Constantinople. The Russians were under threat from the Turks in the Caucasus and needed help, so the British decided to bombard and try to capture Gallipoli. Located on the western coast of the Dardanelles, the British hoped by eventually getting to Constantinople that they would link up with the Russians. Cannon in place: Troops landing at what would become known as Anzac Cove in the Dardanelles during the Gallipoli campaign . The intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war. A naval attack began on February 19 but was called off after three battleships were sunk. Then by the time of another landing on April 25, the Turks had been given time to prepare better fortifications and increased their armies sixfold. Australian and New Zealand troops won a bridgehead at Anzac Cove as the British aimed to land at five points in Cape Helles - but only managed three. The British still required reinforcements in these areas and the Turkish were able to bring extra troops onto the peninsula to better defend themselves. Graphically explained: This is a panorama map from the Daily Mail showing the Gallipoli peninsula during the First World War . A standstill continued through the summer in hot and filthy conditions, and the campaign was eventually ended by the War Council in winter 1915. The invasion had been intended to knock Turkey out of the war, but in the end it only gave the Russians some breathing space from the Turks. Turkey lost around 300,000 men and the Allies had 214,000 killed in a disastrous campaign. Anzac Cove became a focus for Australasian pride after forces were stuck there in squalid conditions for eight months, defending it from the Turks. Troops going ashore at the Dardanelles: Soldiers are seen leaving S.S. Nile for the landing beach in 1915 . The Anzac soldiers who arrived on the narrow strip of beach were faced with a difficult environment of steep cliffs and ridges - and almost daily shelling. At the height of the fighting during the landings of April 25, 1915, the waters around the peninsula were stained red with blood at one point 150ft out. Fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster for the campaign.","National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth awarded £1.75million lottery grant to restore HMS M.33 next year .

"A French left-wing MEP has hit out at the creators of video game Assassin's Creed over their portrayal of Maximilien de Robespierre. A slight artistic liberty from the creators sees the character of Robespierre presented as a psychopathic mass-murderer, which has enraged the French left, . Jean-Luc Melenchon claims the depiction of Robespierre, considered by many to have been the architect of the French Revolution, in the latest installation of the game is 'propaganda against the people'. Off with their heads! The creator's of Assassin's Creed: Unity (pictured) have been accused of 'propaganda against the people' following it's less than flattering portrayal of Maximilien de Robespierre . Robespierre, considered one of the most influential politicians of the French Revolution, remains a controversial figure in the country's history. Despite being a fierce opponent to the death penalty early in his political career, he praised the Reign of Terror that followed the fall of the French monarchy as 'necessary, laudable and inevitable'. During the 11 months of 'Terror' 1793-1794, more than 40,000 people were executed, mainly as part of public spectacles using the guillotine. However, his depiction in Assassin's Creed: Unity has not been welcomed by the left-wing on France. Attack: MEP and former presidential candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, also accuse makers Ubisoft of being part of a 'capitalist conspiracy' 'This is propaganda against the people,' MEP and former presidential candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon said, accusing the creators, Ubisoft, of rewriting French history as part of a capitalist conspiracy. 'A man who was our liberator at one stage of the Revolution is portrayed as a monster,' he is quoted as saying in The Independent. Robespierre is presented as a psychopathic mass-murderer in the new video game . 'They are insulting us to destroy what keeps us together as French people.' The game has also been accused of giving young people a distorted view of history, but not accurately portraying the events of the French Revolution. However, Ubisoft and the team behind Assassin's Creed: Unity, has hit back at this, defending their right to artistic license. 'We're making art,' said 'Unity' level design director Nicolas Guerin. 'It's not a historical simulation. We still want players to feel like they're in the Paris they've seen on a postcard or visited in person, but there's pressure — because many of the developers are French — to make sure that we render justice to the capitol of my country, as well as to history.' 'Assassin's Creed: Unity' designers spent two years erecting a virtual Notre Dame — inside and out — to scale, but it is not historically correct. Despite the fact 'Unity,' is set before the iconic cathedral's spire was built, it sits atop the game's Notre Dame. Likewise, Bastille is still standing when it would've been rubble.","French MEP calls Assassin's Creed 'propaganda against the people'

"The son of firebrand Islamist cleric Abu Hamza was leader of a gang who kidnapped a man and tortured him over a £15,000 debt. Tito Ibn Sheikh, 28, was jailed for 12 years after a jury agreed he 'orchestrated the violence' inflicted on restaurant worker Hassan Monawwer over three days. Mr Monawwer was knifed, strangled almost to death and battered with a metal bar and wooden cosh in three separate locations before armed police burst in to save him. Family values: Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, whose son Tito Ibn Sheikh was jailed for 12 years for kidnapping and torturing a restaurant worker said to have owed £15,000 to his friend . Sheikh, who is one of nine children of Hamza, was convicted last year, but a judge banned reports on his family ties to avoid prejudicing jurors. But last week after he and an accomplice unsuccessfully appealed their convictions the court lifted the gag allowing him to be named the the circumstances of the case revealed. Sheikh and friends Adam Abed and Mostafa Dawoud snatched Mr Monawwer in Acton, west London, in 2012. They subjected him to an ordeal of violence over £15,000 he was said to owe to Abed, the Sun on Sunday reports. Yet in an effort to extort even more money, the trio told his family they would sell him to another gang unless they came up with £25,000 ransom. Prosecutors said: 'His neck was squeezed so hard he thought his tongue would pop out.' Scammers: Hamza Mustafa Kamel, Mohamed Kamel Mostafa and Mohssin Ghailan, the three sons of jailed hook-handed cleric Abu Hamza who exploited a loophole in the vehicle registration system to steal luxury cars . Hamza, 58, has nine children – six sons, two daughters and a stepson. Five of his sons are now known to have criminal records. Mohammed Kamel Mostafa, Hamza's eldest son, was jailed for plotting to blow up British tourists. He was accused of masterminding a plot to sabotage economic and tourist sites in Yemen in August 1999, when he was just 17. He returned to London in January 2002 after serving three years in prison in the Arab state. Six years later he was jailed again, along with his brother Hamza Mustafa Kamel and their step-brother Mohssin Ghailam. Imran Mostafa was jailed after being convicted of armed robbery and illegal possession of a firearm over a raid on a jewellers in King's Lynn, Norfolk. The trio operated a £1million luxury car scam which involved exploiting a DVLA loophole to steal BMW, Mercedes and other luxury brand cars, which they then either sold on or used as collateral to make fraudulent loans. Although they were investigated by anti-terror police there was no evidence they used the cash for terrorist purposes. 'They just used the cash to party,' a source said at the time. In 2012, another of Hamza's sons, Imran Mostafa, was jailed after being convicted of armed robbery and illegal possession of a firearm over a smash and grab raid on a jewellers in King's Lynn, Norfolk. Hamza himself faces life in jail in the U.S. after he was convicted of 11 terrorism charges. Meanwhile, his second wife Najat Mostafa, 55, mother of seven of his children, lives in a £1.25million five-bedroom council house in Shepherd’s Bush, West London.","Tito Ibn Sheikh's role in the plot could not be reported until now .

"General Sir David Richards warned that the Government has to be prepared to go to war if it wants to limit the powers of the Assad regime . Britain 'would have to act' to stop chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria falling into the hands of al-Qaeda terrorists, the outgoing head of the Armed Forces revealed today. One of these actions could be to implement a no-fly zone, but General Sir David Richards warned that the Government has to be prepared to go to war if it wants to limit the powers of the Assad regime. The Chief of the Defence Staff, who retires today, said: ‘If you wanted to have the material impact on the Syrian regime’s calculations that some people seek, a no-fly zone per se is insufficient. ‘You have to be able, as we did successfully in Libya, to hit ground targets... so you would be going to war if that is what you want to do.’ Sir David, 61, continued: ‘The risk of terrorism is becoming more and more dominant in our strategic vision for what we might do in Syria.  If that risk develops, we would almost certainly have to act to mitigate it and we are ready to do so. ‘I think it is a very big question. If we saw chemical weapons proliferate as a result of what is happening in Syria then we would have to act. Obviously we have contingency plans for everything.’ He said the Government needed to clarify its ‘political objective’ in Syria before a military plan for dealing with Bashar al-Assad’s regime could be recommended. In another chilling warning Sir David said that once Nato leave Afghanistan in 2015, outside the country's towns and cities 'we shouldn't be surprised if Taliban black flags fly', he said. He also revealed in a wide-ranging interview that there were disagreements between him and David Cameron over British airstrikes in Libya in 2011. In a stinging rebuke, General Richards added that Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander was wrong to push for more cuts to the military, and accused him of making 'feeble' attempts to 'have a go at us'. This year the senior minister ridiculed the department for having ‘more horses than tanks’. Shame: This photo by the official Syrian Araba News Agency (SANA) allegedly shows mortar shells and chemicals used as weapons . A Syrian victim who suffered an alleged chemical attack at Khan al-Assal village receives treatment by doctors, and the head of the British armed forces said today that Britain should be prepared to step in . Earlier this month David Cameron ditched plans to arm the Syrian rebels after being warned by military chiefs that there is little point sending small arms or ground-to-air missiles because it would make little difference to the outcome of the conflict unless he is prepared for all-out war with the Assad regime. Prime Minister David Cameron said Assad had 'blood on his hands' and insisted it was 'unthinkable' the dictator could play any part in the nation's future. In an interview with The Sun, Gen Richards said that British forces could also be sent to the country to prevent chemical weapons falling into the wrong hands. 'The risk of terrorism is becoming more and more dominant in our strategic vision for what we might do in Syria,' he told the paper. 'If that risk develops, we would almost certainly have to act to mitigate it and we are ready to do so. I think it is a very big question. If we saw chemical weapons proliferate as a result of what is happening in Syria then we would have to act.' Prime Minister David Cameron said Assad had 'blood on his hands' and insisted it was 'unthinkable' the dictator could play any part in the nation's future . He added: 'Some could characterise that, even though it might be for a limited period, as a war'. Last week British spy chiefs warned Syria's arsenal of chemical weapons could fall into the hands of al Qaida militants if Assad was toppled with potentially 'catastrophic' consequences. The parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), which oversees the work of the intelligence agencies, said there was 'serious concern' about the security of the 'vast stockpiles' of chemical weapons amassed by the regime. General Richards steps down after a career of more than 40 years in the British Army. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1971 and served in Northern Ireland, Germany, East Timor, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, where his role as head of the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) made him the first British general to command American troops since the Second World War.","General Sir David Richards says UK may have to go to war to tackle Assad .

"Two cabin crew swapped shifts so they would not be on the doomed Malaysian airliner downed by a missile in eastern Ukraine, after raising concerns about the safety of flying over the war zone. Other senior pilots and cabin crew had flagged up fears about the flightpath in the weeks leading up to the tragedy, although Malaysia Airlines last night denied ignoring crew concerns. Some staff are reported to have refused to fly over the airspace where the passenger airliner was downed because they deemed it to be too volatile and dangerous, especially after two Ukrainian planes, a fighter jet and a transport aircraft, were shot down by rebels. Scroll down for video . Malaysia Airlines stewardess Angeline Premila Rajandaran, 30, who was the youngest member of crew on board flight MH17 when it was shot down over Ukraine . According to well-placed Malaysia Airlines sources, at least two cabin crew swapped shifts so they would not be on MH17, specifically because they were worried about the flightpath. The Mail on Sunday has been told worried pilots consulted air traffic controllers in Malaysia and also made an informal approach to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). But still Malaysia Airlines did not divert the route, unlike other carriers. British Airways as well as all US airlines, Lufthansa, Air France and Qantas, were already avoiding the war zone in Ukraine, adding an extra 20 minutes’ flight time, and there is growing pressure on Malaysia Airlines to explain why it did not follow suit. Asiana Airlines, another company avoiding the war zone, said: ‘Although the detour adds to flight time and cost, we have been making the detour for safety.’ Last night, civil aviation analyst Chris Yates backed up the pilots’ concerns, saying: ‘My view is that wherever there is a conflict zone, then above that conflict zone the airspace should be closed. ‘Any time that you have civil strife or military strife ongoing in a military area, my opinion is that airspace should be closed until the situation clears up. Why take the risk? The bottom line is: Passengers on flights need to stay safe.’ Tragic: Angeline Premila died doing the job she loved aboard flight MH17 . Ismail Nasarudd, the president of the National Union of Flight Attendants in Malaysia said yesterday that serious questions needed to be asked about how the passenger jet was allowed to fly over the war zone. Mr Nasarudd, who said that he was not aware of any union members who had raised concerns about flying in the airspace, added: ‘We are very angry and upset that this has happened. The International Civil Aviation Organisation had given the green light for aircraft to fly over that airspace above 32,000ft and other airlines were doing so. An air stewardess has cheated death twice – by switching shifts on both doomed Malaysia Airlines flights. Tan Bee Jeok, 43, was supposed to be flying on MH17, which was shot down over Ukraine, and the missing airliner MH370. Tragically, her husband, Sanjid Singh, who is also an air steward, died on the flight downed by a missile on Thursday. Mr Singh, 41, had swapped flights with a colleague to fly on the Kuala Lumpur-bound Boeing 777. Mr and Mrs Singh - she avoided flight MH17 . It is not known why Mrs Singh changed her shift on the flight. Remarkably, she had also swapped her shift on flight MH370, which carried 239 passengers and has been missing since March. The couple lived in Kuala Lumpur with their seven-year-old son. Mr Singh’s father Jijar, 71, told a Malaysian newspaper after hearing of his son’s death: ‘We are in such a state. My whole body is shivering. ‘We are heartbroken because he was our only son. What to do? What has happened, has happened.’ He added: ‘He always called us before he left for his trip. He told us he swapped with a colleague for the return Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight. ‘Sanjid’s wife was meant to fly on MH370 but swapped with a colleague at the last minute.’ Mr Singh’s father said his son had been expected to visit them on his return from Amsterdam, adding: ‘His mother had prepared all his favourite dishes.’ Mr Singh’s daughter, who lives in Italy, informed him about the crash on Friday. A Malaysia Airlines spokesman said last night: ‘Crew members on all airlines regularly swap shifts for various reasons. ‘We cannot discuss individual colleagues’ work patterns.’ ‘We need to know whether the International Civil Aviation Organisation was aware of a risk of flying in that airspace and, if it was, why it made the decision to allow flights. We also want to know whether Malaysia Airlines was specifically targeted.’ The British Civil Aviation Authority had warned operators to take caution in the Donetsk area but Eurocontrol, the EU authority, and the International Civil Aviation Organisation had not imposed a ban on flying through the zone. A Malaysia Airlines spokesman said last night: ‘No crew members have discussed any concerns about flying over Ukraine. ‘Malaysia Airlines, along with many other airlines, has been flying in this airspace, which was declared safe by ICAO and IATA. He added: ‘150 airlines each day were using the same air corridor.’","Airline staff refused to fly over airspace deeming it too dangerous .

"Broken Britain: Prime Minister David Cameron said during a visit to a Norwich school yesterday that he was determined to bring 'rigour' back to the classroom . David Cameron yesterday launched a . blitz on ‘coasting’ schools in affluent areas which are being outshone . by their inner-city counterparts. He said hundreds of secondary schools in better-off parts of the country needed a ‘wake-up call’ to improve their results. In a major speech, Mr Cameron said . that schools in areas such as Oxfordshire and Surrey were being . out-performed by two inner-city London schools. The Prime Minister said these coasting . schools could not blame deprivation for their poor results and pledged . to expose their ‘complacency’. Speaking at a newly-opened free school . in Norwich, Mr Cameron also warned that parents of youngsters who play . truant face having their benefits cuts. He pledged to bring ‘rigour’ back into . Britain’s classrooms and condemned Labour’s ‘prizes for all’ culture, . which frowns on competitiveness. Mr Cameron is under increasing . pressure to reassure Tory MPs and voters that the Coalition is in touch . with middle-class anxieties. His speech was seen as a deliberate . contrast to pledges by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to drive up . standards in poorer areas. Promising a ‘revolution’ in choice, . competition and freedom for schools, Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s not just . failing schools we need to tackle. Respect: As well as giving teachers' more powers to deal with unruly pupils, 'restoring discipline is also about what parents do', Mr Cameron said . It’s coasting schools, too – the ones . whose results have  either flat-lined or where they haven’t improved as . much as they could have.’ He said four-fifths of schools in . Oxfordshire and Surrey had produced poorer results than Walworth Academy . and Burlington Danes Academy, both of which are in London. Between 70 to 75 per cent of pupils at . the London schools gained five or more good GCSEs, despite large . numbers being eligible for free school meals – the accepted measure of . relative poverty. Mr Cameron went on: ‘That must be a wake-up call. Why . is there this difference? Why are these schools coasting along?’ Free schools: London Mayor Boris Johnson (centre right) and Toby Young (centre left) with Headmaster Thomas Packer (top centre) and the first students of the newly opened West London Free School . Twenty-four new free schools have been set up in England since the Coalition came to power - more than half open this week, the rest by the end of the month.The policy, a central plank of the Conservatives' election manifesto, gives people the chance to set up schools in direct response to local demand.Free schools can be primary or secondaries and can be set up by a wide range of proposers which have included teachers, parents, charities, universities, businesses and faith groups. Many are being set up because there are simply not enough school places in the area.The schools, like the new academies, are funded directly by Westminster, are semi-independent and outside local authority control. They have the freedom to vary term times, the curriculum and teachers' pay and conditions.Free schools cannot make a profit and will be subject to the same Ofsted inspections as state schools. They will also have to take part in their local admissions process. Senior Downing Street sources said . ‘super heads’ with experience of turning schools around could  be . drafted in to work alongside existing head teachers to improve . standards. One source said that parents will be . able to judge whether their school is ‘coasting’ when more detailed . performance figures are published in January next year. The Government recently announced it . was increasing the minimum standard for schools. By 2015 any secondary . school in which fewer than 50 per cent of pupils get five good GCSEs . will be defined as failing. The standard is currently 30 per cent. Ministers hope a further 200 free . schools will open next year, and also say around 150 failing secondaries . and 200 failing primary schools will have been transformed into . academies by that time. Mr Cameron said more discipline was needed to mend a ‘broken society’. Chris Keates, of NASUWT, the largest . teachers’ union, said: ‘The Prime Minister’s speech is a desperate . attempt to detract attention from the fact that his Coalition Government . is engaged in a deliberate attempt to privatise schools.’ n Mr Cameron wants his old school, Eton College, to set up a free school, it emerged yesterday. He has held meetings in Downing Street . with the heads of top public schools – including the exclusive . £30,000-a-year boarding school. It is considering setting up a free . ‘mini Eton’, with boarding facilities and high academic standards – but . without the price tag. Prime Minister David Cameron (centre back row) at Heatherdown prep school in 1976 . David Cameron is perfectly placed to discuss elitism in British society having benefited from attendance at the cream of the independent English education system. As a young boy he attended the . preparatory school, Heatherdown, in Berkshire, favoured by Royals and . boasting Princes Andrew and Edward as former pupils. It . was from their exclusive classrooms that he made the move to the . world’s best known public school for boys, Eton, where annual fees at . the six hundred-year-old boys’ school are £31,000. At . current rates the Prime Minister’s senior school years would have cost . more than £150k and that does not include expenditure on school clubs, . like boating and fencing which carry additional tariffs. The . Prime Minister-in-waiting then moved to study Philosophy, Politics and . Economics at Oxford becoming a member of the select all-boy dining . society, The Bullingdon Club. His elevated position in society is apparent in every aspect of his life and has seen him marry well.

"Ronnie O’Sullivan made light of his broken ankle to clinch a 6-3 win over Peter Lines and book his place in the last 32 of the Coral UK Championship. Sullivan was far from his fluent best at the York Barbican Centre, but still knocked in a highest break of 106 as he proved too good for his 44-year-old opponent. His participation had been in doubt after he suggested after a first-round win over Daniel Wells that he might have to withdraw from the tournament. Ronnie O'Sullivan battled through an ankle injury to defeat Peter Lines 6-3 at the York Barbican Centre . But he wrote on Twitter he was 'gonna give the ankle a go' against Leeds potter Lines and the injury did not prove too great a hindrance. The four-time UK champion moved into a 3-0 lead after a scrappy opening three frames, the highest break 54 in the third. Lines took the fourth, but the five-time world champion turned on the style in the next, producing a run of 106. He edged the sixth frame to move within one of victory, but Lines delayed the inevitable by reducing the deficit to 5-3 before a break of 74 saw O’Sullivan over the line. Next up for O’Sullivan is a meeting with Ben Woollaston. Lines, who went 3-0 down early on,  battled back to 5-3 before O'Sullivan pulled away to victory . Earlier in the day, Neil Robertson paid a poignant tribute to fellow Australian Phillip Hughes before battling back from the brink of defeat to stay in the competition. The 32-year-old, a big cricket fan who enjoyed making an unprecedented century of centuries on the baize last season, brought out a bat along with his cue for his second-round clash with Kyren Wilson. Melbourne-born Robertson was joining in the appreciation of Hughes which has come from around the world of sport since the batsman’s death on Thursday. The bat stayed out in the arena with defending champion Robertson, who at one stage looked to be heading out of the tournament but scraped a 6-5 win. Robertson fell 5-4 behind when Wilson made 87 in the ninth frame and, when the 22-year-old English potter fluked the final red in the next, he had a clear match-winning opportunity. Yet Wilson fluffed a crucial positional shot from green to brown and a relieved Robertson was able to pot brown and blue to force the decider. O'Sullivan flexes his injured ankle during his second round 2014 Coral UK Championship game . Wilson had the first chance of the all-important 11th frame, but missed a tricky red and left a half-decent chance. Robertson showed why offering him any such opening is a mistake by rattling in an 86 break to secure a pass to the third round. Robertson later explained that carrying the bat in honour of Hughes gave him added focus at the end of his match against Wilson. He told reporters in a press conference: 'I noticed a lot of other Australian sportsmen doing it over the weekend. It was nice to be able to pay tribute. O'Sullivan tweeted a picture of his broken left ankle on Tuesday . 'It was a really good opportunity for me to do that and show my respect to him and his family. 'I guess it made me just a bit more motivated to stick in there and try to get the win today.' Elsewhere, Mark Allen played brutal hardball as he swatted aside Belgian teenager Luca Brecel. The 28-year-old Northern Irishman, runner-up in York three years ago, beat Brecel 6-0 to reach the last 32. Other winners on Sunday included Peter Ebdon, Stephen Maguire, Shaun Murphy and Ken Doherty.","Ronnie O’Sullivan played through the game with a broken ankle .

"A man sleeping in a school hallway with a glass smoking pipe and a bag of synthetic marijuana marked 'Scooby Snax', was found by police just outside Philadelphia.

"A relative of John Kerry who knew Lee Harvey Oswald well today lashed out at the secretary of state's belief that JFK's assassin did not act alone. 'Oh, dear. He said that?' Ruth Paine reacted when MailOnline told her Monday what Kerry said to NBC's Tom Brokaw on Friday. 'That's so disappointing,' she said. 'These conspiracy theories do a great deal of disservice to history.' Paine married a Kerry cousin and befriended Lee Harvey's Russian wife Marina Oswald. She also got the future killer his job at the Texas School Book Depository. Oswald shot the president from its sixth floor window. Ruth and Michael Paine testified before the Warren Commission after the JFK assassination. The Texas couple befriended Lee Harvey Oswald and his Russian-born bride after their return form the Soviet Union in early 1962 . Lee Harvey Oswald, his wife Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova, and their daughter June Lee (L) were photographed in Minsk the year before they returned to the U.S.  Ruth Paine (R) let Marina and her daughters live in her house after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Now she says the Warren Commission got it right . Her husband Michael was close with Lee, and had him as a frequent house guest. And Oswald had stored his rifle in the garage of her Irving, Texas home, she learned later. It was wrapped tightly inside a green and brown-colored blanket roll. Just days before the 50th anniversary of the assassination, Kerry has . breathed new life into the persistent buzz of naysayers. 'I'm . disappointed,' Ruth Paine said. 'I really feel that people who are . looking at it ought to realize that the Commission did a really . excellent job.' She was referring to the controversial and often disputed 900-page Warren Commission report published a year after the president's assassination that concluded Oswald did act alone. The State Department didn't respond to phone calls seeking comment. Kerry told Brokaw that 'to this day, I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.' 'Really?' a surprised Brokaw asked. 'I certainly have doubts that he was motivated by himself,' Kerry replied. Oswald held his Mannlicher-Carcano rifle in this photo, which may have been the one he showed Michael Paine. Oswald stored his gun in the Paines' garage . Doubts: Kerry told Tom Brokaw (L) that he's still not sure Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone assassin who acted alone in 1963 . 'I mean, I'm not sure if anybody else . is involved – I won't go down that road with respect to the Grassy Knoll . theory and all that – but I have serious questions about whether they . got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald's time and influence from Cuba . and Russia,' said the secretary of state. Michael Paine wouldn't speak to MailOnline, laughing off the idea that he was related to Secretary of State John Forbes Kerry. But the two are second cousins through their mothers, who were first cousins, according to news reports, and his wife. 'My former husband is related to the Forbes family – one branch of the family, the less-expensive type,' Mrs Paine told MailOnline. Her father-in-law and sister-in-law, through a sibling's marriage, both had unspecified CIA ties, according to papers released under the JFK Documents Act. All those worlds collided with the seamy underbelly of presidential assassinations at the Paine residence, where the Oswalds were always welcome. Marina lived there for months with her first daughter after she and her husband moved back to Dallas from New Orleans two months before the assassination. Lee Harvey Oswald stayed in the house the night before he killed Kennedy, bringing the wrapped-up rifle to his book depository job the next morning. The garage: Michael and Ruth Paine's home is now a museum, in which visitors can see a projected image of an actress playing Marina Oswald talk about her husband's rifle (lower right) that he stored there during 1963 . Moments before the fateful shot -- or shots? -- rang out, Kennedy waved to well-wishers in Dallas . Oswald tried to kill Gen. Edwin A. Walker earlier in 1963. That fact, says Ruth Paine, points toward his guilt . Ruth Paine and Marina Oswald had a special relationship, formed when the Paines attended a dinner party hosted by friends who wanted to introduce them to other couples who were interested in Russian culture. Ruth drove the Oswalds to New Orleans and back during their two 1963 moves. After the assassination, Marina and her two daughters stayed with Ruth briefly until the Secret Service took her into custody. Mrs. Paine would later say her Quaker faith led her to take the woman and her children in. 'Oswald's wife was at our house a lot, and the rifle was there,' Ruth Paine told MailOnline. 'Of course, I didn't know he had a gun. I'm a Quaker. I wouldn't have wanted that in the house.' But Michael Paine knew. 'Obviously he liked guns,' Mr. Paine said of Oswald during a 1993 interview for a CBS documentary. 'I went one afternoon to pick him up, went upstairs, and I think the first thing he did, practically, was pick up this photograph of himself – eight by ten – holding his rifle there and some papers. I was a little startled. I suppose he was looking for a big revolution.' When Ruth learned that detail after the assassination, she also discovered that taking a shot at the president wasn't Oswald's first assassination attempt. 'Oswald tried to shoot and kill someone in April 1963,' she said on Monday. 'It was in Vincent Bugliosi's book.' John Kerry was barely out of high school in 1963, but fancies himself a Warren Commission skeptic. His second cousin knew Lee Harvey Oswald well . The 1,600-page tome 'Reclaiming . History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy,' was the 2007 . project of Bugliosi, best known as Charles Manson's prosecutor. 'It . was General Edwin A. Walker,' she recalled to MailOnline. 'Oswald left a . note for Marina saying that the guy was a fascist. The shot was a . near-miss, but I think he believed he'd killed him.' Walker . later said that when he heard about the 'second gunman' theory in the . Kennedy case, he started believing there was a second gunman at the site . of his near-death experience, too. That . would fit in with some conspiracy theorists' belief that the CIA or a . Cuban conspiracy used Oswald as a patsy, since the same kind of . lightning could have struck twice. 'I wish all of this were better covered,' Ruth told MailOnline. 'It's crucial. Oswald bought his gun and within days he was out shooting at someone. Someone like Kerry should know that.' An Associated Press poll this month found that just 24 per cent of Americans believe the central conclusion of the Warren Commission report, which found that Oswald was not part of any broader conspiracy to eliminate President Kennedy.","Ruth Paine married John Kerry's second cousin, and also knew JFK's assassin and his Russian wife Marina .
The gunman stored his rifle in her garage without her knowledge, and used it in another murder attempt seven months before Kennedy died .
Ruth, a Quaker, was best friend of Oswald's wife Marina, and also got the killer his job at the School Book Depository from where he shot JFK .
She's disappointed that the secretary of state is giving oxygen to conspiracy theories that dispute the official findings about Nov. 22, 1963 .
'To this day,' Kerry said Friday in an NBC interview, 'I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone'"
"A woman in McArthur, Ohio came home from a two-week vacation last month to discover her house had been mistakenly repossessed. At first Katie Barnett, 36, thought the changed locks meant a squatter, but reality turned out to be much worse than that when she broke into her own home and found it completely emptied. It turns out the repo men sent by First National Bank of Wellston, Ohio to gut the house, had mistaken Barnett's house for the bank-owned home across the street. Unpleasant surprise: When Katie Barnett returned from vacation last month, she found her house had been mistakenly repossessed . 'A GPS had led them to my house, the president of the bank told me,' Barnett told 10 TV. 'They also said my grass hadn't been mowed so they just assumed that was the house.' Ms Barnett points out that the houses are clearly marked. The bank owned 509, and her house is 514. The wrong house: The GPS system used by the repo men took them to Barnett's house, number 514, instead of bank-owned number 509. They assumed that the overgrown grass meant it was the correct property . Now Ms Barnett, a nurse with children ages six to 18, wants her life back, but the bank isn't being accommodating in the way she hoped. Ms Barnett sent the bank an estimate of the lost items, totaling $18,000 and the president refused to pay it. Among the items lost in the foreclosure were car engine parts valued at $9,000. 'He told me that I would probably need receipts for everything that they took and they were not paying retail. I told him I wasn't running a yard sale and asking them to make me an offer,' Ms Barnett told Good Morning America. Empty rooms: The family is currently living with what furniture the bank left behind . Proof of purchase: Ms Barnett says the bank has asked her to provide receipts for everything she lost . 'I told him I don't keep receipts around for everything I have just in a case a bank comes by and steals my stuff. And if I did, where do you think it would be? With the stuff that you threw away?' Bank President and CEO Tony Thorne issued a statement with their side of the store. Mr Thorne apologized for the incident, saying: 'Nothing like this has ever happened before.' As for Ms Barnett's list of losses, he insists that the written list of items she provided were 'inconsistent with the list and descriptions of items removed that was prepared by the employees who did the work.' Inconsistent: First National Bank's President and CEO Tony Thorne said Ms Barnett's list of items is different from the list his repo men prepared while emptying the house . Barnett has retained an attorney and plans to sue the bank. 'We are definitely going to bring a lawsuit,' she said. 'I gave them a chance and they are not willing to work with me.' Outrage over the faulty repression has spread to the internet. One petition has over 13,000 signers demanding First National Bank pay Ms Barnett her money immediately 'so she can get her life back again.' For the time being, Barnett and her children are living with just the furniture that the bank left behind. 'It's kind of ruined their summer, that's for sure,' she said.","Katie Barnett, a nurse in McArthur, Ohio, was on a two-week vacation with her family when her house was repossessed by First National Bank of Wellston .

"Officials at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant are building a mile-long wall of ice to prevent radioactive water from leaking into the Pacific Ocean. More than three years after the March 2011 meltdowns, the Fukushima plant is still plagued by a massive amount of contaminated water. Repeated leaks from storage tanks and other mishaps have hampered a decommissioning effort that is expected to take decades. Workers place pipes into the ground around the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in a bid to create an 'ice wall' around the plant to prevent contamination . The pipes being sunk into the ground will be filled with liquid coolant which will freeze the surrounding earth in the hopes that this will decrease the amount of water seeping into plants . A Tepco official measures radiation close to the site . Experts from Tepco - which owns the site - are freezing earth around the station to create an underground 1.4km wall of ice. The technique will work by flooding the damaged reactors with vast amounts of water in order to keep them cool. The water will become radioactive, Al Jazeera reports. Officials said they have already tested the technique but that the water had failed to freeze the earth sufficiently. The wall will freeze soil around four reactors at the power plant in northern Japan . The technique will work by flooding the damaged reactors with vast amounts of water in order to keep them cool . The wall, stretching 0.9miles and nearly 100 feet deep, will be set up around reactors 1 to 4 at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, which suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Workers will insert a line of pipes into the ground that circulate liquid as cold as -40C - causing the earth around them to freeze. As well as preventing polluted water from escaping the plant, the wall will also block groundwater from flowing into the buildings' basements and mixing with highly radioactive water leaks from the melted cores. Workers test a journalist for radiation levels after a visit to the plant . The Fukushima Dai-ichi plant suffered multiple meltdowns following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Above, smoke is pictured rising from reactor 3 at the nuclear power plant on March 21, 2011 . Earlier this year, Dale Klein, a former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman who now heads a supervisory panel for TEPCO, said he was not convinced the 'ice wall' is the best way to prevent radioactive water from escaping the plant. He also claimed the Government and TEPCO should review the plan to balance risk and benefit to see whether they should spend the money elsewhere. 'Any time you make a decision, it should be based on current, relevant science, and you have to strike a balance between science and policy,' he said. 'At the end of the day, it may be a good alternative. But I'm just not convinced.' Akiro Ono, the plant's manager, told Al Jazeera the latest effort to construct the ice wall was working. 'The ice wall itself has been tested. And in those cases we've seen that the ground itself does freeze so I myself am not that worried that it will not go well,' Ono said.","Experts are freezing earth around station to create underground 1.4km wall .

"The toddler who died in his father's hot SUV in Georgia last month had been switched out of his forward-facing new car seat weeks before his death - even though he was too big for his old one. Cooper Harris was found dead in his rear-facing car seat in a parking lot in Cobb County, Georgia on June 18 - after sweltering inside for more than seven hours. His father, Ross Harris, faces a murder charge in the boy's death - but insists he mistakenly left his 22-month-old son inside the car before heading to work at Home Depot. With the boy in the rear-facing seat, Harris would not have seen his child if he looked over towards it. Scroll down for video . Loss: Cooper Harris, pictured with his parents Justin Ross and Leanna, had been switched out of a seat that might have been easier for his father to see him in the back of the sweltering car . During a probable cause hearing on Thursday, Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified that the boy was 'several inches' too big for the child seat, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. He added that the parents had bought a new, forward-facing child seat just six weeks ago but they switched back to his old seat for reasons that are not yet clear. 'Harris knew the specific make and model of the seat and what the weight limit was for the child to be seated in it,' the warrants state. 'When the seat was inspected the straps for the seat were set on the lowest level for a small child.' Harris told detectives his son was 'developing fine'. Suspicions are also growing about what role Harris' wife may have played in the death. Accused: Justin Ross Harris, pictured at his bond hearing in Mariette, Georgia on Thursday, is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a hot SUV on June 18 . Emotional: Harris is facing additional charges of sexual exploitation of a minor as well as murder . Leanna Harris has not yet been charged with any crime but she expressed little emotion throughout Thursday’s hearing, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away. Investigators also described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious. When . workers at her son's day care said that Cooper had never been dropped . off, she calmly responded: ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There's . no other explanation,’ Stoddard said. When . reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been . charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him: 'Did you say too much?' according to Stoddard. When she called home June 18 with the . grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone . saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’ Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’ Familiar face: Leanna Harris, right, wife of . Justin Ross Harris, arrives for her husband's bond hearing in Cobb . County Magistrate Court Thursday. There are also questions surrounding her reactions to her son's death . Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month . Police . had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched . children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling . officers it was her ‘worst fear.’ At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him. ‘Ross . is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her . husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’ Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions. 'Some . of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the . same question,' the deeply religious mother said. Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head . 'I should be crumpled . into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing . behind me, holding me up.' The . 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her . two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, . even if she could. 'He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is,' she said. Detective Stoddard also told the court . that several injuries were found on the boy's body, including . visible marks on his face, revealing that he had struggled to escape as temperatures soared.

"The man dubbed 'America's scariest police chief' will not lose his job after posting 'disturbing' videos of himself firing assault rifles and threatening liberals because the town's mayor thinks he is exercising his freedom of speech. Mark Kessler is the only police officer in the tiny hamlet of Gilberton, Pennsylvania, but has caused serious concern following his appearances in a slew of foul mouthed and provocative videos in which he attacks Secretary of State John Kerry and makes rude slurs against liberals. The self-professed gun fanatic and militia member, who carries an M-16 to work policing his town of 700 people, has been unapologetic about his conduct denying all claims he is a 'delusional lunatic' and claims the YouTube clips were 'designed to get people's attention.' Scroll down for video . Chief of Police of One: Mark Kessler  the one-man police force of tiny Gilberton has made a series of videos in which he advocates his support of the Second Amendment and made disparaging remarks about liberals . Kessler made headlines in 2011 after he shot himself in the hand after pulling his weapon to intervene in a bar fight. He was off-duty and was the only person armed in the altercation. To date, over 40,000 people have viewed Kessler's videos - which he uploads under the banner of his Constitutional Security Force - which he claims is designed to protect the rights of all Americans, but isn't a militia - despite being armed. 'What he does in his private life, we have no control of,' Gilberton Mayor Mary Lou Hannon told Frank Andruscavage of the Pottsville Republican Herald when asked about the video. In one video Kessler uploaded to YouTube on July 15th, the 14-year veteran tells viewers offended by his profanity to 'go f**k yourself'. Second Amendment: Mark Kessler sports one of his modified rifles and the uniform of his Constitutional Security Force (right) Chief Mark Kessler - pictured in 2010 - shot himself in the hand a year later after he tried to split up a bar fight . 'F**k all you libtards out there, as a matter of fact, read my shirt,' rants Kessler as he turns to reveal the back of his T-shirt which reads, 'Liberals take it in the a**.' 'You take it in the a**a and I don't give a f**k what you say so you can all just go f**K yourselves,' says Kessler. 'If you f**king maniacs want to turn this into an armed revolt, knock yourselves out. I'm not about that, so see you on the other side.' In a second video uploaded to YouTube later that day, Kessler takes it on himself to pretend to apologize to the thousands of people who wrote him messages of complaint. The unnerving video begins with a mock-apology to all those 'libtards' who claimed their feelings were hurt by his language and then begins a rant about calling Secretary of State john Kerry a 'traitor'. In the video he claims to be annoyed by a recent news article in which Kerry says the U.N. would sign an arms control treaty which many conservatives see as a stealth assault on the Second Amendment. 'That piece of s**t traitor,' yells Kessler into the camera. 'Who is he to decide what we can and can't own? And f**K the U.N. Who are they to decide what we, the American people, can own?' 'I've got a message to Kerry and to these c**ksuckers over in the U.N. Sign anything you want to sign. It's not going to mean s**t. 'You know what I have to say to you? Come and take it, motherf**kers.' Angry: In his first video posted on July 15th - Police Chief Mark Kessler shows how he feels about liberals - while sporting a Confederate flag on his T-shirt . Hate: Chief Mark Kessler shows off his real attitudes towards liberals with a motto on the back of his T-shirt in his July 15th video . Kessler then proceeds to fire off rounds from his assault weapon, calling it his 'sincere apology.' After firing the first weapon, Kessler screams out, 'I'm hurting some feelings today. All you f**king libtards out there, all you f**king crybabies, grow a pair of balls, and man the F**k up, all right?' In an interview with the Pottsville Republican-Herald, Kessler affirmed his right to make the videos. 'I think the video is in support of the Constitution—the support of the First Amendment, the right to express your thoughts and words freely without reprisal from any government,' said Kessler. 'That’s why I used the vocabulary I did. As for the firing of the guns, that is my Second Amendment right. I have the right to keep and bear arms regardless of what the government says that I don’t.' Kessler's Constitutional Security Forces, despite stating they are not a militia are still armed and declare they will, 'Defend our Constitution our country from tyranny only if needed.' Attack on John Kerry: In his second video, Kessler pretended to apologize and then launched into a violent tirade against John Kerry culminating in him firing a round of assault rifle fire . Gilberton Mayor Mary Lou Hannon (left), has refused to fire her police chief Mark Kessler (right) because he was not wearing a uniform when he made his controversial comments . Uploaded: This is how Police Chief Kessler announced to the world his first video attacking liberals onto Twitter . He also hosts his own regular radio show and has uploaded videos to YouTube in which he claims he is being followed by suspicious helicopters and unidentified members of the military. The chief, Mark Kessler, the one-man police force of tiny Gilberton, population about 800, and some other gun-rights advocates view the treaty — which Congress would have to ratify for the U.S. to take part — as a step toward restricting the domestic use of more conventional weapons that are personal property. In a telephone interview, Kessler said he made the videos to draw attention to what he views as the erosion of the constitutional rights of free speech and to bear arms and to speak out for the many others who are afraid to do so. He also said he is increasingly concerned about what he views as a government out of control, citing the FBI's use of drones, the National Security Agency's collection of hundreds of millions of Americans' phone records and the Internal Revenue Service's scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status by politically active groups. 'I'm trying to wake people up to say, 'Hey, there's a lot more going on than meets the eye.' A lot more,' Kessler said in an interview from Texas where the 41-year-old father of four was vacationing. 'It goes way beyond the Second Amendment, the First Amendment. It's a shame. Our founding fathers didn't intend for our government to be the way it is.' Kessler, who called himself 'a wholeheartedly good man who loves his country,' acknowledged that some people were upset by the videos, but he said he does not regret posting them and insisted that many more people were supportive of them. Gilberton Mayor Mary Lou Hannon said Wednesday that she found the language offensive and understood that many others did, too. 'They're like watching an R-rated movie,' Hannon said. 'The profanity and violence in it was a little upsetting.' Not a Militia: The Constitutional Security Force which is headed by Kessler deny they are a militia . The weapons in the video are legal weapons and belong to the police department after he purchased them with his own money and donated them in a transaction approved by the borough council, Hannon said. The council, which has had a contract with Kessler for 14 years, is planning to address the matter with Kessler in a private session Wednesday, Hannon said. She said she supports his continued employment, noting that he has made a lot of residents feel safe and responds to emergencies at all hours. 'If you were in trouble and you needed somebody to protect you, Mark would be the person you would want running to your aid,' Hannon said. 'My experience and that of many of our residents (is) he will die for you. He's loyal and I think that's important.' Watch Video Here: . Kessler, a former coal miner, is active in gun-rights circles, appearing on an online radio broadcast on the conservative conspiracy theory website Infowars, hosting an online radio show on a website that bills itself as the 'voice of the resistance,' speaking at gun-rights rallies and hosting his own website where he is seeking recruits for what he calls the Constitutional Security Force. He also has claimed in recent weeks that his outspoken views on gun rights have earned him death threats. On Wednesday, he would not say how many people have signed up for the security force, but said there are chapters in 45 states and many recruits are current or former members of law enforcement and the military. The mission, he says on the website, is to help the military or peace officers to defend the constitution and country from 'tyranny.' In January, Kessler drafted a resolution the borough adopted that calls for 'nullifying' any federal, state or local regulations that infringe on the Second Amendment. He boasted about the resolution while speaking at a February gun-rights rally on the steps of the Pennsylvania Capitol. 'If they come in and try to disarm any of my citizens, it's not going to go over very well,' he told the crowd.","Mark Kessler is the police chief and only police officer for Gilberton, Pennsylvania - population 700 .

"Australia is involved in what could be a century-long conflict against radical Islam but should try to avoid direct combat, a new reports says. Former army chief Peter Leahy says Australia should not sit idly by but there are limits to what it can do. 'Australia's international focus should be on co-operating with allies and friends to support moderate nations with radical Islamist problems in the immediate region: Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan,' he says in a report released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Former army chief Peter Leahy says Australia should not sit idly by but there are limits to what it can do . Professor Leahy, the director of the Canberra University National Security Institute, says the threat from radical Islamists is real, likely to be sustained and a threat to Australia's way of life. The home-grown terrorism threat would worsen and there was real potential for attacks. But Australia should try to avoid involvement in fighting the extremists because this was the responsibility of regional nations. 'The best course of action is to be careful about becoming involved and to offer carefully tailored, largely non-combat support where appropriate,' he says in the paper. Professor Leahy says defensive measures are important but so is an offensive capability to reach out to deter and if necessary destroy imminent threats. 'The focus should be on defensive and protective measures and intervention only when there's a clear vision of what can be achieved, an agreed and long-term strategy, and the commitment of resources over an extended period,' he says. Professor Leahy's comments come just days after Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop confirmed Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to combat the growing threat of terror group Islamic State. Only on Saturday had Ms Bishop said there were still no plans to put boots on the ground in Iraq. But on Sunday it was a different story. 'We have reached an agreement for a legal framework and now it will be a matter for our military when our special forces will be deployed,' Ms Bishop said.","Former army Peter Leahy says Australia should not sit idly by but should limit what does .

"Quel horreur: Rouge Sucette, which means red lollipop, is designed to win new wine fans . A French drinks company is launching a red wine that will have the edge on its competitors - by adding a dash of cola. In a break with tradition Rouge Sucette, French for red lollipop, is made from 75 per cent grapes with water, sugar and cola flavouring making up the remainder. Sure to horrify connoisseurs, it is designed to appeal to the younger 'Coke generation'. Winemakers fear that young people who drink endless spirits and mixers will be difficult to attract if they do not adapt to their sweet palette. The 9 per cent ABV blend is part of a . new range by Aquitaine-based firm Haussmann Famille. They also make fruity . Passion Fruit and Grape Fruit blends. The company recommends serving it ice-cold for the summer weather. It went on sale this week for 2.95 euros a bottle and is hoped to become a feature of French barbeques and summer drinks parties. Pauline Lacombe, Marketing Director of Haussmann Famille, said: 'The result is surprising; the balance between the bitterness of the wine and the sweetness of the cola is perfect.' 'We did a lot of research to elaborate the best recipe and the best mix between wine, water and the aroma. 'The packaging is fun, with a label in the shape of lollipop. 'This kind of product is more dedicated to young adults, and women. Inspiration: Rouge Sucette's bouquet will be flavourings of cola . Young fans: The French company is hoping a wine as sweet as cola will appeal to young drinkers who prefer spirits and mixers . 'We have worked closely with a lab in Bordeaux, specialised in aroma.' Despite having a reputation for their snobbish attitude to wine, the French themselves have actually embraced flavoured wines, drinking a predicted 30 million bottles in 2013. Cola wine could also be a big hit in Britain, as sugar consumption has increased by 31 per cent since 1990, with the average person consuming 700g of sugar a week.","Rouge Sucette is only 75 per cent wine, the rest is sugar, water and cola .

"Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga troubles continued on Sunday with a 2-0 loss at Eintracht Frankfurt that left the 2011 and 2012 champions bottom of the table after 13 games. Alexander Meier's fourth-minute strike and Haris Seferovic's goal in the 78th were enough to inflict Dortmund with their eighth defeat of the season. Meier got the home side off to a flying start when he ran onto Marco Russ's long clearance and clipped the ball past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.

Ginter headed the ball back to the Dortmund captain, only to find he had emerged from goal, and the grateful Seferovic made no mistake. Frankfurt reserve keeper Felix Wiedwald produced a host of saves at the other end as the home side climbed to ninth. The 24-year-old Wiedwald, playing because of an injury to Kevin Trapp, denied Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while Kevin Grosskreutz almost equalized in the 24th minute when he struck the post on the rebound from Aubameyang's effort. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp vowed he would continue fighting to turn the side's domestic season around. 'I consider myself fully responsible,' said Klopp. 'There's no tendency (for a coaching change) here. Until someone comes along and tells me otherwise, I can't go away.

"This is the moment a racehorse was shot dead at a busy racecourse after breaking its leg near the end of a race. Wigmore Hall raced on courses around the world before it was humanely destroyed at Doncaster races at the weekend. The seven-year-old horse shattered one of its forelegs and fell less than three furlongs (less than half a mile) from the finish at the St Leger festival at Doncaster last weekend. Scroll down for video . This is the moment Wigmore Hall was humanely destroyed at Doncaster Races after breaking a leg in a race . The decision was taken to put the badly hurt animal down, and a temporary screen was erected to shield the scene from hundreds of racegoers. The horse's jockey, 26-year-old Adam Kirby, was understood to be inconsolable. Afterwards specialist vets said the decision to put a quick end to the animal's suffering was the right one. The RSPCA's equine consultant, David Muir, said: 'I can't see that the vet has done anything wrong or the racecourse, either. 'Shooting a horse is probably the most humane and quick way that you could put a horse down.' He told the Guardian: 'In the circumstances where a horse has suffered a catastrophic injury, what would worry me more would be the delay involved in splinting the leg, taking the horse away and putting him down somewhere else after the horse has been suffering all that time.' An equine vet, who asked not to be named, told MailOnline: 'What the picture is showing is a veterinary procedure, an act of humanity rather than one of cruelty.' The seven-year-old horse had been competing at the St Leger festival at Doncaster Racecourse when it fell . A spokesman for the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) said: 'British racing's welfare standards far exceed existing animal welfare legislation. 'Over the last 15 years, the equine fatality rate in British racing has fallen by a third. Horses are at risk of injury throughout their lives, regardless of the type of equestrian activity they participate in.' The authority also confirmed that the fatality rate for racehorses currently stands at 0.2 per cent. BHA chief veterinary officer Jenny Hall said: 'This sad incident was the only fatality at Doncaster's flat racing course this year from 1,563 runners. 'The team of veterinary surgeons were at Wigmore Hall's side in moments after the injury. The vets were able to make an immediate assessment of the Wigmore Hall's condition. 'In this case the diagnosis was made that the injury was untreatable, so the correct course of action for Wigmore Hall's welfare was for him to be humanely put down.'","Racehorse Wigmore Hall broke a leg less than three furlongs from the finish .

"If the Premier League awarded points for apologies, Joey Barton might already have made amends for the latest red card of his controversial career. As it is, even Barton’s own teammates at Queens Park Rangers are growing tired of their captain’s excuses after they were left to battle fellow strugglers Hull City for an hour with 10 men. Barton was sent off in the 32nd minute for shoving Hull defender Alex Bruce and then aiming a low blow into the groin of Tom Huddlestone. Joey Barton (left) hits out at Tom Huddlestone in the groin during the first half of QPR's game against Hull . Barton's red card was the ninth dismissal he has received over the course of a controversial career . Charlie Austin's strike means he is the joint top-scoring Englishman in the Premier League this season alongside Harry Kane with 14 goals. The 32-year-old will now miss the next three games in QPR’s survival fight – London derbies against Arsenal, Tottenham and Crystal Palace – and apologised profusely to his teammates and the club’s supporters after Saturday’s costly defeat at the KC Stadium. But Charlie Austin, who cancelled out Nikica Jelavic’s opening goal only to see Dame N’Doye head a late winner for Hull, said: ‘There’s only so many times you can say sorry. ‘It’s a silly sending-off and it’s kind of cost us the game. He’s the villain and rightly so for getting sent off. He’s got to deal with it. ‘He’s going to miss the next three games and he’s an important player for us, he’s our captain. We move on now.’ New QPR head coach Chris Ramsey wants to take his players away on a training break this week and will use the opportunity to speak to Barton, whose ninth red card of his career followed a Premier League record seven consecutive yellows. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor called for Barton to undergo anger management in May 2012 after the midfielder was banned for 12 games for lashing out at Manchester City players Carlos Tevez, Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany, and Ramsey has not ruled it out as an option now. The midfielder pushed Hull's defender Alex Bruce before attempting a low blow on Huddlestone . The QPR captain trudges off the field after receiving his marching orders in the first half . ‘It’s something I would discuss with the player and see what he’s open to,’ said the QPR boss. ‘The medical staff are very good here so I’m sure a whole range of things have been discussed with him in his career. ‘He’s quite an intelligent lad and I’m sure he would be open to anything that he thought could help him. We’ll have a discussion in the cold light of day away from this incident and see where we go next.’ Barton apologised to his teammates at half-time and to fans on Twitter, but insisted that he was only defending Darnell Furlong after the teenage debutant had angered the Hull players with a late challenge on Jelavic. ‘Senior pros shouldn’t be running over asking for him to be sent off,’ said Barton. ‘If the boot was on the other foot, I wouldn’t be screaming for a 19-year-old kid from Hull to be sent off. ‘Alex Bruce has run 40 yards to not only get in the ref’s face and scream for a red card but he barged me in the process. Dame N'Doye scored an 89th minute winner for Hull as they moved up to 15th in the Premier League table . ‘I’ve stupidly reacted and touched Tom Huddlestone up. Absolutely no malice, I didn’t intend to hurt Tom. But I’ve been a fool and I’ve been rightly punished for it. ‘You see other incidents where people make contact with other people’s faces and it isn’t a red card. Without making excuses for my own actions, it’s stupid but not malicious. ‘I was sitting in there for a couple of hours just thinking how stupid it was. The sickener for me, as someone who puts the team above everything else, is that I’ve let the team down. ‘I’ve apologised to everyone and come out and fronted up. I’ve always been one, when I’ve made mistakes, to hold my hands up and say I’ve made a mistake. ‘It’s a testament to the kind of person that I am that I’ve fronted up. I’ve made a mistake, I’m human. I’ll try my utmost to atone for it in whatever way that is. All I can say is I’m sorry I’ve let people down, certainly our fans and the players. Charlie Austin (right) feigned a knee injury in celebration as a reference to his reported failed medical ahead of a proposed move to Hull last summer after making it 1-1 . ‘I’m a man of substance and a man of principle. I can only apologise to the lads, I can’t chop my arm off and give it to them. Obviously, if I could rewind it and take it back, I wouldn’t do it. ‘There are no excuses. As a 32-year-old with a few hundred Premier League appearances, and someone who’s been captain of the club for a while with a very public profile, I should know a lot better. ‘People will lambast me from pillar to post and I have to accept that. As one of the tallest trees, you catch the most wind. I won’t shy away from it. ‘There’s a long way to go between now and the end of the season and I hope to atone for it because that’s all I can really do.’","10-man QPR fell to a late defeat at fellow strugglers Hull on Saturday .

"A woman has been accused of running into a school wielding a baseball bat in her underwear. Chesie Lawton, 23, has been charged with  trespassing at Westside Elementary in Memphis, Tennessee, moments before hundreds of children were due to arrive for their lunch. According to WMC5, the first officers on scene were flagged down by a teacher who said the woman was 'acting out' during the bizarre disturbance. Chesie Lawton, 23, has been charged with criminal trespassing Westside Elementary in Memphis, Tennessee. Officers said she was 'acting out' and screaming while wielding a baseball bat . Officials say the woman came onto campus and entered the cafeteria through a back door while screaming. Reports from earlier in the day suggest she had been running round the neighbourhood with her shirt on, but then removed it before entering the school. According to an incident report, 'officers opened the door and the female tried to get away. The female was yelling and acting out. She was nervous and squirming all over the place.' A statement by Shelby County Schools said: 'This person entered the building through a door located in the rear of the building.' A statement from Shelby County Schools suspects she may have been able to get in because one of the doors was not locked properly . 'This is not a public entrance/exit or an entrance/exit used by students. 'All exterior doors are designed to lock automatically when pulled shut; however, it appears someone who used the door accidentally failed to shut it completely. 'This incident did not occur in the presence of any children, and police responded within a few minutes.' However parents were concerned that they were not told about the intrusion that could have harmed their children. Tori Fink told WMBF: 'The school didn't notify any parents. No way, form or fashion.' Police say Lawton also has a warrant out for her arrest in Millington. She is locked up in the Shelby County jail on $100 bond. According to the New York Daily News, Lawton told the officers she had problems with her diabetes. However it is not clear how she connected those health issues to her odd behavior. Parents at the school reacted angrily to the alleged trespassing, saying they were not notified 'in any form' even though the children could have been harmed .","Chesie Lawton has been charged with trespassing at Westside Elementary .

"The BBC yesterday refused to reveal how many households are dodging the licence fee by watching television programmes on the internet. It is thought many of the one million homes which do not pay the charge watch programmes legally on internet catch-up services, such as the BBC iPlayer, which do not need a licence to use. The loophole is believed to be costing the Corporation millions a year in lost revenue from the £145.50 annual fee. The BBC turned down a freedom of information request asking for the number of households who had said they didn't need a licence fee . And critics accused the BBC of . 'refusing to answer legitimate questions' by concealing how many people . were using the online loophole to avoid payment. John Whittingdale, chairman of the . Commons culture, media and sport committee, urged the Corporation to . publish the figures so the public could have a 'proper debate' on the . future of the licence fee. The first licence fee was issued in November 1922 for radio users, and cost a princely 10 shillings (50p). The first combined Radio/TV licence - for £2 - was issued in June 1946. As television became popular, radio-only licences were abolished in February 1971. The first supplementary licence fee for colour TV was introduced in January 1968. The original iPlayer service was launched as a five-month trial in October 2005, with 5,000 broadband users testing it. It . was then gradually rolled out and made available to more people across . the UK until in 2011 an international version was launched. A television licence is not needed to watch iPlayer content after it has been broadcast. However, the 'Watch Live' option, which broadcasts some channels simultaneously with television demands a valid TV licence. He said: 'The licence fee was created . when television was in a different world, when there was very little . choice and everybody watched the BBC. 'Today people have access to hundreds of channels as well as downloads, catch-up services and on demand. 'As more and more choice is available, the arguments for having a licence fee no longer hold. 'It is important that figures for . things like how many people are avoiding the licence fee by using . catch-up services are released so there can be an informed discussion . about what to do about the fee.' Almost all the BBC's programmes are . available on the internet catch-up service and can be viewed just a few . minutes after they have finished on television. Some programmes, such as a forthcoming Peter Kay sitcom, are even being made available on iPlayer first. The idea looks set to be extended . after the BBC approved a 12-month trial which would allow up to 40 hours . of programming to be shown on BBC online before transmission on TV. It means licence fee payers without . access to iPlayer are funding programmes they cannot watch, which could . be seen first by those who are escaping the charge. Comedian Peter Kay, left, is to star in a sitcom that will be shown on iPlayer before terrestrial channels, while Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee chair John Whittingdale, right, said the Government and BBC should discuss an alternative to the licence fee . Last year, 2.32billion TV and radio . programmes were watched on the BBC iPlayer, a figure boosted by the . coverage of the Olympics. Viewers who use only the internet . catch-up services can respond to letters from TV Licensing by making . what it calls a 'no licence fee needed claim'. When a newspaper submitted a freedom . of information request, asking how many people were exploiting the . 'catch-up' loophole to avoid paying their licence fee, the BBC refused . to reveal the figures. It said the 'disclosure would, or . would be likely to, prejudice the prevention or detection of crime [and] . the collection of the licence fee'. The Corporation said this was . because the information would be 'of use to those seeking to evade . paying the licence fee'. Some programmes are even being made available on iPlayer before they are broadcast . Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It is very disappointing that the BBC are refusing to . answer legitimate questions. 'It is attempts to enforce the law that are . protected in the Freedom of Information Act, not attempts to confuse . people into paying more than they should.' The BBC estimates that £196million of revenue was lost in 2009/10 due to licence fee evasion. It added: 'The BBC does not anticipate . a significant loss of income from the number of people who pay the . licence fee due to catch-up viewing. 'The number of people watching only catch-up TV is less than 2 per cent per week. 'The licence fee model has shown . itself resilient enjoying greater public support today than it did 20 . years ago and at 40p per day it remains good value to audiences.' WHO NEEDS A TV LICENCE?Anyone watching or recording TV programmes on any channel as they are being broadcast. Whatever device you use to watch programmes – a TV set, computer, laptop or mobile phone – you must pay the £145.50 licence fee. Over-75s are entitled to a free licence. Anyone without a valid licence risks prosecution and a fine of up to £1,000. WHAT CAN YOU WATCH WITHOUT ONE?Programmes on the iPlayer, the BBC’s catch-up service, provided you view them after they have been broadcast. Those using the iPlayer’s Watch Live function, which broadcasts eight channels at virtually the same time as on TV, will need a licence. HOW MANY ARE VIEWING ONLINE TO DOGE LICENCE FEE?The BBC won’t reveal how much revenue it is losing because people watch   online but it is likely to be well into the millions. Three per cent of people don’t pay a licence fee, equal to a million households, but it’s unclear how many of them are using iPlayer. HOW CAN BBC TELL WHO WATCHES LIVE OR CATCH-TV?It can't. It relies on honesty. Anyone not paying a licence fee has to submit a declaration that they are not watching or recording live broadcasts. Licence enforcers can make house visits to check and if your explanation is accepted, they put your account on ‘hold’ for two years, before investigating again. COULD NON-FEE PAYERS BE CHARGED FOR iPLAYER?Possibly, but it would be complicated. The BBC could introduce a system similar to Sky, under which customers cannot watch any programmes on TV sets, laptops, or mobile devices without an ID code. However,  this would involve an enormous amount of bureaucracy. Equally, the BBC could not charge all viewers to watch iPlayer, because existing licence holders would end up paying twice for the same service. HOW MUCH IS LIVE ON iPLAYERThe only ‘live’ programmes on iPlayer are the eight BBC channels screened on the Watch Live section, for which you still need a licence. Most other programmes are available on catch-up.","More than a million households do not pay the £145.50 annual fee .

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has removed a warning from its website that Ebola can, in rare cases, spread from person through coughing and sneezing. It has replaced the old language with new guidance that says there's 'no evidence' Ebola is spread through either. According to the New York Post, the CDC also took down on Thursday a poster that said that Ebola can be transferred through 'droplets' from coughing or sneezing that land on hard surfaces, like doorknobs. Scroll down for video . This undated handout photo provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shows a kit that travelers from Ebola-stricken West African nations will be given containing information cards and a thermometer. The CDC previously suggested that Ebola can, in rare cases, spread from person through coughing and sneezing. It now says there 'no evidence' to support that claim . As the Huffington Post, which discovered the shift in language, noted yesterday evening, it's unclear why the CDC abruptly changed it's Ebola advisories. However, the move came a day after the New York Post reported on the existence of the poster. 'Droplet spread happens when germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes, nose or mouth of another person,' the fact sheet reportedly stated. Now the page says, 'The What’s the difference between infections spread through air or by droplets? Fact sheet is being updated and is currently unavailable. Please visit cdc.gov/Ebola for up-to-date information on Ebola.' The quiet removal of the information follows a weeks long public health campaign championed Republican Sen. Rand Paul to get the CDC to be 'forthright' about how the disease is spread. Previously the CDC's frequently asked questions page on Ebola said: 'Although coughing and sneezing are not common symptoms of Ebola, if a symptomatic patient with Ebola coughs or sneezes on someone, and saliva or mucus come into contact with that person’s eyes, nose or mouth, these fluids may transmit the disease. A CDC poster claiming that Ebola can spread through 'droplets' of germs on hard surfaces such as doorknobs has been quietly removed from the government agency's website . Paul has pointed to similar statements from the CDC on numerous occasions as evidence that someone could in fact catch Ebola through the air if in close range of someone who has the virus at, say, a party. If 'you listen to them closely, they say you have to have direct contact. But you know how they define direct contact? Being within three feet of someone,' he said on one recent occasion. Given that information, the Kentucky senator has characterized the CDC's claims that the deadly disease could only be spread through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids and the virus does not travel through the air as misleading. 'They have so wanted to downplay this that they really, I don't think, have been very accurate in their description of the disease,' Paul told Bloomberg News earlier this month. Possibly in response to Paul's claims, the CDC has now changed at least one page of it's website to say, 'there is no evidence indicating that Ebola virus is spread by coughing or sneezing. 'Ebola virus is transmitted through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola; the virus is not transmitted through the air (like measles virus). 'However, droplets (e.g., splashes or sprays) of respiratory or other secretions from a person who is sick with Ebola could be infectious, and therefore certain precautions (called standard, contact, and droplet precautions) are recommended for use in healthcare settings to prevent the transmission of Ebola virus from patients sick with Ebola to healthcare personnel and other patients or family members.' The Senator wasn't immediately available to comment on the CDC's updated guidance.","It has replaced the old language with new guidance that says there's 'no evidence' Ebola is spread through either .

"Tweet: Elisabeth Hasselbeck has made a comparison with the public's desire to hound the NFL with their apparent refusal to know the facts of Benghazi, in her opinion . Fox and Friends host Elisabeth Hasselbeck has compared the NFL's domestic violence scandals with the Obama administration's handling of the September 11, 2012 terror attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Hasselbeck seemed to question why the nation's media was vociferously hounding the league and its commissioner, Roger Goodell for their handling of the Ray Rice and Adrian Paterson affairs, but ignored what Fox claims is a White House cover-up of the deadly attack two years ago. Hasselbeck, 37, who was fired from The View, has split loyalties to both issues; her husband, Tim Hasselbeck is a former NFL quarterback, but Hasselbeck, who left 'The View' in 2013, celebrated her one year anniversary at Fox this week. 'Imagine if everone that asked for transparency in the NFL demanded that same transparency in our government,' wrote Hasselbeck. The tweet, posted on Tuesday, was met with criticism by the Huffington Post, who mocked her for the comparison between two seemingly separate events that bear no comparison. Hasselbeck responded by saying she had spoke to the mother of one of the four men killed during the attack which claimed the life of US Ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens. '@HuffingtonPost We spoke w/the (sic) mom whose son was killed and men there that night. Inserting #Benghazi - is not ridiculous - IT IS AN #HONOR.' Over the past two years, Fox News has been attacked for its level of coverage of the Benghazi affair and for repeatedly trying to claim the Obama administration was responsible for severe lapses in security, but tried to cover them up after. Scroll down for video . Opinion: The Fox and Friends host made the point of transparency in reference to the continued attack on the Obama administration by Fox News . Counter: Huffington Post called her claim 'ridiculous' - so Hasselbeck answered back that the mother of one of the four dead Americans from Benghazi did not agree . A study by the group Media Matters claims that since 2012, Fox News' primetime news show has aired 1,098 pieces on Benghazi and 281 that allege a coverup by the White House. Last week, Hasselbeck's Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade made a crass joke after they aired the sickening video of ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice punching his fiancée in an elevator. Kilmeade quipped: 'I think the message is take the stairs.' The remark led to giggles from his co-hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman before Doocy added: 'The message is when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera' before smoothly segueing into a new report. Inappropriate: Brian Kilmeade made a crass joke about the Ray Rice video last week on Fox and Friends and apologized the day later . The presenter's remarks led to outrage online. News and politics editor at Global Grind, Christina Coleman, tweeted today: 'Why am I not surprised? This is how Fox News handled #RayRice video.' Dan Murphy posted: 'If there's a more ghastly assemblage of callous mouthbreathers than Fox and Friends on TV I don't want to know.' Al Jazeera anchor Richelle Carey simply dubbed Kilmeade's remark as 'moronic'. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's $40 million contract on Monday in the wake of the release of the tape showing Rice punch his then fiancée Janay Palmer unconscious in an Atlantic City elevator in February. Minutes later, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice from the league indefinitely and said he would have to apply for reinstatement.","Fox and Friend host said she wished public and media scrutinized Benghazi as much as NFL and Commissioner, Roger Goodell ."
"His incredible bravery in the heat of battle in Afghanistan earned 23-year-old Lance Corporal James Ashworth the ultimate military honour – a posthumous Victoria Cross. Until now, details of his courage while storming a Taliban stronghold have been sketchy. But today The Mail on Sunday can reveal the astonishing story of his final hours, as told by his commanding officer who was fighting with Ashworth when he died. The official British Army report compiled by Captain Michael Dobbin – himself awarded a Military Cross for ‘repeated courage’ that day – reveals: . The previously unseen document describing the firefight in gut-wrenching detail includes accounts by Capt Dobbin and by Ashworth’s comrades in the Grenadier Guards Reconnaissance Platoon dispatched on a dangerous mission to eliminate insurgents. June 13, 2012, dawned like any other day at Patrol Base Rahim in Helmand’s Upper Gereshk Valley. As the morning passed, temperatures soared to 45C and whenever possible L/Cpl Ashworth sought out the shade of the base’s baked-mud walls. In the early afternoon, 6ft 8in Ashworth was summoned by platoon commander Capt Dobbin, who explained that a group of Taliban gunmen had been spotted in Mohammed Zai, a village just over a mile from their base. VC HERO GRAPHIC . Dobbin outlined the mission to eliminate the insurgents and referred to maps and photographs. To avoid confusion in the heat of battle the compounds were identified by code numbers. The mission would also involve a jet equipped with video cameras circling thousands of feet above the battlefield and feeding live information to UK commanders. The report reads: ‘The operation was to drop the ISAF [International Security Assistance Forces] by helicopter in locations to the East and West of a group of compounds in the Mohammed Zai area. ‘L/Cpl Ashworth was Second in Command of callsign Dragon 76 [a team of six soldiers] and would be positioned to the West area with the main objective being a tree-line where the insurgents were known to be.’ At around 4.20pm, L/Cpl Ashworth and his colleagues strapped themselves into two RAF Chinook helicopters. Ashworth, from Corby, Northamptonshire, was seated next to Guardsman Jordan Loftus. During the short flight the good friends squeezed together for what would prove the Lance Corporal’s final photograph. Over Mohammed Zai, they came under heavy fire from below. The report continues: ‘At approximately 1630hrs the helicopter carrying L/Cpl Ashworth landed, the soldiers dismounted and ran across a bridge. Dragon 76 was instructed to secure what was believed to be the insurgents’ sniper position, located in a tree-line north-east of Compound 14.’ Sprinting into position, Ashworth fired grenades from his UGL – a  grenade launcher bolted to his rifle barrel. For the next ten minutes,  British and Afghan National Army troops bombarded the tree-line, killing two insurgents. But Dobbin was radioed with new information. The pilot overhead had tracked the escape of a third gunman from the tree-line to Compound 22. Immediately Dobbin ran to the compound, throwing grenades over the 6ft walls. When he had used up his grenades, he ordered those soldiers from Dragon 76 who still had grenades left to help clear the compound. With the Taliban gunman firing from inside the compound, the Grenadiers knew how dangerous this was. And their fears were confirmed when an Afghan soldier was killed attempting to enter the compound. Bravery: Lance Corporal Ashworth, left, became only the tenth member of the British Army since the Second World War to receive the Victoria Cross, right . Ashworth and Dobbin began their . assault at 4.55pm. They climbed a perimeter wall and jumped into an . alleyway. Ashworth threw a grenade ahead and they advanced, weapons at . the ready, to an open area and a vegetable garden where they were joined . by another soldier providing cover. The report notes: ‘The garden was surrounded by a 2ft-high wall and was about 6ft in front of the man providing cover.’ There . was a flat-roofed mud-hut inside the compound and Dobbin saw an . insurgent emerge from a doorway and open fire towards the Grenadiers. Another member of  the platoon returned fire, forcing the insurgent to . retreat inside, firing through a window. Dobbin requested reinforcements . and when two more soldiers arrived, he told them to join Ashworth. Trees prevented them from throwing grenades to kill the enemy. Although . it is not in the report, The Mail on Sunday has been told that an . Afghan interpreter with the Grenadiers shouted at the Taliban fighter to . surrender but he refused, shouting ‘Allah Akhbar’ (God is great). Then . Ashworth ran to Dobbin and put to him a daring plan: ‘He [Ashworth] . suggested that he crawl up against the wall until he was level with the . insurgent and then throw the grenade into the doorway.’ Dobbin had . doubts, fearing Ashworth’s plan was too dangerous, but as the report . notes, they agreed the Lance Corporal’s plan still represented ‘the most . risk-free approach’. Ashworth set off, shuffling forward on his elbows and knees. Ahead, . a table and two chairs blocked his route. The furniture was only 9ft . from the mud-hut, meaning any attempt to move it would be noticed.

Honour: The repatriation ceremony for Lance Corporal James Ashworth, at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire . So Ashworth decided to crawl around – a manoeuvre that risked bringing him into the insurgent’s line of sight. Now Dobbin made a desperate plea, the report says. ‘He shouted to Ashworth to come back as he could see that the insurgent had seen Ashworth and was firing towards him with the rounds landing within a metre of him.’ But L/Cpl Ashworth – only the tenth member of the British Army to receive the Victoria Cross since the Second World War – could not be persuaded to retreat. He crawled on, clutching his last grenade. With Taliban rounds fizzing inches overhead, he even attempted to reassure his officer, whispering into his radio that he was ‘almost in position’. Ashworth rose into a crouching position, pulled the grenade pin and took aim. Seeing him, the insurgent opened fire and a round struck Ashworth’s chest. He was saved by his body armour but fell back, the live grenade escaping his grasp. Lying dazed and immobile, Ashworth had no chance of escaping the blast and his colleagues were too far away to help. The grenade inflicted serious blast wounds. As the report notes, Ashworth’s position meant ‘no one could get to him to provide first aid as it would have put them directly in front of the insurgent’. Two other soldiers were badly wounded before the insurgent was finally shot dead. The report reads: ‘The Combat Medical Technician moved to Ashworth’s position; however, no first aid was afforded as it was obvious his injuries were incompatible with life.’ He was declared dead at 7.40pm at Camp Bastion. That evening Cpt Dobbin and other commanders met to write up their battle reports. These formed the basis of the Grenadiers’ application for Ashworth to receive the Victoria Cross.","Unit had a Taliban sharpshooter surrounded but ammo was low .

"Dying? The son of Fred Phelps Sr. the founder of the controversial Westboro Baptist Church has said his father is gravely ill . The founder of notorious hate group the Westboro Baptist Church is dying, according to his estranged son. The son of Fred Phelps took to his own Facebook page early on Sunday morning to announce that his father was 'on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka.' Nate Phelps, who left the extreme Christian sect 37-years ago wrote, 'I've learned that my father, Fred Phelps Sr., pastor of the 'God Hates Fags' Westboro Baptist Church, was ex-communicated from the 'church' back in August of 2013. He is now on the edge of death at Midland Hospice house in Topeka, Kansas,' Nate Phelps posted. 'I'm not sure how I feel about this. Terribly ironic that his devotion to his god ends this way.

'I can tell you that Fred Phelps is having some health problems,' Drain . said. 'He's an old man and old people get health problems.' He said . Phelps is 84. Phelps Sr. started the Westboro Baptist Church in 1955, but before that was known as an award winning civil rights attorney. However, he was disbarred from the Kansas Supreme Court in 1979 and lost his license to practice law in federal courts in 1989. Scroll down for video .

Sick: Pastor Fred Phelps, of Topeka, Kan., looks to the sky as he wields placards protesting homosexuality outside the Albany County Courthouse in Laramie, Wyoming, in early Monday, April 5, 1999 . In 2012, half-a-million people igned petitions asking the White House to crack down on Westboro Baptist Church after the group, known for holding anti-gay demonstrations at funerals, threatened to picket in Newtown, Connecticut. Newtown was the site of a school massacre on December 14 in which 20 young children and six adults were killed. Five petitions posted on the White House website since the shootings have asked the government to name the church, based in Topeka, Kansas, as a hate group or end its tax-exempt status. The requests were among the most popular on the White House site on Thursday. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization, has called the church 'arguably the most obnoxious and rabid hate group in America' because of the anti-gay signs its members have carried at hundreds of military funerals. The protests reflect their view that God is punishing America for tolerance of gays and lesbians. The church has successfully defended its right to free speech in court. Hate group: Rev. Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas takes part in an anti-gay protests behind a police officer at the courthouse site of the trial of one of the alleged attackers of gay student Matthew Shepard in 1998 . In the past Pastor Fred Phelps and other church members have protested at hundreds of funerals of military members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan as part of their religious view that God is punishing America for tolerance of gays and lesbians. The church has gone to court to defend its right to protest and courts have wrestled with how to balance the group's right to free-speech against individuals' rights to privacy. In March 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the group's funeral protests were protected speech under the First Amendment in a suit brought by Albert Snyder, the father of a Marine who had died in Iraq. The protesters had carried signs that stated, 'God Hates You,' 'You Are Going To Hell' and 'Thank God for Dead Soldiers' at his son's funeral.","Fred Phelps, the founder of the Westboro Baptist church, is on his deathbed in Kansas .

"Two heterosexual men have tied the knot on Friday morning under New Zealand's liberal marriage laws. Marrying not for love, but for Rugby World Cup Tickets, the two men from Dunedin in the South Island of New Zealand officially said 'I do' in front of 60 family and friends. The ceremony was live broadcast by Edge Radio, who's 'I Love You, Man' competition was launched earlier this year in a bid to find two straight men willing to wed for the sought after tickets. 'It's official folks, Travis and Matt have just said 'I do'! Congrats to the happy couple!,' the station tweeted. McIntosh and McCormick wed this morning as part of a competition to win tickets to the Rugby World Cup . Travis McIntosh, 23, and Matt McCormick, 24, won the 'bromantic' radio contest in August and are over the moon- not for a life together, but for the opportunity to head to the Rugby World Cup in England next year. While some gay rights groups in New Zealand have voiced objections to the nuptials, the pair are content with their reasons for the wedding. McIntosh, an engineer, and McCormick, a teacher, have known each other for nearly 20 years, and see the wedding as a celebration of their friendship rather than a political statement. The newlyweds spoke to Daily Mail Australia, taking time out from their wedding reception to walk through their experience. 'We entered the competition as a way of taking our friendship to the next level,' said Travis. The men met at the Pirates Rugby Club in Dunedin when they were six years old, and have been friends ever since. 'Matt called me and asked me to marry him and I said yes without first asking why. I knew he'd have a good reason.' The pair wed in front of 60 friends and family in a 'hilarious' ceremony . While some gay rights groups have spoken out against the marriage, they have felt 'love and support' 'We had to explain it to our families several times, but they're all quite open minded and we've been overwhelmed by the love and support we've experience from our community.' A spokesperson from The Edge explained that as with any event that pushes boundaries, there was bound to be a bit of backlash. Local gay rights groups have condemned the wedding, protesting that it 'trivializes what we've fought for,' according to the New Zealand Herald. LegaliseLove Aotearoa Wellington co-chairman Joseph Habgood said the competition made clear that men marrying each other was 'something they think is worth having a laugh at.' However, McCormick and McIntosh have explained that their friendship was one of the main motivators in the process, and that it has been strengthened through the trials and challenges which lead them to their big day. 'We had to be very vulnerable with one another,' said Matt. 'Through the official proposal and preparing for the wedding we've spent so much time together, and we've had to share a lot of intimate details with one another.' Mike Peru, one of the hosts of The Edge and a gay man himself, said that he knew that there would be some objection, but as time went by he realised that 'this was a fun event,' 'It’s not that I'm a spokesperson for the gay community, but when you’re out people do look to you for opinions,' 'But its been fine and I just relaxed into and took it for what it was. I think the gay community has too for the most part,' The pair will not be living together but aren't sure what the future will bring . 'In New Zealand the argument seems to be that  if two people want to get married it's no skin off anyone’s nose,' 'So two blokes can have an immense friends and strong bond, and I guess some of them would like to be married,' 'I think it's a good thing to celebrate bromance in quirky way, and Matt and Travis really epitomised that.' For Matt and Travis, the details of the day made it something to look forward to. Matt and Travis all suited up to wed as part of the 'I Love You, Man' radio competition . 'All of our mates and family came up for the wedding which has been amazing,' 'We had so much fun with it all. We got kitted out in amazing suits and Trevor walked down the aisle to Cruisin'.' The wedding was a very male populated event, with each of the pair having a best man. Looking to the future, the pair are mainly focused on heading to next year's Rugby World Cup in England, saying that they 'bleed black'. After a honeymoon on the Cook Islands, life will return to normal for the non-traditional newlyweds. Neither has a girlfriend or partner, which Matt says 'makes life easier. The wedding won't impede on our lives too much,' 'We're going to play things by ear. While we're not living together at the moment, we have before, so we'll see how it's all going in a year or so.' The two friends, who have known each other for almost 20 years, are looking to see what the future holds . 'We're certainly not ready to start a family.' The Edge's host Mike said that the ceremony was filled with good laughs. 'They're such funny guys so the ceremony was hilarious,' 'Everyone took it for what it was, and forgot the whole reason for why they were getting married. It was just a celebration of their friendship.'","Got engaged for a radio competition to win Rugby tickets .

"Oxford student Charlotte Coursier committed suicide six hours after her boyfriend ended their relationship . A 'talented and gifted' Oxford University student hanged herself after her boyfriend of 11 months ended their relationship. Charlotte Coursier was struggling to cope with a 'campaign of harassment' inflicted on her by a college lecturer, as well as the torment of having aborted a pregnancy. An inquest heard how Miss Coursier was found dead at home by her housemates in June last year. The coroner was told she had been bombarded with 'crazy and rambling' emails sent by Dr Jeffrey Ketland, a former college lecturer, who followed her to Oxford when she moved from Edinburgh. He harassed the 25-year-old after the pair had a sexual relationship, claiming he saved Miss Coursier's life after she overdosed while they were both at Edinburgh University, the inquest heard. Miss Coursier left the Scottish university to study a post-graduate course in philosophy at St Edmund Hall College in Oxford in October 2012. Dr Ketland had also moved to the city, securing a lecturing post at one of the colleges in Oxford, the coroner was told. Three months prior to moving to Oxford, Miss Coursier had started seeing Ben Fardell, from London. A statement by Mr Fardell, read to the inquest, revealed he had recently come out of another relationship when he started dating Miss Coursier. The statement said: 'In the first six months there were . issues of trust and commitment in the relationship. 'But . Charlotte was much better in the new year. Then, in February, . she discovered she was seven weeks pregnant despite taking . contraception.' Lecturer Dr Jeffrey Ketland, (pictured) inflicted a 'campaign of harrassment' on Miss Coursier, bombarding her with 'crazy and rambling' emails . Mr Fardell told his girlfriend that he was not ready to be a father and supported her as she came to the 'incredibly difficult' decision to terminate the pregnancy. After cancelling her first appointment, Miss Coursier's abortion was carried out on March 25 - something she later described as 'murdering her child'. 'She was very low for . weeks after this and she found it very difficult to get over having . murdered her child, as she put it,' said Mr Fardell. 'Although she stopped mentioning it after a while I'm not sure she ever got over it.' Nicholas Graham, assistant coroner . for Oxfordshire, heard that while at Edinburgh University, Miss Coursier had started a sexual relationship with lecturer Dr . Ketland. After the relationship ended and she graduated, Dr Ketland also moved to Oxford to start working at Pembroke College - after holding another post elsewhere. Miss Coursier told Mr Fardell she had contacted Dr Ketland in a friendly manner ahead of going to Oxford and he responded to her in a way that began politely but quickly descended into crazy, rambling accusations. Ms Coursier then shared her concerns with Mr Fardell and showed him the emails she had exchanged with Dr Ketland. 'He thought he saved her life in Edinburgh and in doing so, he managed to destroy his own,' Mr Fardell said. 'She . went to see him in a professional capacity to seek help and advice. His . abuse of her made an already fragile girl even worse. 'She found the whole thing very distressing and disheartening and thought nobody would believe her and that they would take Jeffrey's side.' Miss Coursier reported Dr Ketland to Thames Valley Police on May 19, and raised the issue with the student advisory services at the university. Dr Ketland was issued a warning by police officers, under the Harassment Act. Mr Fardell said he felt the . relationship was holding both he and Miss Coursier back, and after . considering what to do for several weeks, he decided to break up with . her. On June 10, after spending the weekend together in London, Mr Fardell told the 25-year-old he wanted to end their relationship. 'Charlotte . pleaded with me not to break up with her and she talked about how hard . she had been trying to make things better,' he said. 'She was crying and told me ""I don't want to live without you"".' Pembroke College at Oxford where Dr Jeffrey Ketland works. He moved to Oxford from Edinburgh when Miss Coursier did. An inquest heard the 25-year-old struggled to cope with the unwanted attention from Dr Ketland, as well as the heartache following an abortion months before her death . After parting ways at 11.45am, Miss Coursier sent two text messages to Mr Fardell and tried to call him three times. He was unable to answer the calls as he was on the train, the inquest was told. Miss Coursier's housemates did not see her arrive home but at 9pm found her phone ringing on the sofa. The house phone rang shortly afterwards. Miss Coursier's housemate Brooke Berndtson answered the call, which was from Mr Fardell. She went to the 25-year-old's room, but discovered her body slumped against the wall, lifeless. Fellow housemate Yuukki Ohta rushed . to help and called 999. Despite attempts to revive the philosophy . student, Miss Coursier was pronounced dead at her home shortly after . 10pm. Detective Sergeant Rhian Evans said police discovered no suicide note. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as hanging. Mr . Fardell said: 'I can't help but feel my breaking up with her was the . tipping point but I understand I am not responsible for her death. 'I deeply regret not picking up the phone when she called. I wish she would have waited for me, I would have come to Oxford.' Assistant coroner, Mr Graham read a statement from Professor Keith Gull, principal of St Edmund Hall, describing Miss Coursier as a 'rising star' and citing references from Edinburgh University lecturers which ranked her in the top five of all undergraduate students they had taught. 'Many thought she was the most gifted philosophy student in her year,' said Professor Gull. 'She was a delight to have in the faculty and is a great loss to us all.' Charlotte's mother, Margaret Marklew from Birmingham, and brother Henry sobbed as Mr Graham recorded a verdict of suicide.","Charlotte Coursier was found hanged at her home in Oxford in June .

"A father-of-two died from bowel cancer seven years after his GP failed to spot the signs of the disease. David Mallaby died in 2012, seven years after first visiting his doctor complaining of symptoms indicative of the early stages of bowel cancer. His wife Joanne and two teenage children, Lucy and Oliver, have now been awarded a six-figure payout at the High Court. Despite Mr Mallaby telling his GP his father had been diagnosed with bowel cancer at the age of 45, he was not referred for further tests. Those tests, medical experts say, would have detected a benign polyp - a growth in the bowel - and Mr Mallaby would have made a full recovery. Scroll down for video . David Mallaby, pictured with his children Oliver and Lucy, died in March 2012 having been diagnosed with bowel cancer. His diagnosis came six years after he first visited his GP complaining of the symptoms . The 44-year-old told his GP during his first visit that his father had died of the disease aged 45. But he was not referred for further tests, which medical experts say would have detected a benign polyp - a growth in the bowel - which later turned into the cancer, and saved his life . The 44-year-old, who was just 44 when he died in March 2012, first visited the doctor in January 2005. But he was sent home having been told his symptoms were most likely just an anal fissure - a tear or cut which bleeds. The father-of-two, from Worksop in South Yorkshire, was told to return if his symptoms became worse. Six years later, in 2011, the cancer was detected but by that stage Mr Mallaby's condition was terminal. He died a few months later from carcinomatosis - cancer that has spread throughout the body. Medical experts told a High Court hearing had Mr Mallaby been investigated earlier, and treated for a benign polyp - growths on the lining of the bowel that can turn into cancer - he would have made a full recovery. The High Court awarded Mr Mallaby's family a six-figure undisclosed sum after his GP, Dr Richard Davey admitted liability . Mr Justice Hickinbottom, who approved the settlement, said it was 'in the best interests of the children and family as a whole'. He said he could see how much 'he meant to his family and how much they miss him and continue to miss him'. He told the court: 'The settlement of this claim is not the most important step for Mrs Mallaby and Lucy and Oliver in coming to terms with that. 'The conclusion of the claim will allow them to concentrate on more important things.' The undisclosed damages will be paid by the family's former GP, Dr Richard Davey, who admitted negligence. Solicitor Tom Cook, for the family, said after the hearing that Mr Mallaby's widow and children hope their experience will give other people 'who feels that their GP is not taking possible cancer symptoms seriously, the confidence to ask to be referred for a second opinion'. Mr Cook added: 'Sadly as medical negligence lawyers we see too many cases where cancer diagnoses are not made promptly and lives are lost needlessly.' Dr Davey, of The Village Surgery in Carlton, Worksop, was represented by his medical defence union. Dr Davey and partners at Larwood and Village Surgeries told MailOnline: 'This was a tragic case for all those concerned and Dr Davey and his GP Partners would like to express their sincere sympathy to all those that, not only loved Mr Mallaby, but whose lives he has touched in some way. 'Although our aim is to always provide the best possible care to our patients, we know that occasionally things may not go as we had hoped. 'This was the case with Mr Mallaby and the consequences were devastating and life-changing for all those involved. 'We will continue to strive to deliver a high standard of care and make any improvements necessary to achieve this.'","David Mallaby first visited his GP in 2005 complaining of symptoms indicative of the early stages of bowel cancer .

"PUBLISHED 12 October 2012 . A dog died after being stabbed 23 times in a frenzied attack by another dog owner. Mother of three Daisy Jenkins cradled her dying American Bulldog Tyson following the daylight attack. Her dog had got in a fight with another dog in a walkway near her Hampstead home in north London. WARNING: Graphic images . Attack: Mother of three Daisy Jenkins cradled her dying American Bulldog following the vicious daylight attack . The owner of the other dog left the scene and returned with two 10-inch knives before stabbing the bulldog. One of the blows was so forceful that the knife bent in half in what one witness described as a ‘blood bath’. Today, he said he knifed the dog because he was only trying to stop it killing his own terrier Monty. 'The dog’s a lunatic.I’d just stepped out my house and the dog went for him. It wasn’t on a lead. It locked its jaw on to Monty’s head. He’s only little and he’s a donut around other dogs. 'It was like a lion on top of a gazelle. I was screaming for help and the owner was nowhere to be seen. Dying: The owner of the other dog left the scene and returned with two 10-inch knives before stabbing Tyson . 'When she did finally turn up five minutes later all she did was stroke her dog. I was kicking and punching it but it wouldn’t budge so I went into the kitchen and got three knives. 'I’m not proud of what I’ve done but what was I supposed to do, stand there and let it kill my dog?' He said the bulldog tried to attack his dog three months earlier. 'I literally had to pick Monty up and throw him over the fence because this dog was going to go for him. He’s attacked loads of dogs on this estate and he’s even gone for a kid outside the Budgens up the road. 'I’m just glad it happened to me because it was only a matter of time before it killed a kid.' Eleven-year-old Monty, who he has had since he was a puppy, suffered bite marks to his head, . face, ear and chin and now flinches when anyone tried to touch him. 'He’s going to be alright but it has . affected him. I’m on anti depressants because I can’t stop thinking . about it. I can’t sleep. It’s been an absolute nightmare,' he said. The waterways worker, of north London, was arrested over the incident and held in a police . cell for 22 hours but has since been released without charge. Pet: Tyson was an American bulldog like this one pictured. A 41-year-old . man was since been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage . He could be charged with criminal damage but is not expecting any further action to be taken against him. 'The police have actually been very . sympathetic to me. It’s not nice to say but people are happy now the . dog’s gone. It caused so much trouble round here,' he said. Miss Jenkins, 41, who has since set up . a shrine to her dog at the spot where he died, had begged passers-by to . help her as Tyson died on the Aspern estate near Hampstead. Witness . Allison Havey said: 'It was a bloodbath. She was covered in blood and . she was just saying: ‘Please help. Help me make my dog live.’ It was . very sad indeed.' A vet was called to try to save Tyson, but the 42kg bulldog died on the footpath. Miss Jenkins said of the attack: 'We . were just clinging together right up against the fence and trying to . keep away from the knives. 'I could feel bleeding but I just held him tightly. I thought if I pretended to be dead he would leave us alone. 'I just kept saying to Tyson ‘hang on, please hang on, pull through’. She was unavailable for further comment today. Neighbour Kim McFarland, 54, claimed Miss Jenkins let to dog run around the estate. She said: 'Daisy always used to let the dog off the lead and it would run round the estate. 'It used to go for other dogs. It never had a muzzle on. 'One . neighbour only just managed to get her dog inside once before he went . for it. Even when she closed the door it kept charging at it.' Weapon: One of the blows was so forceful the knife bent in half in what one witness described as a 'blood bath' The . grandmother-of-10, who has lived on the estate for 22 years, said the . man, was acting in self defence and was . ‘devastated’ about what had happened. She . said: 'He’s a dog lover himself and he’s not the kind of person to go . around doing things like that. He was just trying to save his dog who is . a lot smaller and older. 'Daisy had let Tyson off his lead and . he ran into the woods and got hold of this other dog by the throat. I . don’t even think she was there at the time to stop him. 'The . other dog owner tried to punch Tyson to get him off but he’s a big dog. He went inside to get something and the next thing I heard was a dog’s . been stabbed and it’s dead. 'He literally couldn’t get Tyson off his . dog. What was he supposed to do, wait until it killed his dog? It would . have been the same circumstances - a dog would still be dead.'","Daisy Jenkins' dog had got into a fight with another dog near her home .

"When he discovered he had run up a £3,700 bill on his father’s credit card playing games on his iPad, Cameron Crossan expected a very stern telling off at least. The 13-year-old was mortified by what he had done – but worse was to come. For instead of punishing him, his father filed an official police complaint effectively accusing him of fraud. Doug Crossan, 48, said he was horrified when his credit card company informed him of the amount his son had spent on the games in Apple’s online App Store. Charges: Mr Crossan claims his son was unaware he was being charged for the in-game purchases and wants Apple to scrap the charge . Cameron could now face arrest and questioning by detectives. But that is not the reason the . teenager was shopped. If Mr Crossan had wanted him to feel the force of . the law he could have done it himself – he is a PC with Avon and . Somerset Police. He contacted the national Action Fraud helpline in the . hope of getting his money back from Apple. He says Cameron was unaware he was . being charged for the purchases and wants Apple to refund the cash. But . the technology giant has so far refused, so Mr Crossan believes that by . reporting the purchases as fraudulent his credit card company will have . to foot the bill. Mr Crossan, of Clevedon, Somerset, . said yesterday: ‘I am sure Cameron had no intention to do it, but I had . to have a crime reference number if there was any chance of getting any . credit card payments refunded. ‘In theory the local police station . would contact me and ask for Cameron to come in to be interviewed. I . could make it difficult, of course, and refuse to bring him in, and they . would have to come and arrest him.’ Games: Cameron Crossan racked up more than 300 purchases on games such as Plants vs Zombies, Hungry Shark, Gun Builder and Nova 3 on the iPad . Mr Crossan logged the details of his MBNA Virgin credit card with Apple when he used his son’s device to download music. Cameron then racked up more than 300 . purchases on games such as Plants vs Zombies, Hungry Shark, Gun Builder . and N.O.V.A. 3. Many of them are free to download but users can buy . in-game extras. In one game Cameron had purchased a virtual chest of . gold coins costing £77.98. He would have had to key in a password before each of the purchases was processed. When his father confronted him, Cameron quickly confessed but said he . did not know it was costing money as the games were initially free. Plants vs Zombies: One of the games Cameron purchased on the iPad . Mr Crossan said: ‘There was no indication in the game that he was being charged for any of the clicks made within it. ‘He innocently thought that, because it was advertised as a free game, the clicks would not cost anything.’ Apple has refused to cancel the . charges, citing parental responsibility and pointing out that iPads . contain password locks to prevent accidental or unwanted purchases. Aid: Cameron has only owned the Apple tablet computer since December after he and other pupils at his school were bought them to aid them in class . But Mr Crossan said: ‘I am a father . of a studious, polite and sensible 13-year-old who has been duped after . uploading free children’s games on his iPod and iPad. ‘Our son is mortified to think that . this has happened. I wonder how many others there are in the UK that . have suffered at the hands of these apps?’ Of his decision to report Cameron to . Action Fraud, Mr Crossan said: ‘Really I just want to embarrass Apple as . much as possible. Morally, I just don’t understand where Apple gets . off, charging for a child’s game.’ A spokesman for the Home Office, . which runs Action Fraud, said last night: ‘It sounds like this would be a . matter to resolve with Apple. It doesn’t sound like a fraud has taken . place.’ Cameron could in theory end up with a criminal record as he is . over the age of ten. But a legal source doubted whether the Crown . Prosecution Service would think a prosecution was in the public . interest. Virgin Money has declined to comment on the case. With more than half a billion active accounts, the App Store is the most popular online marketplace in the world. Mr Crossan is among a growing number of parents caught out by their children’s unauthorised spending on apps. Earlier this year, five-year-old Danny Kitchen spent £1,700 buying weapons and ammunition in the iPad game Zombies vs Ninjas. Apple refunded the money to his parents Greg and Sharon. In the US, Apple is paying £66million . in compensation to parents whose children ran up huge bills. The case . is unlikely to affect British families . This is by no means the first case of a parent being shocked to find their child had run up a huge bill on their computer by playing games. Earlier this month MailOnline reported how Theo Rowland-Fry had racked up a £980 bill by buying virtual doughnuts while playing a Simpsons game. And just last month five-year-old Danny Kitchen (pictured right), from Bristol, made 19 purchases totalling more than £1,300 for extra software to help him play the game Zombies vs Ninja. By pressing a shopping trolley icon on the screen, Danny was offered the chance to buy extra animated ‘ammunition’. He bought dozens of in-game ‘weapons’ and ‘keys’ which cost up to £69.99 a time. His parents were refunded after they contacted Apple. Customers who accidentally rack up large bills on iTunes do not have an automatic right to a refund, although Apple does appear willing to return the cash on a case-by-case basis. But in the US, the company is paying out £66million in compensation to parents whose children ran up massive bills while using its free apps. Now, as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families. A US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency. Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million).","Father claims teenage son was unaware he was being charged .

"Taliban fighters have beheaded 15 civilians in battles for control of a key district near Kabul in a chilling echo of the brutality meted out by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The Ghazni provincial government said it has lost contact with police in the province's western district of Ajrestan after hundreds of insurgents stormed several villages in the area. The attack by an estimated 700 Taliban fighters began about five days ago and early reports were that more than 100 people had been killed, provincial deputy governor Ahmadullah Ahmadi said. At least 15 of those were decapitated, he added. The main highway linking Kabul to southern Afghanistan, where the Taliban have been making advances in recent months, passes through the province, which lies southwest of Kabul. 'If there is no urgent help from the central government, the district will collapse,' said Asadullah Safi, deputy police chief of the area. Scroll down for video . Ruthless: Taliban fighters have beheaded 15 civilians in a battle for control of a district near Kabul (file picture) The battle for Ajrestan illustrates the grave challenges facing Afghanistan's new president and the security forces in holding territory as foreign combat troops prepare to leave at the end of the year. No longer pinned down by U.S. air cover, Taliban fighters are attacking Afghan military posts in large numbers with the aim of taking and holding ground. Heavy fighting was continuing in Ajrestan today. Safi said a suicide car bomber attacked a police checkpoint early in the day before provincial authorities completely lost contact with the district. The militants have been focusing on regaining important opium-growing areas, such as the southern province of Helmand, and areas where they have traditionally enjoyed support, such as Kunduz province in the north. Control of Ghazni's mountainous Ajrestan district, about 200 km (125 miles) from Kabul, could provide the Taliban with a launching point for attacks in two bordering provinces and along the crucial artery connecting the capital to Afghanistan's second city of Kandahar in the south. The growing Taliban threat is likely to be the most urgent challenge for the new, U.S.-brokered government of national unity between President-elect Ashraf Ghani and his former rival Abdullah Abdullah. Fragile: The offensive illustrates the grave challenges facing Afghanistan's new president Ashraf Ghani (above) and the security forces in holding territory as foreign combat troops prepare to leave at the end of the year . Key target: Control of Ghazni's mountainous Ajrestan district, about 200 km (125 miles) from Kabul, could provide the Taliban with a launching point for attacks in two bordering provinces . Provincial authorities have appealed for help from the central government in Kabul, where Ghani is in the process of taking over the presidency from Hamid Karzai. 'We have asked repeatedly for helicopters to evacuate the wounded, but so far nothing has been done,' Ahmadi said. However, a regional spokesman for the Afghan army, Nazif Sultani, said on Friday that reinforcements had been sent to the district the previous day. He said he had no further information. Months of deadlock over a disputed election and uncertainty over whether any U.S. troops will remain beyond this year has battered morale among Afghan security forces. 'Peace with the Taliban requires a strong government. 'At the moment the Taliban think they can fight in every province and they believe they can overthrow the government,' said Haji Mohammad Mohaqiq, Abdullah's running mate and the leader of Afghanistan's ethnic Hazara minority. 'Without international support it will be hard to provide security... The example of Ajrestan district shows that without international commitment of troops, it will be difficult to handle the Taliban.'","700 militants battle for control of key opium-growing district near the capital .

"Time out: Prince William could be about to end his RAF career prematurely as he prepares for the arrival of his first child, it has emerged . Prince William could be about to end his RAF career prematurely as he prepares for the arrival of his first child, it has emerged. Tomorrow will mark the end of the minimum period he was required to serve as a search and rescue pilot. Although his three-year tour of duty is not due to end until September, with the Duchess of Cambridge due to give birth in July, he could leave the RAF within weeks. This would give him extended paternity leave before starting the next stage of his career. According to the Daily Telegraph, sources close to the Duke, 30, said he has not yet made up his mind on his immediate future. His options include continuing to fly, transferring  elsewhere within the Armed Forces or completely ending his military career. Speaking to the paper, a royal source said: 'He hasn't made a final decision yet on his future but he is there or thereabouts. 'His tour of duty can finish any time between the end of March and September and the expectation is that it will be over towards the latter half  of that period.' A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Duke had reached the stage in his service called tour review. It means he will sit down with his superiors to discuss his next step. The spokesman added: 'The review happens about six months from the end of the tour. 'An individual might move on before the end date of their tour, depending on the availability of personnel, they may stay in post or they may even be asked to stay on longer, if required. 'There are no hard and fast rules.' Change: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to move out of the farmhouse where they have been able to live a normal life on Anglesey . Moving on: It is thought highly unlikely that the Duke will remain at RAF Valley on Anglesey, pictured . However, it is thought extremely . unlikely that the Duke will continue as a search and rescue pilot . because another tour of duty would take him beyond March 2016. Sources say, though, that it is certain he will not remain at RAF Valley on Anglesey. This means the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will move out of the farmhouse where they have been able to live a normal life. One theory is that the Duke may ask for a transfer to Wattisham in Suffolk, which is home to an RAF Search and Rescue Squadron and is the base for Apache helicopters. His brother, Prince Harry, is also based there.","Tomorrow marks end of minimum period he was required to serve as pilot .

"Tens of thousands of young families caught crossing the border illegally earlier this year subsequently failed to meet with federal immigration agents, as they were instructed, the Homeland Security Department has acknowledged privately. An official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement revealed that about 70 percent of immigrant families the Obama administration had released into the U.S. never showed up weeks later for follow-up appointments. The ICE official made the disclosure in a confidential meeting at its Washington headquarters with immigration advocates participating in a federal working group on detention and enforcement policies. The Associated Press obtained an audio recording of Wednesday's meeting and separately interviewed participants. The Homeland Security Department has privately acknowledged that roughly 70 percent of young families caught crossing the border illegally this year subsequently failed to meet with federal immigration agents, as they were instructed, and now roam free in the U.S. On the recording obtained by the AP, the government did not specify the total number of families released into the U.S. since October. Since only a few hundred families have already been returned to their home countries and limited U.S. detention facilities can house only about 1,200 family members, the 70 percent figure suggests the government released roughly 41,000 members of immigrant families who subsequently failed to appear at federal immigration offices. The official, who was not identified by name on the recording obtained by the AP, also said final deportation had been ordered for at least 860 people traveling as families caught at the border since May but only 14 people had reported as ordered. In a statement, ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen did not respond to questions from the AP about the newly disclosed figures. Instead, she said the agency was committed to increasing its capacity to detain and quickly deport families who crossed the border illegally. The AP reported in June that the administration would not say publicly how many immigrant families from Central America caught crossing into the U.S. it had released in recent months or how many of those subsequently reported back to the government after 15 days as directed. The AP noted that senior U.S. officials directly familiar with the issue, including at the Homeland Security Department and White House, had dodged the answer on at least seven occasions over two weeks, alternately saying that they did not know the figure or didn't have it immediately at hand. The Homeland Security Department's public affairs office during the same period did not answer roughly a dozen requests for the figures. Data suggests the government released and promptly lost track of roughly 41,000 members of immigrant families last year . More than 66,000 immigrants traveling as families, mostly mothers and young children, have been apprehended at the border since the start of the budget year in October. Nearly 60,000 of those immigrants are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala and cannot be immediately repatriated, so the government has been releasing them into the U.S. and telling them to report within 15 days to the nearest Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices. At the meeting, the ICE official acknowledged the no-show figures while explaining the administration's decision in June to open a temporary detention center for families in Artesia, New Mexico. A second immigration jail in Texas was later converted for families and can house about 530 people. A third such detention center will open in Texas later this year. Before the new facility in Artesia, the government had room for fewer than 100 people at its only family detention center in Pennsylvania. Immigration advocates have complained that the new detention centers were punishing immigrants who ultimately may win lawful asylum claims to remain in the U.S. In the meeting, they also questioned whether immigration officials had clearly and properly instructed immigrants to meet with federal agents within 15 days. The ICE official said it was necessary to detain families to ensure they didn't vanish into the U.S. He encouraged advocacy groups to help find ways to ensure that immigrants reported to federal agents as ordered so the government could begin processing their cases, including any requests to remain in the U.S. legally.","An immigration official revealed that about 70 percent never show up weeks later for follow-up appointments .

"In a thoughtful essay about the future of the internet, one of the founding fathers of the dot com era has finally apologized for creating the pop-up ad. Ethan Zuckerman is the director of the MIT Center for Civic Media but in the mid-90s he found himself as one of the first staff members of Tripod.com, a pioneer site in attempting to create online communities. And as the company tried to create a viable revenue model, Zuckerman came up with a very important, very annoying, way to attract advertising revenue. Ethan Zuckerman, the man who invented the pop-up ad, has publicly apologized for his creation . 'At the end of the day, the business model that got us funded was . advertising,' Zuckerman writes in The Atlantic. 'The model that got us acquired was analyzing users’ personal homepages so we could better target ads to them. Along the way, . we ended up creating one of the most hated tools in the advertiser’s . toolkit: the pop-up ad.' More specifically: 'I wrote the code to launch the window and run an ad in it. I’m sorry. Our intentions were good.' Zuckerman writes that pop-up ad was originally meant to placate a car maker who was upset that its banner ad was appearing on a page featuring sexual content. This way they could keep the ad revenue, but the advertisement itself would be featured in a separate window. But now, 20 years later, Zuckerman believes the advertising based model of online businesses is doing more harm than good, and urges people to consider 'micropayments' or subscription models. Advertising as we regularly see it online is now a hinderence for users. Zuckerman calls the current ad-based Web model 'broken and corrosive' 'As a rule, the ads that are worth the most money are those that appear . when you’re ready to make a purchase—the ads that appear on Google when . you’re searching for a new car or for someone to repair your roof can be . sold for dollars per click because advertisers know you’re already . interested in the services they are offering and that you’re likely to . make an expensive purchase,' he writes. 'But most online advertising doesn’t follow . your interest; it competes for your attention. It’s a barrier you have . to overcome (minimizing windows, clicking it out of the way, ignoring . it) to get to the article or interaction you want.' Zuckerman has now concluded that the current system is 'bad, broken, and corrosive.' The full text of Zuckerman's apology and where how he hopes the internet can still correct course can be read at The Atlantic.","Ethan Zuckerman helped created the ad in the mid-90s while on staff at Tripod.com .

"Prince Harry is set to receive £10million of his mother's fortune on his 30th birthday next month. The inheritance, stipulated in the will of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, is the same as that received by his older brother Prince William on his 30th birthday in 2012. However, the total amount he will receive is expected to be more than that of his brother due to the accumulated interest in the past two years. The money comes from a trust fund bequeathed to her two sons at the time of her death in 1997. In her original will, drawn up in 1993, the princess had stipulated that both princes would be entitled to their entire share of the capital on reaching 25. Prince Harry will receive a large inheritance from his mother's estate on his birthday in two weeks time . Prince William also received £10million inheritance on his 30th birthday two years ago, but his brother is expected to receive more due to the accumulated interest . But details of the will were changed by a variation order granted by the High Court on December 19, 1997 - three months after her premature death in a Paris car crash. Her estate comprised stocks and shares, jewellery, cash from her £17million divorce settlement, dresses and other personal belongings at her Kensington Palace apartment. Diana stipulated that it would be held in trust to be shared equally between her two sons, even though William will inherit income from the Duchy of Cornwall estate when he becomes Prince of Wales. Prince Harry, who in recent months broke up with his girlfriend Cressida Bonas and turns 30 on September 15, currently earns £38,847 a year as an Army captain. The hard partying prince currently lives a stone’s-throw from his childhood home, at Nottingham Cottage, a two-bedroom house with its own front garden opposite Kate and William’s Apartment 1A in Kensington Palace. The inheritance payout is just part of a series of items and a fortune which is handed over to the princes once they both turn 30. Her now famous wedding dress, which has been in the possession of her brother Earl Spencer since her death, will also be transferred into their possession. Diana pictured wearing the wedding dress on her wedding day with the Prince of Wales in 1981 . Lord Spencer said her will stated the . dress and a number of other dresses and belongings were to be 'looked . after' by him until both the boys turned 30.

"A 26-year-old man who fell asleep during a New York Yankees game is suing ESPN and two of its announcers for airing his nap on the live telecast. Andrew Rector claims he has suffered emotional distress due to an 'unending verbal crusade' against him during the broadcast, in which the camera panned to his second-row seat in the lower level of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and showed him snoozing, according to The Smoking Gun. Major League Baseball has been named as a defendant in the complaint after the clip was uploaded to the MLB website as part of a highlights packed, allegedly causing a flurry of insulting comments.

ESPN announcer Dan Shulman is accused of referring to the New Yorker as 'oblivious', while the second commentator, John Kruk, is accused of saying a ballpark is 'not the place you come to sleep'. Schulman also questioned whether Rector had slept through a third inning home run by Yankee Carlos Beltran, which causes a huge applause from the crowd of 45,000. Rector contends his distress comes from . being made out to be a 'fatty cow that needs to seats' and a 'confused . disgusted and socially bankrupt individual'.
